The Borough of Mount Arlington (the Borough) appeals from a Government Records Council (GRC) order directing it to release the cell phone records, redacting only the telephone numbers called, and to refund overcharges for duplicating audiotapes of a borough council meeting.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Borough challenges the propriety of the GRC order, urging additional redaction is warranted because the Supreme Court has established a privacy interest exists in the people and places one calls. The Borough also argues the GRC erred in ordering a refund of the charges for audiotape replication, which properly included a charge for the cost of the equipment to create the copied audiotape.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Telephone records of a public entity, which are government records as defined under OPRA, may contain some information subject to an individual\u2019s privacy interests, such as the telephone number called. However, we reject the Borough\u2019s argument suggesting the opinions establishing a right to privacy in telephone records shields the destination location of the calls from public scrutiny. <em>See North Jersey Newspapers Co. v. Passaic Cnty. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>9, 18, 601 A.2d 693 (1992); <em>Gannett N.J. Partners, LP v. Cnty. of Middlesex, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>205, 215, 877 A.2d 330 (App.Div.2005). We hold that when limiting a public record request, OPRA\u2019s emphasis on access mandates the public entity clearly demonstrate a claim of privacy in all redacted information.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Here, in balancing these countervailing interests, the Borough has failed to show that the destination location of the calls made by municipal employees triggers a protected privacy right, similar to that sheltering the release of telephone numbers or names of persons called. Accordingly, OPRA\u2019s presumption favoring public access to the call location information prevails, and we affirm the order of the GRC.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Complainant Gayle Ann Livecchia submitted OPRA demands seeking copies of audiotapes recording the Borough\u2019s December 10, 2007 council meeting and cell phone records for all borough employees for September and October 2007.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Livecchia sought to verify whether the authorized limits of cell phone use were exceeded, including whether cell phones were being used for personal, rather than government, business without reimbursement and whether municipal employees made calls from home during working hours. To effectuate her requests, upon notice by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>the Borough, Livecehia paid $5.00 each for two audiotapes of the council meeting, a fee set by the Borough of Mount Arlington Code \u00a7 4-25(D), and $14.00 for twenty-six pages of cell phone records.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">When releasing the records, the Borough informed Livecehia \u201csome portions of the documents [we]re redacted as some of the information contained therein [wa]s not considered disclosable as a government record pursuant to OPRA.\u201d Both the numbers and destination of the itemized calls were removed. Livecehia asked for cell phone records without redaction and objected to the cost of replicating the audiotapes, suggesting it exceeded the actual cost. The Borough declined to alter its position, remaining steadfast to its initial explanation that redacting the information was permitted because of privacy interests and the audiotape charge was set by ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Livecehia filed a \u201cDenial of Access Complaint\u201d with the GRC. The GRC provides a forum to facilitate the mediated or adjudicated resolution of disputes regarding access to government records. <em>N.J.S.A </em>47:1A-7(b). Liveechia\u2019s complaint alleged the Borough violated OPRA by wrongly redacting the destination location included on the cell phone bills and imposing an unreasonable charge for producing audiotapes. After reviewing the parties\u2019 submissions, including supporting documentation, the GRC issued an interim order on November 19, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">First, the agency concluded the redaction of the destination location of the cell phone calls was a violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>47:1A-5(g) because no privacy issues were \u201cimplicated by the disclosure of a generic city and state without any personal identifiers such as a telephone number[.]\u201d The Borough was ordered to release the cell phone records without removing \u201cthe city and state of the location of the cell phone calls\u201d and to certify its compliance. Second, relying on <em>Libertarian Party of Cent. N.J. v. Murphy, </em>384 <em>N.J.Super. </em>136, 140-41, 894 A.2d 72 (App.Div.), <em>remanded on other grounds by, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>487, 909 A.2d 723 (2006), the GRC required additional information to determine whether the audio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>tape charges exceeded the actual cost of providing the copy, as provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-5(b). The Borough was required to certify its costs, which could not include labor or other overhead expenses associated with making the copy, refund any excess charges and verify its compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The Borough supplied additional documentation and sought reconsideration, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:105-2.10, and a stay of the order, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:105-2.12(f). At the GRC\u2019s request, the parties completed a Balancing Test Chart, detailing the alleged privacy interests implicated by disclosure of the information and the reasons Livecchia sought disclosure. The Borough supported redacting the information because it fell within a person\u2019s expectation of privacy interests. <em>See North Jersey Newspapers, supra, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 18, 601 A.2d 693 (stating a person\u2019s expectation of privacy extends to telephone records). Livecchia expressed a need to obtain the call location information to determine whether borough employees were using municipal cell phones for personal use without reimbursement and to prove whether the Borough Administrator used the phone for personal calls from home, while absent from work.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The Executive Director considered the submissions and issued supplemental findings and recommendations. On April 8, 2010, the GRC unanimously adopted those findings and recommendations and entered its order. The order stated the Borough \u201cfailed to bear [the] burden of proof that the redactions made to the requested cell phone bills were authorized[,]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-5(g), or necessary and did not sustain its burden to warrant reconsideration of the GRC\u2019s November 19, 2009 Order. The Borough was ordered to produce the records without redacting the call locations and to refund $8.42 of the charge collected for the audiotapes. This appeal ensued. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-7(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">Our limited review is guided by well-settled principles. <em>Univ.

We do not substitute our judgment for that of the agency, <em>Div. of Alcoholic Beverage Control v.

Consequently, our role is limited to four inquiries: (1) whether the agency\u2019s decision comports with federal and state constitutional requirements; (2) whether the agency\u2019s action is supported by express or implied legislative policies; (3) whether the factual findings that provide a foundation for the agency\u2019s decision are based on substantial evidence; and (4) whether the legislative policies, when applied to the facts, show that the agency clearly erred in reaching a conclusion that could not reasonably have been made on a showing of the relevant factors. <em>In re Taylor, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>644, 656, 731 A.2d 35 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">We also take cognizance of the provisions and policy considerations undergirding OPRA.

The government\u2019s need to weigh overriding concerns against allowing access permeates OPRA\u2019s provisions. <em>Ibid. </em>For example, the basis for allowing government records to be \u201cinspected, examined and copied,\u201d stated in <em>N.J.S.A </em>47:1A-5(a), is tempered by the caveat that a request for access to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>government document may be denied if it \u201cwould substantially disrupt agency operations,\u201d found in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-5(g). A public agency is guided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-5(a), which directs that \u201c[p]rior to allowing access to any government record, the custodian thereof shall redact from that record any information which discloses the social security number, credit card number, unlisted telephone number, or driver license number of any person!.]\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Further, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-9(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">The provisions of [OPRA] shall not abrogate or erode any executive or legislative privilege or grant of confidentiality heretofore established or recognized by the Constitution of this State, statute, court rule or judicial case law, which privilege or grant of confidentiality may duly be claimed to restrict public access to a public record or government record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">In this matter, we again weigh whether an individual privacy interest overcomes OPRA\u2019s paramount principle of \u201cready access to government records[.]\u201d <em>Burnett, supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 421, 968 A.2d 1151.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">Liveechia elected to file a challenge to the Borough\u2019s partial denial of her records request before the GRC. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-6 (stating that when a public agency denies access to public records, the requestor may file a complaint with the Superior Court or the GRC). The GRC is empowered to render decisions \u201cas to whether the record which is the subject of the complaint is a government record which must be made available for public access....\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-7(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">On appeal, the Borough advances the arguments rejected by the GRC. These include: (1) the release of the cell phone records, unaltered as to destination location of the calls, violates the privacy interest of the parties to the call; and (2) the charge for reproducing audiotapes, which included a fee for the purchase of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>the requisite reproduction equipment in addition to the cost of an audiotape, was permissible. We examine each issue, keeping in mind the limits of our review and OPRA\u2019s statutory purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Principally relying on <em>North Jersey Newspapers, supra, </em>which entailed a review of an application under OPRA\u2019s predecessor, the Right to Know Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-2 to -4, the Borough echoes its position presented before the GRC: \u201ca person\u2019s privacy interests include! ] \u2018the people and places one calls on a telephone, no less than the resulting conversations.\u2019 \u201d 127 <em>N.J. </em>at 18, 601 A.2d 693 (quoting <em>State v. Mollica, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>329, 344, 554 A.2d 1315 (1989)). Quoting our opinion in <em>Gannett, supra, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 216-17, 877 A.2d 330, which applied <em>North Jersey Newspapers </em>to an OPRA request, the Borough maintains the privacy rights attached to telephone records are undisputable and absolute. The Borough contends the GRC\u2019s determination abrogated what \u201cconstitutes \u2018judicial case law\u2019 that \u2018established or recognized\u2019 the \u2018confidentiality\u2019 of telephone billing records before enactment of OPRA within the intent of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-9(b).\u201d Therefore, the Borough maintains the GRC exceeded its authority by \u201cdeviating from judicial precedents\u201d and \u201crevisited the law on redaction! ] of cell phone records ... and privacy rights\u201d by balancing the request for disclosure against the established interests in maintaining privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">First, we note OPRA itself, although discussing exemption of telephone numbers in the interest of privacy, limits its restriction to unlisted numbers. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-1.1 (excluding from the definition of \u201cgovernment record\u201d a \u201cportion of any document which discloses the ... unlisted telephone number ... of any person\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">Second, although the Court in <em>North Jersey Newspapers, supra, </em>held there was no unqualified right of public access to telephone billing records because both the public official and the other person to the call have a expectation of privacy and a right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>maintain the confidentiality of the communication, the overriding concern expressed by the Court\u2019s analysis was the disclosure of the identity of the caller. 127 <em>N.J. </em>at 16-18, 601 A.2d 693. Moreover, despite the more problematic concern of revealing with whom public officials communicate by telephone, the Court, in dicta, commented on possible circumstances permitting release:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">If determining the identity of callers becomes necessary to prevent possible misuse of public funds (for example, if a public official is conducting a private business at public expense), a court may require preliminary disclosure to it of the identity of the persons called and the public nature of the calls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 17, 601 A.2d 693.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Presaging the matter at hand, the Court\u2019s illustration exposes the flaw of the Borough\u2019s assertion that privacy of telephone call records is unconditional.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">In <em>Gannett, supra, </em>we examined the plaintiff newspaper\u2019s OPRA request for documents released in response to a federal grand jury subpoena issued to county offices. 379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 209, 877 A.2d 330. Among the documents sought was a blanket request for the telephone billing records of the County Administrator. <em>Id. </em>at 211, 877 A.2d 330. The telephone records were not released. <em>Ibid. </em>In upholding the defendant\u2019s claim of an OPRA exemption, we noted <em>North Jersey Newspapers </em>established a recognized confidentiality in telephone billing records, highlighting its passage that identified the problem with releasing \u201c \u2018telephone numbers called is the disclosure ... inferentially, the identity of those called[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Gannett, supra, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 216, 877 A.2d 330 (quoting <em>North Jersey Newspapers, supra, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 17, 601 A.2d 693).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">We are not faced with a request to release telephone numbers or to identify the person called. Livecchia concedes as legitimate the redaction of telephone numbers; however, she maintains the destination location of the calls should be revealed based upon her need to cheek whether the cell phones are being used properly. As we have noted, the Borough\u2019s position advances a wholesale rejection of any need to balance the demand for access against an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>asserted privacy interest; it believes the privacy interest universally prevails.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Following our review, we reject the Borough\u2019s assertions and are convinced that neither <em>North Jersey Newspapers </em>nor <em>Gannett </em>allows complete exemption to all details of public entity telephone records. Further, we find persuasive Livecchia\u2019s argument that there is no absolute bar to the release of the destination location of telephone calls placed by public employees using publicly funded cell phones and the same would not impinge upon individual privacy interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">We next review the most appropriate method to determine the propriety of the information\u2019s release. When reviewing an OPRA challenge, the Supreme Court has instructed we should weigh the interests to \u201charmonize the language in sections 1 and 5 and balance the interests each section advances: ready access to government documents while safeguarding the citizen\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>Burnett, supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 425-26, 968 A.2d 1151. <em>Burnett </em>included a discussion of OPRA\u2019s legislative history, offering \u201cdirect support for a balancing test that weighs both the public\u2019s strong interest in disclosure with the need to safeguard from public access personal information that would violate a reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427, 968 A.2d 1151.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">To balance the countervailing interests of privacy and access, we look to <em>Doe v. Poritz, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>1, 87-88, 662 A.2d 367 (1995), for guidance. <em>Burnett, supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 427, 968 A.2d 1151. \u201cAlthough <em>Doe </em>considered constitutional privacy interests implicated by Megan\u2019s Law, it relied on case law concerning statutory privacy provisions under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Doe, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 82-86, 662 A.2d 367). The Court not only endorsed the GRC\u2019s prior application of <em>Doe\u2019s </em>factors when addressing statutory privacy claims under OPRA, it adopted the application of such a methodology because it \u201cclearly identifies the key inquiries[.]\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>The test articulated in <em>Doe, supra, </em>delineated the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">(I) the type of record requested; (2) the information it does or might contain; (3) the potential for harm in any subsequent nonconsensual disclosure; (4) the injury from disclosure to the relationship in which the record was generated; (5) the adequacy of safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure; (6) the degree of need for access; and (7) whether there is an express statutory mandate, articulated public policy, or other recognized public interest militating toward access.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">[142 <em>N.J. </em>at 87-88, 662 A.2d 367.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">This is exactly the reasoning followed by the GRC, belying the Borough\u2019s suggestion of a flawed procedural process. We conclude the GRC correctly applied the <em>Doe </em>balancing test when evaluating the competing interests at stake and we find no fault with its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">As we noted, Livecchia sought to assess her suspicions that borough employees were improperly using borough-supplied cell phones for personal calls without reimbursement and that the Borough Administrator used a borough-issued cell phone to make personal calls from her home during work hours. Livecchia advanced a need to analyze the borough employee cell phone records with the location \u2014 city and state \u2014 of the calls when placed and the destination of the individual called. Simply stated, Livecchia needed the time of the call and the destination to determine whether government or personal business was being conducted at the taxpayer\u2019s expense. Livecchia acknowledged privacy concerns and did not press for the release of the phone number called.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">On the other hand, the Borough has never explained, and we fail to understand, how revealing the city and state called by a municipal employee using a taxpayer-funded cell phone designated for work use could possibly impede the privacy rights of either the caller or the person called. None of the governmental privacy interests obviating disclosure identified in <em>North Jersey Newspapers </em>and reiterated in <em>Gannett </em>are present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">Municipal employees are public servants. Rooting out the possible misuse of the public fisc and abuse of the taxpayer\u2019s trust is the bedrock upon which OPRA rests. We hold that the privacy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>interest attached to government telephone records, which protects the person called and his or her telephone number, does not similarly cloak the destination location of calls placed by government employees when necessary to advance the watchful eye of a vigilant public seeking accountability of its municipal representatives. OPRA does not permit redaction of such information. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-5(g). Accordingly, we conclude the GRC properly ordered the Borough to release the cell phone records, redacting only the numbers called.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">We also reject, as lacking merit, the Borough\u2019s procedural contention suggesting Livecchia failed to articulate the basis for her OPRA request and her post-complaint justification should be ignored. <em>R. </em>2:11\u20143(e)(1)(E). \u201cOPRA requires a party requesting access to a public record to specifically describe the document sought.\u201d <em>Gannett, supra, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 212, 877 A.2d 330. <em>See also N.J.S.A </em>47:1A-5(f) (providing that \u201c[t]he custodian of a public agency shall adopt a form for the use of any person who requests access to a government record held or controlled by the public agency\u201d). The statute does not demand the requestor submit an approved justification for release of government records.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">The Borough also argues the GRC erred in ordering the difference between the actual cost of reproducing audiotapes and the $5.00 per audiotape charge imposed by ordinance be refunded. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">OPRA\u2019s \u201cguiding principle\u201d states that \u201ca fee [charged to a requestor] should reflect the actual cost of duplication.\u201d <em>Murphy, supra, </em>384 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 139, 894 A.2d 72. <em>N.J.S.A </em>47:1A-5(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>[T]he public agency shall be permitted to charge the actual cost of duplicating the record.

Register, </em>411 <em>N.J.Super. </em>538, 562-70, 988 A.2d 114 (App.Div.2010)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In reaffirming the need to adhere to the \u201cactual cost\u201d standard, we noted \u201cactual per-page costs may be reasonably approximated. A margin of error of a penny or two in the per-page rate will be tolerable. The costs may be averaged for the copy equipment used in all county offices.\u201d <em>Smith, supra, </em>411 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 571, 988 A.2d 114. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>did not review whether the hard cost of equipment purchased to perform audiotape replication tasks is an includable item when calculating actual cost under OPRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">The Borough argues it should be entitled to include, as a special fee, a reasonable charge attributed to the cost of equipment purchased to make audiotapes. With this in mind, the Borough justifies the $5.00 per audiotape charge by considering the cost of each audiotape, $.79, and dividing the purchase price of the audiotape machine, $129.99, by the thirteen audiotape requests, computes an \u201cactual cost\u201d per audiotape of $10.78. Using this formula, the Borough reasons the $5.00 charge, set by ordinance on May 7, 2007, was imminently reasonable as it evinced half of the actual cost incurred at the time Livecchia made her request.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Without deciding whether the equipment purchase made here was an extraordinary expense entitling a special fee pursuant to N.J.S.A 47:1A-5(d), we reject the Borough\u2019s methodology as both unacceptable and arbitrary. We save for another day whether recouping the purchase price of equipment to assure OPRA compliance is permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">First, there is no relationship between recouping the costs of the audiotape duplicating machine and the charge of $5.00 per audiotape. Based on the Borough\u2019s disclosures, $4.21 of each $5.00 charge would be applied towards the machine\u2019s cost. Also, thirteen audiotapes were requested in seven months. If one annualizes these figures, the full price of the audiotape machine would be recovered in less than eighteen months. Therefore, those requesting audiotapes shortly following the machine\u2019s acquisition would be bearing the brunt of the expense and beginning in month sixteen, requestors would be paying for non-existent equipment costs, rendering a windfall to the municipality. The Borough\u2019s formula inequitably burdens requestors by continuing to charge for equipment years after the equipment cost was fully recouped.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Second, the assessment of a per audiotape cost without explanation as to why the fee was fixed at $5.00 is arbitrary and cannot be sustained. The burden of proving the actual costs rests on the Borough, which was unable to justify how its fee reflected the actual costs incurred. <em>Smith, supra, </em>411 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 572, 988 A.2d 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Here, the evidence in the record sustains the GRC\u2019s determination that the Borough failed to prove the fee charged reasonably reflected its actual cost. Accordingly, we will not disturb its order requiring reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">In summary, we conclude the privacy interest attached to telephone billing records permitting redaction of the telephone numbers may not preclude release of the destination locations called. Any claim of privacy may be overcome by a requestor\u2019s reasonable need for the information to challenge the misuse of public funds. In making a determination of whether redaction is warranted, the balancing test enunciated in <em>Doe, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 87-88, 662 A.2d 367, should be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">Here, the Borough\u2019s assertions of privacy were unsupportable in light of Liveechia\u2019s claims of maintaining the integrity in the use of public equipment. Also, the Borough\u2019s attempt to recoup the cost of equipment to replicate audiotapes to be provided under OPRA was unsupportable as reflective of the actual cost of providing the public record and is therefore rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b56-12\"> By our leave granted on July 28, 2010, we stated \u201d[t]he order will be treated as final.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b57-9\"> Livecchia's initial OPRA submission sought numerous documents; however, we limit our discussion to the two items that are the focus of this appeal: the redaction of the cell phone records and the cost of the audiotapes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b62-10\"><em> </em>We note <em>N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A\u20141.1 excludes from the definition of \"government record\u201d a \"portion of any document which discloses the ... unlisted telephone number ... of any person[,]\u201d an exception not applicable in this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b68-11\"> On September 10, 2010, following our 2010 decision in <em>Smith, </em>the Legislature enacted A-559, amending OPRA to set copying costs for letter-size pages at $0.05 per page. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>47:1A-5(b) (as amended, eff.
