We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">The relevant facts are that at 2:46 a.m. on September 23, 2007, State Police troopers were dispatched to the Garden State Parkway in East Orange to investigate a motor vehicle accident and to provide assistance. When they arrived, the troopers saw three damaged vehicles in the left and center lanes. Trooper Walsh testified at defendant\u2019s trial he believed a BMW had struck a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>black car that had stopped in the left lane of the Parkway, and then, a gray Honda driven by defendant had struck one of those cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The troopers observed a person lying in the shoulder of the roadway and other people standing or walking near the damaged cars. Defendant was \u201crunning around in the lanes and back and forth.\u201d Trooper Walsh made the following observations as he spoke to defendant about the accident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">There was an odor of an alcoholic beverage. His eyes were bloodshot. He was \u2014 his demeanor seemed very excited. He used excessive profanity. He seemed nervous. He was inattentive to my questions. His eyes \u2014 his attention was bouncing from one\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">He was ... rambling on. He was, as I said, not answering direct questions initially, not \u2014 when I would ask him questions he wasn\u2019t necessarily listening to what I was saying. After initially speaking with him we had asked him to sit on the embankment adjacent to the roadway. I had to ask him repeatedly to sit down, because he would get up and walk away from where we had told him to sit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-8\">At one point he was running around the accident scene, literally running around the accident scene. I don\u2019t know what he was doing, but he was maybe conversing with other people who were there or his brother. I\u2019m not \u2014 I don\u2019t recall what he was doing specifically. But that\u2019s the level of agitation or excitement that he displayed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">For safety reasons, the troopers did not conduct roadside sobriety testing. The scene of the accident was at a curve down a hill on the Parkway and rescue personnel were helping the injured and removing the vehicles. The troopers arrested defendant and the driver of the black vehicle and transported them in one police car to State Police barracks. According to Trooper Walsh, \u201cthe troop car smelled of the odor of a consumed alcoholic beverage.\u201d Breathalyzer testing shortly after 5:00 a.m. showed that defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content was .10 percent, above the legal limit for driving. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">Defendant\u2019s municipal court trial in East Orange was adjourned eleven times from the initial trial date of October 10, 2007, until it was held on July 15, 2008 \u2014 296 days from the date of defendant\u2019s arrest. After his conviction in the municipal court, defendant filed a notice of appeal on July 30, 2008, for trial de novo on the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>in the Superior Court, Law Division. <em>See R. </em>3:23-8(a). The Superior Court trial did not occur until October 22, 2010 \u2014 798 days from the filing of the notice of appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">Defendant raises speedy trial and other arguments as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-7\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">THE STATE HAS VIOLATED DEFENDANT\u2019S DUE PROCESS RIGHTS, AND AS SUCH, THE CHARGE AGAINST HIM SHOULD BE DISMISSED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-10\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-11\">THE STATE LACKED SUFFICIENT PROBABLE CAUSE TO DETAIN AND ARREST DEFENDANT AND, ACCORDINGLY, ALL EVIDENCE THEREAFTER OBTAINED SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-13\">\n<em>POINT III</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-14\">AS A RESULT OF THE STATE\u2019S SPOLIATION OF EVIDENCE THAT WAS LIKELY TO RAISE A REASONABLE DOUBT OF DEFENDANT\u2019S GUILT, THE COMPLAINT SHOULD BE DISMISSED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-17\">To the extent these arguments pertain to the municipal court proceedings, we reject them for the reasons stated in the thorough and well-reasoned written decision of Judge Ramona Santiago in the Law Division dated August 30, 2010. Judge Santiago determined that defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial in the municipal court had not been violated such that the charge must be dismissed, that the State Police had probable cause to arrest defendant for DWI, and that defendant had not been prejudiced by alleged spoliation of evidence in that the prosecution had lost the original videotape from the State Police dashboard camera that was introduced as an exhibit at the municipal court trial. The court\u2019s decision, however, did not address defendant\u2019s speedy trial and due process argument regarding the twenty-seven months that passed before disposition of his appeal and trial de novo in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-18\">The relevant facts regarding the Superior Court proceedings are as follows. A few days after defendant\u2019s conviction in the municipal court, counsel for defendant wrote to the East Orange Municipal Court requesting the dashboard videotape introduced in evidence. At the time he filed the notice of appeal, counsel requested that the municipal court prepare and file relevant transcripts of the municipal court proceedings. On August 22, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>2008, municipal court staff advised defense counsel that, because of a technical problem, there would be a delay in producing a compact disc of the sound recordings to be transcribed. On October 17, 2008, defense counsel was notified of another delay in providing trial transcripts. On February 4, 2009, defense counsel wrote to the municipal court inquiring about the transcripts. Defense counsel finally received the transcripts on February 6, 2009 \u2014 191 days, or about six months, after he filed the notice of appeal and made the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">In the meantime, on January 6, 2009, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division for Essex County Superior Court executed a court-generated order dismissing defendant\u2019s appeal without prejudice for failing to file transcripts as required under <em>Rules </em>3:23-8 and 2:5-3(a). The order of dismissal was not served upon defendant or the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Fifteen months later, in April 2010, defense counsel sent a paralegal to the Essex County Criminal Division office to check the status of the ease. Counsel learned that the appeal was not being scheduled for disposition because it had been dismissed. The clerk\u2019s office refused to provide a copy of the order of dismissal to the paralegal because it had not been filed on the court\u2019s docket. Defense counsel received a copy ten days later and promptly filed a motion to vacate the dismissal, which the Superior Court granted on May 21, 2010. Thus, 469 days of the delay were caused by the court\u2019s dismissal of the appeal without prejudice, but also without notice to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">On May 25, 2010, defense counsel wrote to the municipal court because the videotape exhibit had not been forwarded to the Superior Court as part of the record. On June 25, 2010, the prosecutor ordered another copy of the tape from the State Police because the original exhibit could not be found. Defense counsel objected to the use of a new copy rather than the original exhibit. By letter dated August 13, 2010, the State wrote to the Superior Court that it had \u201clocated the video tape introduced and marked as S-l in the defendant\u2019s municipal appeal trial below.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>prosecutor\u2019s letter stated the videotape was found in the filing cabinet of a prosecutor who had retired earlier that year.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, 80 days of delay were caused in part by the search for the missing videotape exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">On August 25, 2010, Judge Santiago heard oral argument on defendant\u2019s appeal of his pretrial motions to dismiss the charges and to suppress evidence. The judge declined to hear the trial de novo at the same time because defendant\u2019s brief was limited to the pretrial issues. On August 30, 2010, Judge Santiago entered an order and issued her letter-opinion denying defendant\u2019s appeal of the municipal court\u2019s pretrial rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">On October 22, 2010, Judge Santiago heard the factual merits of defendant\u2019s de novo appeal, at the conclusion of which she found defendant guilty of driving while intoxicated. A judgment order to that effect was entered on the same date and sentence was imposed. As a first DWI offender, defendant was sentenced to pay a fine of $300 and other statutory money penalties totaling $358, twelve hours at the Intoxicated Drivers Resource Center, and seven months\u2019 driver\u2019s license suspension. Judge Santiago denied defendant\u2019s motion to stay execution of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">The State concedes that the right not to be subjected to unreasonable delay applies to an appeal, <em>State v. Le Furge, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>92, 98, 535 A.2d 1015 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>568, 546 A.2d 498 (1988), and consequently, to a trial de novo on appeal to the Superior Court from a municipal court conviction. <em>See also Simmons v. Beyer, </em>44 <em>F.</em>3d 1160, 1169 (3d Cir.1995) (unreasonable delay in an appeal as of right violates a defendant\u2019s right to due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>In <em>Le Furge, supra, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 98, 535 A.2d 1015, we stated that the same framework and standard apply to evaluating undue delay on appeal as applies to a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial in the trial court. The constitutional standard for a speedy trial was established by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 <em>U.S. </em>514, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972), and applied by our Supreme Court in <em>State v. Szima, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>196, 200-02, 358 A.2d 773, <em>cert. denied, </em>429 <em>U.S. </em>896, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>259, 50 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>180 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">In <em>Barker, </em>the Court set forth a \u201cbalancing test ... in which the conduct of both the prosecution and the defendant are weighed\u201d to aid in determining when a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment has been violated. 407 <em>U.S. </em>at 530, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2191-92, 33 L.Ed.2d at 115-17. The Court identified four factors that should be examined: \u201cLength of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Ibid.; accord Szima, supra, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 200-01, 358 A.2d 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">In this case, the first of those factors, the length of the twenty-seven month delay from the notice of appeal to the trial de novo, weighs heavily in favor of defendant\u2019s argument that his right to speedy disposition on appeal was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The reasons for the delay are largely, but not entirely, attributable to the courts and the prosecution. First, the East Orange Municipal Court could not produce timely transcripts, requiring about six months from the end of July 2008 to the beginning of February 2009 to complete transcripts. Next, the Superior Court dismissed the appeal for lack of transcripts without serving notice of the court-initiated dismissal on defendant or the prosecution. Fifteen months passed until April 2010 without any activity on the appeal. From May to August 2010, a period of three months, the delay was caused mostly by the municipal court\u2019s and the prosecution\u2019s inability to find the videotape exhibit admitted at the trial, which turned out to have been stored and forgotten in a prosecutor\u2019s file cabinet. The reason for the last two months of delay, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>from August to October 2010, was that the initial briefing before the Superior Court focused on pretrial issues rather than the facts presented at trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">We reject the State\u2019s argument that defendant was solely to blame for all these delays. We are particularly troubled by the Superior Court\u2019s dismissal of the appeal without giving notice to defense counsel and the prosecutor both before and after the order of dismissal was issued. For fifteen months, neither attorney was notified that the court had dismissed the appeal. Because the municipal court had stayed execution of defendant\u2019s sentence after his conviction, defendant continued to be licensed to drive during that time although he had been convicted of DWI and no court proceeding was then pending. The Superior Court had a responsibility to notify the attorneys of the dismissal so that appropriate action could be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">But defendant and defense counsel were not completely free of blame. We also attribute responsibility to defendant and counsel for the fifteen-month period of inactivity. During the time the appeal was dismissed, defendant did not make any inquiry or pursue the ease. Had he done so, that period of delay would have been significantly shortened. Because execution of sentence had been stayed, defendant apparently did not have a strong incentive to seek a speedy disposition of his appeal in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">In fact, the third factor under the <em>Barker </em>analysis weighs heavily against defendant\u2019s argument that his speedy trial rights were violated. There is no evidence on this record that defendant asserted a right to speedy disposition of the de novo appeal at any time from filing the notice of appeal in July 2008 until the Superior Court heard argument on pretrial issues in August 2010. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Barker, supra, </em>407 U. <em>S. </em>at 532, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2193, 33 L.Ed.2d at 118, and we repeated in <em>Le Furge, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number><em>supra, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 99, 535 A.2d 1015, \u201cfailure to assert the right [to a speedy trial] will make it difficult for a defendant to prove that he was denied a fair trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Also important, defendant was not prejudiced by the delay. His defenses had already been presented in the municipal court; they could not have been impaired by the delay. <em>See id. </em>at 99, 535 A.2d 1015. A trial de novo in the Superior Court is heard on the record made in the municipal court, usually without new evidence or rehearing of live witnesses. <em>See R. </em>3:23-8(a). Furthermore, defendant suffered no detrimental consequences from his conviction, the sentence having been stayed during the time of appeal to the Superior Court. The \u201chardship\u201d of waiting for disposition of his appeal, standing alone, \u201cis insufficient to constitute meaningful prejudice.\u201d <em>Le Furge, supra, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 99-100, 535 A.2d 1015 (citing <em>United States v. Loud Hawk, </em>474 <em>U.S. </em>302, 315, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>648, 656, 88 L.Ed.2d 640, 654 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Balancing the four factors set forth in <em>Barker, </em>we conclude that defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated by the delay in the disposition of his trial de novo on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-9\"> With respect to defendant's spoliation argument, defense counsel argued the exhibit in the municipal court trial had been marked D-2 and not S-l. He could not represent to the court either way whether the videotape filed for the trial de novo was identical to or different from the one admitted in evidence by the municipal court. The prosecution insisted it was the same recording, and Judge Santiago accepted that representation. She viewed the videotape and determined it was not probative of any issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b573-9\"> Because defendant\u2019s conviction was a per se violation based on the blood alcohol reading of .10, the trial de novo itself did not involve any significant issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
