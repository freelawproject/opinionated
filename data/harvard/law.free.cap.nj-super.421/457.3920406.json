In contrast, <em>Rule </em>1:20-3(e)(3) allows the secretary of a district ethics committee to decline to docket a grievance against an attorney which the secretary, with the concurrence of a public member, has determined fails to allege conduct violative of the Rules of Professional Conduct <em>(\u201cRPC\u2019). </em>The issue presented in this appeal is whether <em>Rule </em>1:20-3(e)(6), which precludes an appeal of an undocketed grievance, violates a grievant\u2019s right to due process or equal protection of the laws. As the plaintiffgrievant fails to assert a viable constitutional basis for his challenge, we affirm the Law Division\u2019s dismissal of his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">Plaintiff Martin O\u2019Boyle filed a grievance with the District I Ethics Committee (\u201cthe Committee\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to <em>Rule </em>1:20-3(e)(3), the grievance was declined by the Secretary, with eoneur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>rence by a designated public member, based on a decision that the facts stated in the grievance, if true, would not constitute unethical conduct. On October 14, 2009, plaintiff filed a three count complaint in the Law Division against the Committee, Charles Centinaro in his official capacity as the Director of the Office of Attorney Ethics (OAE), and the New Jersey Supreme Court, captioned in lieu of prerogative writs, declaratory judgment, and the New Jersey Civil Rights Act (CRA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:6-2. The Law Division granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e) on April 16, 2010. Plaintiff appealed. On November 12, 2010, the Supreme Court denied plaintiffs application for direct certification. <em>R. </em>2:12-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Plaintiff and his wife were involved in a dispute over an unpaid bill with an electrician who performed work at their Longport home. On September 19, 2006, James Swift, an attorney for the electrician, sent a letter to plaintiffs attorney, stating an intention, if plaintiff did not promptly pay the debt, to file a construction lien and notify Longport officials that plaintiff performed work on the property without the proper construction permits. Plaintiff refused to accede to the attorney\u2019s demand for payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">After receipt of Swift\u2019s letter, Longport officials filed municipal court complaints against plaintiff. Plaintiff represents he prevailed, but ultimately incurred over $100,000 in attorney and expert fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">Plaintiff then filed a grievance against Swift with the Committee, claiming Swift violated various <em>RPCs, </em>\u201cnotably 3.4(g), by threatening criminal charges against the O\u2019Boyle family in order to gain an advantage in a civil contract matter.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He included a recitation of the facts, certification of his attorney who was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>recipient of the letter and phone call from Swift, and a copy of Swift\u2019s letter to Longport.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">By letter of April 14, 2009, Fredric L. Shenkman, Esquire and Dr. Larry Nutt,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Secretary and public member of the Committee, respectively, advised plaintiff of their review of the grievance and conclusion that, even if proven, plaintiffs allegations would not constitute unethical conduct. Accordingly, pursuant to <em>Rule </em>1:20\u2014 3(e)(3), the grievance was declined, and the file was closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Plaintiffs counsel subsequently wrote the Secretary, arguing the threat of prosecution by way of municipal ordinance in the municipal court was a \u201ccriminal\u201d prosecution threat within the meaning of <em>RPC </em>3.4(g), citing case law and Supreme Court Advisory Committee opinions. The Secretary and public member again conferred, and by letter of June 2, 2009 and e-mail of September 21, 2009, Shenkman provided plaintiffs counsel with further explanation of the decision and advised there would be no investigation, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Plaintiff filed suit against defendants, asserting in his action in lieu of prerogative writs count that the Secretary\u2019s and Committee\u2019s policy of relying on the criminal code \u2014 \u201cTitle 2C\u201d \u2014 to establish the scope of attorneys\u2019 ethical responsibilities and the resulting refusal to accept jurisdiction over plaintiffs grievance was arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of discretion, and the other defendants \u201cshould not condone and are without powers to authorize district ethics committees to establish policies inconsistent with the intent and spirit of the <em>RPCs </em>or prior ethics opinions.\u201d Accordingly, plaintiff sought to compel the Committee to accept jurisdiction over his grievance, interpret <em>RPC </em>3.4(g) \u201caccording to its plain purpose of prohibiting threats of prosecution to influence civil matters,\u201d and refrain from \u201carbitrarily and erroneously relying upon the criminal code to determine the scope\u201d of Swift\u2019s ethical responsibilities. Plaintiff also sought to enjoin \u201call policies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>existing on any level of the attorney ethics system that allows local committees [to] establish their own standards regarding the interpretation of <em>RPC </em>3.4(g).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In his second count, plaintiff sought both a declaratory judgment against defendants as to the scope of <em>RPC </em>3.4(g) and the conduct which it is directed to punish, and an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. In his third count, plaintiff alleged his substantive due process rights under the CRA to pursue attorney discipline grievances were violated by the Committee\u2019s refusal to accept his grievance against Swift. Plaintiff sought to enjoin the Secretary from declining jurisdiction over his grievance, and an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Defendants filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:6 \u2014 2(e). At oral argument on April 16, 2010, Judge Linda Feinberg framed the parties\u2019 positions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">Defendantts] argute:] (1) the [c]ourt lacks jurisdiction to review a decision of the [Cjommittee or to compel the [C]ommittee to prosecute a grievance, (2) [ ] plaintiff has no constitutional right to have [the] [C]ommittee review his grievance, and (3) [ ] defendants have immunity with respect to plaintiffs request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-9\">In opposition, plaintiff concedes that he has no constitutional right to have his grievance heard by the committee, but is arguing that there should be some appellate process \u2014 and I believe he used the tern there shouldn\u2019t be [a] single gatekeeper \u2014 but there should be some mechanism of appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">Plaintiffs attorney articulated his arguments and clarified his constitutional challenge as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-11\">One, O\u2019Boyle does not have a constitutional right to prosecute Swift through this Court. That\u2019s what I meant in the brief. He does have a constitutional right to a substantive due process in the grievance procedure, that\u2019s the distinction that\u2019s being drawn. That\u2019s my first point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-12\">The second point is, a law suit is a poor substitute for policing attorney ethics, and every opinion that you read usually runs against that parameter. So, I\u2019m uncomfortable with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-13\">And the third and final point that I was hoping to get the Court to address was there\u2019s the <em>Felmeister</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>decision from the Supreme Court that encourages attorneys to bring declaratory judgment actions about the rales ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>In dismissing the case, Judge Feinberg said the Supreme Court, within its judgment under the Constitution, had set up a specific mechanism allowing the secretary to accept grievances or to reject grievances with no appeal, and she did not have jurisdiction to change that procedure. She explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">I\u2019m a trial judge, the Supreme Court through a fairly elaborate process of review, public comment^-when they changed that rule it went out for public comment, and they have vested at this local level, without authority, and there\u2019s no appeal. I don\u2019t have any authority to change that, or enjoin that process____I don\u2019t have jurisdiction to change that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">The judge observed that plaintiffs request for greater appellate rights than he was entitled under <em>Rule </em>1:20-3(e)(6) would be more properly addressed by a request to the Supreme Court Committee with jurisdiction over the ethics rules for a modification of the current procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">The court was not persuaded that plaintiffs inability to appeal the Secretary\u2019s decision violated his due process rights, elaborating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-10\">Well, I think he had a process. He presented his grievance, presented the letters. The secretary who holds a veiy significant position in the district ethics process reviewed it, was disinclined to accept it, decided to confer with a public member. There was a three-month lapse. I assume there was an opportunity to discuss and review, and made a decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-11\">So there was a process, and there was a result and there was an opportunity. It\u2019s just that the result is not something that your client agrees with and you believe there should be a second level. It\u2019s just if, like if the Legislature had adopted a statute and there should have been an appeal, but there is no appeal, I couldn\u2019t change that. You could certainly advance your argument, you know, down the street, but it\u2019s really sort of the same thing. There was no absence of a due process mechanism here, it was just more limited in focus, and if you believe strongly then you can certainly articulate that to the appropriate forum. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s here with all due respect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">Following argument, the court entered an order dismissing plaintiffs complaint with prejudice, and this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-14\">On appeal, plaintiff argues: (1) the Committee\u2019s interpretation of <em>RPC </em>3.4(g) is legally wrong and the process contained in <em>Rule </em>1:20-3 is flawed because it prohibits review; (2) the trial court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>empowered to take action; (3) due process is violated because the \u201chearing\u201d afforded is not \u201cfull and fair\u201d in light of the significant matters at stake; (4) the <em>Rules </em>cannot distinguish between classes of grievants without violating equal protection principles; (5) the Committee\u2019s \u201cpolicy\u201d is an ultra vires act subject to being enjoined; and (6) an action in lieu of prerogative writs may proceed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Based on our review of the record and applicable law, we are not persuaded by any of plaintiffs arguments and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The facts are not in dispute. We accord no deference to the motion judge\u2019s conclusions on issues of law, <em>Estate of Hanges v. Metro. Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>369, 382-83, 997 A.2d 954 (2010); <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P., v. Twp.

Const. </em>art. VI, \u00a7 1, \u00b6 1. The Supreme Court has the authority to create the rules that govern the administration, practice, and procedure of all courts in our State. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2, \u00b6 3. The Court also exercises plenary authority over the regulation of the practice of law in New Jersey, including disciplinary grievances against attorneys and business entities authorized to practice law in New Jersey. <em>Ibid.; R. </em>1:20 \u2014 1(a); <em>In re Greenberg, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>138, 152, 714 A.2d 243 (1998); <em>State v.

Before 1973, attorney disciplinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>matters were handled principally at the local level, with local ethics committees established in each county. Kevin H. Michels, <em>New Jersey Attorney Ethics </em>\u2014 The <em>Law of New Jersey Lawyering </em>\u00a7 42:1 at 1028 (2011). In 1978, the Supreme Court regionalized the system by combining these county committees into twelve district ethics committees. <em>Ibid. </em>Public members were added to the district committees in 1979. <em>Ibid. </em>In 1984, the Supreme Court established the OAE and district ethics and fee arbitration committees to assist in the administration of its disciplinary function. <em>R. </em>l:20-l(a). Each district ethics committee (\u201cdistrict committee\u201d) is comprised of not less than eight members, of which a minimum of four members must be attorneys and two must be lay persons, all of whom are appointed by the Supreme Court and serve at its pleasure. <em>R. </em>1:20-3(a) &amp; (b). All members of such district committee must reside or work in the county in which the ethics district lies. <em>R. </em>1:20-3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">The district committee acts as an arm of the Supreme Court when it performs the functions of receiving and investigate ing grievances, and holding disciplinary hearings. <em>Middlesex Cnty. Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>457 <em>U.S. </em>423, 433, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>2515, 2522, 73 L.Ed.2d 116, 126 (1982). Filing an ethics grievance with a district committee \u201cis in effect a filing with the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Toft v. Ketchum, </em>18 <em>N.J. </em>280, 284, 113 A.2d 671 (1955)). <em>See also In re LiVolsi, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>576, 597 n. 22, 428 A.2d 1268 (1981) (commenting that the Court has labeled fee arbitration, disciplinary and similar\u2019 Supreme Court Committees and the Board \u201cagents\u201d of the Supreme Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The Director of the OAE, after consultation with the chairperson of the district committee, is required to appoint a secretary who is not a member of the committee. <em>R. </em>1:20-3(e). The secretary is the designated recipient of all grievances filed with that district committee. <em>R. </em>1:20-3(d). The secretary evaluates the grievance and determines whether the committee should investigate it for possible prosecution or dismiss it without further inquiry, specifically, looking at whether the conduct attributed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>the attorney, taken as true, would violate the Rules of Professional Conduct. <em>R. </em>1:20-3(e) &amp; (e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">In situations in which the secretary has preliminarily decided to decline jurisdiction of a grievance because the facts alleged, \u201cif true, would not constitute unethical conduct or incapacity,\u201d the secretary is required to consult with a public member of the committee. <em>R. </em>1:20 \u2014 3(e)(3). If the public member agrees with the secretary\u2019s preliminary determination, the secretary must decline to accept the grievance. <em>Ibid. </em>However, if the public member disagrees with the secretary\u2019s preliminary decision, the secretary must accept the grievance for further investigation. <em>R. </em>1:20-3(e)(4). The secretary is required to notify the grievant of the decision and provide a copy of the specific Court Rule or written guideline for declination. <em>R. </em>1:20-3(e)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Grievances that are initially docketed, investigated, and then dismissed may be appealed. <em>R. </em>1:20 \u2014 3(h); <em>see also R. </em>1:20-3(e)(6). However, the Court Rules expressly provide that the decision by a secretary to decline a grievance is not appealable. <em>R. </em>1:20-3(e)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The attorney disciplinary rules did not always provide a secretary with the discretion to decline to docket a grievance. Immediately prior to the adoption of the current version of <em>Rule </em>1:20-3 in 1995, the <em>Rule </em>provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">Each [District Ethics] Committee shall, in accordance with these <em>Rules, </em>review and act upon all grievances submitted to it by a grievant, the Supreme Court, the Administrative Office of the Courts, the Board, the Director or otherwise brought to its attention regarding alleged unethical conduct that, if proved, would constitute grounds for disciplinary action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">[R 1:20-3(e).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-10\"><em>Rule </em>1:20 \u2014 3(f) required the chairperson of the district committee to assign an attorney member to preliminarily review any grievance received by the committee and \u201cmake such inquiry as may be necessary in order to determine whether a formal complaint should be filed.\u201d The investigator then reported in writing to the chairperson,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-11\">the facts together with a finding or recommendation that (1) unethical conduct has occurred, (2) the matter should be closed for absence of an indication of unethical conduct, (3) there is a need for further investigation, (4) the matter should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>referred to the Director to determine incapacity or disability under <em>R. </em>1:20-9, or (5) proceedings should be deferred pending completion of related litigation under <em>R. </em>1:20-11(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\">[R. 1:20-3(f).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">A chairperson who concluded the matter should be closed or deferred directed the secretary to so advise the grievant and other interested parties and furnish a copy of the written investigative report. <em>Ibid. </em>The <em>Rule </em>expressly provided grievants with an ability to appeal the dismissal of a grievance to the Board, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Amf\">Either the Director or a grievant shall have a right of appeal to the Board within 30 days as provided by <em>R. </em>1:20-4(e).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">[R. 1:20-3(f).]</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s 1987 Guidelines relating to the rules governing the New Jersey Disciplinary and Fee Arbitration System, the secretary of the district committee was required to docket all grievances presented for filing, even if the secretaiy felt the conduct attributed to the attorney did not violate the <em>RPCs, </em>so long as the grievant insisted against the secretary\u2019s recommendation in pursuing the grievance. <em>Administrative Guidelines of the Office of Attorney Ethics, </em>Guideline No. 3 (revised March 1,1987). In such cases, the secretary was required to docket and assign the matter to the committee\u2019s designated investigator to conduct a preliminary investigation and render a written report to the chairperson pursuant to <em>Rule </em>1:20 \u2014 3(f) and Guideline No. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">In 1991, Chief Justice Robert N. Wilentz appointed the New Jersey Ethics Commission, known as the Michels Commission,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and issued a mandate to \u201crecommend those changes needed to assure that New Jersey\u2019s ethics system becomes as effective, as efficient, and as responsive as possible.\u201d <em>Report of the New Jersey Ethics Commission </em>(\u201cMichels Comm\u2019n Report\u201d), 133 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>905 (March 15, 1993).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Commission was also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>charged with making \u201cfindings and recommendations to the Court regarding acceptable time standards for the disposition of attorney ethics matters, whether the present disciplinary structure can achieve those standards and, if not, the changes that should be made in order to achieve those standards.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">The Michels Commission Report was released in 1993. One of its primary concerns was the ever-increasing backlog of cases. <em>Id. </em>at 909. The Commission cited the inefficiency of the then-current system, noting the unacceptable periods of time it took to process a grievance from intake to resolution, even for uncomplicated eases. Testimony was heard from grievants who were critical of the delays in processing, sometimes for periods of years without any status updates. <em>Id. </em>at 909. The Commission determined that \u201cit is readily apparent that, at all levels of discipline, many cases languish at the district ethics committee level for between two and three years without regard to the relative simplicity of certain matters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 910.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">One reason the turnaround time was so poor was the burden of investigating a docketed claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-6\">Delays are even more likely to occur in the investigative stage, where the volunteer investigator must find time from his or her own law practice to gather all relevant facts and documentary proofs; interview in person or by telephone the griovant, the respondent and other necessary witnesses; review the appropriate rules and case law on the particular issue under consideration, and finally, draft an investigative report detailing all efforts undertaken, findings and conclusions of the case, and recommending either dismissal or further action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 911.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Relevant to this appeal, the Commission noted that a large number of grievances, as many as eighty percent, were never docketed but were deflected by the district secretaries, based on their determination that a cause of action had not been stated that would justify docketing the grievance. <em>Id. </em>at 913-14. The Commission noted the Supreme Court had an \u201copen complaint\u201d policy that allowed a grievant to insist that his or her grievance be docketed and investigated but that most people were unaware of this option. <em>Id. </em>at 914 n. 85. The Commission concluded that \u201cthis aspect of the disciplinary system requires major revision\u201d and \u201c[i]t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>should be a primary goal of the disciplinary system to provide meaningful and timely assistance to members of the public who have concerns regarding their lawyers\u2019 conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The Commission noted the exact problem plaintiff complains of with respect to the district secretary making determinations that no unethical conduct has been alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">It is currently the function of the district secretary to screen all grievances prior to docketing. While, in a perfect world, all secretaries would apply the same standards and norms, in actual practice, that action may be subjective, and may result in disparate treatment of grievants, depending on the vagaries of chance as to where the grievance was filed. There is currently no oversight of, or right of appeal from, dismissal of an undocketed grievance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 914 n. 88.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">On July 14, 1994, the Supreme Court issued its own administrative determinations responding to the Commission\u2019s recommendations. <em>Administrative Determinations Relating to the Report of the New Jersey Ethics Commission </em>(\u201cAdministrative Determinations\u201d), 137 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>1177 (July 18,1994). The Court rejected the recommendations of the Commission for a central intake office for the receipt of all grievances against attorneys and, instead required, as part of an overall plan to increase public participation in the disciplinary process, that a public member concur with any decision by the district secretary not to docket a grievance. <em>See ibid.; Michels Comm\u2019n Report, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>at 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">In the <em>Administrative Determinations, supra, </em>the Court stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-10\">The secretaries and chairs of Distinct Ethics Committees shall perform the functions set forth in this recommendation. They shall continue to be the intake office for the receipt of grievances against lawyers. No grievance shall be dismissed, however, <em>unless that dismissal is concurred in by a public member designated by the Chair, </em>all as set forth above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-11\">[137 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>at 1177 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">Expressing the desire the public share the Court\u2019s confidence in the integrity of the system, the Court noted that the change would \u201csubstantially increase public membership in the local district ethics committees, and will guarantee that before a matter reaches [the Court], all disciplinary decisions of any kind, at any level, will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>either be made with the participation of public members or be appealable to an agency that includes public members.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1174.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The Court amended <em>Rule </em>1:20-3 on January 31, 1995, effective March 1, 1995, among other items, deleting paragraph (e) and replacing it with the following language, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">(e) Screening; Docketing. <em>The secreta,ry shall evaluate inquiries and grievances in accordance with this rule and shall docket, decline, or dismiss the matters </em>within 45 days of their receipt. <em>The secretary shall not conduct an investigation of a grievance.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">(1) The secretary shall evaluate all information received by inquiry, grievance or from other sources alleging attorney unethical conduct or incapacity by an attorney maintaining an office in that district.

Unless declination is mandatory under subparagraph (e)(2), on receipt of a properly completed attorney grievance form the secretary will have the grievance reviewed by one or more public members of the Ethics Committee designated by the secretary. <em>If a designated, public member agrees with the secretary, the matter shall be declined. </em>Otherwise, the matter shall be docketed and assigned for investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>(5) If a matter is declined, the secretary shall furnish a concise written statement to the grievant of the reasons therefor and shall enclose a copy of the court rale or written guideline for declination approved by the Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-4\">(6) <em>There shall be no appeal from a decision to decline a grievance made in accordance with this rule.

Of the eleven members of this Committee, five must be members of the public. <em>R. </em>1:20B-2. The Committee reports to the Supreme Court quarterly \u201cand at such other times as the Supreme Court and the Oversight Committee deem appropriate, making whatever recommendations it believes would improve the quality and efficiency of the disciplinary system and strengthen adherence to high ethical standards.\u201d <em>R. </em>1:20B-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">We first address plaintiffs right to judicial review of his grievance. Plaintiff concedes in his reply brief that \u201cthe prerogative writ count is out,\u201d expressly recognizing <em>LiVolsi, supra, </em>is controlling. In <em>LiVolsi, </em>on direct certification, the Supreme Court rejected a similar attempt to use the Superior Court\u2019s jurisdiction in lieu of prerogative writs to challenge the exclusive attorney regulatory power of the Supreme Court\u2019s Fee Arbitration Committee. <em>Supra, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>at 576, 428 A.2d 1268. Relying on the prerogative writs clause of the New Jersey Constitution, art. VI, \u00a7 V, par. 4,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the petitioner-attorney argued that an appeal in lieu <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>of prerogative writs should lie \u201cby right\u201d from determinations of fee arbitration committees established pursuant to <em>Rule </em>1:20A-1,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> just as such appeals lie \u201cby right\u201d from determinations of legislatively-created administrative agencies. <em>LiVolsi, supra, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>at 592-93, 428 A.2d 1268.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The Court rejected the petitioner\u2019s contentions on two grounds. It first noted that \u201c[a]ctions in lieu of prerogative writs lie only in those cases where a remedy was available under a traditional prerogative writ\u201d and found no evidence that the pre1947 writ of <em>certiorari </em>was available for review of actions by judicially-created agencies, such as the fee arbitration committees, as opposed to ordinary administrative agencies. <em>Id. </em>at 593-96, 428 A.2d 1268. Secondly, and more importantly, the Court found that permitting appeals from judicially-created agencies to the Superi- or Court would be \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cexclusive constitutional authority over the regulation of the Bar\u201d granted by art. VI, \u00a7 II, par. 3, which had as a \u201ccentral element\u201d the \u201ccontrol over the procedures under which these institutions are regulated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593, 596-97, 428 A.2d 1268. It is clear district ethics committees, like fee arbitration committees, are agencies established by the Supreme Court, which are not subject to actions in lieu of prerogative writs in the Superior Court. <em>See id. </em>at 597, 428 A.2d 1268.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Plaintiff, however, asserts, without legal authority, that this concession \u201cdoes not alter the ability [to] enjoin the operation of the <em>Rule </em>under the New Jersey Civil Rights Act or general equitable powers.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">It would make little sense to allow the Superior Court, Law Division, to review a decision of a district ethics secretary that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>expressly not appealable by <em>Rule </em>based on the court\u2019s \u201cinherent equitable powers\u201d when the Supreme Court has held that the same cannot be accomplished by an action in lieu of prerogative writs.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">In <em>GE Capital Mortgage Services, Inc. v. New Jersey Title Insurance Co., </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 754 A.2d 558 (App.Div.2000), we rejected a mortgagee\u2019s attempt to utilize the court system to establish an enforceable claim against the New Jersey Lawyers\u2019 Fund for Client Protection (\u201cthe Fund\u201d) outside of the procedures established by the Supreme Court for the processing of such claims. The plaintiff filed suit against the Fund when it was informed the Fund would not consider its claim for reimbursement of monies misappropriated by the buyers\u2019 attorney. <em>Id. </em>at 3-4, 754 A.2d 558. The plaintiff argued it should be permitted to sue the Fund in furtherance of the Fund\u2019s goal of compensating those wronged by a member of the bar. <em>Id. </em>at 4-5, 754 A.2d 558. We disagreed and affirmed dismissal of the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, noting the Supreme Court\u2019s exclusive constitutional authority over the regulation of the Bar and the Court\u2019s establishment of the Fund and grant of sole discretion to the trustees to administer it pursuant to <em>Rule </em>1:28. <em>Id. </em>at 4-6, 754 A.2d 558. We concluded that permitting the plaintiff \u201cto establish a viable and enforceable claim against the Fund\u201d would be a \u201ccollateral approach\u201d that \u201cwould directly violate the procedure established by our Supreme Court for the processing of such elaims[,]\u201d reasoning that \u201c[bjecause the Fund is wholly a creature of the Supreme Court, the Court should determine whether alternate procedures may be followed in order to pursue a claim against the Fund.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6, 754 A.2d 558. We further reasoned that the \u201cnovel jurisdictional and public policy implications of permitting direct claims against the Fund in the Law Division go beyond the conventional rule relaxation contemplated by <em>Rule </em>1:1\u2014 2 and would intrude improperly on matters clearly vested in the Fund by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>We also rejected as without merit the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that a \u201csubstantial injustice\u201d would result if it were denied the opportunity to proceed against the Fund in the Superior Court. <em>Ibid. </em>We noted that not only did the rules pertaining to the Fund fail to provide for a judicial appeal process but \u201cour Supreme Court has observed ... that \u2018permitting appeals from judicially created agencies to the Superior Court would be inconsistent with this Court\u2019s exclusive constitutional authority over the regulation of the Bar.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7, 754 A.2d 558 (quoting <em>LiVolsi, supra, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>at 593, 428 A.2d 1268).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">We recognize that the Supreme Court has suggested the use of a declaratory judgment action to determine the constitutionality of the Court Rules. In <em>Felmeister, </em>two attorneys advised the ethics advisory committee of their plan to violate a prohibition against engaging in broadcast advertising during the pendency of a review of the rules. <em>Supra, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>at 432-34, 471 A.2d 775. After a disciplinary action was instituted when the attorneys broadcast their advertisement, they sought interlocutory review by the Supreme Court to dismiss the charges on the ground the ban on such advertising was an unconstitutional infringement of speech. <em>Id. </em>at 432-33, 471 A.2d 775. The Court granted leave to appeal, denied the attorneys\u2019 motions for dismissal and remanded to the district ethics committee for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 448, 471 A.2d 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The Supreme Court commented that, instead of violating the mandate of the Court, the attorneys \u201ccould have challenged the constitutionality of the Disciplinary Rule in a suit for a declaratory judgment\u201d pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A: 16-50 to -62. <em>Id. </em>at 444, 471 A.2d 775. As the Court noted, \u201c \u2018[o]ur rules are never immutable. Applications for their review are never foreclosed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445, 471 A.2d 775 (quoting <em>Am. Trial Lawyers Ass\u2019n v. N.J. Supreme Court, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>258, 267, 330 A.2d 350 (1974) (upholding the constitutionality of the contingent fee rule, <em>R. </em>1:21-7)).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Plaintiff also cites <em>R.M. v. Supreme Court of New Jersey, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>208, 888 A.2d 369 (2005), as persuasive authority for the Law Division to have enjoined, or declared the rights between the parties in, the district ethics committee process. In <em>R.M., </em>a client sued the Supreme Court, a district ethics committee, the OAE and her former attorney, alleging <em>Rule </em>1:20-9, which mandates that an ethics grievance filed against an attorney remain confidential until a formal complaint is filed, was an unconstitutional restriction on speech. On direct certification, <em>R. </em>2:12-1, the Court struck down the <em>Rule </em>as unconstitutional because it was not narrowly tailored to advance a compelling interest. <em>Id. </em>at 227, 883 A.2d 369. The Court remanded the matter to the Professional Responsibility Rules Committee to draft implementing amendments. <em>Id. </em>at 231, 883 A.2d 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The Supreme Court has established the procedure for processing grievances. The <em>Rule </em>at issue expressly provides that \u201c[tjhere shall be no appeal from a decision to decline a grievance made in accordance with this rule.\u201d <em>R. </em>1:20-3(e)(6). As the Court recognized in <em>R.M., </em>the ethics-process rules are subject to constitutional challenge, and if <em>Rule </em>1:20-3(e)(6) were unconstitutional on its face or as applied, we would have a duty to declare it invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">We initially note that nowhere in his complaint does plaintiff seek a declaratory judgment that <em>Rule </em>1:20-3(e)(6) is unconstitutional. In the second count plaintiff merely demands a judgment \u201c[djeclaring t[he] scope of <em>RPC </em>3.4(g) and the conduct which it is directed to punish,\u201d awarding attorneys fees and costs of suit, and awarding such other relief as is fair, equitable and necessary. In the third count asserting the CRA, plaintiff alleges that defendants\u2019 refusal to exercise jurisdiction over his grievance \u201cdeprived him of his substantive due process right to pursue an ethical grievance against\u201d Swift and seeks to enjoin the Secretary from declining jurisdiction over his grievance. In essence, plaintiff simply attacks the Committee\u2019s interpretation of <em>RPC </em>3.4(g) and the Secretary\u2019s decision to decline jurisdiction of his grievance. Plaintiff does not allege <em>Rule </em>1:20-3(e)(6) is unconstitutional due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>to the inability to appeal grievances that are declined or challenge the constitutionality of the grievance intake procedures established by <em>Rules </em>1:20-3(e)(6) and 1:20-3(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Nevertheless, affording plaintiff broad latitude, <em>R. </em>4:6-2(e), we are not satisfied he has demonstrated a constitutional basis upon which to challenge the ethics grievance intake procedure established by the Supreme Court, such that we would consider declaring it invalid and compel the Committee to docket plaintiff\u2019s grievance. Nor would we entertain plaintiffs declaratory judgment request to interpret <em>RPC </em>3.4(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Plaintiff couches his arguments in terms of \u201cprocedural\u201d and \u201csubstantive due process.\u201d He concedes that, as a general matter, due process does not \u201cautomatically and in all cases\u201d require appellate review. <em>See M.L.B. v. S.L.J., </em>519 <em>U.S. </em>102, 110, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>555, 560, 136 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>473, 483 (1996) (\u201c[T]he Federal Constitution guarantees no right to appellate review____\u201d). He contends, however, that \u201c[d]ue process is violated because the \u2018hearing\u2019 afforded is not \u2018full and fair\u2019 in light of the significant matters at stake.\u201d According to plaintiff, this case \u201ccontains a procedural due process violation by virtue of the lack of a meaningful record or an appeal to counter impermissible interpretations being made at intake stage.\u201d His \u201csubstantive challenge\u201d is that the \u201clocal ethics committee is left, by the lack of procedural safeguards, to create whatever standards it sees fit to impose on a grievant and there is no way to have the declined grievance reviewed or safeguarded [in] a meaningful way to have his grievance considered.\u201d In other words, plaintiff \u201ccomplains of the inability to have declined grievances subject to some sort of appellate-type review.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Plaintiff fails to assert a constitutional infirmity existing in <em>Rule </em>1:20 \u2014 3(e)(6). He concedes that he does not have a \u201cright\u201d to prosecute the ethics violation and this case does not involve a fundamental right, such as freedom of speech. Accordingly, the standard to be applied is the \u201crational basis\u201d test. Therefore, as long as <em>Rule </em>1:20 \u2014 3(e)(6) is \u201csupported by a conceivable rational basis, it will withstand a substantive due process attack.\u201d <em>Greenberg v. Kimmelman, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>552, 563, 494 A.2d 294 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">In <em>In re Logan, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>222, 228-29, 358 A.2d 787 (1976), the Supreme Court rejected a constitutional challenge by an attorney subject to disciplinary proceedings before it following a presentment by a local ethics committee that his due process rights were violated because there were no appeals from the Court\u2019s determinations in disciplinary matters. In <em>LiVolsi, </em>the Court similarly rejected the attorney\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment due process challenge. The Court explained that the due process clause \u201cdoes not require states to provide litigants with a right to appeal adverse holdings by lower tribunals\u201d or \u201cby administrative agencies.\u201d <em>Supra, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>at 592, 428 A.2d 1268. Accordingly, the Supreme Court held that its decision to make Fee Arbitration Committee determinations non-reviewable in the courts similarly did not violate the due process clause. <em>Id. </em>at 592 and n. 16, 428 A.2d 1268 (citing <em>Logan, supra, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 228-29, 358 A.2d 787).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">We also reject plaintiffs argument that <em>Rule </em>1:20 \u2014 3(e)(6) violates equal protection principles because it allows grievants whose complaints are docketed and dismissed by the committee to appeal the committees\u2019 decisions, but not those whose complaints are declined by the secretary and never docketed.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Because plaintiff is not a member of a suspect class and there is no fundamental right being infringed upon by <em>Rule </em>1:20-3(e)(6), there need only be a rational basis supporting the difference in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>treatment between grievants whose complaints are preliminarily declined and those whose are docketed and then dismissed. <em>See LiVolsi, supra, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>at 586, 428 A.2d 1268; <em>see also Somers Assocs., Inc. v. Gloucester Twp., </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>323, 329-30, 575 A.2d 20 (App.Div.) (noting that the right of appeal is not a \u201cnecessary ingredient to due process\u201d nor a \u201cfundamental right\u201d for the purposes of equal protection analysis), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>355, 585 A.2d 366 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The disciplinary rules were the subject of significant review and modification by the Supreme Court, the body constitutionally entrusted with the authority to regulate the practice of law in New Jersey. Considering, in part, the available resources and the backlog of cases, the Supreme Court clearly had a rational basis for streamlining the disciplinary grievance intake procedure. The Court developed an efficient and expeditious method by which experienced counsel would screen and dispose of ethics complaints at an early stage that do not even allege unethical conduct, and provide \u201cappellate\u201d review, i.e. review by the Board, of only those grievances that alleged a prima facie ease of unethical conduct as defined by the <em>RPCs, </em>case law or other authority, but were not supported by the facts revealed by an investigation. Expressing the desire that the public share the Court\u2019s confidence in the integrity of the disciplinary system and be active participants, the Court also modified <em>Rule </em>1:20-3 within its wisdom and developed a procedure whereby the secretary was required to obtain a public member\u2019s concurrence to decline jurisdiction of a grievance whose facts did not constitute unethical conduct or incapacity. <em>R. </em>1:20-3(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">That plaintiff is dissatisfied with the procedure established by the disciplinary rules and the Committee\u2019s decision, or has suggestions for what he considers to be improvements to the process, does not translate into a cognizable claim in the court system. As the Committee followed the applicable rule pertaining to the processing of ethics complaints, plaintiff received all due process to which he was entitled under law. As Judge Feinberg noted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>there was a process, an opportunity for participation by plaintiff, and a result; plaintiff simply disagrees with that result. Plaintiff presented his grievance, supplemented by a brief by his attorney, which was reviewed and declined twice by the Committee\u2019s Secretary after conferring with the public member in accordance with <em>R. </em>1:20-3(e)(3) &amp; (5). Accordingly, pursuant to <em>Rule </em>1:20 \u2014 3(e)(6), the Committee\u2019s decision is final and plaintiff has no judicial recourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-12\"> District I handles grievances submitted against attorneys practicing in Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland and Salem Counties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b489-10\"><em> RPC </em>3.4(g) prohibits lawyers from presenting or threatening to \"present criminal charges to obtain an improper advantage in a civil matter.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b490-7\"> Larry Nutt, Ph.D. is a criminal justice professor at Richard Stockton College of New Jersey.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b491-14\"> <em>In re Felmeister, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>431, 471 A.2d 775 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b493-9\"> As discussed <em>infra, </em>plaintiff subsequently abandoned the last argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b496-9\"> The late Herman D.
