Plaintiff Kinderkamack Road Associates, LLC, appeals from a Law Division order affirming a resolution by defendant Mayor and Council of the Borough of Oradell (the Governing Body) rejecting plaintiff\u2019s application for a use variance. The Governing Body\u2019s resolution reversed a prior resolution by the Oradell Zoning Board of Adjustment (the Board), which granted plaintiffs application. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the Law Division\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">Because of the legislative preference for municipal land use planning by ordinance rather than variance, use variances may be granted only in exceptional circumstances. <em>E.g., Nuckel v. Borough of Little Ferry Planning Bd., </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>95, 101-02, 26 A.3d 418, 2011 <em>WL </em>2384322 (2011) (acknowledging this preference); <em>Funeral Home Mgmt., Inc. v. Basralian, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>200, 207, 725 A.2d 64 (App.Div.1999) (stating that \u201conly exceptional cases warrant use variances\u201d). Therefore, a municipal board of adjustment may permit \u201ca use or principal structure in a district restricted against such use or principal structure\u201d only where the applicant can demonstrate \u201cspecial reasons\u201d for the variance. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70(d)(1). This requirement is known as the \u201cpositive criteria.\u201d <em>New Brunswick Cellular Tel. Co. v. Borough of S. Plainfield Bd. of Adj., </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>1, 6, 733 A.2d 442 (1999). In addition, a variance application must meet the \u201cnegative criteria,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>by \u201cshowing that [the] variance can be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and will not substantially impair the intent and purpose of the zone plan and zoning ordinance.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Regarding the positive criteria, the Court has stated that \u201c \u2018special reasons\u2019 takes its definition and meaning from the general purposes of the zoning laws\u201d enumerated at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-2. <em>Burbridge v. Twp. of Mine Hill, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>376, 386, 568 A.2d 527 (1990) (citing <em>Kohl v. Mayor of Fair Lawn, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>268, 279, 234 A.2d 385 (1967)). In <em>Saddle Brook Realty, LLC v. Township of Saddle Brook Zoning Board of Adjustment, </em>388 <em>N.J.Super. </em>67, 76, 906 A.2d 454 (App.Div.2006), we observed three situations in which \u201cspecial reasons\u201d may be found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">(1) where the proposed use inherently serves the public good, such as a school, hospital or public housing facility; (2) where the property owner would suffer \u201cundue hardship\u201d if compelled to use the property in conformity with the permitted uses in the zone; and (3) where the use would serve the general welfare because the proposed site is particularly suitable for the proposed use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\">[ (Internal citations and quotation marks omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">Because most commercial uses are not inherently beneficial, <em>Medici v. BPR Co., </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>1, 18, 526 A.2d 109 (1987), they must generally rely on the particular suitability of the site or an undue hardship to the owner. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Co. v. Bd. of Adj. of Springfield, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>418, 431, 744 A.2d 1169 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">All use variance applicants must satisfy the first prong of the negative criteria, which requires proof that \u201cthe variance can be granted \u2018without substantial detriment to the public good.\u2019\u201d <em>Medici v. BPR Co., supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 22 n. 12, 526 A.2d 109. In addition, any proponent of a use that is not inherently beneficial must satisfy \u201can enhanced quality of proof\u2019 that requires \u201cclear and specific findings by the board of adjustment that the variance sought is not inconsistent with the intent and purpose of the master plan and zoning ordinance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 21, 526 A.2d 109. These findings \u201cmust reconcile the proposed use variance with the zoning ordinance\u2019s omission of the use from those permitted in the zoning district.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">In 1978 and 1988, respectively, Oradell adopted and reaffirmed the Oradell Master Plan (the Master Plan), which set forth the following goals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>1. To encourage the proper relationship between land uses by promoting spatial distribution of uses and establishing areas which have their own integrity and uniformity of purpose;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\">2. To encourage and provide buffer zones to separate incompatible land uses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">3. To preserve and enhance the primarily residential character of the existing community by restricting incompatible land uses from established residential areas and maintaining compatible residential densities in established neighborhoods;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">6. To preserve and enhance the Borough\u2019s commercial areas by defining their functional role in the Borough and enhancing the quality of life within the commercial center through an appropriate mixture of activities, in order to create a community focal point____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The Master Plan also sought to encourage \u201c[t]he elimination of incompatible land uses to ensure a consistent land use arrangement.\u201d A 2005 reexamination report confirmed these goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">Plaintiff is the owner of four lots in the Borough of Oradell (Oradell): 623 Ridgewood Avenue (Lot 9); 619 Ridgewood Avenue (Lot 10); 281 Kinderkamack Road (Lot 11); and 265 Kinderkamack Road (Lot 13). Lot 9 is located entirely within an R-4 Residential Zone, and Lots 10, 11, and 13 are in a B-1 Business Zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">In late 2007, plaintiff filed a variance application with the Board seeking \u201cto construct improvements to [Lots 9, 10, 11, and 13] to lease same to a \u2018Walgreens\u2019 pharmacy, with drive-through window facilities.\u201d Plaintiff proposed to utilize Lots 10, 11, and 13 for parking and the building itself, while transforming Lot 9 into a landscaped buffer zone with no structures, commercial or otherwise. Over the next year, the Board conducted twelve hearings, and plaintiff presented four expert witnesses: Conrad Roneati, a licensed architect; Robert Costa, a municipal engineer; Gary Dean, a traffic engineer; and Paul Phillips, an urban planner. Plaintiff also called one fact witness: James Ward, a Walgreens supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-11\">Regarding the positive criteria, Phillips testified that Lot 9 was well-suited for the proposed use because plaintiffs plan would (1) make the block consistent with the B-1/R-4 zone boundary on the other side of Ridgewood Avenue; (2) allow a \u201cmore efficient site <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>layout\u201d by expanding the buffer between the B-1 and R-4 zones; and (3) \u201celiminate a number of non-conforming conditions\u201d already existing on the lots. He also stated that the application would advance three of the stated purposes of the Municipal Land Use Law (MLUL) found at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">With regard to the negative criteria, Phillips testified that \u201cthe public good is generally the community at large as well as more specifically the immediate surroundings,\u201d and he acknowledged that the project\u2019s \u201creal potential impact [was] on Lot 8.\u201d Nevertheless, he concluded that the proposal would not be detrimental to the general welfare:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\">The real potential impact is on Lot 8. Because, indeed, it is bringing the commercial assemblage closer to that residence. And, I think ... that residence is entitled to be afforded maximum protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-8\">But, again, ... the mitigating factor here is that [Lot 9] is being used solely as a landscaped buffer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-9\">So, I think the issue to consider, in weighing impacts here, is whether that buffer, in any way, has a significant negative impact on that lot when weighed against .. the positive benefits ... of, including Lot 9 within [the commercial development] site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-10\">And, I look at it ... in terms of weighing any impact relative to the benefits. And ... I think the impacts would not l\u00e1se to the level of substantial and that would clearly [allow], in my opinion, the Board to grant the relief without causing substantial detriment to the public good.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-11\">Phillips also testified that plaintiffs application was a \u201credevelopment opportunity\u201d that was \u201cconsistent with the thinking that is espoused in the Master Plan.\u201d Although Phillips noted that the proposal would extend \u201cthe limits of the commercial development [by] one lot,\u201d he argued that it would not \u201chave any significant impact on the zone plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-12\">In addition, the Board heard expert testimony from Joseph Burgis, its planner, and John M. Packolek, its engineer. It also heard testimony from Stephen Depken, Oradell\u2019s Zoning Officer. Regarding the positive criteria, Burgis emphasized that no business activity would occur on Lot 9. Rather, \u201cthe sole use\u201d for the lot would be \u201clandscaping [to] serve as a buffer for [plaintiffs] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>non-residential use.\u201d He offered the following testimony on the negative criteria:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-6\">[W]hen we talked about the ... first prong of the negative criteria, no substantial detriment to the public good, although there [were] a lot of questions about the amount of traffic generating potential and pollution from cars and that sort of thing, those issues, unfortunately, don\u2019t ... relate at all to the issue of the parking lot and the building because all of that is in the portion of the site that\u2019s already zoned for that particular use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\">In terms of the second prong of the negative criteria, no substantial ... impairment to the intent and purpose of the zone plan[, the] zone plan talks about enhancing the landscaping amenity to the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-8\">The Master Plan talks about enhancing buffers, separating incompatible land uses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-9\">So, when you focus on the issue of use, those are the things that you should really focus on rather than some of the other things that have been discussed that relate to vehicles, traffic generating potential and the building itself and the use itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">Burgis agreed, however, that Lot 9 was only being utilized to allow a larger commercial building on Lots 10, 11, and 13:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-11\">ACTING CHAIRMAN LANG: ... So, in essence, we have an entire development of the site, which includes Lot 9, that really doesn\u2019t fit into the B-l zone. So, we\u2019re having to use Lot 9 to make it fit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-12\">MR. BURGIS: [Plaintiff] would lose 14 parking spaces and have to reduce the size of the commercial building on this lot by that amount. That\u2019s what would happen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-13\">On December 30, 2008, the Board approved plaintiffs application by a vote of five to two. It memorialized its decision and made detailed findings in a thirty-page resolution on February 17, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-14\">The Board found that \u201c[t]he utilization of Lot 9 solely as a landscaped and fenced buffer between the permitted Walgreens pharmacy use and the adjacent residential properties creates greater protection for the adjoining residential property and provides a substantial transition area between the B-l Zone and R-4 Zone.\u201d It further found that \u201cthe proposed landscaped and fenced buffer area is a less intrusive use than currently exists.\u201d The Board analyzed plaintiffs proposal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-15\">(iv) All non-buffer activity on the site is located on the portion of the Property which is entirely within the B-l Zone. The proposed commercial use is consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>with the existing developed property located to the north across from Ridgewood Avenue. The Board agrees with [Phillips] that special reasons exist and that the application satisfies the positive criteria required for [the] granting of a variance pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70(d)(1). The proposed development and consolidation of Lots 9, 10, 11, and 13 will result in the elimination of a significant number of non-conforming bulk conditions ... and will eliminate the non-conforming residential use of Lot 10 which is located entirely in the B-l Business Zone. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">Additionally, the Board is satisfied, that this configuration furthers the general welfare because it will increase open space and encourage a desirable visual environment by ensuring that no residential dwelling is too close to either the parking areas of the development or the commercial structure on the Property. The Board further finds, as stated by [Burgis], that Lot 9 could be fully landscaped as planned by a residential property owner and be a permitted use. The Board further agrees with Burgis\u2019[s] testimony that this furthers the goals of the Master Plan of enhancing buffers and separating incompatible uses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">(v) The Board also finds Mr. Phillips[\u2019s] testimony credible that the proposed development is consistent with the existing Master Plan of the Borough of Oradell in that the Master Plan recommends assembling of properties to promote aesthetically attractive and efficient use of property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-8\">(vi) Lot 9 is particularly suitable for use as a landscaped oversized buffer. The utilization of Lot 9 solely as a landscaped buffer zone, with fencing, does not constitute a substantial detriment to the public good and does not cause a substantial negative impact to the adjacent residential properties. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-10\">(vii) The Board is satisfied that the granting of this use variance to ostensibly permit a commercial use on Lot 9 does not constitute a substantial impairment of the zone plan and zoning ordinance and can be reconciled with the Borough\u2019s zoning ordinance. When the ordinance was drafted, the Oradell Council drew the zone boundary between Lot 9 and Lot 10, with the expectation that Lot 9 would be residential and Lot 10 would be commercial. It only required a 10-foot buffer between those two use categories. It did not envision that Lot 9 would be used exclusively as part of an overall development of the area, and the Board believes that were the Council to review the applicable zoning, it would countenance this type of development. In fact, if Lot 9 was not a part of the commercial property, it could be developed as a landscaped open space as of right. For that reason, the variance is more technical than substantive. The Board recognizes that while this type of reconciliation is not explicitly mentioned in <em>[Medici v. BPR Co., supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 21 n. 11, 526 A.2d 109], it is mindful that the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s reference to the new uses and changing conditions were merely two examples of how a board of a4justment could reconcile a use\u2019s omission from the ordinance. The Board finds that the ordinance\u2019s omission of this type of landscaped use is inadvertent. Therefore, the Board believes that the granting of a use variance, for use of the entire residential lot as a landscaped buffer, in effect creating a much larger buffer than is otherwise required, for a commercial development in the R-4 Zone can be reconciled with Oradell Zoning Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">The Board imposed \u201ca deed restriction limiting the use of [Lot 9] to landscaped/fenced/buffered area\u201d to ensure that plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>would never utilize it for \u201cany active commercial or other active use.\u201d In addition, it granted a number of bulk, signage, and parking variances on Lots 10, 11, and 13, finding none of them to be \u201csubstantially detrimental\u201d to Oradell and the surrounding neighborhoods. In sum, the Board found that plaintiffs proposal (1) was \u201ca better zoning alternative and [would] constitute a benefit to the community\u201d; (2) would not \u201cbe substantially detrimental to the public good\u201d; and (3) was consistent with \u201cthe purpose and intent of the zoning ordinance, master plan and the Municipal Land Use Law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Less than a week later, on February 23, 2009, defendant Citizens Action to Preserve Oradell (CAPO) appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the Governing Body as an \u201cinterested party\u201d pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. 40:55D-17(a).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Counsel for CAPO, plaintiff, and the Board appeared for oral arguments on June 10, 2009, and the Governing Body performed a full de novo review. <em>See Evesham Twp. Zoning Bd. of Adj. v. Evesham Twp. Council, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>295, 300, 430 A.2d 922 (1981) (stating that a governing body must \u201cmake a <em>de novo </em>review of the record established before the board and reach its own decision in the matter subject only to the requirement that its findings and conclusions are supported by the record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">On June 23, 2009, the Governing Body issued a resolution that reversed the Board\u2019s decision and denied plaintiffs proposal. It rejected the Board\u2019s findings and conclusions regarding Lot 9 and instead found that \u201cthe proposed use of Lot 9 [would] have the effect of allowing [plaintiff] to bring the business use, namely [plaintiffs] parking area, 10 feet closer to the adjacent residential property located at Lot 8.\u201d The Governing Body also determined that the Lot 9 buffer area \u201cwould have the effect of allowing [plaintiff] to more intensively use ... Lots 10, 11, and 13.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Neither of these results was deemed \u201cconsistent with the Master Plan and the Borough\u2019s zoning ordinances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Thus, the Governing Body found that plaintiffs application failed to satisfy either the positive or the negative criteria under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70(d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">(iv) The Governing Body is not persuaded by the expert testimony offered that special reasons exist so that the application satisfies the positive criteria for the granting of a variance pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70(d)(1). The Governing Body appreciates that a residential property owner could fully landscape a lot as a permitted use. However, an adjacent property owner to such a fully landscaped lot in either a business or residential zone could not rely upon that fully landscaped lot to satisfy setback requirements. Regardless of any deed restrictions placed on Lot 9, [plaintiffs] reliance upon Lot 9 to satisfy the B-l zone setback requirements inescapably allows [plaintiff] to intensify the permitted uses of Lots 10, 11, and 13 and brings the B-l zone closer to the R-4 residential zone. The encroachment of the B-l zone upon the balance of the residential zone does not further the goals of the Master Plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">(v) The Governing Body finds the testimony of [plaintiffs] planner Paul Phillips credible that the proposed development is consistent with the Borough\u2019s Master Plan in that the Master Plan recommends assembling of properties to promote an aesthetically attractive and efficient use of property. However, the Master Plan does not call for the assembling of properties in business and residential zones to permit a more intense development of the business zone. Therefore, the Governing Body does not find that this testimony satisfies any of [plaintiffs] burdens to show that its application satisfies the positive criteria....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">(vi) The Governing Body does not object to a fully landscaped Lot 9, but the Governing Body finds that [plaintiffs] proposed intensification of the permitted uses in the B-l zone through reliance on Lot 9 to satisfy the B-l zone\u2019s required setbacks constitutes a substantial detriment to the public good and causes a substantial negative impact to the adjacent residential properties by bringing the B-l use, namely [plaintiffs] parking area, 10 feet closer to the adjacent residential properties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-10\">(vii) Neither the Borough\u2019s Master Plan nor zoning ordinances contemplate allowing an applicant to use a residential lot to satisfy business zone setbacks, thereby allowing the applicant to intensify the development of lots in the business zone. To permit the unintended expansion of the business zone at the expense of the residential zone cannot be reconciled with the Borough\u2019s zoning ordinances and presents a substantial detriment to the public good.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">The Governing Body\u2019s resolution was published on July 9, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-12\">On August 12, 2009, plaintiff filed a complaint in lieu of prerogative writs with the Law Division seeking the reversal of the Governing Body\u2019s decision and the reinstatement of the Board\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>approval. CAPO and the Governing Body filed answers denying plaintiffs allegations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The court heard arguments from all four parties on March 26, 2010, and rendered a decision in a letter opinion dated April 5, 2010. Because \u201cit [was] undisputed that the residential home located on Lot 9 could be razed and developed into a fully landscaped lot,\u201d the court found that the proposed use was \u201csuitable\u201d and satisfied the positive criteria. Nevertheless, it determined that \u201cthe record supported] the Governing Body\u2019s conclusions as to the negative criteria.\u201d Therefore, the court concluded that \u201cthe Governing Body\u2019s decision was not made in an arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable manner\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">The Governing Body determined that Plaintiffs proposed use allowed for the commercial development to encroach into the residential zone, directly in conflict with the Master Plan. . . . While the Governing Body acknowledged that the use of Lot 9 as a landscaped buffer would create open space, it found that the proposal compromised the integrity of the Master Plan because it ultimately increased the intensity of the commercial development by encroaching into the residential zone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-10\">... [T]he Court finds that the Governing Body was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable in finding that Plaintiff had not met its burden of proving the negative criteria to warrant a reversal of the Zoning Board\u2019s grant of Plaintiffs use variance. This Court finds that the Governing Body considered the testimony of both planners and the record below in finding that Plaintiff could not demonstrate that its proposal could be met without substantial detriment to the public good and that it would not substantially impair the intent and purpose of Oradell\u2019s Master Plan and zoning ordinance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">The Law Division memorialized its decision in an order on April 20, 2010. Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal on May 28, 2010. On appeal, plaintiff argues that its proposal satisfied the positive and negative criteria; the Governing Body improperly rejected plaintiffs \u201cuncontroverted expert testimony\u201d; the trial court failed to consider several existing \u201cnon-conformities\u201d that would be eliminated by plaintiffs proposal; and \u201cthe trial court erred in affirm<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>ing the Governing Body\u2019s arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable decision.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">When reviewing a trial court order concerning a municipal action, we apply the same standard of review as the trial court. <em>D.

To hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>otherwise would effectively divest the Governing Body of its discretion by holding its legal determinations hostage to the opinions of expert witnesses. <em>See Evesham Twp. Zoning Bd. of Adj. v. Evesham Twp. Council, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 301, 430 A.2d 922 (stating that a governing body has \u201cthe right to apply its own expertise and knowledge of the community and make the final evaluation based on the record created below\u201d); <em>Med. Ctr. at Princeton v. Twp. of Princeton Zoning Bd. of Adj., </em>343 <em>N.J.Super. </em>177, 198, 778 A.2d 482 (App.Div.2001) (acknowledging the Legislature\u2019s determination that \u201clocal citizens familiar with a community\u2019s characteristics and interests are best equipped to assess the merits of variance applications\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Furthermore, we conclude from our independent examination of the record that plaintiff failed to satisfy the positive criteria by establishing Lot 9\u2019s \u201cparticular suitability\u201d for the proposed use. On this point, the facts of <em>Funeral Home Management, Inc. v. Basralian, supra, </em>are instructive. In that case, \u201cthe primary basis for the Board\u2019s finding of special reasons was its view that the site with [the proposed use] on it would be a buffer or transition between the two zones.\u201d <em>Funeral Home Mgmt., supra, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 211-12, 725 A.2d 64. Nevertheless, we found that the use variance should not have been granted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">\u201cIt can always be said that the border area of a zone is affected by the adjoining uses and that such an area is particularly adaptable to uses pursuant to a variance. However, the lines have to be drawn somewhere if a zone plan is to have any real purpose. The erosion of border areas through variances is destructive of sound zoning and cannot be allowed except where special circumstances beyond those ordinarily associated with zone borders are shown. Plaintiffs property can be put to its zoned use. It already has a dwelling on its northerly portion. Plaintiffs own expert witness testified ... that the subject property could be used for residential purposes. Moreover, the Board itself found that the property can be developed consonant with the existing zone plan. The proposal ... would undoubtedly return plaintiff a larger profit on its investment. That is not the test, however, by which a variance application should be measured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 212-13, 725 A.2d 64 (first omission in original) (quoting <em>Cerdel Constr. Co. v. Twp. Comm. of E. Hanover, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>303, 306-07, 430 A.2d 925 (1981)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">The facts here warrant a similar conclusion, and we reject plaintiffs claim that there were \u201cspecial reasons\u201d for the use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>variance. Rather than establishing Lot 9\u2019s particular suitability as a landscaped buffer zone, plaintiffs arguments regarding symmetry and efficiency suggest a basis to modify the Oradell zoning map, a remedy that is beyond the scope of this case. <em>Saddle Brook Realty, LLC v. Twp. of Saddle Brook Zoning Bd. of Adj., supra, </em>388 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 78, 906 A.2d 454 (\u201c \u2018[A] variance may not be based upon a conclusion ... that there is no factual justification for the regulation as an act of legislation.\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>Bern v. Borough of Fair Lawn, </em>65 <em>N.J.Super. </em>435, 451, 168 A.2d 52 (App.Div.1961)). Similarly, the claim that the proposed use would eliminate non-conformities does not demonstrate any particular suitability for the proposed use. Therefore, plaintiff failed to establish the positive criteria, and the Governing Body\u2019s decision was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">We also find support in the record for the Governing Body\u2019s determination that plaintiff failed to satisfy the negative criteria. Among other things, the Master Plan seeks \u201c[t]o preserve and enhance the primarily residential character of the existing community by restricting incompatible land uses from established residential areas.\u201d Plaintiffs proposal would allow a business enterprise to encroach upon a residential zone by effectively removing all the residential uses of Lot 9. Moreover, as the Governing Body observed, the proposal would move the commercial uses ten feet closer to the residence on Lot 8 and allow more intensive use of Lots 10, 11, and 13. In light of these facts, we agree with the Governing Body\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe unintended expansion of the business zone at the expense of the residential zone cannot be reconciled with the Borough\u2019s zoning ordinances and presents a substantial detriment to the public good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Plaintiffs remaining arguments are without sufficient merit to warrant further discussion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E).
