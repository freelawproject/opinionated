This case requires us to determine whether to accord that amendment retroactive effect in a case filed against the promisor\u2019s Estate prior to the effective date of the amendment on an alleged agreement enforceable when the complaint was filed. We conclude that the amendment applies prospectively and affirm the June 9, 2010 order denying the Estate\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint, which is before us on leave granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">The June 9, 2010 order also denied the Estate\u2019s motion to amend its counterclaim to include claims against plaintiff for fraud, perjury, attorneys fees and punitive damages. We affirm that ruling as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">We summarize the pertinent background from the pleadings and motion papers. In her palimony complaint, plaintiff alleged that she and Gary G. Kudriek (hereinafter decedent) first met in high school in or about 1954. They subsequently married other people, but when their respective marriages ended \u2014 decedent\u2019s in 1972 by divorce and plaintiffs by the death of her husband in 1974 \u2014 they \u201ccommenced a permanent relationship.\u201d Decedent moved into plaintiffs Howell residence in 1976, but continued to maintain his residence in Holmdel.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">Plaintiff further alleged that she and decedent lived together \u201cin a marriage-like relationship\u201d for the next eight years and in 1984 made a joint decision to sell her residence and move together into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>decedent\u2019s \u201cnewly expanded residence\u201d in Holmdel; plaintiff asserted that she invested $17,000 from the proceeds of the sale of her residence into \u201cfurnishing the Holmdel ... residence.\u201d Although they never married, plaintiff alleged that they \u201ccohabited at the Holmdel address and shared a life as if they were husband and wife[,]\u201d and \u201cpresented themselves as a couple to their family and friends, and ... were dependent on each other for love, affection, and support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">In 1995, plaintiff asserted, the parties jointly purchased a residence in Waretown; plaintiffs name was originally on the deed but in 1996 title was transferred to decedent alone, for no consideration, \u201cfor income tax purposes beneficial to [decedent].\u201d Decedent \u201cassurefd] ... plaintiff that this residence would always be hers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Plaintiff also claimed that she became dependent upon decedent for support because of his \u201csuperior financial situation,\u201d and that he \u201cpromised [her] that he would always take care of her and that in the event of his death, she would be cared for consistent with the lifestyle that they shared together.\u201d After living together in this relationship \u201cfor approximately [thirty-two] years,\u201d decedent \u201cbecame stricken with cancer,\u201d and plaintiff \u201ccared for him and tended to his needs.\u201d Shortly before decedent\u2019s death, plaintiff first learned that no provision had been made for her in his will and that his entire estate had been left to his daughter and grandchildren, \u201ccontrary to [his] prior representations to [her].\u201d Based on these allegations, plaintiff sought palimony, the transfer of title of both the Holmdel and Waretown residences to her, and other related relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The Estate filed an answer essentially denying all allegations in the complaint and asserting twelve affirmative defenses, including that \u201cplaintiff was not in a marital-type relationship with the decedent.\u201d The Estate also filed a counterclaim, alleging that plaintiff (1) made unauthorized withdrawals from a home equity line on the Waretown residence; (2) removed belongings and furnishings from the Holmdel residence, including decedent\u2019s fi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>nancial documents; and (3) refused requests to return the financial documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Various pre-trial proceedings ensued between November 2008 and March 29, 2010, when the Estate moved to dismiss the complaint based upon the amendment to the statute of frauds and to amend its counterclaim. We need not discuss those intervening proceedings. Suffice it to say the parties\u2019 respective positions on all issues are entrenched and highly adversarial.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The judge heard arguments on the motion on April 30, 2010, and rendered an oral decision from the bench on June 9, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">The judge determined as a matter of law that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:1-5(h) applied prospectively in this case for the following reasons: (1) language in the law that \u201c[t]his act shall take effect immediately\u201d indicated a legislative intent that its application be prospective; (2) our courts have \u201c \u2018long followed a general rule of statutory construction that favors prospective applications of [a] statute[,]\u2019 \u201d citing <em>Cruz v. Central Jersey Landscaping, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>33, 45, 947 A.2d 1228 (2008); (3) since plaintiffs \u201cclaim was filed long before the statute was enacted, ... this is not a claim that would be barred by the enactment of this statute\u201d; (4) \u201cit has been the law in th[is] State ... for (thirty] years ... that there is a right to support and it\u2019s found in principles of contract and those contractual rights may be either expressed or implied[,]\u201d citing <em>Kozlowski v. Kozlowski, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>378, 384, 403 A.2d 902 (1979); (5) \u201cthe Legislature cannot, without notice and an opportunity to cure, extinguish these well established rights\u201d; and (6) decedent \u201chas no ability to comply with the recently enacted statute since he is dead. Thus he can\u2019t do that which the Legislature is mandating after his death.\u201d The judge concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">the Legislature was sending a very clear message <em>for claims that are to be brought subsequent to January of 2010. </em>But for those individuals such as the plaintiff who have in good faith relied upon established case law for [thirty] years, a retroactive application would ... be a manifest injustice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">... [A]s an aside, the [c]ourt notes that an argument could be advanced on behalf of the plaintiff] ] that partial performance itself is a defense under the statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>frauds. And here [plaintiff] has clearly performed her side of the bargain she said the parties agreed upon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-5\">And the [c]ourt finds a retroactive application here was neither intended nor would result in [anything] other than a violation of plaintiffs due process rights and a manifest injustice to [plaintiff].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The judge then denied the Estate\u2019s request to amend its counterclaim, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">This is a case that\u2019s ... going on two years of age, and there\u2019s no reason to amend a[ ] ... counterclaim ... at this late stage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">... [T]he complaint of plaintiff and the facts in this case, certainly no well reasoned analysis of the case would find this to be frivolous or trivial, and there\u2019s nothing that I have found to find the plaintiff to be fraudulent in any statements so as to give rise to a cause of action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-10\">Plaintiffs complaint may not be meritorious when all of the facts are presented, and this [c]ourt is not going to prejudge the case. But I can say unequivocally based on the undisputed facts in this case, that it is not a frivolous complaint____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">On appeal, the Estate contends that the trial judge erred by (1) failing to consider the legislative and curative intent of the statute; (2) finding that retroactive application would be unconstitutional and would result in a manifest injustice to plaintiff; (3) \u201cincorrectly characterizing] the outcome\u201d if plaintiffs palimony claim was dismissed; (4) failing to apply the proper legal standards to plaintiffs palimony claim; and (5) finding that plaintiff had a \u201cpartial performance\u201d defense to the statute of frauds. The Estate also asserts that the judge incorrectly denied its motion to amend its counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">Initially, we note our standard of review. The primary question presented is whether the Legislature intended courts to apply <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:1-5(h) retroactively. <em>Cruz, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>at 42-43, 947 A.2d 1228. That is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>In re Liquidation of Integrity Ins. Co., </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>86, 94, 935 A.2d 1184 (2007). \u201cA trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts are not entitled to any special deference.\u201d <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Palimony is \u201ca claim for support between unmarried personsf,]\u201d <em>Devaney v. L\u2019Esperance, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>247, 253, 949 A.2d 743 (2008), and our courts have regarded it as a cognizable legal claim for over thirty years. <em>Kozlowski, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 384, 403 A.2d 902. A palimony obligation has even been held enforceable against the estate of the promisor. <em>In re Estate of Roccamonte, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>381, 395-97, 808 A.2d 838 (2002). The operative principle of a palimony claim is that \u201cthe formation of a marital-type relationship between unmarried persons may, legitimately and enforceably, rest upon a promise by one to support the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 392, 808 A.2d 838. \u201c[T]he entry into La marital-type] relationship and then conducting oneself in accordance with its unique character is consideration\u201d warranting enforcement of a promise of support. <em>Id. </em>at 393, 808 A.2d 838. Such a promise, whether \u201cexpress or implied,\u201d if \u201ccoupled with a marital-type relationship ... supports] a valid claim for palimony.\u201d <em>Devaney, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>at 258, 949 A.2d 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Until January 2010, our statutes were silent on the subject of palimony. This amendment to the statute of frauds thus represents the first, and only, legislative action with respect to the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">To discern the Legislature\u2019s intent courts \u201clook first to the plain language of the amendment\u201d and if the language is not clear to other \u201cinterpretative aids\u201d such as legislative history. <em>Cruz, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>at 43, 947 A.2d 1228. The statute of frauds identifies various \u201cagreements [and] promises\u201d upon which \u201c[n]o action shall be brought ... unless the agreement or promise, ... or some memorandum or note thereof, shall be in writing, and signed by the party to be charged therewith, or by some other person thereunto by him lawfully authorized.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:1-5. The 2010 amendment adds the following to the statute\u2019s purview:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqd\">h. A promise by one party to a non-marital personal relationship to provide support or other consideration for the other party, either during the course of such relationship or after its termination. For the purposes of this subsection, no such written promise is binding unless it was made with the independent advice of counsel for both parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>25:1-5(h).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The law states that it \u201cshall take effect immediately.\u201d <em>L. </em>2009, c. 311, \u00a7 2. That language provides \u201cno clear indication\u201d as to whether the Legislature intended the amendment \u201cto apply to claims that were pending on the date of its enactment.\u201d <em>Bunk v. Port Auth, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>176, 194, 676 A.2d 118 (1996). The legislative history explains that the amendment is \u201cintended to overturn recent \u2018palimony\u2019 decisions by New Jersey courts,\u201d specifically referring to <em>Devaney, Roccamonte </em>and <em>Kozlowski. Senate Judiciary Committee, Statement to S.2091 </em>(February 9, 2009). That statement is equally unclear as to the date on which the Legislature intended to bar actions based on oral palimony agreements. The only indication of intention with respect to prospective versus retrospective application is the suggestion implicit in the language of the statute amended, which provides no \u201caction shall be brought\u201d and does not purport to address pending actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Absent a clear indication of legislative intent, our courts \u201c \u2018have long followed a general rule of statutory construction that favors prospective application of statutes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cruz, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>at 45, 947 A.2d 1228 (quoting <em>Gibbons v. Gibbons, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>515, 521, 432 A.2d 80 (1981) (footnote omitted)). A statute will be given retroactive effect only (1) where the Legislature has declared such an intent, either explicitly or implicitly, (2) when an amendment is curative, or (3) \u201cwhen the expectations of the parties so warrant.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Gibbons, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 522-23, 432 A.2d 80). As noted above, there is no indication of legislative intention favoring retroactive application. Accordingly, we turn to consider whether the second or third conditions favoring retroactive application apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">With respect to the reasonable expectations of the parties, where, as here, an amendment is enacted to a statute that mandates that \u201c[n]o action shall be brought\u201d unless certain conditions are satisfied, we have determined that the critical factor in the \u201cprospective/retroactive application\u201d inquiry is whether the parties could have expected and, therefore, complied with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>conditions. In <em>Serrano v. Gibson, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>314, 318-20, 700 A.2d 390 (App.Div.1997), we addressed the retroactivity of a 1994 amendment to the Tort Claims Act that expanded a plaintiff\u2019s obligation to present the public entity with a notice of claim within ninety days of the accrual of a the cause of action to include claims against public employees. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-3; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-8(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The legislative history explained that the amendment was \u201cintended to reverse\u201d the holding in <em>Chatman v. Hall, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>394, 419-20, 608 A.2d 263 (1992), in which \u201cthe Supreme Court reaffirmed that the ninety-day notice requirement of the ... Act was not applicable to claims against public employees.\u201d <em>Serrano, supra, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 315, 700 A.2d 390.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">Relevant to the parties\u2019 reasonable expectations, we found not only at the time of the accident, but during the critical subsequent ninety-day period, the notice obligations of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-3 and ... -8, which now must be met during that t\u00edme period as to public employees, did not exist. PlaintiffI ] could not have known [she] could lose [her] then viable cause of action ... by not complying with the notice provisions that would be triggered by subsequent legislation. <em>[Id. </em>at 318, 700 A.2d 390.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Relying on those facts, we concluded that the parties\u2019 reasonable expectations did not warrant retroactive application. We reasoned that under the law in effect at the time of the injury, the public employee \u201ccould not have had a reasonable expectation of that the ninety-day notice could be relied upon\u201d and the plaintiffs \u201ccould not have anticipated that their cause of action would be lost through noncompliance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319, 700 A.2d 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">The same is true here, in this action on a palimony agreement. With respect to contracts and agreements, the parties\u2019 relevant expectations are generally those they had at the time of the agreement. <em>See </em>73 <em>Am.Jur.2d Statute of Frauds </em>\u00a7 429 (2010) (noting that prospective application of the statute of frauds is favored because of constitutional restrictions on impairment of contractual rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">In this ease, (1) decedent, the putative palimony promisor, died almost one-and-a-half years before the effective date of the statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>tory amendment, and (2) plaintiff filed her complaint shortly after his death and about more than a year before the statute was amended. As the trial judge noted, and to restate the obvious, decedent was singularly unable to comply with the new requirements. More importantly, prior to this amendment and at the time of their agreement, case law supported a mutual expectation that their agreement was enforceable without regard to a writing executed after consultation with an attorney. Neither plaintiff nor decedent could reasonably have anticipated the prerequisites to enforcement of a palimony promise during the time when they were in a position to create such a document.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">We cannot agree with the Estate that this amendment should be given retroactive effect as \u201ccurative or ameliorative.\u201d \u201cUnder the curative exception to prospective applicability, a new law is given retroactive effect \u2018if it is designed merely to carry out or explain the intent of the original statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Serrano, supra, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 319, 700 A.2d 390 (quoting <em>Nelson v. Board of Educ., </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>358, 370, 689 A.2d 1342 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Affording a statutory amendment retroactive effect based upon its curative intent is appropriate where the \u201ccure\u201d is addressed to prior legislation, not to the decisions of our courts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">The \u201ccurative\u201d exception comes into play when a statute amends a previous law which is unclear or which does not effectuate the actual intent of the Legislature in adopting <em>the original act. </em>The purpose of a curative amendment is merely to remedy a perceived imperfection in or misapplication of <em>a statute. </em>The amendment explains or clarifies existing law and brings it into harmony with <em>wlmt the Legislature originally intended.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\"><em>[In re D.C., </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>31, 51, 679 A.2d 634 (1996) (internal quotations omitted) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Insofar as the bill was \u201cintended to overturn ... [the] palimony decisions [in <em>Devaney, Roccamonte </em>and <em>Kozlowski </em>] by requiring that any such contract must be in writing and signed by the person making the promise,\u201d <em>Committee Statement to S. </em>2091, it was not to rectify or clarify statutory law but to overturn case law. <em>See Serrano, supra, </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 319, 714 A.2d 970 (noting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>that the Legislature\u2019s intent to \u201creverse\u201d a decision of the Supreme Court was neither \u201cameliorative or curative\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Until the January 2010 enactment of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:1-5(h), no statute addressed palimony claims. Rather, as noted, such claims were recognized by our courts as a matter of contract law. <em>Kozlowski, supra, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>at 384, 403 A.2d 902. \u201c[B]y definition, an amendment intended as a derogation of the common law cannot be said to \u2018cure\u2019 a judicial misapprehension of a legislative act.\u201d <em>Olkusz v. Brown, </em>401 <em>N.J.Super. </em>496, 504, 951 A.2d 1069 (App.Div.2008). A new statute will not be deemed \u201ccurative\u201d simply because the legislative history of that statute reflects disapproval of a contractual provision previously found permissible by our courts based upon common law contract principles. <em>Id. </em>at 503-04, 951 A.2d 1069.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">We turn to the Estate\u2019s contention that plaintiff would still have a viable cause of action for partition of the contested real property if her palimony claim were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">\u201c[P]ersons who have engaged in a joint venture to purchase property in which they reside, are entitled to seek a partition\u201d when \u201ctheir joint enterprise comes to an end ... irrespective of how title is formally held.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Oksienik, </em>380 <em>N.J.Super. </em>119, 127, 880 A.2d 1194 (App.Div.2005) (internal citations omitted). \u201cAmong the remedies available on partition\u2014 where other modes of relief are not practical \u2014 is a forced sale of the property and division of the net proceeds between the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128, 880 A.2d 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">However, where an agreement exists between an unmarried couple giving one party \u201ca continued right to occupy ... the jointly-owned home,\u201d \u201ca partition by way of sale to third parties is not an appropriate remedy.\u201d <em>Olson v. Stevens, </em>322 <em>N.J.Super. </em>119, 123, 730 A.2d 432 (App.Div.1999). \u201cAgreements about property jointly held by cohabitants are material in actions concerning its division\u201d and \u201cmay be specifically enforced when that remedy is appropriate.\u201d <em>Houseman v.

Therefore, \u201c[a]s a matter of judicial economy, all issues between the parties should be resolved in [one proceeding], including disputes over entitlement to property, as long as actual notice is provided as to the specific relief sought.\u201d <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>380 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 131, 880 A.2d 1194. The Estate\u2019s position runs counter to these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">As we have determined that retroactive application of the 2010 amendment to the statute of frauds is inappropriate in this case, we need not address the remaining issues raised by the Estate. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">We find no error in the judge\u2019s observation that plaintiff may have a \u201cpartial performance ... defense under the statute of frauds,\u201d which the judge \u201cnote[d]\u201d as \u201can aside,\u201d in his decision. We are satisfied this \u201cnote[ ]\u201d by the judge is immaterial to his ultimate conclusion that the amendment to the statute would not apply retroactively. Moreover, the judge alluded to the parties\u2019 agreement as one that \u201c[plaintiff] said the parties agreed upon[,]\u201d thereby recognizing that further proofs on the issue were necessary. Clearly, this comment has no relevance to the issues presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Finally, we affirm the denial of the Estate\u2019s request to amend its counterclaim for the reasons stated by the judge in his bench decision, which are \u201cbased on findings of fact, adequately supported by [the] evidence.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:11 \u2014 3(e)(1)(A).
