The Act provides for,</p>\n<p id=\"b298-14\">among other remedies, a \u201c[p]rivate right of action\u201d and fixes the damages for each violation at $500 or actual damages, whichever is greater. 47 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 227(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>The narrow issue raised on this appeal is whether a plaintiff may maintain a class action to enforce the private cause of action. On defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e) and <em>Rule </em>4:6-3, the motion judge concluded that no class action could be brought and dismissed all class action claims as well as a separate claim for conversion. Thereafter, judgment was entered in plaintiffs favor for the $500 statutory damages. We affirm and conclude that plaintiff may not maintain a class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The facts are not complex. According to plaintiff Local Baking Products, Inc., on May 19, 2006, it received an unsolicited one-page fax in its fax machine from defendant Kosher Bagel Munch, Inc., touting the services of defendant, a local restaurant in Passaic. Apparently, defendant had hired an entity known as Business to Business Solutions to transmit a \u201cblast fax,\u201d advertising defendant\u2019s food services to approximately 4649<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> fax machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">In response, plaintiff filed a complaint under the TCPA on its behalf and on behalf of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">All persons who (1) on or after four years prior to the filing of this action, (2) were sent telephone facsimile messages of material advertising the commercial availability of any property, goods, or services by or on behalf of Defendant, (3) with respect to whom Defendant did not have prior express permission or invitation for the sending of such faxes, and (4) with whom Defendant did not have an established business relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Defendant thereafter moved to dismiss the class action allegations for failure to state a cause of action. The motion judge concluded that a class action could not be maintained under the TCPA. She dismissed the class action allegations as well as the claim for conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>On appeal, plaintiff asserts that the judge erred in dismissing the complaint\u2019s class allegations. It claims that New Jersey authorities support a class action under the TCPA, and the TCPA does not expressly preclude class actions. Finally, it claims that the judge erroneously dismissed plaintiffs conversion claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">In response, defendant claims that the complaint, on its face, does not support a class action. Specifically, it alludes to typicality and superiority as appropriate bases for denying relief. It also argues that the judge properly dismissed the conversion cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The motion judge relied on two unreported opinions that had previously held that no class action could be maintained under the TCPA She noted that in one instance, no certifiable class had been identified even after full discovery. The judge concluded that New Jersey\u2019s easily accessible small claims courts, the expressed statutory intent, the minimal harm involved, and the relatively high statutory damages supported the view that individual claims were \u201ca far superior method to vindication of any rights and protection of the public than any certification or class action.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>4:32-1(b)(3). Finally, she indicated that because she ruled \u201con a substantive level\u201d and not on \u201cprocedural [grounds] that could be fixed later on,\u201d all class claims were dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">In addressing the issues involved, we first consider the provisions of the Act. In 1991, Congress enacted the TCPA, providing, among other things, federally recognized relief from unwanted commercial advertising solicitations by means of telephone facsimile (fax) machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The provisions of the TCPA are not complex. As we previously noted, section 227(b)(1)(C) makes it unlawful for any person within the United States \u201cto use any telephone facsimile machine, computer, or other device to send, to a telephone facsimile machine, an unsolicited advertisement____\u201d The Act also provides three exceptions: (1) if a prior business relationship exists between the parties; (2) if the recipient voluntarily makes its fax number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>available for \u201cpublic distribution\u201d; or (3) if the advertisement contains a notice informing the recipient of the ability and means to avoid future unsolicited advertisements. 47 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 227(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">An unsolicited advertisement is defined as \u201cany material advertising the commercial availability or quality of any property, goods, or services which is transmitted to any person without that person\u2019s express invitation or permission, in writing or otherwise.\u201d 47 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 227(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The TCPA provides three avenues for enforcement: (1) regulatory and court action by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for violation of regulations promulgated under the Act, 47 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 227(b)(2); (2) civil action by the Attorney General of a state, or an official or agency designated by a state, on behalf of its residents, to recover for the greater of actual monetary loss or $500 for each violation, trebled in the court\u2019s discretion for willful or knowing violations, 47 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 227(g); (3) a private action brought by a private person or entity, not in federal court but if \u201cotherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State,\u201d in an \u201cappropriate court of that State\u201d for injunctive relief and for recovery of the greater of actual monetary loss or $500 in damages for each violation, 47 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 227(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">The private action remedy, which is the focus of this appeal, was incorporated in a late amendment to Senate Bill S. 1462, with the purpose of permitting, in states willing to allow such actions, a consumer to appear without an attorney in a small claims court to recover not merely actual damages but a minimum of $500 for each violation. <em>See Int\u2019l Sci. &amp; Tech. Inst. v. Inacom Commc\u2019ns, Inc., </em>106 F.3d 1146, 1152-53 (4th Cir.1997). The drafters recognized that damages from a single violation would ordinarily amount to only a few pennies worth of ink and paper usage, and so believed that the $500 minimum damage award would be sufficient to motivate private redress of a consumer\u2019s grievance through a relatively simple small claims court proceeding, without an attorney. <em>See </em>137 <em>Cong. Rec. </em>S16205-06 (daily ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Nov. 7, 1991) (statement of Sen. Hollings) (\u201c[I]t would defeat the purposes of the bill if the attorneys\u2019 costs to consumers of bringing an action were greater than the potential damages.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Here, plaintiff seeks to pursue the private action remedy not simply on its own behalf, but as a class action. Class action certification is governed by <em>Rule </em>4:32-1. That <em>Rule </em>includes both general, <em>Rule </em>4:32-1(a), and specific, <em>see Rule </em>4:32 \u2014 1(b), requirements. <em>Iliadis v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>88, 106, 922 A.2d 710 (2007). Class certification is appropriate only if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. [R. 4:32 \u2014 1(a).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The issues in this case are whether the proposed class raises \u201cquestions of law or fact common to the members of the class [that] predominate over any questions affecting only individual members [ (commonality and predomination) ], and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy [ (superiority) ].\u201d <em>R. </em>4:32-1(b)(3). The analysis must be \u201crigorous\u201d and \u201clook beyond the pleadings to understand the claims, defenses, relevant facts, and applicable substantive law.\u201d <em>Iliadis, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 106-07, 922 A.2d 710 (internal quotations and alterations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">The factors pertinent to the findings include: (A) the interest of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class; (C) the desirability or undesirability in concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and (D) the difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\"><em>[R. </em>4:32 \u2014 1 (b) (3).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Defendant argues that the motion judge\u2019s decision was contrary to our holding in <em>United Consumer Financial Services Co. v. Carbo, </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>280, 982 A.2d 7 (App.Div.2009). In <em>Carbo, </em>we considered whether the superiority requirement is fulfilled when \u201cthe common, typical and predominant claim of the class members is a statutory violation for which a statutory civil penalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>will be awarded____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 308, 982 A.2d 7. The statute at issue was \u201cthe Truth-in-Consumer Contract, Warranty and Notice Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-14 to -18.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 292, 982 A.2d 7. The trial judge had certified a class of 16,845 individuals and awarded each the statutory penalty of $100. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">In upholding the award, we considered a prior TCPA decision, which concluded that \u201cthe individual claims, which required proof that the defendant transmitted an advertisement without the individual recipient\u2019s \u2018prior express invitation or permission,\u2019 did not have the \u2018common nucleus of operative facts\u2019 required for a class action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 308, 982 A.2d 7 (quoting <em>Forman v. Data Transfer, </em>164 <em>F.R.D. </em>400, 402-05 (E.D.Pa.1995)). We did not dispute the holding in <em>Forman </em>but took issue with the view that the \u201cauthorization of a class action where statutory civil penalties available to many individuals could be aggregated \u2018would be inconsistent with the specific and personal remedy provided by Congress to address the minor nuisance of unsolicited facsimile advertisements.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Forman, supra, </em>164 <em>F.R.D. </em>at 405). <em>Forman </em>was unpersuasive because problems with \u201cenormous awards\u201d which were \u201cbased upon aggregation of individual statutory civil penalties should be addressed as a question of excessive damages at the time the penalty is fixed, not at the time of class certification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309, 982 A.2d 7 (citing <em>Parker v. Time Warner Entm\u2019t Co., L.P., </em>331 F.3d 13, 22 (2d Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Defendant argues that \u201c[t]he Superior Court\u2019s reasoning was indistinguishable from the defendants\u2019 argument that was rejected in <em>Carbo.\u201d </em>We disagree. <em>Carbo </em>rejected the out-of-hand denial of class certification \u201cbased on the potential for a large award based upon aggregated civil penalties.\u201d <em>Carbo, supra, </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 309, 982 A.2d 7 (citing <em>Murray v. GMAC Mortgage Corp., </em>434 <em>F.3d </em>948, 953 (7th Cir.2006)). This narrow ruling is distinguishable from the superiority concerns addressed by the motion judge. A superiority analysis \u201cnecessarily implies a comparison with alternative procedures, and mandates assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of using the class-action device <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>in relation to other methods of litigation.\u201d <em>Iliadis, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 114, 922 A.2d 710 (internal citations and quotations omitted) (citing <em>In re Cadillac, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>412, 436, 461 A.2d 736 (1983)). The trial judge did just that, noting that a plaintiff simply must \u201ccome to the small claims court, file your complaint, have your $500, you don\u2019t need an attorney; ... that\u2019s a far superior method of vindication ... than any certification or class action.\u201d This view reflected the view of Senator Hollings, the sponsor of the TCPA The trial judge\u2019s recognition of the viability of individual claims as compared to a class action was not only proper but required, and such analysis does not bespeak a generalized policy against large awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">While no New Jersey case has been reported on the issue,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the issue of TCPA class actions has been the subject of reported decisions in other jurisdictions. A survey of these cases reveals a lack of uniformity as to approach and result.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Seven states have reported decisions<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> allowing class certification for TCPA claims: Arizona, California, Florida, Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Oklahoma. <em>See ESI Ergonomic Solu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number><em>tions, LLC v.

Class actions are generally appropriate where individual plaintiffs have \u201csmall claims\u201d which \u201care, in isolation, too small ... to warrant recourse to litigation----\u201d <em>Iliadis, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 104, 922 A.2d 710 (internal quotation marks omitted). In such instances, \u201cthe class-action device equalizes the claimants\u2019 ability to zealously advocate their positions.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>That equalization principle remedies the incentive problem facing litigants who seek only a small recovery. \u201cIn short, the class action\u2019s equalization function opens the courthouse doors for those who cannot enter alone.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">Here, by imposing a statutory award of $500, a sum considerably in excess of any real or sustained damages, Congress has presented an aggrieved party with an incentive to act in his or her own interest without the necessity of class action relief. As the motion judge observed, \u201cthe nature of the harm ... as near as I can tell, is about two cents worth of paper and maybe a little ink and toner.\u201d The judge also noted that in New Jersey, \u201cpro se individuals and consumers [are] allowed to file a small claims complaint, [and] they do not need a lawyer. They are quickly before a Judge. I believe at the present time the standard is 30 to 45 days. An answer doesn\u2019t even have to be filed.\u201d The combination of the TCPA\u2019s design and New Jersey\u2019s procedures suggests that the benefit of a class action has been conferred on a litigant by the very nature of the procedures employed and relief ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>tained. The cost of litigating for an individual is significantly less than the potential recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Ultimately, we note that the same facts required to prevail on an individual TCPA claim \u2014 an unsolicited fax was received from a sender with whom the recipient had no prior business relationship \u2014 are identical to the facts that would have to be proven to merely identify a single class member. <em>See Kenro, supra, </em>962 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 1169. We discern no superiority in such a situation. In sum, the class action cannot meet the superiority test and is inappropriate here.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Finally, plaintiff appeals from the dismissal of its conversion claim based, in part, on the cost of the paper and ink used to receive the unsolicited fax.
