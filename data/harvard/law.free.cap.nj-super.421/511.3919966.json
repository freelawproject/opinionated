He was sentenced to an extended term of seven years\u2019 imprisonment. He appeals, alleging trial errors and an excessive sentence. Because of two trial errors that prejudiced defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, we reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The charges arose from the July 2006 shooting death of Michael Newkirk on a street in Newark. In May 2007, an Essex County grand jury returned an indictment charging defendant with first-degree murder, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3(a)(1) or (2) (count one); third-degree unlawful possession of a handgun without a permit, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5b (count two); and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4a (count three).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">At the trial in May and June 2008, the prosecution presented the following evidence. At approximately 2:50 a.m. on July 9, 2006, a witness was driving on South 9th Street towards 13th Avenue in Newark when she heard a gunshot. She looked up and down 13th Avenue to determine where the shot came from, and she saw three men running in her direction. One of the men \u201chad a little lead\u201d on the other two men. One of the men behind caught up to and kicked the lead man\u2019s leg, causing him to fall down. Someone said \u201cI got you now,\u201d while the man on the ground was yelling \u201cno, no, don\u2019t.\u201d The witness \u201csaw some sparks\u201d and heard two gunshots. Although she knew a shooting had just occurred, she did not see a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The witness drove away and called 911. She then drove back to the area of 7th Street and 13th Avenue and saw the two men involved in the shooting walking down the street in front of her. She recognized the shooter as the man who had a \u201clong length of dreads.\u201d The other man had close cut hair. The witness went to the police station that night to give a statement. She described the suspects as black males, both about 5'7\" or 5'8\" in height, wearing white T-shirts. Approximately two months later, the witness was shown a photo array, and she selected defendant\u2019s picture, identifying him as the shooter. She also identified defendant at trial as the man who fired the shots.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Detective Keith Sheppard of the Newark Police Department was assigned to investigate Newkirk\u2019s murder. In the course of his investigation, Sheppard brought in a seventeen-year-old juvenile for questioning. On September 7, 2006, two months after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>shooting, the juvenile signed a written statement indicating he had witnessed the shooting of Newkirk, whom he referred to as \u201cthe Crip dude.\u201d In the statement, he identified defendant as the shooter. He also selected defendant\u2019s photo from an array prepared by the detective. He knew defendant on the street by the name \u201cSnap.\u201d The juvenile said, however, that at the time of the incident, \u201cSnap\u201d was wearing \u201ca gold thermal, long sleeve, blue jeans, construction Timberland boots.\u201d At the time of the shooting, the juvenile was wearing a white T-shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">At trial in May 2008, the juvenile, now an adult, testified that he was a witness to the shooting but did not see who killed Newkirk. He further testified that Detective Sheppard demanded the juvenile \u201cgive him Snap,\u201d and he only gave the statement implicating defendant so that Sheppard would \u201cstop hitting [him] so [he] could go home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Defendant elected not to testify and did not present any witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">The jury acquitted defendant of murder and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, but convicted him of possession of a handgun without a permit. Because of defendant\u2019s extensive prior record, the court granted the prosecution\u2019s motion for a discretionary extended term sentence under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3a and sentenced him within the second-degree range to seven years\u2019 imprisonment, in addition to statutory money penalties. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">On appeal, defendant contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-10\">\n<em>POINT i</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-11\">THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S INSTRUCTIONS AND THE PROSECUTOR\u2019S COMMENTS DURING SUMMATION THAT THE STATE WAS PRECLUDED FROM ASKING DET. SHEPPARD ABOUT HOW HE LINKED SNAP TO THE SHOOTING ERRONEOUSLY CIRCUMVENTED THE LIMITATIONS OUTLINED IN <em>STATE V. BANKSTON, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>263 [307 A.2d 65] (1973) AND <em>STATE </em>V <em>BRANCH, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>338 [865 A.2d 673] (2005), AND DEPRIVED MR. JOHNSON OF HIS RIGHTS TO CONFRONTATION AND DUE PROCESS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-16\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>MR. JOHNSON WAS DEPRIVED OF HIS RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL BECAUSE THE STATE INTRODUCED A PRIOR INCONSISTENT STATEMENT OF ITS OWN WITNESS WITHOUT SATISFYING THE REQUIREMENTS OF <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(a)(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">\n<em>POINT III</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS CASE, WHERE THE JURY ERRONEOUSLY HEARD THAT MR. JOHNSON WAS INVOLVED IN THE SHOOTING, THE TESTIMONY BY DET. SHEPPARD THAT HE HAD MR. JOHNSON\u2019S PHOTOGRAPH IN A \u201cMUG MASTER\u201d DATABASE FURTHER IMPLICATED MR. JOHNSON AS A CRIMINAL BASED ON FACTS OUTSIDE OF THE EVIDENCE ADDUCED AT TRIAL AND DEPRIVED MR. JOHNSON OF A FAIR TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">\n<em>POINT IV</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY IMPOSING A MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE SENTENCE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">We find merit in Points I and III and conclude that the errors were prejudicial to a fan trial. We reverse defendant\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">Before proceeding to the meritorious points raised by-defendant, we comment briefly on his other point of trial error. In Point II, defendant contends he was prejudiced when the court admitted in evidence the juvenile\u2019s written statement, which was contrary to his trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\"><em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(a)(1) provides for the admission of a prior inconsistent statement of a witness but restricts the circumstances under which such a statement may be offered by the party that called the witness to testify. The rule states that a prior inconsistent statement is admissible when offered by the party who called the witness only if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-13\">it (A) is contained in a sound recording or in a wilting made or signed by the witness in circumstances establishing its reliability or (B) was given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial or other judicial, quasi-judicial, legislative, administrative or grand jury proceeding, or in a deposition!]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">Here, the juvenile was the State\u2019s witness. His prior inconsistent statement to police was not given under oath. Therefore, the State was required to demonstrate \u201ccircumstances establishing its reliability.\u201d <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>803(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Before the juvenile was called to testify, the court held a hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine the reliability of his statement. Reviewing the evidence in light of the factors set forth in <em>State v. Gross, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>1, 10, 577 A.2d 806 (1990), the court concluded in a detailed oral decision that the statement was reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">On appeal, defendant challenges the court\u2019s findings on the <em>Gross </em>factors and argues the State failed to establish the reliability of the prior statement. In particular, defendant contends the juvenile was coerced by police into making the statement and may have been impaired because he smoked marijuana earlier in the day before giving the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The evidence before the court was largely testimonial. In concluding that the statement was reliable and therefore admissible, the court made credibility findings in favor of the State\u2019s witnesses and against the juvenile\u2019s version of events at the time of trial. Those findings are entitled to deference. <em>State v. Locurto, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>463, 474, 724 A.2d 234 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">We find no error in the admission of the juvenile\u2019s prior inconsistent statement under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Defendant argues prejudicial violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s directives regarding police testimony as set forth in <em>State v. Bankston, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>263, 307 A.2d 65 (1973), and <em>State v. Branch, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>338, 865 A.2d 673 (2005). He contends \u201cthe trial court\u2019s instructions and the prosecutor\u2019s comments during summation that the State was precluded from asking Detective Sheppard about how he linked Snap to the shooting erroneously circumvented the limitations outlined in <em>[Bankston </em>and <em>Branch </em>], and deprived [him] of his rights to confrontation and due process.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">Prior to trial, defendant unsuccessfully moved for discovery of the identity of the informant that led police to question the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>juvenile about the shooting. After the juvenile testified that Detective Sheppard physically assaulted him to \u201cgive up Snap,\u201d the prosecution asked the court to instruct the jury that it was precluded under the rules of evidence from asking Sheppard what information he had obtained leading him to use defendant\u2019s picture in the photo array. The court ruled it would give the jury such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The prosecutor then made the following remarks in summation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFV\">By the way, you\u2019re going to hear from the Judge I was not permitted under our Rules of Evidence to ask Keith Sheppard what he knew, what information he had before he put the photo display together. Under our case law that\u2019s not allowed for the Prosecutor to do that. But it is allowed for [defense counsel], if she chooses to, to ask those questions. And in this case she did. And, of course, he knew he had information. Why would you put six photos together logically? Why would you ever put six photos together for someone to look at if you didn\u2019t have some idea who you were looking for? You just going to take six photos randomly from the computer and just show them to somebody? Of course not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Subsequently, over defendant\u2019s objection, the court gave the jury the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">Due to limitations of the Rules of Evidence, the State was not allowed to ask on direct examination questions as to what, if anything, Detective Sheppard told [the juvenile] about his information relating to the identity of the shooter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">In <em>Bankston, supra, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>at 268, 307 <em>A.2d </em>65, the Court stated: \u201cIt is well-settled that the hearsay rule is not violated when a police officer explains the reason he approached a suspect or went to the scene of the crime by stating that he did so \u2018upon information received.\u2019 \u201d However, \u201c[wjhen the logical implication to be drawn from [the witness\u2019s] testimony leads the jury to believe that a non-testifying witness has given the police evidence of the accused\u2019s guilt, the testimony should be disallowed as hearsay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271, 307 A.2d 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">In <em>Branch, supra, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>338, 865 A.2d 673, the Court considered the holding of <em>Bankston </em>in the context of testimony regarding photo arrays. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-10\">Why the officer placed the defendant\u2019s photograph in the array is of no relevance to the identification process and is highly prejudicial. For that reason, we disapprove of a police officer testifying that he placed a defendant\u2019s picture in a photographic array \u201cupon information received.\u201d Even such seemingly neutral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>language, by inference, has the capacity to sweep in inadmissible hearsay. It implies that the police officer has information suggestive of the defendant\u2019s guilt from some unknown source.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 352, 865 A.2d 673.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The Court recognized an exception, however, for \u201cinvited error\u201d by the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-8\">The exception would be the defendant who opens the door by flagrantly and falsely suggesting that a police officer acted arbitrarily or with ill motive. In such a circumstance, the officer might be permitted to dispel that false impression, despite the invited prejudice the defendant would suffer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-9\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">Here, the jury charge and the prosecutor\u2019s summation remarks violated <em>Bankston </em>and <em>Branch </em>because they implied that the State had additional information about defendant\u2019s guilt from an undisclosed source. That this inference was created by the prosecutor\u2019s summation and the court\u2019s instruction to the jury, rather than a police officer\u2019s testimony, makes it no less prejudicial. The prosecution could not circumvent the holdings of <em>Bankston </em>and <em>Branch </em>by suggesting to the jury information it could not have elicited directly from Detective Sheppard.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">The State argues that the doctrine of invited error should excuse the reference because defense counsel \u201copened the door\u201d when she argued to the jury that Sheppard \u201cboth wanted and forced [the juvenile] to finger Snap.\u201d In particular, the State focuses on defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the juvenile, during which she elicited testimony that Sheppard told him \u201cSnap\u201d was involved and demanded he \u201cgive him Snap.\u201d However, the juvenile had already testified on direct examination that he was physically assaulted by Sheppard before giving the statement. Defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination did not \u201cflagrantly and falsely suggest,\u201d without any basis in the evidence, that the police had acted arbitrarily in choosing defendant as the person to be charged with these crimes. <em>See Branch, supra, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>at 352, 865 A.2d 673. Rather, the direct testimony of the State\u2019s own witness suggested the possibility that the police procured a false identification of defendant, and defense counsel simply followed up on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Moreover, even if we were to apply the doctrine of invited error, the prosecutor\u2019s argument in summation went beyond appropriate rebuttal. By arguing that Sheppard \u201cknew he had information\u201d about defendant\u2019s potential involvement in the crime before questioning the juvenile, the prosecutor improperly suggested that the State had additional evidence about defendant\u2019s guilt that was not presented to the jury. <em>See Branch, supra, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>at 352, 865 A.2d 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The clear violation of the hearsay prohibition set forth in <em>Bankston </em>and <em>Branch </em>entitles defendant to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Defendant also argues he was prejudiced when Detective Sheppard testified that he obtained his picture for the photo array from a \u201cMug Master\u201d database.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">The prosecutor was aware that reference to \u201cmug shots\u201d must be avoided by police witnesses, but apparently Detective Sheppard was not. During direct examination of Sheppard, the prosecutor went to sidebar seeking permission to ask leading questions regarding how the photo array was assembled. Specifically, he wanted to elicit testimony from Sheppard that the female witness to the shooting was shown six separate photos, rather than all the photos being placed together. He asked for \u201ca little latitude\u201d to avoid Sheppard making reference to a mug shot database. Even though the witness had previously been instructed to avoid such a reference, the prosecutor wanted to \u201cexercise an abundance of caution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Despite the caution discussed at sidebar, the prosecutor\u2019s questioning led Detective Sheppard to prejudicial testimony as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-Y\">Q. Detective, in preparing the photo displays am I correct that you go to a database that you have in your office where you can, on a computer, pull up the photographs? Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-12\">A. Yes. That\u2019s called the Mug Master.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-13\">Q. And is that what you did in this case; you pulled up photos from a database?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-14\">A. That is correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Defendant did not object to this testimony or ask for a curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\u201c[W]hen a defendant does not testify, the State cannot, in the ordinary circumstance, refer to his criminal record.\u201d <em>State v. Taplin, </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>95, 99, 552 A.2d 1015 (App.Div.1988). \u201cIf proof is nevertheless adduced which permits the jury to infer that he has a criminal record, defendant cannot but be prejudiced and, in effect, deprived of the benefit he anticipated in deciding not to testify.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In particular, references to mug shots are generally impermissible because they imply a criminal record. <em>State v. Cribb, </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>156, 160, 656 A.2d 1279 (App.Div.1995). However, \u201csolitary, fleeting references [to mug shots] generally will not constitute reversible error.\u201d <em>State v. Harris, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>122, 173, 716 A.2d 458 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Because defendant did not object to Sheppard\u2019s testimony or request a curative instruction, the plain error standard of review applies. Under that standard, a conviction will be reversed only if the error was \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2. The error must be \u201csufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the error led the jury to a result it otherwise might not have reached[.]\u201d <em>State v. Taffaro, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>442, 454, 950 A.2d 860 (2008); <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 336, 273 A.2d 1 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Here, as part of the final jury charge, the court instructed the jury in conformity with <em>Model Jury Charge (Criminal), </em>\u201cIdentity \u2014 Police Photos\u201d (1992).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While this instruction may be useful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>in avoiding jury speculation about the source of police photos, it was not sufficiently effective in curing Sheppard\u2019s overt reference to a database of mug shots.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Although Sheppard\u2019s single reference to the \u201cMug Master\u201d database may not, standing alone, have constituted reversible error, in combination with the <em>Bcmkston/Branch </em>violations we have discussed, the improper reference prejudiced defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. <em>See State v. Wakefield, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>397, 538, 921 A.2d 954 (2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>552 <em>U.S. </em>1146, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>1074, 169 L.Ed.2d 817 (2008) (\u201cwhere \u2018legal errors ... in their aggregate have rendered the trial unfair, our fundamental constitutional concepts dictate the granting of a new trial\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>State v. Orecchio, </em>16 <em>N.J. </em>125, 129, 106 A.2d 541 (1954)).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The reference suggested to the jury that defendant had a criminal record, adding to the inference improperly argued in summation and reinforced in the court\u2019s instructions that the State had additional information about defendant\u2019s guilt that it was not permitted to put in evidence. The error compounded the prejudice to defendant and tainted the jury\u2019s evaluation of the admissible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-9\"> The court charged the juiy as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-10\">There are in evidence photographs that were used to identify the defendant in this case. With reference to the photographs submitted into evidence you will notice that many or all of the photographs appear to have been taken by a law enforcement agency or some other government entity. You are not to consider the fact that the agency obtained a photograph of the defendant as prejudicing him in any way. The photographs are not evidence that the defendant has ever been arrested or convicted of any crime. Such photographs come into the hands of law enforcement from a variety of sources, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>including but not limited to, driver license applications, passports, ABC identification cards, various forms of government employment, private employment requiring state regulation, including but not limited to, casino license applications, security guard applications, et cetera, or for many other variety of other sources totally unconnected with criminal activity.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
