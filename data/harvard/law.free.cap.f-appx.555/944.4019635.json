The district court did not have Hernandez\u2019s correct address, so several of the court\u2019s orders never reached him. Nearly two years later, Hernandez filed a motion to reopen, claiming he was unaware that his \u00a7 2241 petition had been denied because he had not received the court\u2019s order. The district court denied the motion, noting that the \u00a7 2241 petition was not dismissed due to undeliverable mail. On appeal, Hernandez reiterates that he did not receive the district court\u2019s instructions to pro se litigants or its order to show cause in his underlying \u00a7 2241 action. He states that the district court incorrectly mailed the documents to a medical facility at which he never resided. As a result, he asks that his proceedings be reopened.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-18\">Because there is no rule or statute providing for a motion to reopen in the context of habeas corpus proceedings, Hernandez\u2019s motion can be construed as a motion for relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-19\">We review the denial of a Rule 60(b)(6) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>High v. Zant, </em>916 F.2d 1507, 1509 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-20\">Rule 60(b) provides that a \u201ccourt may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding\u201d for one of several enumerated reasons, including for \u201cany other reason that justifies relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6). There is no specific time limit for filing a Rule 60(b) motion, but Rule 60(c)(1) pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>vides that the motion \u201cmust be made within a reasonable time.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">\u201cThe law is well established that Rule 60(b)(6) affords relief from a final judgment only under extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>High, </em>916 F.2d at 1509. We have noted that \u201cextraordinary circumstances that warrant the reopening of a judgment \u2018will rarely occur in the habeas context.\u2019 \u201d <em>Howell v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>730 F.3d 1257, 1260 (11th Cir.2013) (quoting <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 535, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 2649, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">In this case, even assuming that Hernandez\u2019s motion was made within a \u201creasonable time\u201d as required by Rule 60(c)(1), the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Hernandez\u2019s motion. The fact that Hernandez did not receive the district court\u2019s initial instructions or show cause order was not sufficient to constitute \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d Further, there was nothing that Hernandez could have argued, even if he had timely received the missing orders, that would have changed the outcome of his \u00a7 2241 proceedings, as his \u00a7 2241 petition was plainly barred by \u00a7 2255(e). <em>See Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1319 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc) (noting that the \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause \u201cdoes not cover sentence claims that could have been raised in earlier proceedings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b968-16\">. Hernandez\u2019s \"Motion for Reconsideration and/or Notice of Appeal\u201d signed on June 10, 2013, cannot perfect an appeal of the district court's June 27, 2013, order denying reconsideration. <em>See Bogle </em>v. <em>Orange Cnty. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs, </em>162 F.3d 653, 661 (11th Cir.1998) (noting that Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(c) \"requires that a notice of appeal designate an existent judgment or order, not one that is merely expected or that is, or should be, within the appellant\u2019s contemplation when the notice of appeal is filed\"). Hernandez did not thereafter amend his notice of appeal or file a new notice of appeal from that order, so we construe his appeal as arising from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
