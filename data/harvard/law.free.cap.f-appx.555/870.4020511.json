We granted Parker a certificate of appealability (COA) on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>a single claim raised in his federal habeas petition, in which he alleged that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the trial court\u2019s jury instruction on aggravated battery or to request a modified instruction that expressly required the State to prove that the victim was pregnant at the time of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">In April 2003, Parker was charged in Florida state court with aggravated battery on a pregnant person, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.045(l)(b). The charging information, largely tracking the statutory language, alleged that on April 7, 2003, Parker committed \u201ca battery upon Barbara Ann Lewis by actually and intentionally touching or striking said person against her will, ... and at the time of the commission of said battery [Lewis] was pregnant and [Parker] knew or should have known that [she] was pregnant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">At his trial, which began and ended on September 3, 2003, Lewis testified that she and Parker were involved in a short-term relationship and briefly lived together in a motel room. She testified that on April 7, 2003, Parker struck her in the face with his closed fist after she rebuffed his sexual advances, and that only a day before he hit her in the leg with a metal cane. Lewis testified that she was six months\u2019 pregnant at the time and, although Parker was not father, he knew of the pregnancy because they had \u201ctalked about being together when the baby came.\u201d Lewis admitted on cross-examination that she drank alcohol and smoked crack cocaine while she was pregnant, though she denied that Parker had ever asked her to stop using drugs during her pregnancy. Deputy Jeremy Jarman, the officer who responded to the 911 call placed by Lewis, testified that when he arrived at the couples\u2019 motel room he noticed that Lewis had \u201cmassive swelling on the left side of her face,\u201d \u201ca bruise to her right forearm,\u201d and \u201cswelling to her right leg.\u201d Deputy Jarman offered Lewis medical attention but she declined. Parker did not testify or present any evidence in his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">During closing arguments, defense counsel reminded the jury that Lewis had admitted to drinking alcohol and using crack cocaine while pregnant, and suggested that Lewis was retaliating against Parker because he had asked her to stop those activities. Defense counsel also maintained that Lewis\u2019 refusal to seek medical treatment following the incident called into question her testimony that Parker had hit her. The State, responding to defense counsel\u2019s arguments, asserted that the un-controverted evidence showed that Lewis was battered by Parker, that she was pregnant at the time, and that Parker was well aware of the pregnancy. In rebuttal, defense counsel did not challenge the State\u2019s assertion that Lewis was pregnant at the time, instead arguing that Lewis declined medical treatment because she wasn\u2019t \u201creally hurt\u201d and that she had to \u201caccept some responsibility for the situation she found herself in\u201d because \u201c[s]he kept going back\u201d to Parker.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">In its instructions, the trial court told the jury that Parker had been accused of battering Lewis while she was pregnant and with knowledge that she was pregnant. The court, without objection from either side, then gave Florida\u2019s standard jury instruction on aggravated battery on a pregnant woman, apprising the jurors that the State had to prove \u201ctwo elements beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d to convict Parker of the charged offense: (1) that the \u201cdefendant intentionally touched or struck Ms. Lewis against her will\u201d; and (2) that the \u201cdefendant in committing the battery knew or should have known that Ms. Lewis was pregnant.\u201d <em>See </em>Fla. Std. Jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>Instr. (Crim.) 8.4 (2003). The jury found Parker guilty as charged, and he was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment as a habitual felony offender. Florida\u2019s First District Court Appeal summarily affirmed Parker\u2019s conviction and sentence on April 21, 2005. <em>See Parker v. State, </em>900 So.2d 561 (Fla. 1st DCA 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">During the pendency of Parker\u2019s direct appeal, but more than a year after his trial, Florida\u2019s First District Court of Appeal held that the standard jury instruction on aggravated battery on a pregnant person was flawed because it omitted an essential element of the offense \u2014 \u201cthat the victim was, in fact, pregnant at the time of the battery.\u201d <em>Small v. State, </em>889 So.2d 862, 864 (Fla. 1st DCA 2004). The <em>Small </em>court, in response to a properly preserved challenge to the instruction, reasoned that the second element of the standard instruction \u2014 that the defendant knew or should have known the victim was pregnant \u2014 \u201cappeared] to presume that the victim was pregnant\u201d and, as such, the instruction as a whole \u201chad the effect of directing a verdict against [the defendant]\u201d on the essential element that the victim was pregnant. <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that, under the circumstances of that particular case, the erroneous instruction was not harmless because the \u201calleged victim did not testify,\u201d \u201cmuch of the evidence came in because of exceptions to the hearsay rule,\u201d and the defendant requested a proper instruction at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 865. The court further noted that, even if the defendant had not requested a proper instruction at trial, \u201cthe failure to give a proper instruction would likely have qualified as fundamental error\u201d exempt from harmless error review \u201cbecause the omitted element was disputed at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court of appeals urged the Florida Supreme Court to modify the standard jury instruction on aggravated battery on a pregnant person, <em>id., </em>which the state\u2019s highest court eventually did in July 2007, <em>see In re Standard Jury Instructions in Criminal Cases, </em>962 So.2d 310, 313 (Fla.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">On July 13, 2005, Parker filed a state post-conviction motion under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850, contending, in relevant part, that trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective in failing to object to the standard jury instruction on the ground that it did not explicitly require the State to prove that the victim was pregnant at the time of the battery, and in failing to request a modified instruction that included this requirement. The state trial court rejected the foundation of Parker\u2019s ineffective assistance claim, finding that it was \u201cconclusively refuted by the record\u201d because \u201cthe Court properly instructed the jury regarding the elements of the offense charged in this case.\u201d On February 23, 2006, Florida\u2019s First District Court of Appeal summarily affirmed the denial of Parker\u2019s ineffective assistance claim without further discussion. <em>See Parker v. State, </em>922 So.2d 336, 337 (Fla. 1st DCA 2006). It did so despite its earlier decision in <em>Small </em>and without even mentioning that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">After filing additional state post-conviction motions, which were dismissed as successive and untimely, Parker filed his federal habeas petition in January 2010, reiterating his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. He asserted that counsel should have known that the jury instruction did not fully track the language of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.045(l)(b), and while he acknowledged that Lewis\u2019 unrebutted trial testimony indicated that she was pregnant at the time of the battery, he asserted that she \u201cwas not in fact pregnant\u201d and that the State had failed to present any medical evidence to corroborate her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>The district court denied the \u00a7 2254 petition, finding that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to request a different jury instruction because, at the time of Parker\u2019s trial, no state court had held that the standard jury instruction on aggravated battery was deficient. The court emphasized that an attorney cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to anticipate a later change in the law, which occurred when the First District Court of Appeal issued its decision in <em>Small </em>more than a year after the trial of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">In accordance with our COA, Parker broadly contends that his trial attorney rendered ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to object to the standard jury instruction on aggravated battery or to request a modified instruction that explicitly required the State to prove that the victim was pregnant at the time of the offense. However, he devotes the bulk of his counseled brief to arguing that the trial court\u2019s jury instruction, by omitting an essential element of the offense, violated his due process right to a fair trial. That due process claim is not properly before us because it was not raised in Parker\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition and is outside the scope of the COA. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that appellate review in a habeas ease \u201cis limited to the issues specified in the COA\u201d). Although the due process claim that Parker attempts to pursue on appeal is factually related to the ineffective assistance claim encompassed by the COA, the two claims are legally and analytically distinct. <em>See Bailey v. Nagle, </em>172 F.3d 1299, 1304 n. 8 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201cAn ineffective-assistance claim is analytically distinct from the substantive claim underlying it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">As to the ineffective assistance of counsel claim properly before us in this appeal, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s rejection of that claim. <em>See McNair v. Campbell, </em>416 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir.2005). To prevail on an ineffective assistance claim, a petitioner must demonstrate both deficient performance and prejudice \u2014 that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d and that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). There is a \u201cstrong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct [fell] within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065, and a petitioner seeking to overcome that presumption must establish \u201cthat no competent counsel would have taken the action that his counsel did take,\u201d <em>Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1315 (11th Cir.2000) (en banc). Where a petitioner challenges his conviction based on the alleged errors of counsel, the prejudice inquiry asks \u201cwhether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 695, 104 S.Ct. at 2068-69. In making this determination, we \u201cmust consider the totality of the evidence before the judge or jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 695, 104 S.Ct. at 2069.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">Federal habeas review of claims adjudicated on the merits in state court, however, is generally circumscribed by two principles of deference, one dealing with questions of federal law and the other with questions of state law. First, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) precludes the grant of federal habeas relief on a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the state court\u2019s decision involved an unrea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>sonable application of clearly established federal law or was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Second, because state courts are the ultimate expositors of state law, federal habeas courts are bound by state-court determinations on state-law questions. <em>See Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 480, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991) (\u201c[I]t is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine state-court determinations on state-law questions.\u201d); <em>Mullaney v. Wilbur, </em>421 U.S. 684, 691, 95 S.Ct. 1881, 1886, 44 L.Ed.2d 508 (1975) (\u201cThis Court ... repeatedly has held that state courts are the ultimate expositors of state law, and that we are bound by their constructions except in extreme circumstances_\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Cargill v. Turpin, </em>120 F.3d 1366, 1381 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cWe are not at liberty to challenge [a] state court determination of state law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Both of these principles are implicated in this case. The state trial court, in a decision summarily affirmed by Florida\u2019s First District Court of Appeal, rejected the state-law underpinnings of Parker\u2019s ineffective assistance claim by finding that the jury was, as a matter of state law, properly instructed on the elements of aggravated battery on a pregnant person. Ordinarily, we would be bound by the states courts\u2019 determination that the challenged jury instruction was proper, which, in turn, would fatally undermine Parker\u2019s contention that his trial attorney was ineffective for failing to object to that instruction. But the deference generally owed to state-court determinations on state-law questions is complicated in this case by the fact that, less than two years earlier, Florida\u2019s First District Court of Appeal \u2014 the same appellate court that summarily affirmed the denial of Parker\u2019s ineffective assistance claim \u2014 held that the same standard instruction that was given at Parker\u2019s trial was defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">Although these seemingly contradictory state-law rulings raise an interesting theoretical question, we need not resolve it. Nor do we need to decide how to apply AEDPA deference when a state court\u2019s decision on a question of federal law hinges upon a disputed interpretation of state law. The reason we need not decide these issues is because, even if we were to assume that the challenged jury instruction was improper as a matter of state law, Parker would still not be entitled to federal habeas relief under <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See Berghuis v. Thompkins, </em>560 U.S. 370, 390, 130 S.Ct. 2250, 2265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1098 (2010) (\u201cCourts can ... deny writs of ha-beas corpus under \u00a7 2254 by engaging in <em>de novo </em>review when it is unclear whether AEDPA deference applies-\u201d). Parker would not be entitled to such relief for two independent reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">First, as the district court properly concluded, Parker has not shown that his trial counsel rendered deficient performance in failing to object to the jury instruction on aggravated battery, which was drawn almost verbatim from the then-existing standard instruction that had been approved by the Florida Supreme Court. At the time of his trial in September 2003, no Florida court had held that the standard jury instruction was flawed. The <em>Smalls </em>decision was not issued until November 30, 2004, more than a full year after Parker\u2019s trial. It is well settled in this circuit that an attorney cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to anticipate a later change in the law. <em>See Black v. United States, </em>373 F.3d 1140, 1144, 1146 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that counsel does not render deficient performance in \u201cfailing to predict what was not yet a certain holding\u201d and where, at the relevant time, \u201cthe legal principle at issue [was] unsettled\u201d); <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number><em>Ardley, </em>273 F.3d 991, 993 (11th Cir.2001) (noting that \u201cwe have a wall of binding precedent that shuts out any contention that an attorney\u2019s failure to anticipate a change in the law constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel,\u201d and that precedent applies even when the \u201cissue was, in hindsight, a sure fire winner\u201d); <em>Jackson v. Herring, </em>42 F.3d 1350, 1359 (11th Cir.1995) (\u201cTo be effective within the bounds set by <em>Strickland, </em>an attorney need not anticipate changes in the law.\u201d); <em>Spaziano v. Singletary, </em>36 F.3d 1028, 1039 (11th Cir.1994) (\u201cWe have held many times that reasonably effective representation cannot and does not include a requirement to make arguments based on predictions of how the law may develop.\u201d) (quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">We recognize that the Florida Supreme Court has long adhered to the view that standard jury instructions are not necessarily correct and that its approval of those instructions does not foreclose parties from requesting alternative instructions or contesting the correctness of the approved instructions. <em>See Standard Jury Instructions in Criminal Cases, </em>723 So.2d 123, 123 (Fla.1998). Nevertheless, we cannot conclude that no reasonable trial attorney would have failed to object to the standard jury instruction that had yet to be questioned, much less disparaged, by any state appellate court, particularly given that the undisputed evidence presented at Parker\u2019s trial showed that the victim was pregnant at the time of the offense. Parker has therefore failed to show that trial counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Second, Parker has also failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s allegedly deficient performance. Lewis\u2019 testimony that she was six months\u2019 pregnant at the time of the offense was not contradicted by any other evidence introduced at trial. In light of that uncontra-dicted testimony, there is no reasonable probability that the jury would have acquitted Parker of the charged offense had the trial court specifically instructed it that the State had to prove the victim\u2019s pregnancy beyond a reasonable doubt. Throughout his federal habeas proceedings, Parker has espoused the view that Lewis\u2019 testimony, though unrebutted, was insufficient to support his conviction because the State did not offer any conclusive medical evidence to corroborate her claimed pregnancy. That is wrong. Lewis\u2019 testimony, if believed by the jury, was alone sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that she was pregnant at the time of the battery. <em>See, e.g., Craig v. Singletary, </em>127 F.3d 1030, 1044 (11th Cir.1997) (explaining that even \u201cthe uncorroborated testimony of a co-conspirator or accomplice is sufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d). The jury was entitled to credit her testimony. <em>See United States v. Prince, </em>883 F.2d 953, 959 n. 3 (11th Cir.1989) (\u2018Weighing the credibility of witnesses ... is within the province of the jury, and the jury is free to believe or disbelieve any part or all of the testimony of a witness.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">Because Parker cannot prevail on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim on <em>de novo </em>review, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2254 habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
