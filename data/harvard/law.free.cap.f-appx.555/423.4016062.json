The district court sentenced Gamez to 27-months\u2019 imprisonment, less 190 days of credit for state custody, and did <em>not </em>impose a supervised-release term.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-22\">For his only issue on appeal, Gamez contends the court erred in concluding his Illinois involuntary-manslaughter conviction warranted a 12-level enhancement under Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (unlawfully entering or remaining in United States after felony conviction for crime of violence). Because Gamez has been released from prison and removed from the United States (24 June 2013), his appeal is moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 383 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-24\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b447-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
