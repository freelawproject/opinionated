Glickman, </em>185 F.R.D. 82 (D.D.C.1999), and additional state-law claims. The district court dismissed the Consent Decree claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">Slaughter was a prevailing plaintiff in the <em>Pigford </em>litigation, a class action lawsuit in which black farmers sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The <em>Pigford </em>litigation was settled by a Consent Decree. As part of the settlement, Slaughter received $50,000 and certain debt relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-13\">Slaughter\u2019s primary allegation is that the USDA and other federal government defendants (collectively USDA) have breached the Consent Decree by improperly recording liens against his property. His Amended Complaint asserted six counts: (I) breach of the Consent Decree; (II) request for a preliminary injunction to stop the breach of the Consent Decree; (III) improper taking in violation of the Consent Decree and the Fifth Amendment; (IV) conspiracy; (V) fraudulent concealment; and (VI) an unspecified claim regarding his former attorney Jon Coo-gle\u2019s representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-16\">USDA and Coogle each moved to dismiss the claims against them. The district court granted the motions and entered judgment in their favor. The district court found it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Slaughter\u2019s claims against the federal defendants, because the District Court for the District of Columbia retained jurisdiction over all alleged violations of the terms of the Consent Decree. In light of that ruling, the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims against Coogle. Slaughter then filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-18\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s order granting a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Parise v. Delta Airlines, Inc., </em>141 F.3d 1463, 1465 (11th Cir.1998). We review a district court\u2019s decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction for abuse of discretion. <em>Engelhardt v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., </em>139 F.3d 1346, 1351 n. 4 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>A. Counts I through III</p>\n<p id=\"Ab1\">The district court correctly determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Counts I through III, because it did not have an independent jurisdictional basis to enforce the <em>Pigford </em>Consent Decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\">Enforcing a settlement agreement generally falls outside the ancillary jurisdiction of the federal courts, even where the court had jurisdiction to hear the underlying case. <em>Anago Franchising, Inc. v. Shaz, LLC, </em>677 F.3d 1272, 1278 (11th Cir.2012). A claim for the enforcement of a settlement agreement is essentially a contract dispute for which there must be some independent basis for federal jurisdiction. <em>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>511 U.S. 375, 381-82, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 1677, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994). However, a court may specifically retain jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement or consent decree through its contempt power. <em>Am. Disability Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Chmielarz, </em>289 F.3d 1315, 1319-21 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">Slaughter brought his complaint in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia. As the district court correctly found, it does not have an independent basis for jurisdiction to enforce violations of the <em>Pigford </em>Consent Decree. The only court that reserved jurisdiction to enforce Consent Decree violations was the District Court for the District of Columbia. Paragraph 13 of the Consent Decree, entitled \u201cEnforcement Procedures,\u201d explains the process for seeking enforcement before that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">While Slaughter argues his claims are separate and apart from the Consent Decree, his Amended Complaint does not reflect any independent claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For exam-pie, Count I is entitled \u201cBreach of Consent Decree.\u201d And Counts II and III allege that the defendants have taken actions in violation of the terms and conditions of the Consent Decree. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Counts I through III of Slaughter\u2019s Amended Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">B. Counts IV through VI</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">We also affirm the district court\u2019s decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Slaughter\u2019s state-law claims for conspiracy, fraudulent concealment, and alleged misconduct by his former attorney. A district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over additional claims after dismissing all claims over which it has original jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3); <em>Raney v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>370 F.3d 1086, 1089 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201cWe have encouraged district courts to dismiss any remaining state claims when, as here, the federal claims have been dismissed prior to trial.\u201d). Slaughter does not offer any argument on appeal that the district court abused its discretion in following this well-settled rule in this case. <em>See, e.g., Roper v. Edwards, </em>815 F.2d 1474, 1477 (11th Cir.1987) (\u201c[I]t is an abuse of discretion for a federal court to dismiss pendent state claims where no viable state forum exists at the time of dismissal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-13\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b953-7\">. If after further evaluation Slaughter determines, as he claims, that he has other federal claims, under a federal statute or the United States Constitution, that are truly separate and independent from the Consent Decree, the Middle District of Georgia may be the proper court for those claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
