He contends that the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA) should be applied retroactively to reduce his sentence and that failing to do so would violate the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-25\">Pearson pleaded guilty in 2003 to multiple offenses, related to the possession and distribution of crack cocaine. Because he had a prior felony drug conviction, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>district court imposed the mandatory minimum sentence of twenty years imprisonment pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(viii). That sentence was greater than what the recommended guidelines range would have been had it applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">In 2008, the United States Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendment 706, which lowered the base offense level for many crack cocaine offenses. The district court <em>sua sponte </em>ordered the parties to address whether Pearson was eligible for a reduction in his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), but it ultimately determined that he was not because his sentence was imposed pursuant to a mandatory statutory minimum, and Amendment 706 did not actually lower his guidelines range. Pearson appealed that denial and his counsel filed a motion to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). This Court granted counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, finding \u201cno arguable issue of merit\u201d for appeal, and affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of the sentence reduction. <em>United States v. Pearson, </em>361 Fed.Appx. 66 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">Pearson again sought a reduction in his sentence in 2010. Proceeding pro se, he filed a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence based on the FSA, which reduced the amount of crack cocaine sufficient to trigger the mandatory statutory penalties under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Pearson argued that the district court should retroactively apply the FSA to his sentence because failing to do so would violate the Equal Protection Clause. The district court denied Pearson\u2019s motion, concluding that the FSA did not apply retroactively to crimes committed before it came into effect. Pearson did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">Pearson\u2019s third attempt to have his sentence reduced, which is the basis of this appeal, came in June 2013, when he filed another \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. In that motion, Pearson again argued for the retroactive application of the FSA to his sentence on equal protection grounds. He cited Amendment 750 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which revised the crack cocaine quantity tables to implement the FSA\u2019s directives. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, amend. 750 (Nov.2011). And he asked the district court to \u201coverlook\u201d his mandatory minimum sentence and instead impose a sentence of 87 months based on what the guidelines range would have been if it had applied. The district court denied the motion. It concluded that the FSA did not apply retroactively to Pearson\u2019s sentence, which was handed down in 2004, and that he was therefore not entitled to relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Pearson appealed, and the government responded with a motion for summary affirmance and a stay of the briefing schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 792 (11th Cir.2009). However, we apply <em>de novo </em>review to the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012). Because Pearson is proceeding <em>pro se, </em>we construe his pleadings liberally. <em>Webb, </em>565 F.3d at 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-11\">Summary disposition is appropriate where \u201cthe position of one of the parties is clearly right as a matter of law so that there can be no substantial question as to the outcome of the case, or where, as is more frequently the case, the appeal is frivolous.\u201d <em>Groendyke Transp., Inc. v. </em>Davis, <em>406 F.2d 1158, 1162 (5th Cir.1969).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">The sole argument advanced by-Pearson on appeal is that the district court violated the Equal Protection Clause by refusing to apply the FSA retroactively to his sentence. He notes that, of the 30,000 prisoners serving crack cocaine sentences, 17,000 of them are ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction because they are serving mandatory minimum or career offender sentences. Because some people perceived the pre-FSA version of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1) to be racially discriminatory,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pearson argues, the sentences imposed pursuant to it are unconstitutional and his sentence should be reduced under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We reject Pearson\u2019s argument for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Section 3582(c)(2) empowers a district court to modify a term of imprisonment only \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Where a defendant such as Pearson is sentenced on the basis of a statutory minimum, and not the sentencing guidelines, \u201c[t]he law is clear that a sentencing court lacks jurisdiction to consider a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.\u201d <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012) (citing <em>United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1078 (11th Cir.2010)) (alteration in original). Furthermore, constitutional claims like the one at issue here are \u201cextraneous resen-tencing issues\u201d that a court lacks jurisdiction to address during a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. United <em>States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000). In short, a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is not the proper procedural vehicle for Pearson\u2019s claim. Such a constitutional challenge should be brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, <em>see id., </em>although the time for filing one has long since passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">Second, this Court\u2019s precedent forecloses Pearson\u2019s argument that he is entitled to a sentence reduction on the ground that the FSA applies retroactively to a defendant serving a mandatory minimum sentence. In <em>United States v. Berry, </em>we held that the FSA does not apply retroactively to sentences imposed before its 2010 effective date. 701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012) (\u201cWe agree with every other circuit to address the issue that there is no evidence that Congress intended [the FSA] to apply to defendants who had been sentenced prior to the August 3, 2010 date of the Act\u2019s enactment.\u201d) (alteration in original) (quotation marks omitted) (citing decisions); <em>see also United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 542 (11th Cir.2013) (holding that a defendant who had been sentenced to a pre-FSA statutory minimum was not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on Amendment 750 because \u201cthe FSA does not apply retroactively to his 1996 sentence.\u201d). Pearson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>was sentenced in 2004, which is six years before the FSA was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">For these reasons, the government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The government\u2019s motion to stay the briefing schedule is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-6\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b942-7\">. Section 841(b)(1) is the statute under which Pearson was sentenced. Before the passage of the FSA, there was a large disparity between the amount of crack cocaine and powder cocaine needed to trigger mandatory statutory penalties. <em>See Dorsey v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2327, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). In a 2002 report, the Sentencing Commission recommended reducing that sentencing disparity in part because of a \" \u2018widely-held perception\u2019 \" that it disproportionately punished black offenders. <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 98, 128 S.Ct. 558, 568, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
