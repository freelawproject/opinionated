Duran v. Alejandro Antonini, </em>Case No. 10-03792. In December 2008, Antonini and his company, Venuz Supply, Inc., commenced an involuntary Chapter 7 case against Duran, alleging that Duran was insolvent and owed them, respectively, $281,000 and $360,950. In April 2009, An-tonini and Venuz Supply petitioned the Bankruptcy Court for Chapter 7 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-22\">The Bankruptcy Court dismissed the Chapter 7 case against Duran without Duran\u2019s consent. Then, in 2010, Duran filed a six-count adversarial complaint against Antonini in <em>In re: Alejandro Antonini </em>seeking damages against Antonini for pursuing the involuntary Chapter 7 case against him and asking the Bankruptcy Court to deny Antonini a discharge of his debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-23\">The court held a two-day bench trial on Duran\u2019s adversarial complaint, heard testimony from witnesses, including Antonini and Duran, and entered a final judgment on Antonini\u2019s petition for the discharge of his debts and ordering him to pay Duran $185,000 in attorney\u2019s fees and costs and $50,000 in punitive damages under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303(i). Antonini timely appealed the judgment to the District Court; he challenged the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s findings of fact as clearly erroneous and its award of attorney\u2019s fees as an abuse of discretion. The District Court found no merit in either challenge and affirmed the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-24\">The District Court found that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s findings of fact were consistent with its assessment of the evidence at the end of the trial and were fully sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>ported by the evidence. The court rejected out of hand Antonini\u2019s argument that the attorney\u2019s fee award lacked evidentiary support because the billing records of Duran\u2019s law firm were not admitted into evidence. The Bankruptcy Court had ample evidence on which to base the award in the form of the testimony of Duran and his expert witness, Charles Throkmorton, which it found credible. The District Court also rejected Antonini\u2019s argument that the evidence failed to support to the punitive damages award. The Bankruptcy Court awarded Duran punitive damages because if found that Antonini filed the Chapter 7 petition against Duran in \u201cbad faith.\u201d As the District Court observed, the record was replete with evidence of bad faith. For example, the day Antonini filed the Chapter 7 petition, he signed an affidavit stating that Duran\u2019s net worth was in excess of $100 million. In the face of that admission and without conducting any due diligence, he filed the Chapter 7 petition. He filed it because, as he put it, it was the \u201cbest\u201d way to collect the money Duran purportedly owed him. After that, he failed to establish the validity of the debts Duran allegedly owed him and his company. Antonini now appeals the District Court\u2019s judgment. He presents to us the arguments he presented to the District Court. Like that court and for the reasons it gave in affirming the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s judgment, we find no merit in any of Antonini\u2019s arguments. The District Court\u2019s judgment is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
