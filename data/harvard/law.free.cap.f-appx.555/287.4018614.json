In his first amended complaint, Oliva raised Eighth Amendment claims against Warden J. Rupert and two unnamed transporting officers arising from Oliva\u2019s fall while exiting a prison van.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">A complaint is frivolous if it lacks \u201can arguable basis in law or fact,\u201d and dismissal on that ground is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999). Dismissal for failure to state a claim is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>applying the standard used to review a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Hart v. Hairston, </em>343 F.3d 762, 763-64 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">\u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cFactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\u201d <em>Bell atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). \u201c[CJonclusory allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual conclusions will not suffice to prevent a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Fernandez-Montes v. Allied Pilots Ass\u2019n, </em>987 F.2d 278, 284 (5th Cir.1993). Because the district court dismissed the complaint both as frivolous and for failure to state a claim, the dismissal is reviewed <em>de novo. See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">Oliva\u2019s allegations against the two transporting officers state, at most, claims for negligence and therefore not valid \u00a7 1983 claims. <em>See Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 332-36, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986). Oliva does not allege facts showing either that Rupert was directly involved in the events at issue or that there was a sufficient causal connection between Rupert\u2019s conduct and those events. <em>See Thompkins v. Belt, </em>828 F.2d 298, 304 (5th Cir.1987). Nor has Oliva pleaded facts sufficient to state a valid claim that Rupert failed to supervise or train the transporting officers. <em>See Goodman v. Harris Cnty., </em>571 F.3d 388, 395 (5th Cir.2009). Finally, though Oliva contends that the district court erred by denying him leave to amend his complaint for a second time, he fails to show that the court abused its discretion, particularly given the futility of the claims that he sought to add through the amendment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(2); <em>Jones v. Robinson Prop. Grp., L.P., </em>427 F.3d 987, 994 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-14\">The appeal is without arguable merit and is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5TH CIR. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous and for failure to state a claim count as one strike each for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number><em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Oliva that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). Oliva\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b312-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
