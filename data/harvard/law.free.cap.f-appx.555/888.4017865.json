On appeal, Townsend claims (1) that the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) insufficiently developed the record to determine whether Townsend could perform his past relevant work by failing to ask enough questions related to his residual functional capacity (RFC) and (2) that the ALJ\u2019s failure to sufficiently inquire into Townsend\u2019s physical limitations was \u201covertly prejudicial.\u201d After careful review, we reject both claims and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-19\">Prior to filing for disability benefits, Townsend had been hospitalized several times in a nearly two year period for a severe injury to his right eye, for pain and infections in his right foot, and for pain in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>his back and knee. Multiple physicians completed RFC evaluations of Townsend, and the physicians\u2019 conclusions varied to some extent. The most favorable portions of each report, from Townsend\u2019s perspective, indicate that he could at least: frequently lift ten pounds and occasionally lift twenty pounds; sit and stand for six hours in an eight hour work day; frequently climb, kneel, crouch, and crawl; and occasionally stoop and balance. They further found that he had no manipulative, communicative, or environmental limitations except that he should avoid concentrated exposure to hazards such as working at significant heights. Finally, the physicians concluded that he had severely limited vision in his right eye and hypertension and diabetes.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">At the administrative hearing before the ALJ, Townsend confirmed that he could lift twenty pounds, but not often. Townsend also stated that his vision was poor, that he had pain in his mouth stemming from the same incident that injured his eye, tendinitis in his knee, and chronic back pain. When the ALJ followed up by asking what treatment he received for this pain, Townsend\u2019s non-attorney representative who had been questioning Townsend stated: \u2018Tour Honor, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not sure if the \u2014 if the Claimant would be able to offer any additional helpful testimony.\u201d Townsend and his representative stated that he was disabled based on the loss of vision in his right eye, the above-described physical impairments, and chronic pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">At the time of his hearing before the ALJ, Townsend was in his mid-fifties and had most recently worked at a carwash where he answered the phone and washed cars. The vocational expert at the hearing classified this job as medium work, which someone with Townsend\u2019s limitations, as described in multiple RFC evaluations, could perform. Townsend offered no evidence to contradict the RFC evaluations performed by the physicians but merely claimed that he was disabled based on the limitations described above. Faced with conflicting conclusions about Townsend\u2019s ability to perform past relevant work, the ALJ found the physicians\u2019 RFC evaluations to be more credible than Townsend\u2019s self-assessment. In particular, the ALJ placed significant weight on: (1) objective medical evidence that Townsend was able to perform medium work; (2) physicians\u2019 reports of callousing on Townsend\u2019s extremities, which were inconsistent with the disabilities he alleged but consistent with the ability to perform medium work; and (3) Townsend\u2019s poor work history, which weakened his credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">Ultimately, the ALJ concluded that although Townsend suffered from several severe impairments, his RFC permitted him to perform medium work, including his past relevant work at the carwash. In any event, Townsend had certainly not met his burden of proving the contrary. Accordingly, the ALJ denied benefits. Townsend challenges this finding because the ALJ did not ask enough questions about Townsend\u2019s impairments to fully and fairly develop the record. Specifically, Townsend complains that the ALJ only asked about his ability to lift but not his ability to sit, stand, or walk \u2014 all of which would be necessary to perform his previous work. This, Townsend claims, was overtly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">We have held that the ALJ has the \u201cduty to develop the record fully and fairly.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Apfel, </em>179 F.3d 1276, 1278 (11th Cir.1999) (per curiam). Claimants have a statutory right to counsel at hearings before an ALJ, and where the right has not been waived, the ALJ\u2019s \u201cobligation to develop a full and fair record rises to a special duty.\u201d <em>Graham v. Apfel, </em>129 F.3d 1420, 1422 (11th Cir.1997) (per curiam). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>But even in cases involving this special duty, \u201ca showing of prejudice must be made before we will find that a hearing violated claimant\u2019s rights of due process and requires a remand to the Secretary for reconsideration.\u201d <em>Kelley v. Heckler, </em>761 F.2d 1538, 1540 (11th Cir.1985) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Prejudice \u201cat least requires a showing that the ALJ did not have all of the relevant evidence before him in the record (which would include relevant testimony from claimant), or that the ALJ did not consider all of the evidence in the record in reaching his decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1540. In determining whether sufficient prejudice exists to warrant remand, \u201c[t]he court should be guided by whether the record reveals evidentiary gaps which result in unfairness or \u2018clear prejudice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Graham, </em>129 F.3d at 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">In <em>Brown v. Shalala, </em>we found prejudice based on the ALJ\u2019s failure to obtain records which were the subject of testimony, to acquire a report which he stated he would review, and to question an available witness when the claimant herself was unable to explain how her disabilities prevented her from working. 44 F.3d 931, 935-36 (11th Cir.1995) (per curiam). By contrast, in <em>Kelley, </em>we held that no prejudice resulted when there was no suggestion that the record was incomplete or inadequate and claimant\u2019s assertion that he would have benefitted from a more extensive hearing was speculative. 761 F.2d at 1540-41. Similarly, in <em>Graham, </em>\u201cthe record as a whole [was] neither incomplete nor inadequate. Instead, the record was sufficient for the ALJ to evaluate Graham\u2019s impairments and functional ability, and [did] not show the kind of gaps in the evidence necessary to demonstrate prejudice.\u201d 129 F.3d at 1423. The ALJ extensively questioned Graham, Graham was able to offer helpful explanations, the ALJ thoroughly examined Graham\u2019s medical history, and the ALJ\u2019s opinion thoroughly compared symptoms and limitations with functional requirements for previous work. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">Here, Townsend has not demonstrated that the record is insufficient. In <em>Wilson, </em>the record, \u201cwhich included the opinions of several physicians ..., was sufficient for a decision and additional expert testimony was unnecessary.\u201d 179 F.3d 1276, 1278. The record here also includes the opinions of several physicians, and in <em>Wilson, </em>we found that even additional <em>expert </em>testimony was unnecessary. Townsend claims the ALJ should have questioned him further. But if additional expert testimony is unnecessary in the face of multiple physicians\u2019 opinions, additional lay testimony from a witness the ALJ has already concluded lacks credibility would be even less necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">Even if we assume the record was insufficient, however, Townsend has not shown prejudice from the ALJ\u2019s decision not to ask Townsend about his ability to sit, stand, and walk. To the extent that Townsend is basing his \u201covert prejudice\u201d claim on <em>Graham, </em>which recognized that extensive questioning undermines a claim of prejudice, Townsend misunderstands that case. In <em>Graham, </em>the ALJ found questioning to be helpful, as claimant was able to provide useful information. Here, by contrast, Townsend presumably would have asserted a more limited ability to work than the physicians\u2019 RFC reports\u2014 though he does not even assert this point on appeal. But the ALJ clearly found Townsend\u2019s bare assertions of his disability to be less credible than multiple physicians\u2019 reports. Therefore, to the extent questioning was less extensive than in <em>Graham, </em>it was brief because it would not have been helpful or credible, and even now, Townsend has not suggested what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>more the ALJ might have learned from further questioning. In fact, Townsend\u2019s representative stated that he had no further helpful testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Not only was further testimony from Townsend unlikely to help his cause, but unlike in <em>Brown, </em>there is no suggestion that other available witnesses would have helped Townsend\u2019s case. In fact, the opposite is true, as the physicians would have provided evidence undermining Townsend\u2019s claim, had they been called to testify. It was unnecessary to call them because their reports were available to the ALJ. Therefore, the ALJ had all the relevant evidence before him such that there were no evidentiary gaps when he made his decision. And while the ALJ did not extensively question Townsend, Townsend had nothing else to offer. Just as in <em>Graham </em>and <em>Kelley, </em>we find no prejudice here because the ALJ reviewed the relevant medical information and prepared a thorough opinion explaining how Townsend could perform his past relevant work despite his symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">In short, the record was sufficiently developed, and even if it was not, no prejudice resulted from any deficiencies that may have existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
