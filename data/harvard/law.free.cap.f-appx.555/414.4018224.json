Ortiz-Hinojo argues that his sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) because the district court did not consider his mitigation arguments, particularly his assertion that his criminal history was overstated due to the impermissible double counting of a previous conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Because Ortiz-Hinojo did not challenge the substantive reasonableness of his sentence in the district court, we review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir.2007). Ortiz-Hinojo\u2019s double-counting argument is currently foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Calbat, </em>266 F.3d 358, 364 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Furthermore, the record reflects that the district court expressly considered the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors as well as Ortiz-Hinojo\u2019s arguments for mitigating his sentence but implicitly overruled those arguments and concluded that a within-guidelines sentence was appropriate. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, we decline Ortiz-Hinojo\u2019s invitation to reweigh the \u00a7 3553(a) factors because \u201cthe sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Ortiz-Hinojo\u2019s general disagreement with the propriety of his sentence and the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 766 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">Because Ortiz-Hinojo has not demonstrated error, plain or otherwise, in the imposition of his within-guidelines 28-month prison term, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 392.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b439-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
