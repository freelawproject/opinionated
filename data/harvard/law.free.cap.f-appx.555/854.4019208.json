After review, we dismiss in part and deny in part the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-13\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b879-14\">A. Illegal Entry and State Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b879-15\">In 1991, Bhai entered the United States without inspection. In 1992, Bhai was convicted in California state court of the misdemeanor offense of \u201cannoy[ing] and molesting] a child\u201d and was sentenced to a suspended 180-day jail term, followed by three years of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-16\">B. 1993 Asylum Application</p>\n<p id=\"b879-17\">In May 1993, Bhai filed an asylum application claiming political persecution based on his membership in the Mohajir Quomii Mahaz (\u201cMQM\u201d) party. In his asylum application, Bhai said that \u201cworkers of IJI [a]nd other groups and professional men hired by the politicians manhandled [him] several times,\u201d and they would approach him while he was having tea in a snack shop, spit in his tea, and throw sand in'his food. Bhai also recounted an incident in which the police jailed him for ten days after he fought with a police officer\u2019s son, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-18\">Once Rehmat[,] that is the son of the police officer in charge[,] was beating me with a stick[;] in self-defense I wrestled with him and we fell on a hard surface^] injuring both of us. The police threw me in jail for 10 days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-19\">No decision was rendered on the 1993 application, however, because, according to Bhai, he did not attend the asylum interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-20\">C. 1995 to 2005</p>\n<p id=\"b879-21\">In June 1995, Minaz entered the United States without inspection and married Bhai a few weeks later. The Bhais moved to Georgia, where they had three children, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>and Bhai worked as a convenience store manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">D. 2005 Application for Adjustment of Status and 2006 Interview</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">In 2005, Bhai filed an 1^85 application for adjustment of status seeking permanent residence based on his approved I-140 petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the application, Bhai checked the \u201cNo\u201d box in response to the question, \u201cHave you ever, in or outside the U.S.... been arrested, cited, charged, indicted, fined, or imprisoned for breaking or violating any law or ordinance, excluding traffic violations?\u201d Bhai signed the application under penalty of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">After an interview in 2006, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUS-CIS\u201d) denied Bhai\u2019s adjustment application in 2009 because Bhai: (1) failed to register as a sex offender in Georgia; (2) did not accurately respond to questions on his application concerning his criminal history; and (3) told the interviewing USCIS officer that he had never been arrested or convicted. USCIS also revoked Bhai\u2019s alien worker status.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">E. Commencement of Removal Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">Soon after, in July 2009, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) initiated removal proceedings against both Bhai and Minaz, and later their cases were consolidated. DHS initially sought Bhai\u2019s expedited removal based on his prior conviction. In September 2009, however, Bhai\u2019s conviction was vacated. Ultimately, DHS charged both Bhai and Minaz with being removable under INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(A)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00ae, as aliens who were present in the United States without being admitted or paroled, and charged Bhai with being inadmissible, pursuant to INA \u25a0 \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)\u00ae, as an alien who, by fraud or willful misrepresentation, had sought to procure an immigration benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-13\">F.2009 Applications for Asylum, Adjustment of Status, and Cancellation of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b880-14\">In October 2009, Bhai filed a second application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief, claiming persecution based on his political opinion. Bhai\u2019s 2009 asylum application claimed that he was persecuted in Pakistan by members of the Pakistan People\u2019s Party (\u201cPPP\u201d) because he was an MQM member.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-15\">According to Bhai\u2019s 2009 asylum application, he became an active member of the MQM beginning in 1987 or 1988, and attended rallies, made banners, and \u201cassisted with party communications, advertising, and other organizational efforts.\u201d After the MQM lost the 1988 elections and the PPP came to power, PPP members harassed, tortured, and killed MQM members. Bhai said that PPP members followed him on multiple occasions and that, once, PPP members spit in his tea and threw sand in his food while he was eating at a hotel.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>In addition, Bhai claimed that, in 1990, he \u201cwas arrested by the police at [his] home\u201d and \u201cdetained in jail for 10 days,\u201d although he was \u201cnever formally charged.\u201d While detained, Bhai was \u201cbeaten, punched, kicked, and [he] lost consciousness,\u201d Bhai was also \u201cnot given any food.\u201d Bhai claimed that \u201c[t]he police knew that [he] was a member of MQM because they had seen [him] at multiple MQM rallies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Bhai\u2019s asylum application stated that, \u201c[a]fter [he] was released from jail, [he] was monitored and harassed by PPP supporters.\u201d Twice PPP supporters \u201cgrabbed [Bhai\u2019s] scooter from behind when [he] was in an alley,\u201d but Bhai managed to escape each time. Bhai hid indoors until he left for the United States in 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Bhai\u2019s application alleged that in 1997, the PPP were looking for him, but found Bhai\u2019s uncle and \u201ctortured him to give [Bhai\u2019s] address.\u201d When Bhai\u2019s uncle did not give an address, the PPP \u201cshot him to death.\u201d The PPP then \u201charassed [Bhai\u2019s] dad,\u201d who Bhai said was \u201ctoo old to bear the mistreatment everyday,\u201d and \u201cpassed away with a severe heart attack in 2004.\u201d The PPP \u201ckeep inquiring about [Bhai] from [his family] members who have to change their addresses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">Bhai also submitted affidavits from his mother and his cousin, Rahim, from Karachi, Pakistan. Bhai\u2019s mother stated that she was present when Bhai \u201cwas detained by police officials who supported the People\u2019s party movement.\u201d After ten days, she secured Bhai\u2019s release and took him to the hospital for treatment. Bhai\u2019s mother stated that, after Bhai\u2019s release, men kept coming to her house, harassing her and her family, and trying to discover Bhai\u2019s hiding place. The men also harassed Bhai\u2019s father and uncle, and Bhai\u2019s uncle was \u201cshot on the road in 1997.\u201d The harassment caused Bhai\u2019s father significant stress, which resulted in a fatal heart attack. Bhai\u2019s mother stated that the PPP is \u201cstill looking to find [Bhai\u2019s] current location so that they can kill him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">Bhai\u2019s cousin Rahim stated that Bhai and his uncle had owned a shop together in Karachi and that a \u201cstrong political group\u201d caused Bhai to flee the country in 1991. The political group repeatedly looted the shop and threatened to kill them if they filed a police report. Rahim said that, on September 27, 1997, the political group \u201cshot dead\u201d Bhai\u2019s uncle \u201cin the shop.\u201d Further, the political group continues to harass and threaten Bhai\u2019s family. As a result Bhai\u2019s family, including Rahim, is forced to \u201cshift their houses\u201d from time to time to protect themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">In 2009, Bhai also filed a second application for adjustment of status based on his previously approved application for a labor certification. On that application, Bhai checked the \u201cYes\u201d box when asked whether he had ever been arrested for breaking the law and cited his 1992 conviction that was vacated in 2009. The same day, Bhai also filed an application for cancellation of removal based on the hardship to his U.S.born children.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">G. 2009 Credible Fear Interview</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">In 2009, Bhai attended a credible fear interview with an asylum officer. Bhai stated that, in 1990, the police arrested him and detained him for ten days. According to Bhai, the local, uniformed police came to his home, dragged him out and \u201cput [him in] jail, beat [him] up, didn\u2019t give [him] any food.\u201d Bhai stated that they sometimes beat him and kicked him until he was unconscious.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-13\">After his mother secured Bhai\u2019s release, Bhai had \u201csmall problems\u201d when he encountered the PPP in alleys while riding his scooter, but he \u201cgot away.\u201d Bhai stopped going out. Bhai had no further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>problems with the police, but said the police \u201chover[ed] around\u201d his house for about a month after his release. Bhai claimed that \u201cthe police and PP members are all looking for [him],\u201d and he feared the police and the PPP would kill him if he returned to Pakistan. Bhai stated that MQM members were still targeted and the PPP either \u201cdo it themselves or they get it done through the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Bhai stated that his uncle \u201cwas okay\u201d until 1992, when PPP members found out that he was Bhai\u2019s uncle. The PPP made inquiries of Bhai\u2019s uncle and threatened and harassed him, and in 1997, the PPP killed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">After Bhai\u2019s uncle was killed, Bhai\u2019s father took over his brother\u2019s (Bhai\u2019s uncle\u2019s) shop. Two or three times a week, PPP members would come to the shop and threaten Bhai\u2019s father. The PPP members said that what had happened to his brother would happen to him and his family and that they would find his son (Bhai) and beat him up. Bhai\u2019s father \u201cwas always in fear, he was moving from place to place.\u201d Bhai said that his family in Pakistan has \u201cstayed in hiding\u201d and has \u201ctried to stay away from the PPP or the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">H. IJ Hearing in 2011</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">On February 8, 2011, an IJ held a consolidated hearing on removability and the merits of each of Bhai\u2019s applications for relief. Bhai and Minaz admitted the allegations regarding, and conceded remova-bility based on, the charge that they were present in the United States without being admitted or paroled. However, Bhai contested the additional charge that he was inadmissible under INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i), because he had misrepresented his criminal history when he applied for adjustment of status in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">The IJ heard testimony from Bhai, Mi-naz, and Officer Richard Lee, the USCIS line adjudicator who conducted Bhai\u2019s 2006 adjustment of status interview. All three witnesses agreed that at the interview Officer Lee asked Bhai (at least twice) whether he had been arrested or convicted and that Bhai answered \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">Officer Lee had no independent recollection of the 2006 interview, but testified that he knew from his general practice and the marks he had made on the adjustment application that he had asked Bhai about his criminal history. Lee maintained that Bhai did not tell him about the conviction during the interview because Lee would have made a note on the adjustment application about it and then would have had Bhai initial the notation.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">Bhai testified that he answered \u201cno\u201d to Lee\u2019s question during the 2006 interview because he did not speak English well at that time and had not understood the words \u201carrest\u201d or \u201cconviction.\u201d However, Bhai said that, when Lee showed him a copy of his 1992 conviction, Bhai had explained to Lee that he had not understood the question and had not meant to lie. Bhai explained that he thought \u201cno\u201d was the correct answer to Officer Lee\u2019s question because he only went to jail once for one or two hours, he had not \u201cdone any crime,\u201d and he \u201cdid not go in the jail several times.\u201d On cross-examination, Bhai stated that he answered \u201cno\u201d to Lee\u2019s question because he \u201cthought that this is over\u201d and he had \u201cfinished the procedure of the court and ... the case was over.\u201d When Bhai was asked for his understanding of the word \u201carrest\u201d at the time of his interview, Bhai insisted that he was \u201cnot a criminal.\u201d The government asked the IJ to instruct Bhai to answer the question. The IJ stated, \u201cWe\u2019ve asked him several time[s]. He\u2019s not answering the questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b883-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>With respect to his 2005 adjustment application, Bhai stated that his prior attorney had completed the application for him and never asked him about his criminal history. Bhai maintained that he did not know the application included a question about his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">After this evidence, the IJ sustained the fraud-based charge of inadmissibility against Bhai, finding Officer Lee \u201cfar more credible than\u201d Bhai and Bhai\u2019s \u201cstory somewhat implausible.\u201d The IJ\u2019s ruling rendered Bhai ineligible for adjustment of status and cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">The IJ then heard testimony on Bhai\u2019s asylum application. Bhai testified that he had been an active member of the MQM in Pakistan and organized and oversaw MQM rallies in Karachi. After the PPP came to power, its member began kidnapping, beating, and killing MQM members.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">About nine months before Bhai came to the United States, five or six men dressed as police officers entered his home, took him away in a car, and kept him in a darkened house, where he was beaten and given food fit only for a dog. After ten days, his mother secured his release with the help of members of the community. Once released, Bhai was hospitalized for ten days. He then went into hiding, moving from one relative\u2019s home to another until he left for the United States. Bhai said that his uncle was killed by the PPP in 1997 and that Bhai feared the PPP would kill him if he returned to Pakistan.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">On cross-examination, the government read from Bhai\u2019s 1993 asylum application, in which he stated that the police threw him in jail for ten days because he got into a fight with the police chiefs son. The government then asked Bhai to explain the inconsistencies between his 1993 asylum application and his hearing testimony. Bhai stated that he had not understood English, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-9\">[Bhai]: I don\u2019t understand why people always think that I (indiscernible), because I don\u2019t understand in English what is it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-10\">[Government]: Okay. But, sir, your asylum application also refers to your MQM membership. Weren\u2019t you a member of MQM?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-11\">[Bhai]: Yes, it is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-12\">[Government]: And what about the activities listed in your asylum application regarding your day-to-day activities with the party, aren\u2019t those details correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-13\">[Bhai]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-14\">[Government]: Okay. But you\u2019re saying the part about your actual arrest in Pakistan is not correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-15\">[Bhai]: I didn\u2019t understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7i\">[Government]: So it\u2019s your contention that all of the information in this asylum application from 1993 related to your detention is not correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-16\">[Bhai]: I don\u2019t know where (indiscernible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-17\">[Government]: So there\u2019s also no mention in this asylum application of a ten-day hospital stay. How do you explain that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-18\">[Bhai]: I don\u2019t know why (indiscernible). Looks like he didn\u2019t ask me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-19\">Bhai also admitted that his mother and brother continued to live in Pakistan and had not been arrested, detained, or tortured. Bhai also admitted that his uncle was not an MQM member. Bhai said that his uncle was killed solely because he knew Bhai and that the PPP killed him as he drove away on a scooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-20\">The IJ then showed Bhai the transcript of his 2009 credible fear interview, in which Bhai stated that local police had taken him for ten days. The IJ asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>Bhai whether he knew in 2009 that the men were not in fact police. Bhai responded that he was \u201cnow so confused\u201d as to whether they were the police \u201cor somebody in the police dress.\u201d Bhai said the men were dressed as the police, but took him to a house rather than the police station, which \u201cmeans that they were not police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">I. IJ\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">In his oral decision, the IJ found Bhai removable under INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(A)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), as an alien present in the United States without being admitted or paroled. The IJ further found that Bhai was also removable under INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i), as an alien who by fraud or willful misrepresentation sought to procure an immigration benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">The IJ found that Bhai\u2019s \u201ctestimony concerning the misrepresentation is not credible,\u201d and gave \u201cgreater credence to the testimony of Donald Lee.\u201d In support of his credibility determination, the IJ noted that Bhai\u2019s testimony that his attorney filled out the adjustment application without asking Bhai relevant questions about his criminal record \u201cseem[ed] somewhat implausible.\u201d The IJ further stressed that Bhai had not submitted any documents from his prior attorney to corroborate his claim or filed a complaint against his prior attorney with the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">The IJ also found Bhai\u2019s testimony about his ability to understand English \u201cto be somewhat evasive\u201d and found that Bhai\u2019s explanation that he did not know the meaning of the words \u201carrest\u201d and \u201cconviction\u201d \u201cto be without credence.\u201d The IJ noted that Bhai was educated and that the words were not complicated. The IJ found it implausible that Bhai did not understand the words \u201carrest\u201d and \u201cconviction\u201d given that he had been living in the United States for fifteen years at the time of his adjustment interview and he had, in fact, been arrested and convicted in California. Further, Bhai never explained what he understood the words \u201carrest\u201d and \u201cconviction\u201d to mean and his demean- or when answering questions about his understanding of those words was evasive. The IJ also found it implausible that Bhai would have answered \u201cno\u201d in the adjustment interview if he did not fully understand the meaning of the word arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">In light of the IJ\u2019s findings that Bhai misrepresented his criminal history in his 2005 adjustment application and in his 2006 adjustment interview, the IJ concluded that Bhai was inadmissible under INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i), and thus was ineligible for adjustment of status and cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-15\">The IJ denied Bhai\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal because Bhai \u201cha[d] not met his threshold burden of presenting credible and consistent evidence and documents in support of his application.\u201d The IJ pointed out that Bhai\u2019s 2011 hearing testimony about his ten-day detention in Pakistan was inconsistent with Bhai\u2019s statement in his original 1998 asylum application, his mother\u2019s statement in support of Bhai\u2019s 2010 asylum application, and his 2009 credible fear interview. Specifically, at the 2011 hearing, Bhai claimed that the men who took him from his mother\u2019s home and detained him for ten days were merely dressed as police officers, but were not in fact police. However, Bhai\u2019s 2009 asylum application, his 2009 credible fear statement, and his mother\u2019s 2010 affidavit all identified the men as real police officers who were supporters of the PPP. The IJ concluded that this was \u201ca significant discrepancy\u201d that went \u201cto the heart of [Bhai\u2019s] claim that he was detained in Pakistan for about ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>days.\u201d The IJ also noted that Bhai did not mention hospitalization at his credible fear interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The IJ identified several implausibilities in Bhai\u2019s claim. Specifically, the IJ found it implausible that: (1) the PPP did not bother Bhai\u2019s family in Pakistan for seven years after Bhai left, but then killed Bhai\u2019s uncle as retaliation against Bhai; (2) Bhai\u2019s father then \u201cplace[d] himself in harm\u2019s way\u201d by taking over the uncle\u2019s store, where the PPP had come looking for Bhai and had killed the uncle; and (3) neither the PPP\u2019s ten-day detention of Bhai in 1990 nor the PPP\u2019s killing of Bhai\u2019s uncle in 1997 was ever reported to the Pakistan police. Based on the forgoing, the IJ found that Bhai had \u201cnot met his burden of presenting a credible, consistent, plausible and believable account of his claim,\u201d and denied his claim on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Alternatively, the IJ denied Bhai\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims \u201con the merits.\u201d The IJ concluded that Bhai had failed to show past persecution by the Pakistani government or a group that the government was unwilling or unable to control. The IJ noted that Bhai did not present any evidence that the men who targeted him worked for the government. Instead, Bhai claimed that his harassers were private individuals associated with the PPP. And, as Bhai never made the government aware that these men sought to harm him, he did not show the government could not control them.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">The IJ also found that Bhai failed to establish that he had a well-founded fear of persecution. The IJ pointed out that (1) Bhai had not shown he could not relocate within Pakistan to avoid harm, (2) Bhai\u2019s father had continued to live in Pakistan unharmed, and (3) given Bhai\u2019s \u201cless than important role\u201d in the MQM, Bhai had not explained why anyone in Pakistan would want to harm him 21 years after he left Pakistan.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">Because Bhai was not eligible for asylum, the IJ concluded that Bhai was also ineligible for withholding of removal. The IJ also found that Bhai had failed to show that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to Pakistan, and thus, he was not entitled to CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">J. BIA Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">In his appeal to the BIA, Bhai argued that the IJ had erred in finding that: (1) he was inadmissible because he misrepresented his criminal history in his 2005 adjustment application and interview; and (2) he had not established eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal based on past or future political persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">The BIA affirmed the IJ and dismissed Bhai\u2019s appeal. With respect to Bhai\u2019s inadmissibility under INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i), the BIA concluded that the IJ did not clearly err in finding Bhai\u2019s testimony not credible and in giving greater credence to Lee\u2019s testimony. Because Bhai was inadmissible under INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a) (6)(C) (i), and was not eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility, the BIA also affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of Bhai\u2019s application for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-13\">With respect to Bhai\u2019s asylum claim, the BIA found no clear error in the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. The BIA noted some of the inconsistencies between Bhai\u2019s 2011 hearing testimony, his 1993 and 2009 asylum applications, and his statements during his 2009 credible fear interview. At his hearing, Bhai testified that he was detained by men dressed in police uniforms, but that he later learned they were not actually police officers. In contrast, in his credible fear interview, Bhai referred to the men as police. In her affidavit in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>support of Bhai\u2019s 2009 asylum application, Bhai\u2019s mother also had said that the men were police. The BIA also pointed out that in his 1993 asylum application, Bhai said that the police jailed him because he had fought with the police chiefs son. As had the IJ, the BIA concluded that these inconsistencies went to the heart of Bhai\u2019s claim because they involved both the identity of his captors and the events that led to his detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">In addition, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s finding that some of Bhai\u2019s testimony was implausible, specifically noting Bhai\u2019s testimony that his uncle was killed by men who were looking for Bhai. The BIA questioned the fact that seven years had passed without incident between Bhai\u2019s 1990 detention and his uncle\u2019s death in 1997. The BIA agreed that it was implausible that Bhai\u2019s father would knowingly place himself in harm\u2019s way by taking over the uncle\u2019s shop and also that Bhai\u2019s father would not then be harmed by the same men who had killed his uncle and were reportedly still looking for Bhai. Finally, the BIA deferred to the IJ\u2019s finding that Bhai\u2019s testimony was evasive and non-responsive.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">The BIA also concluded that Bhai had failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution because: (1) Bhai did not sufficiently corroborate his claim that his uncle was killed by people looking for Bhai; and (2) Bhai did not show why anyone in the Pakistan government would be interested in him more than twenty years after his departure and fifteen years after his uncle\u2019s death, particularly given that Bhai\u2019s family remained in Pakistan unharmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">Given that Bhai had not established asylum eligibility, the BIA concluded that Bhai also failed to meet the higher eviden-tiary burden for withholding of removal. It further concluded that Bhai had not demonstrated entitlement to CAT relief because he had not shown that he more likely than not would be tortured in Pakistan. The Bhais filed this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">A. Bhai\u2019s Inadmissibility under INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">Under INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i), \u201c[a]ny alien who, by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact, seeks to procure ... a visa, other documentation, or admission into the United States or other benefit provided under [the INA] is inadmissible.\u201d Where an alien is charged with inadmissibility, he has the burden of proving that he is \u201cclearly and beyond doubt entitled to admission, and that he [is] not inadmissible under any of the grounds enumerated in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a).\u201d <em>Garces v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>611 F.3d 1337, 1345-46 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(2)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(2)(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To qualify for adjustment of status under INA \u00a7 245(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\u00ae, an alien must be \u201cadmissible\u201d to the United States. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 245(i)(2)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(2)(A).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision to sustain the fraud-based charge of inadmissibility against Bhai and therefore deny his application for adjustment of status. It is undisputed that in 1993 Bhai was arrested and convicted in California of a crime, that Bhai inaccurately stated under oath on his 2005 adjustment application that he had never been arrested and convicted, and that Bhai repeated that false assertion to Officer Lee during the 2006 adjustment interview. Although Bhai testified that he did not intend to deceive and merely misunderstood the question, the IJ found Bhai\u2019s testimony incredible.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">Furthermore, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Officer Lee was credible, but Bhai was not. The IJ\u2019s reasons for discrediting Bhai included Bhai\u2019s evasive demeanor, the implausibility of his account, and the lack of corroborating evidence in support of his testimony. The record reflects that, although Bhai testified that he misunderstood the words \u201carrest\u201d and \u201cconviction,\u201d he refused to give clear answers as to his understanding of those words. Bhai also failed to account for his ability to respond accurately to other questions of equal complexity during the 2006 interview, on his adjustment application, or on his 1993 asylum application, when his language skills presumably would have been even more limited. Bhai\u2019s claim that he misunderstood the words \u201carrest\u201d and \u201cconviction\u201d is particularly suspect given that he was actually arrested and convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Bhai placed much of the blame on his prior attorney. For instance, Bhai said that his prior attorney completed his adjustment application without asking Bhai about his criminal history and refused Bhai\u2019s request for a translator at the adjustment interview. However, Bhai did not submit any corroborating evidence from his prior attorney and did not file a bar complaint against his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">There is no merit to Bhai\u2019s contention that his retraction during the interview is evidence of his lack of intent to deceive. First, according to Officer Lee\u2019s credited testimony, Officer Lee was unaware of Bhai\u2019s conviction during the interview. Officer Lee explained that he would have noted on the adjustment paperwork if Bhai had admitted to the arrest or conviction during the interview and would have had Bhai initial the notation. Officer Lee\u2019s adjustment paperwork did not contain such a notation. Thus, under Officer Lee\u2019s credited version of events, corroborated by the adjustment paperwork, Bhai did not make a retraction during the interview. In any event, even if Bhai\u2019s claimed retraction were credited, it does not compel reversal because Bhai admitted he only retracted his false answer after Officer Lee showed him the conviction record.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">As the BIA noted, the IJ could have conceivably weighed the evidence differently, and accepted Bhai\u2019s version of events. However, that possibility does not compel a reversal. <em>See Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1254-55 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify reversal of the agency\u2019s findings). In sum, substantial evidence supports the finding that Bhai willfully misrepresented his criminal history in an attempt to procure a benefit under the INA, i.e., adjustment of his status to lawful permanent residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">B. Bhai\u2019s Asylum and Withholding of Removal Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">To establish eligibility for asylum, an applicant must show, with credible, di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>rect, and specific evidence, either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA \u00a7\u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1), INA \u00a7 101(a)(42), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42); <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286-87 (11th Cir.2005); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b). Similarly, to be eligible for withholding of removal Under the INA, an applicant must show that it is more likely than not that he has been or will be persecuted on account of one of the five protected grounds. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3); <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232 (11th Cir.2005). Because this standard is more stringent than the standard for asylum, an alien who fails to establish asylum eligibility generally cannot satisfy the higher burden for withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>at 1232-33.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">If the IJ finds an asylum applicant not credible, the IJ must make an explicit adverse credibility finding and offer \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d for the finding. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287 (quotation marks omitted). \u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1255. \u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility determination was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">Although uncorroborated but credible testimony may be sufficient to demonstrate asylum eligibility, \u201c[t]he weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony, ... the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cConversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial\u201d of an applicant\u2019s claim, especially if the applicant fails to produce corroborating evidence. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">Here, the adverse credibility determination is supported by specific, cogent reasons, including: (1) the inconsistencies between Bhai\u2019s testimony and other items of evidence; (2) the implausibility of his claim concerning his uncle\u2019s death; and (3) his evasive demeanor during the hearing. The record supports these bases.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">For example, in his 1993 asylum application, Bhai attributed his ten-day detention to punishment for fighting with the police chiefs son, and he stated that the police put him in jail, rather than in a house. However, in subsequent immigration applications and interviews, Bhai changed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>account substantially, describing the reason for his detention as his political affiliation, the men who detained him as PPP members, and the location as a dark house. Meanwhile, Bhai\u2019s later accounts were inconsistent with his mother\u2019s affidavit, in which she identified the men as police officers. Bhai was unable to clearly reconcile these inconsistencies before the IJ, and continued to change his answer even then, responding at one point, for example, that perhaps the men were police.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s finding that certain aspects of Bhai\u2019s claim concerning his uncle\u2019s death were implausible. Bhai testified that PPP members killed his uncle in 1997 because they were looking for Bhai. Yet, Bhai conceded that neither he nor his family had any issues with the PPP during the period of time after his release from detention in 1990 until he left Pakistan for the United States in 1991. Further, his uncle\u2019s death was the first alleged violent act against Bhai\u2019s family by the PPP after Bhai left, though six years had passed without incident. And, the BIA reasonably noted that it was implausible that Bhai\u2019s father would expose himself to possible harm by taking over Bhai\u2019s uncle\u2019s shop, or that, after having done so, the men looking for Bhai would not similarly harm his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">We defer to the IJ\u2019s finding as to Bhai\u2019s demeanor. Because an IJ \u201cis [uniquely] positioned to make determinations about demeanor \u2014 by observing the alien and assessing his or her tone and appearance\u201d\u2014 we give \u201cgreat deference to an IJ\u2019s assessment of \u2018demeanor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Todorovic v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>621 F.3d 1318, 1324-25 (11th Cir.2010). Bhai has not offered any reason why we should withhold such deference in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">Furthermore, apart from Bhai\u2019s discredited testimony, none of the other evidence compels a conclusion that Bhai suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution. For example, Bhai\u2019s only evidence that he was an active MQM member in Pakistan is his own testimony. Beyond his own testimony, the only evidence concerning Bhai\u2019s ten-day detention, the basis of his past persecution claim, was his mother\u2019s affidavit, which partially contradicted his own account.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">Similarly, the only evidence corroborating Bhai\u2019s claims concerning his Uncle\u2019s death were the affidavits of his mother and cousin, but these affidavits were not wholly consistent with each other or with other evidence in the record. Bhai\u2019s cousin stated that Bhai\u2019s uncle was shot and killed in his store by the \u201cstrong political group\u201d that harassed Bhai. Notably, the death certificate for Bhai\u2019s uncle indicates that his death was caused by \u201ccardiac respiratory arrest due to fire calm injury [sic]\u201d and that Bhai\u2019s uncle died in the hospital, not in his shop, as claimed by Bhai\u2019s cousin, or on the road as claimed by Bhai\u2019s mother. Even to the extent these affidavits support Bhai\u2019s claims, they are not substantial enough to compel reversal. <em>See Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201 (explaining that when the applicant\u2019s testimony is weak, the need for corroborative evidence is great).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">Further, although Bhai\u2019s mother stated that PPP members continue to look for Bhai and have come to her house and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>harassed her and her family, Bhai conceded at the hearing that no one in his family has been harmed in the thirteen years since his uncle\u2019s death in 1997. As the BIA pointed out, the fact that Bhai\u2019s family has remained unharmed in Karachi, Pakistan since 1997 undermines his mother\u2019s assertion of potential future harm. <em>See Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1259 (concluding that an asylum applicant failed to show future persecution in part because his family remained in the same region of Colombia without incident).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Bhai also submitted an expert report on Pakistan by Dr. Shaul Gabbay. Dr. Gab-bay opined that Bhai faces danger if returned to Pakistan given, in relevant part, the past physical abuse Bhai suffered based on his political beliefs. Dr. Gab-bay\u2019s opinion, however, rested on the same statements concerning Bhai\u2019s MQM membership and his detention by the PPP that the IJ found not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Dr. Gabbay further opined that Bhai primarily risks danger from the Taliban and religious extremists with anti-western sentiments who would view him as a U.S. spy, a claim Bhai has never raised. Dr. Gabbay also stated that there has been political violence between two competing factions of the MQM \u2014 the MQM-H and the MQM-A. However, Bhai has never claimed to be a member of either of these factions or to fear harm from either of them. Dr. Gabbay\u2019s report did not mention any political violence between the PPP and the MQM, which is the basis for Bhai\u2019s particular persecution claims. Thus, Dr. Gabbay\u2019s report is not persuasive in assessing Bhai\u2019s future persecution claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">The record contains other background information about political violence and instability in Pakistan, including: (1) the U.S. State Department\u2019s 2008 Human Rights Report on Pakistan, which reported extrajudicial and politically motivated killings, torture, and disappearances, sometimes carried out by the police;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (2) news reports of killings of MQM members by unknown perpetrators; and (3) reports about violence between numerous political and sectarian groups in Pakistan. However, in light of the adverse credibility determination, none of this evidence compels the conclusion that Bhai himself would be \u201csingled out\u201d for harm because of his political opinion if he returned to Pakistan. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (stating that an asylum applicant must present evidence showing \u201ca good reason to fear that he or she will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Bhai failed to establish asylum eligibility. Because Bhai could not show eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to demonstrate that he was eligible for withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 1232-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">For these reasons, we conclude the IJ properly found Bhai inadmissible due to his willful misrepresentations in his adjustment application and interview and, thus, ineligible for adjustment of status. We also conclude the IJ properly found that Bhai failed to carry his burden to show he was eligible for asylum or withholding of removal. We deny Bhai\u2019s petition with respect to these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">We dismiss the petition as to Bhai\u2019s claim for CAT relief for lack of jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>because he failed to exhaust this issue in his appeal to the BIA. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); Ama<em>ya-Arbunduaga v.

We deny Minaz\u2019s withholding of removal claim because \"there are no derivative benefits associated with the grant of withholding of removal.\u201d See <em>Delgado v.

Because Bhai\u2019s application was filed before May 11, 2005, however, the new standards do not apply to his asylum and withholding of removal claims. <em>See Shkambi v.

We need not resolve whether adverse credibility determinations in pre-REAL ID Act cases must go to the heart of the claim, however, because, as the BIA pointed out, Bhai\u2019s inconsistencies regarding the reasons for his detention and the identity of his captors go to the heart of Bhai\u2019s claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b890-7\">.
