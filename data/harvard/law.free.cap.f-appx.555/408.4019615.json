Aragon contends that the district court violated his due process rights by prohibiting him from presenting testimony from a defense witness, Jose Flores. He asserts that the government substantially interfered with Flores\u2019s decision whether to testify by threatening that he would be indicted for additional crimes and that his plea agreement would be invalidated if he testified for the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-16\">The existence of substantial governmental interference with a defense witness\u2019s free and unhampered choice to testify is a factual question that we typically review for clear error. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>130 F.3d 676, 686-87 (5th Cir.1997). As Aragon did not raise a claim of substantial interference in the district court, however, our review is for plain error only. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 134, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Binker, </em>795 F.2d 1218, 1228 (5th Cir.1986). And, he cannot succeed on plain error review because his claim of substantial interference could have been resolved if he had properly raised it in the district court. <em>See United States v. Chung, </em>261 F.3d 536, 539 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-17\">In any event, Aragon cannot demonstrate error, plain or otherwise, with regard to his claim of substantial interference. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 134, 129 S.Ct. 1423; <em>United States v. Viera, </em>839 F.2d 1113, 1115 (5th Cir.1988) (en banc); <em>Thompson, </em>130 F.3d at 686-87. He has failed to show that the government substantially interfered with Flores\u2019s free decision to testify or that his defense was prejudiced by any such interference. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number><em>Viera, </em>839 F.2d at 1115. The record does not reflect that the government made any threats, express or implied, directed at Flores or related to him. There is no indication that the government\u2019s discussion with Flores\u2019s counsel or its arguments to the district court about the likely consequences of Flores\u2019s testimony were improper. <em>See id.; Thompson, </em>130 F.3d at 687. Furthermore, the record reflects that Flores\u2019s decision not to testify was an informed choice based on his concerns about self-incrimination and future prosecution and was not the result of impermissible interference by the government. <em>See United States v. Girod, </em>646 F.3d 304, 312 (5th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Bieganowski, </em>313 F.3d 264, 291 (5th Cir.2002). Neither has Aragon shown that Flores\u2019s testimony would have been material or exculpatory. <em>See Viera, </em>839 F.2d at 1115; <em>Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b433-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
