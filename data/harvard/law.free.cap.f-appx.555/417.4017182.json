Wilson contends that (1) the district court erroneously denied relief based on the 2007 amendments to the guideline instead of the 2010 amendments, and (2) he was eligible for a sentence reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B) because, after the district court had denied his \u00a7 3582 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>motion, his sentence was reduced based on the government\u2019s motion pursuant to Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which, in turn, reduced his guideline range under the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">We review the denial of a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. O\u2019Keefe, </em>128 F.3d 885, 892 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Caulfield, </em>536 Fed.Appx. 509, 509-10 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 708, 187 L.Ed.2d 570 (2013). A motion for reconsideration \u201cmust clearly establish either a manifest error of law or fact or must present newly discovered evidence\u201d and \u201ccannot be used to raise arguments which could, and should, have been made before the judgment issued\u201d or \u201cto argue a case under a new legal theory.\u201d <em>Simon v. United States, </em>891 F.2d 1154, 1159 (5th Cir.1990) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Wilson\u2019s position is without merit. First, the record reflects that the district court properly construed his \u00a7 3582 motion as arising under the 2010 amendments. In its order denying the motion, the court stated that the FSA did not reduce Wilson\u2019s guideline range. Second, because Wilson argues that he is entitled to a sentence reduction pursuant to a new legal theory, i.e., U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B), that was not presented to the district court, he has not shown a manifest error of law or fact. <em>See Simon, </em>891 F.2d at 1159. Third, even if we assume that Wilson has shown that his guideline range was reduced by the FSA, the court exercised its discretion and decided that a further sentence reduction was not warranted based on the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and specifically noted that Wilson distributed significant amounts of cocaine, that he was a leader or manager of the conspiracy, and that he received an obstruction-of-justice enhancement. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826-27, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">The court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for reconsideration. <em>See O\u2019Keefe, </em>128 F.3d at 892. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b441-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
