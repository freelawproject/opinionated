On appeal, Rivas argues that: (1) his prior convictions under the Florida fleeing and eluding statute did not qualify as violent felonies under the ACCA; (2) the district court erred in classifying one prior conviction under the Florida fleeing and eluding statute as a violent felony under the ACCA where that conviction was not charged in his indictment, in light of <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013); and (3) the district court should not have classified his prior Florida burglary convictions as violent felonies under the ACCA because the Florida burglary statute is indivisible in light of <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), and his burglary convictions did not constitute generic burglaries under the ACCA. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a particular prior conviction qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>United States v. Petite, </em>703 F.3d 1290, 1292 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 182, 187 L.Ed.2d 124 (2013). We review sentencing objections based on <em>Alleyne </em>that were not preserved before the district court for plain error. <em>United States v. McKinley, </em>732 F.3d 1291, 1295-96 (11th Cir.2013). This standard requires that \u201c(1) there must be error; (2) the error must be plain; (3) the error must affect the appellant\u2019s substantial rights, and (4) the error must seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Pantle, </em>637 F.3d 1172, 1174 (11th Cir.2011) (quotation omitted). We are bound to follow the decisions of the Supreme Court unless and until those decisions are overruled. <em>See United States v. Gandy, </em>710 F.3d 1234, 1237 n. 3 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 304, 187 L.Ed.2d 216 (2013). We also must follow the holding of a prior panel of this Court \u201cunless and until it is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court or by this court sitting en banc.\u201d <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-16\">First, we are unconvinced by Rivas\u2019s argument that his prior convictions did not qualify as violent felonies under the ACCA. A defendant is a \u201ccareer offender\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) if at the time of his instant offense of conviction he has \u201cthree previous convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Under the ACCA, a \u201cviolent felony\u201d is one that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-17\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-18\">(2) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-19\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-20\">In <em>Petite, </em>we held that a simple fleeing and eluding conviction under Florida\u2019s fleeing and eluding statute is categorically a violent felony under the ACCA because there is an inherent risk of violence in using a vehicle to flee and elude a police officer. 703 F.3d at 1296, 1300-01. Using a vehicle to flee shows a \u201cdetermination to elude capture,\u201d in defiance of law enforcement, that \u201cmakes a lack of concern for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>the safety of property and persons of pedestrians and other drivers an inherent part of the offense.\u201d <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 2273, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011). Beyond posing serious and substantial risks, we also determined that the risks posed by simple vehicle flight are similar in degree of danger to the risks of arson and burglary. <em>Petite, </em>703 F.3d at 1295-96; <em>Sykes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2274 (noting that vehicle flight actually \u201cpresents more certain risk as a categorical matter than burglary\u201d). Accordingly, \u201cany form of intentional vehicle flight from a police officer presents powerful risks comparable to those presented by arson and burglary.\u201d <em>Petite, </em>703 F.3d at 1296 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">Here, Rivas has been convicted of fleeing to elude under Florida\u2019s fleeing and eluding statute twice. We\u2019ve already held, in <em>Petite, </em>that acts of fleeing and eluding pose serious and substantial risks of danger. 703 F.3d at 1295-96. <em>Petite </em>has not been overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation, so we are bound by our decision. <em>Archer, </em>531 F.3d at 1352. Therefore, the district court did not err when it found that Rivas\u2019s convictions for fleeing to elude qualified as violent felonies under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">We are also unpersuaded by Rivas\u2019s claim that the district court plainly erred under <em>Alleyne. </em>In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that a prior conviction is not a fact that must be alleged in the indictment or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219. The Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decisions in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), did not disturb the holding of <em>Almendarez-Torres. United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">In <em>Alleyne, </em>the Supreme Court overturned <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002), and held that any factor that increases a defendant\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence is an element of the crime that must be found by a jury. <em>Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2155. <em>Alleyne, </em>however, did not address prior-conviction sentencing enhancements. Instead, the Supreme Court explicitly stated that it was not revisiting the \u201cnarrow exception to this general rule for the fact of a prior conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2160 n. 1. As the Supreme Court has yet to overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>we continue to follow that case as binding precedent. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>242 F.3d 1028, 1035 (11th Cir.2001) (noting that we are \u201cbound to follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>unless and until the Supreme Court itself overrules that decision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">Here, the district court did not plainly err when it determined that Rivas\u2019s fleeing and eluding conviction that was not charged in his indictment qualified as a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>Alleyne </em>expressly left <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>undisturbed, and we are bound to follow <em>Al-mendarez-Torres </em>as binding precedent. <em>Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2160 n. 1.; <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219; <em>Thomas, </em>242 F.3d at 1035. Therefore, Rivas\u2019s prior conviction for fleeing and eluding did not need to be charged in his indictment in order to qualify as a violent felony under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-12\">Finally, because we\u2019ve found no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Rivas\u2019s two fleeing and eluding convictions and his uncontested federal drug crime conviction qualify as violent felonies, these three convictions are sufficient for purposes of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>ACCA and the district court did not err in sentencing Rivas as an armed career criminal. Moreover, we need not address his argument concerning a fourth conviction\u2014 that Florida\u2019s burglary statute is over-broad. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
