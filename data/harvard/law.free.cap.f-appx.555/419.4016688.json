The magistrate judge (MJ) denied the motion because Mayberry\u2019s ha-beas case was closed and he had not established any basis for further filings in the case. The district court denied Mayber-ry\u2019s objection to the MJ\u2019s order and his motion for reconsideration, and Mayberry now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of those motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">We do not consider Mayberry\u2019s argument, raised for the first time on appeal, that his constitutional rights have been violated based on his inability to obtain free copies of court records. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Neither will we consider the arguments raised for the first time in Mayberry\u2019s reply brief, which include his complaints concerning the dismissal of his appeal in <em>Mayberry v. Thaler, </em>No. 13-10077. <em>See United States v. Jimenez, </em>509 F.3d 682, 693 n. 10 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Contrary to Mayberry\u2019s contention, neither 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250 nor 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(c) provides him with a basis for requesting free copies of documents filed in his closed habeas case. Mayberry\u2019s motion for documents was a \u201cmeaningless, unauthorized motion\u201d over which the district court had no jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994). We therefore AFFIRM district court\u2019s orders denying Mayberry\u2019s objection to the MJ\u2019s order and denying his motion for reconsideration. We also WARN Mayberry that if he continues to file repetitious and frivolous filings requesting free copies of court records, he could face sanctions, including dismissal, monetary sanctions, or restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court or any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
