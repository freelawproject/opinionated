After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-22\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"AOb\">A. Offense Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b935-23\">Pitter, a citizen of Jamaica, first entered the United States in 2000, when he was 18 years\u2019 old. From November 2002 to March 2003, Pitter, under the name \u201cTroy Williams,\u201d conspired with others to distribute between 5 and 15 kilograms of cocaine. Pitter drove quantities of cocaine from Florida to Ohio, and at the time of his arrest, he had over $30,000 in cash on his person and in his suitcase. In October 2003, Pitter was convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and sentenced to 96 months\u2019 imprisonment and 5 years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-24\">Pitter\u2019s advisory guidelines range for the drug-trafficking offense was 121 to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment. Pitter\u2019s 96-month <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>sentence was a result of a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 for his substantial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">On May 6, 2010, after he served his prison sentence, Pitter was deported to Jamaica. Sometime thereafter, law enforcement discovered that Pitter had returned to the United States and was residing in Florida under the name \u201cJermaine Ayala.\u201d In February 2013, Pitter was arrested and charged with illegal reentry of a deported alien. In May 2013, Pitter pled guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement. In the plea agreement, the government agreed not to charge Pitter for impersonating a U.S. citizen, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">Also, because Pitter was on supervised release for his 2003 drug-trafficking offense when he reentered the United States, he was separately charged with violating the terms of his supervised release. Pitter admitted that he had committed the violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">B. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) prepared for Pitter\u2019s illegal reentry case calculated a total offense level of 21, which included: (1) a base offense level of 8, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a); (2) a 16-level increase, pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), because Pitter was previously deported following a drug-trafficking conviction for which his sentence exceeded 13 months; and (3) a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">Pitter received three criminal-history points for his 2003 drug-trafficking offense and another two points because he committed the instant offense while on supervised release for the drug-trafficking offense. His five criminal history points yielded a criminal history category of III. With an adjusted offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of III, the PSI suggested an advisory guidelines range of 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b936-12\">In a sentencing memorandum, Pitter asked for a 24-month prison sentence because (1) he previously cooperated with the government in relation to his 2003 drug-trafficking conviction, and (2) he reentered the United States, as his codefendants had returned to Jamaica and were threatening to harm Pitter and his mother due to Pitter\u2019s prior cooperation. As further support for his request for a downward variance, Pitter asserted that his advisory guidelines range substantially overrepresented his criminal history and the likelihood that he would reoffend because the PSI used his 2003 drug-trafficking conviction, his only prior criminal offense, to increase his sentence by 16 levels and to increase his criminal history category.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-13\">Pitter also noted that the government determined that he was ineligible for the \u201cfast-track program,\u201d which applies to defendants charged with illegal reentry, because he had a prior conviction and was on supervised release when he was arrested for the illegal reentry offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pitter con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>tended that the fast-track program created sentencing disparities between similarly-situated defendants because the U.S. Attorney for each district had discretion as to whether a defendant was eligible for the program. Finally, Pitter requested that the district court consider several mitigating factors, including his lack of positive role models, his exemplary behavior while in prison for his 2003 drug-trafficking offense, and the fact that he was about to become a father.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">At sentencing, Pitter stated he had no objections to the PSI, and the district court adopted the PSI\u2019s advisory guidelines range of 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment. Pitter reiterated the arguments in his sentencing memorandum, adding, <em>inter alia, </em>that (1) he was culturally assimilated into the United States, even though most of his time in the country was spent in prison, and (2) he cooperated with law enforcement in the instant case and even provided information about the person who helped him obtain a fake identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">The government asked the district court to deny Pitter\u2019s request for a downward variance because Pitter had a history of illegally entering and committing crimes: on both occasions that he entered the United States, he assumed a false identity, and during his first stay, he was convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">The district court stated it had considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court found that Pitter did not leave Jamaica to protect his mother, as she was still living there. The court further found that it was \u201cperfectly fine\u201d to use Pitter\u2019s prior 2003 drug-trafficking offense to increase both his offense level and his criminal history category. The court also (1) acknowledged Pitter\u2019s argument concerning \u201c[t]he disparity in Fast-Track programs,\u201d (2) determined that Pitter had no \u201cright\u201d to be in the fast-track program, (3) found that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida had not discriminated against Pitter in finding him ineligible for the fast-track program, and (4) noted that, even if the U.S. Attorney had found Pitter eligible, the court would still not be required to reduce Pitter\u2019s sentence based on his eligibility for the fast-track program.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">The district court found insufficient cultural assimilation to warrant a variance, but determined that it would consider Pit-ter\u2019s cooperation in the case in deciding where to sentence within the advisory guidelines range. The court observed that Pitter had a conviction for a serious drug-trafficking offense, involving large amounts of cash, and that Pitter\u2019s below-guidelines sentence for that offense had not deterred him from committing further criminal activity because he had illegally returned to the United States and assumed someone else\u2019s identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">The district court determined that a sentence at the low end of the advisory guidelines range of 46 to 57 months was appropriate and imposed a 46-month prison sentence. As to the supervised release violation, the district court sentenced Pit-ter to a four-month prison sentence to run concurrently with the sentence imposed in his illegal reentry case. Pitter appealed the 46-month sentence imposed in the illegal reentry case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b937-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ApB\">A. Prior Felony Drug Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b937-13\">As Pitter concedes, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>forecloses any argument that the existence of a defendant\u2019s prior felony drug conviction needed to be admitted in his guilty plea or otherwise proven beyond a reasonable doubt before that conviction could be used to increase his statutory maximum sentence and advisory guidelines range, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 239, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1222, 1228, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (holding that a prior conviction used to increase a defendant\u2019s statutory maximum sentence under \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is not an element of the offense and, thus, need not be alleged in the indictment or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt); <em>United, States v. Palomino Garcia, </em>606 F.3d 1317, 1337 (11th Cir.2010) (holding that, under <em>Almenda-rez-Torres, </em>a prior conviction used to increase a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 2L1.2 does not need to be alleged in the indictment or proved beyond a reasonable doubt and that <em>Almendarez-Torres \u201c </em>\u2018remains the law until the Supreme Court overrules it\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">B. Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We first determine whether the district court committed any significant procedural error<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and then examine whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). The abuse of discretion standard \u201callows a range of choice for the district court, so long as that choice does not constitute a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted). We ordinarily expect a sentence within the advisory guidelines range to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of proving the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">Pitter\u2019s only procedural argument is that the district court misinterpreted his argument \u201cthat the government\u2019s uneven application of [the fast-track] program created unwarranted sentencing disparities that the court should take into account in fashioning a reasonable sentence under \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\">After reviewing the sentencing transcript, we conclude that the district court did not misconstrue Pitter\u2019s sentencing-disparity argument and properly declined to consider the disparities created by the fast-track program in weighing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a) factors. Congress contemplated that the fast-track program would create disparities between defendants because \u201ca defendant may benefit from its application only on motion of the government, and only if the Attorney General has authorized the [fast-track program] in that district.\u201d <em>United States v. Arevalo-Juarez, </em>464 F.3d 1246, 1251 (11th Cir.2006). Thus, this Court has held that sentence disparities based on the uneven application of the fast-track program are not \u201cunwarranted sentencing disparities for the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a)(6)\u201d and that it is impermissible for a district court to consider such disparities. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, had the district court actually considered the disparities created by the fast-track program, as Pitter urged, the district court would have abused its discretion by considering an impermissible factor. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">We also conclude that Pitter\u2019s 46-month prison sentence was substantively reasonable. His 46-month sentence is at the bottom of his advisory guidelines range of 46 to 57 months, and we ordinarily expect a guidelines sentence to be reasonable. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. In addition, his 46-month sentence was well below the statutory maximum penalty of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment, which is a \u201cfurther indicator the sentence was reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. McKinley, </em>732 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">In choosing where to sentence Pitter within the advisory guidelines range, the district court considered Pitter\u2019s cooperation with the government as a mitigating factor. It also acknowledged Pitter\u2019s arguments in support of a variance from his advisory guidelines range. Despite Pitter\u2019s arguments, the district court was entitled to conclude that a downward variance from the advisory guidelines range was not warranted, in light of (1) the severity of Pitter\u2019s prior felony drug conviction, involving Pitter\u2019s use of an alias and large amounts of cocaine and cash, and (2) his use of a false identity after illegally reentering the country.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">Further, in sentencing Pitter, the district court was entitled to place weight on the need to deter Pitter from committing future criminal activity, as Pitter\u2019s prior below-guidelines sentence for his 2003 drug-trafficking had not deterred him from illegally reentering the United States and assuming a false identity. Under the totality of the circumstances, we cannot say that Pitter\u2019s 46-month prison sentence was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">For all the foregoing reasons, we affirm Pitter\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b936-8\">. Under \u00a7 1326(a) the statutory maximum for illegal reentry of a deported alien is two years\u2019 imprisonment. However, because of Pitter's 2003 drug-trafficking conviction, his statutory maximum became 20 years' imprisonment under \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b936-9\">. A defendant eligible for the \u201cfast-track program\u201d may receive a downward departure of not more than four levels under the Sentencing Guidelines. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K3.1; <em>United States v. Campos-Diaz, </em>472 F.3d 1278, 1279 n. 1 (11th Cir.2006). Some districts do not have fast track programs, as they must be authorized by the U.S. Attorney General and the district's U.S. Attorney. <em>Campos-Diaz, </em>472 F.3d at 1279 &amp; n. 1. The Southern District of Florida has a fast-track program; however, under that program, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>deny an individual defendant\u2019s participation if the defendant is \u201cunder any form of court or correctional supervision\u201d or if any \"other aggravating factors [are] identified.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b937-14\">. Pitter has not appealed the judgment in his supervised-release revocation case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b938-6\">. A district court can commit procedural error by \"failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b938-7\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b939-7\">. We note that our prior precedent forecloses any argument by Pitter that the district court engaged in improper \"double counting\u201d by using his prior drug-trafficking conviction to increase his base offense level by 16, pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A), and to increase his criminal history category. See <em>United States v. Adeleke, </em>968 F.2d 1159, 1160-61 (11th Cir.1992) (rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that a district court engaged in improper \"double counting\u201d when it uses a defendant\u2019s prior convictions to increase his criminal history category and offense level).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
