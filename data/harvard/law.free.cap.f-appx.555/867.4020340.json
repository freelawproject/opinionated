Moody appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment filed against him, which charged him with unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(e). On appeal, Moody argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that \u00a7 922(g) is an unconstitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power as applied to purely intrastate conduct, such as mere possession of a firearm, under <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995). Moody concedes that this argument is foreclosed by our existing precedent but claims that it would be appropriate for us to review our stance on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g) in light of our \u201cpotential expansion of the principles of <em>Lopez </em>as expressed in <em>Florida v. U.S. Department of Health,\u201d Florida ex rel. Attorney General v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, </em>648 F.3d 1285 (11th Cir.2011), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part sub nom. Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, </em>567 U.S. -, 182 S.Ct. 2566, 183 L.Ed.2d 450 (2012). Moody also contends that \u00a7 922(g) violates the Tenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of state sovereignty and the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss the indictment for an abuse of discretion, and we review any underlying legal errors de novo. <em>United States v. Broughton, </em>689 F.3d 1260, 1272 (11th Cir.2012). We also review de novo a district court\u2019s conclusion as to the constitutionality of a challenged statute, <em>United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 943 (11th Cir.2006), and whether a criminal statute is unconstitutionally vague. <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>712 F.3d 498, 504 (11th Cir.2013). In addition, the law of this Circuit is \u201cemphatic\u201d that only the Supreme Court or this Court sitting en banc can judicially override a prior panel decision. <em>Cargill v. Turpin, </em>120 F.3d 1366, 1386 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), it is unlawful for a convicted felon \u201cto ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d In <em>Lopez, </em>the Supreme Court held that gun control legislation related to possession of firearms in school zones was an invalid exercise of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power partly because the statute could not be sustained under the reasoning that the regulated activities, in the aggregate, substantially affected interstate commerce. <em>See Lopez, </em>514 U.S. at 561, 115 S.Ct. at 1631. In addition, the Supreme Court emphasized that the challenged statute \u201ccontain[ed] no jurisdictional element which would ensure, through case-by-case inquiry, that the firearm possession in question affectfed] interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">Since <em>Lopez, </em>we have continually held that \u00a7 922(g) is not a facially unconstitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power because unlike the statute at issue in <em>Lopez, </em>\u00a7 922(g) contains a jurisdictional requirement. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Jordan, </em>635 F.3d 1181, 1189 (11th Cir.2011) (\u201cWe have repeatedly held that Section -922(g)(1) is not a facially unconstitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s power under the Commerce Clause because it contains an express jurisdictional requirement.\u201d); <em>United States v. Scott, </em>263 F.3d 1270, 1273 (11th Cir.2001) (reaffirming the holding that \u201cthe jurisdictional element of the statute, <em>i.e., </em>the requirement that the felon \u2018possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition,\u2019 immunizes \u00a7 922(g)(1) from [a] facial constitutional attack\u201d); <em>United States v. Dupree, </em>258 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2001) (upholding the conclusion that \u201cthe jurisdictional element of \u00a7 922(g) brings it within the commerce powers of the Congress\u201d); <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 389-90 (1 1th Cir.1996) (holding that the jurisdictional element of \u00a7 922(g) defeats a facial challenge to the statute even after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Lopez).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">More relevant to Moody\u2019s argument here, we have also held that \u00a7 922(g) is not unconstitutional as applied to a defendant who merely possessed a firearm within state lines so long as the government introduces sufficient evidence showing that the firearm has a minimal nexus to interstate commerce, <em>i.e., </em>that the firearm was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>manufactured, assembled, or sold outside the state or that it travelled in interstate commerce. <em>See, e.g., Jordan, </em>635 F.3d at 1189 (holding that \u00a7 922(g) was not unconstitutional \u201cas applied to a defendant who possessed a firearm only intrastate\u201d because the government demonstrated that the firearm involved in that case was manufactured and assembled outside the state); <em>Dupree, </em>258 F.3d at 1260 (holding that \u00a7 922(g) requires only a minimal nexus to interstate commerce and that the defendant\u2019s actions of brandishing a firearm in Georgia that was manufactured in California satisfied the jurisdictional requirement of \u00a7 922(g)); <em>McAllister, 77 </em>F.3d at 390 (holding that even in the wake of <em>Lopez, </em>\u00a7 922(g) is constitutional as applied to a defendant who merely possessed a firearm within state lines so long as the firearm has a \u201cminimal nexus\u201d to interstate commerce). As it is undisputed that the firearm involved in this case was manufactured outside the state of Florida, the jurisdictional element of \u00a7 922(g) was satisfied, and the statute is not unconstitutional as applied to Moody\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">In addition, Moody argues that our decision in <em>Florida ex rel. Attorney General v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, </em>648 F.3d 1235, somehow altered our prior holdings with respect to the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g) as a valid exercise of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power. In that case, we held that the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act exceeded Congress\u2019s regulatory powers under the Commerce Clause because it compelled citizens to engage in commercial activity and regulated inactivity. <em>Id. </em>at 1311-13. However, our decision in that case did nothing to abrogate or reverse our prior holdings regarding the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g), and thus Moody\u2019s reliance on that case is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Furthermore, we have held that Congress does not violate the Tenth Amendment when it enacts legislation through the constitutionally permissible exercise of its Commerce Clause power. <em>See Cheffer v. Reno, </em>55 F.3d 1517, 1521 (11th Cir.1995) (\u201cBecause the [challenged statute] is within Congress\u2019 Commerce Clause power, it does not violate the Tenth Amendment.\u201d); <em>see also New York v. United States, </em>505 U.S. 144, 174, 112 S.Ct. 2408, 2427, 120 L.Ed.2d 120 (1992) (holding that legislation enacted under the valid exercise of Congress\u2019s commerce power does not intrude on the sovereignty reserved to the states by the Tenth Amendment). Moreover, we have held that \u00a7 922(g) does not violate the Tenth Amendment. <em>See, e.g., Hiley v. Barrett, </em>155 F.3d 1276, 1277 (11th Cir.1998), aff'g <em>Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Emps., Inc. v. Barrett, </em>968 F.Supp. 1564, 1577-78 (N.D.Ga.1997) (affirming the district court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 922(g) does not violate the Tenth Amendment .because it represents a valid exercise of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power). Thus, Moody\u2019s argument that \u00a7 922(g) violates the Tenth Amendment by encroaching on traditional state police powers necessarily fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Lastly, a criminal statute is unconstitutionally vague and violates due process \u201cif it fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits\u201d or if \u201cit authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>United States v. Wayerski, </em>624 F.3d 1342, 1347 (11th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). The plain language of \u00a7 922(g) makes clear that it is unlawful for any person who has been convicted of a felony to \u201cpossess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition,\u201d and as Moody has failed to show how that provision is so vague that a person of ordinary intelligence would have to guess at its meaning, his void-for-vagueness argument must fail. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number><em>Indigo Room, Inc. v. City of Fort Myers, </em>710 F.3d 1294, 1301 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-3\">Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Moody\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
