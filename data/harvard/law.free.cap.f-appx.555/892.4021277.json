She contends that the ALJ gave improper weight to her treating physician\u2019s silence about her residual functional capacity. She also challenges an adverse credibility finding regarding her assertions about the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of her symptoms, and she argues that the ALJ erred by failing to address an affidavit from her sister. Finally, she challenges a vocational expert\u2019s testimony given in response to a hypothetical question that she asserts was incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-19\">When the ALJ denies benefits and the Appeals Council denies review, we review the ALJ\u2019s decision as the Commissioner\u2019s final decision. <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001). We review <em>de novo </em>the legal conclusions and consider the factual findings conclusive if supported by substantial evidence. <em>Lewis v. Barnhart, </em>285 F.3d 1329, 1330 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">Clyburn first contends that, in making a residual functional capacity finding, the ALJ gave improper weight to her treating physician Dr. Torres\u2019 silence regarding Clyburn\u2019s functional capacity. The ALJ noted that \u201cDr. Torres did not offer any limitations or restrictions on the claimant\u2019s activities of daily living and his opinion was given great weight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">When a doctor\u2019s silence about a claimant\u2019s ability to work is subject to competing inferences, we have stated that no inference should be drawn from that silence. <em>See Lamb v. Bowen, </em>847 F.2d 698, 703 (11th Cir.1988). Contrary to Cly-burn\u2019s contentions, however, the ALJ did not base his residual functional capacity determination merely on Dr. Torres\u2019 silence with respect to Clyburn\u2019s functional limitations. The ALJ also considered Dr. Torres\u2019 findings about Clyburn\u2019s lack of a history of swelling or progressive joint deformity, his conclusion that Clyburn\u2019s clinical course was atypical for rheumatoid arthritis, and his conclusion that he was unable to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis based on his observations. Furthermore, the ALJ observed that in her own testimony Clyburn \u201creluctantly admitted\u201d that she was able to engage in certain \u201cactivities of daily living,\u201d which provided additional support for the residual functional capacity finding that the ALJ made. Regardless of how the ALJ interpreted Dr. Torres\u2019 silence about Clyburn\u2019s functional capacity, substantial evidence, including Clyburn\u2019s own testimony and the medical evidence in the record, supports the ALJ\u2019s the residual functional capacity determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">Clyburn contends that the ALJ erred by concluding that her assertions about the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of her symptoms were not credible. As a general rule, \u201ccredibility determinations are for the ALJ.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Heckler, </em>734 F.2d 513, 517 (11th Cir.1984). \u201cAfter considering a claimant\u2019s complaints of pain, the ALJ may reject them as not creditable, and that determination will be reviewed for substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Marbury v. Sullivan, </em>957 F.2d 837, 839 (11th Cir.1992). If the ALJ discredits subjective testimony, he must explicitly and adequately articulate his reasons. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">The ALJ specifically and adequately articulated his reasons for the adverse credibility determination in this case, and substantial evidence supports that determination. The ALJ found inconsistencies in Clyburn\u2019s testimony. For example, she testified on direct examination that she could not lift a gallon of milk, but when questioned by the ALJ admitted that she could lift her 26-pound baby, \u201cif she has to.\u201d She also testified that she was unable to drive after knee surgery but that she was in a car accident one month after the surgery. She stated that was able to drive even though she was not supposed to be driving, and the ALJ found that her testimony called into question whether Clyburn was ignoring her physicians\u2019 advice. The ALJ found that these and other inconsistencies diminished Clyburn\u2019s \u201coverall credibility.\u201d Although Clyburn attempts to qualify her testimony and rebut the ALJ\u2019s interpretation of it, the record establishes that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">Nor did the ALJ err by not explicitly discussing statements contained in an affidavit by Clyburn\u2019s sister. Because the ALJ expressly rejected as not credible Clyburn\u2019s testimony about the severity of her pain and the extent of her limitations, he impliedly rejected the statements in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>affidavit as well. <em>See Allen v. Schweiker, </em>642 F.2d 799, 801 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">As for the hypothetical question that the ALJ posed to the vocational expert, the ALJ was not required to include findings that he properly rejected as unsupported. <em>See Crawford v. Comm\u2019r Soc. Sec., </em>368 F.3d 1155, 1161 (11th Cir.2004). The ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question adequately accounted for Clyburn\u2019s impairments. Furthermore, the expert testified that Clyburn could perform her past relevant work, and Clyburn failed to demonstrate otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
