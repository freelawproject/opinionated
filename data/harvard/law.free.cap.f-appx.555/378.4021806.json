As discussed in detail below, the employee failed to attend several discovery proceedings and a hearing before the district court. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">In May 2012, Plaintiffs, Atlantic Sounding Co., Inc., and Weeks Marine, Inc., (\u201cPlaintiffs,\u201d collectively) filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that they did not owe Maurice Fendlason, an injured seaman-employee, maintenance and cure benefits. Fendlason filed an Answer and counterclaim against Plaintiffs seeking damages for negligence or unseaworthiness, as well as maintenance and cure.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Beginning in the fall of 2012, Fendlason repeatedly failed to appear for various proceedings, and failed to comply with district court orders. On October 10, 2012, Fend-lason did not attend a scheduled deposition. On November 28, 2012, the district court granted a Motion to Withdraw filed by counsel for Fendlason, who claimed that Fendlason had not only failed to attend his deposition, but had also failed to attend meetings with him and to return counsel\u2019s phone calls. The motion by counsel included Fendlason\u2019s current address and telephone number. The district court also ordered Fendlason to enroll new counsel of record or notify the court of his intention to proceed <em>pro se </em>within 30 days. Fendlason failed to take action in response to the Order. On December 5, 2012, Fendlason was again absent at a deposition despite having been served with a subpoena to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">On January 9, 2013, Plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss the action under Rule 37 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure due to Fendlason\u2019s failure to attend the October and December depositions, or alternatively for failure to prosecute. Service of the motion was completed on January 11, 2013, at Fendlason\u2019s mother\u2019s residency using the address provided by Fendlason\u2019s counsel. A hearing was scheduled on Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to dismiss for January 30, 2013. On January 28, 2013, the district court entered an order (the \u201cShow Cause Order\u201d) which continued the hearing on the motion to dismiss until February 22, and also ordered Fend-lason to \u201cshow cause why the Court should not dismiss the ... action with prejudice for failure to prosecute or, alternatively, as a sanction for failure to attend his deposition or abide by this Court\u2019s order issued on November 28, 2012.\u201d On February 3, 2013, the Plaintiffs served the Show Cause Order at the address provided in the motion to withdraw. Despite proper service and notice, Fendlason failed to appear for the hearing on Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to dismiss and Show Cause Order on February 22, 2013. As a result, the district court granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion and issued an order dismissing the action with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-14\">On March 4, 2013, after the dismissal, Fendlason filed an ex parte motion to enroll new counsel of record. On March 21, 2013, Fendlason, through his new attorney, subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration of the district court order dismissing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>the action with prejudice, which the district court denied. Fendlason appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">We review the district court\u2019s imposition of sanctions for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s factual findings underlying the imposition of sanctions are reviewed for clear error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dismissal with prejudice is the \u201cseverest sanction possible,\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and we affirm such a dismissal only if: \u201c(1) there is a \u2018clear record of delay or contumacious conduct by the plaintiff,\u2019 and (2)\u2019lesser sanctions would not serve the best interests of justice.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201c[Dismissal with prejudice is a more appropriate sanction when the objectionable conduct is that of the client, and not the attorney.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">On appeal, Fendlason argues that the district court abused its discretion when it dismissed the action with prejudice because it failed to consider alternative lesser sanctions. Fendlason contends that the district court could have entered an order for Fendlason to appear for his deposition under threat of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">This court \u201cnormally only affirms the sanction of dismissal with prejudice where the district court has also found that \u2018lesser sanctions would not serve the best interests of justice.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, this court has also recognized that a district court may \u201cimplicitly reject[]\u201d lesser sanctions as inappropriate when it determines that dismissal was the only effective option.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-19\">Here, the district court dismissed the action because of Fendlason\u2019s repeated failure to attend properly noticed depositions and comply with court orders. This conduct is directly attributable to Fendla-son, and not his attorney, as it took place both before and after his original counsel withdrew from representation. In addition, Fendlason\u2019s failure to act was one of the reasons that drove original counsel to withdraw, as discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-20\">We find that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it dismissed the instant action with prejudice. Fendlason\u2019s lack of action shows a \u201cclear record of delay or contumacious conduct\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> sufficient to warrant dismissal. In addition, our cases \u201chave recognized that advance warnings of possible default mitigate the requirement that the district court consider lesser sanctions.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Fendlason had at least two warnings that dismissal was possible in this case. The first came on January 9, 2013, when the Plaintiffs filed their Motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>to Dismiss. The second, stronger warning occurred on January 28, 2013, when the district court issued its Show Cause Order in which it made clear that dismissal was imminent should Fendlason fail to appear before the court on February 22, 2013. Fendlason avers that a lesser sanction, such as requiring attendance at a deposition with the threat of dismissal, should have been considered by the district court. However, the Show Cause Order offered an identical threat \u2014 attend or have your case dismissed \u2014 and Fendlason failed to appear. The district court was not required to repeat the same warning. The district court did not abuse its discretion when, after adequate warning, it dismissed the action with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">For the above reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b403-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
