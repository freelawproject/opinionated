Reid was a principal in the first degree to the murder of Mrs. Bronstein, for which the jury sentenced him to death. On appeal to this Court Reid raised, in addition to the claimed disproportionality of the death sentence in his case, two issues relating to guilt or innocence and fourteen issues relating to the death sentence. In an opinion filed November 8, 1985, we found no merit in Reid\u2019s contentions of error at the trial on guilt or innocence. On the basis of the record then before us, we found that at the sentencing hearing the trial judge improperly excluded two character letters offered by Reid, each of which purported to be from an official at the Baltimore City Jail. Consequently, we would have issued a mandate affirming the convictions and sentences, except as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>to the death sentence which the mandate would have vacated with a remand for a new sentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">On November 22, 1985, the State filed a Motion for Reconsideration and Stay of Issuance of Mandate, with supporting affidavits from the Warden of the B\u00e1ltimore City Jail, and from the Administrative Director of therapeutic programs at that facility. The substance of the State\u2019s motion and of the affidavits is \u201cthat the writers of [the two] letters do not exist, and that the letters are thus bogus.\u201d The State requests that we remand this case pursuant to Maryland Rule 871 for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of authenticity \u201cwith directions that if the circuit court finds that the letters are authentic, it shall proceed with resentencing, and if the circuit court finds that the letters are not authentic, it shall return the record to this Court for review of Appellant\u2019s remaining challenges to his sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">As a result of our decision, hereinafter explained, to grant the State\u2019s motion we have today directed the Clerk of this Court to withdraw the opinion filed on November 8, 1985. A copy of that opinion is attached hereto for informational purposes and is marked \u201cAppendix A.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">We hereby incorporate by reference into this opinion parts I A and I B from Appendix A. For the reasons therein set forth there is no error in the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Reid filed a response to the Motion for Reconsideration raising three grounds of opposition: (1) the death penalty statute does not permit a limited remand; (2) objection to the letters on the basis of authenticity was waived; and (3) Rule 871 cannot be used to correct errors committed during the trial itself. For the following reasons we reject Reid\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">Md. Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 414(f) provides that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-11\">with regard to the death sentence, [this] Court shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>(i) Affirm the sentence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-5\">(ii) Set aside the sentence and remand the case for the conduct of a new sentencing proceeding under \u00a7 413; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">(iii) Set aside the sentence and remand for modification of the sentence to imprisonment for life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">These provisions do not apply at this stage of the case. They relate to a mandate which finally adjudicates the merits of a death sentence review. No mandate issued under the opinion attached as Appendix A. We do not reach the merits of the death sentence in this opinion and do not issue any mandate finally adjudicating the merits of the death sentence review. Section 414(f) is not an implied repeal of MD.R. 871.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Further, \u00a7 414(f) cannot have the effect of precluding a limited remand. <em>See Harris v. State, </em>299 Md. 511, 474 A.2d 890 (1984) (limited remand entered in capital case without vacating death sentence, to determine under former Md.R. 73111 whether appellant had been denied effective representation of counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">Because the grounds given by the State at the sentencing hearing for its objection to the letters never raised an issue of authenticity, Reid argues that any authenticity objection has been waived. Of course, by offering the letters, Reid impliedly represented that they were genuine. Indeed, defense trial counsel expressly and on the record represented, presumably innocently, to the State, to the trial court, and thereby to this Court that the character letters were \u201cfrom individuals who know Mr. Reid.\u201d Whatever the extent of the State\u2019s waiver might be for purposes of reviewing objections on evidentiary grounds, the waiver does not extend to a waiver of any opportunity to demonstrate that the letters are in fact bogus, if such an opportunity is allowed by this Court under MD.R. 871.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">MD.R. 871 in pertinent part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">If it shall appear to this Court that the substantial merits of a case will not be determined by affirming, reversing or modifying the judgment from which the appeal was taken, or that the purposes of justice will be advanced by permitting further proceedings in the cause, either through amendment of the pleadings, introduction of additional evidence, making of additional parties, or otherwise, then this Court, instead of entering a final order affirming, reversing or modifying the judgment from which the appeal was taken, may order the case to be remanded to the appropriate court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Reid contends that the issue of whether the letters are genuine or bogus cannot be addressed under MD.R. 871 because it is not collateral to the proceedings. Reid refers to <em>Gill v. State, </em>265 Md. 350, 357, 289 A.2d 575, 579 (1972), where we said that MD.R. 871</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqs\">may be suitable to correct procedures subsidiary to the criminal trial, [but] it can never be utilized to rectify prejudicial errors committed during the trial itself. The admissibility of a confession is always an integral part of the trial. This is not only true of the confession, per se, but also encompasses the entire process of ascertaining, prima facie, that it was legally obtained. [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">In <em>Gill </em>a trial judge, sitting nonjury, had admitted a confession without the State\u2019s having made a prima facie showing of voluntariness. Under a Rule 1071 remand, which the Court of Special Appeals had ordered, evidence of voluntariness given by the police officers who had custody of Gill when his confession was obtained would, under the Maryland procedure, have to have been re-evaluated in connection with all the evidence of guilt or innocence, even in a bench trial. Consequently the issue on remand was integral and not collateral to the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number><em>Gill </em>was distinguished in <em>Wiener v. State, </em>290 Md. 425, 430 A.2d 588 (1981). The question there was whether Wiener\u2019s right to the effective assistance of counsel had been prejudiced because an undercover agent for the Attorney General was employed in the office of the District Public Defender who was representing Wiener. We said that \u201c[ujnlike the issue relating to the voluntariness of the confession in <em>Gill, </em>evidence given in support of, or in opposition to, Wiener\u2019s motion to dismiss is not presented again in the course of the trial for consideration with all of the evidence bearing on guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438, 430 A.2d at 596. On our remand without affirmance or reversal, for the purpose of conducting a new hearing, we specifically stated the additional evidence \u201cmay include evidence directed to demonstrating and negating prejudice arising from [the undercover agent\u2019s] receipt of information in Wiener\u2019s statement, from defense suggestions made by [the undercover agent], or otherwise.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Rule 871 was employed in <em>Warrick v. State, 302 </em>Md. 162, 486 A.2d 189 (1985). There we held that the trial court had erred by misconstruing a discovery rule when the court concluded that the State had not violated its obligations under those rules. On remand the trial court was to determine whether the State possessed any information which should have been produced. If that were the fact, the trial court was then to exercise discretion as to the sanction, including \u201cevaluating whether a discovery violation has caused prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173, 486 A.2d at 194. <em>See Bailey v. State, </em>303 Md. 650, 496 A.2d 665 (1985) (Rule 871 remand to determine, <em>inter alia, </em>prejudice, if any, from discovery violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">With respect to the Rule 871 motion now before us, a remand to determine whether the letters are genuine or bogus will, as in <em>Wiener, Warrick, </em>and <em>Bailey, </em>determine whether there has been any prejudice. A remand in the instant matter is not for the purpose of giving the State an opportunity to demonstrate that what appeared to be error from the record presented to us for review was not error. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>The remand here will determine whether there has been a fraud on the court by presenting bogus letters as evidence. If it is determined that the letters are bogus, there can be no prejudice. Denial of an advantage obtained through working a fraud on the court is not prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">We recognize that the fraud alleged by the State in its motion is \u201cintrinsic\u201d as opposed to \u201cextrinsic\u201d fraud. <em>See Schwartz v. Merchants Mortgage Co., </em>272 Md. 305, 322 A.2d 544 (1974). Intrinsic fraud, which includes forged documents and perjured testimony, is not a basis for vacating an enrolled decree under \u201cthe principle that, once parties have had the opportunity to present before a court a matter for investigation and determination, and once the decision has been rendered <em>and the litigants, if they so choose, have exhausted every means of reviewing it, </em>the public policy of this State demands that there be an end to that litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 308, 322 A.2d at 546 (emphasis added). Here the mandate has not issued so intrinsic fraud may be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">We shall exercise our discretion under MD.R. 871 and grant the requested remand because of the unique facts in this case. Under its motion and supporting affidavits the State proposes to prove not simply that the content of the character letters is mistaken, inaccurate, or untrue but that the purported authors thereof do not exist. The remand will not be a rehashing of credibility issues. Whether the purported authors ever existed and thus, whether a fraud was committed on the court, can be determined objectively and from a review of public records as well as from live witness testimony under the peculiar facts in this case. From the content of the character letters one of the authors is represented to be Matthew Saunders, a captain at the Baltimore City Jail where he had been a correctional officer for eleven years and had been acquainted with Reid for one year preceding June 23, 1984. The other author was represented to be Vance Rosenbaum, Director of Treatment at the therapeutic community at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Baltimore City Jail known as Eager Village, where Rosenbaum is said to have been employed from at least June of 1983 to June 22, 1984. These representations of objective, historic, and readily determinable facts justify in this case applying the Rule 871 powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">On remand the circuit court shall conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the two letters are bogus in that their purported authors do not exist. If the court finds that the letters were in fact written by real persons who are the persons described by the content of the letters as the respective authors thereof, then the court should set aside the death sentence and promptly schedule a new sentencing hearing. If, on the other hand, the circuit court concludes that the letters are bogus because the persons described by the content of the letters as the respective authors thereof are not in fact real persons, then we shall review the death sentence as we are required to do by statute. <em>See </em>Art. 27, \u00a7 414(a); <em>Harris v. State, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">JUDGMENTS OF CONVICTION AND SENTENCES AFFIRMED, EXCEPT AS TO THE IMPOSITION OF THE DEATH SENTENCE FOR MURDER. MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION GRANTED.

State of Maryland, filed November 8, 1985; withdrawn December 17th, 1985)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">Appellant, Willie Reid (Reid), was convicted in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City of the murders and robberies of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Irvin and Rose Bronstein and of conspiracy to rob.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Reid was a principal in the first degree to the murder of Mrs. Bronstein, for which the jury sentenced Reid to death.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The cases are before us on appeals and a capital sentence review pursuant to Md. Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 414. We shall remand for a new sentencing proceeding in the capital case and in all other respects we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The bodies of the victims were found on May 20, 1983, in the living room of their home, a bungalow in the Pimlico section of Baltimore City. Each had been stabbed to death, with twelve stab wounds each. Mrs. Bronstein\u2019s body lay face down on the floor with her hands tied in front of her and with a scarf tied around her head. Mr. Bronstein\u2019s body was sprawled on a couch. His hands had been bound behind his back with a belt and he was gagged. There was a hood or cover over his face. The house had been ransacked.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The jury could have found from the State\u2019s proof that the Bronsteins were murdered by Reid and a John Marvin Booth (Booth) late in the afternoon of May 18, 1983. Booth resided at his mother\u2019s home located two houses from the Bronsteins\u2019 domicile. In the evening of May 18 Reid and Booth, with jewelry taken from the Bronsteins, went to the apartment at 400 North Aisquith Street of Yeronda Mazyck (Veronda), the woman with whom Reid was then living. After Booth\u2019s wife, Jewell, arrived at the apartment, the two couples returned to the Bronstein home to loot it further. They brought the loot back to Veronda\u2019s apartment in the Bronsteins\u2019 car. Part of the loot was fenced or bartered for hard drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Veronda\u2019s brother, 14-year-old Henry Mazyck (Henry), had been babysitting with her two children at the Aisquith Street apartment on the night of May 18, 1983. The next morning Reid admitted to Henry that Reid had stabbed Mrs. Bronstein while Booth had stabbed Mr. Bronstein.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Reid raises sixteen issues in addition to the claimed disproportionality of the death sentence in his case. We need consider only (I) the alleged trial errors and (II) certain proof offered by Reid but excluded at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">The State opened its case with the testimony of the Bronsteins\u2019 son, who had discovered their bodies, and of the first police officer to arrive at the scene. Each described what he had observed. The next witness was the homicide detective who had been in charge of the. investigation. Through him the State introduced a series of photographs presenting various rooms in the Bronstein home, most of which had been ransacked. Reid unsuccessfully objected to photographs of the living room which included the victims\u2019 bodies. He argued that the scene had been adequately described orally by the prior witnesses and that the prejudicial effect of the photographs outweighed any assistance which they might give the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">The admissibility of photographs is a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial judge and that discretion will not be disturbed unless plainly arbitrary. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>303 Md. 487, 502, 495 A.2d 1, 8 (1985). The photographs objected to in the instant matter are in black and white. They do not focus on the wounds of either victim. While some bloodstains are visible on the clothing of each victim, the photographs are not close-ups of the wounds and do not highlight the bloodstains in any way. Indeed, later in the trial the court excluded autopsy photographs which clearly depicted the wounds. There was no abuse of discretion, particularly in lgiht of the fact that the State was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>seeking first-degree murder convictions against Reid on the basis of premeditation as well as on a felony murder theory. The photographs present more clearly than words what the witnesses were attempting to describe concerning the bindings and the covers over the faces of the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Appellant also complains of the trial judge\u2019s having assisted Henry Mazyck\u2019s in-court identification. There was no objection when the witness was testifying on June 12, 1984. The jury began its deliberations on guilt or innocence on Thursday, June 14, and deliberated throughout Friday, June 15. Just before 6 p.m. on that date defense counsel, at the request of Reid, noted the objection now under consideration. The point has not been preserved. MD.R. 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">Further, the point has no merit. We interpret the record to reflect that the witness was looking over the heads of the persons seated at the trial tables and at persons in the spectator area of the courtroom. In order to save time the trial court directed the witness\u2019 attention to the persons at the trial tables. There were at least four such persons, two prosecuting attorneys, one defense attorney, and Reid.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Further, the error, if any, is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. This is not a case in which the victim of a crime is called upon to make an identification regarding a person who was seen only when the crime was committed. No one disputed that Henry Mazyck, as a result of visits to his sister\u2019s apartment, knew Reid. Indeed, Reid in his direct testimony at the trial on guilt or innocence described Henry\u2019s frequenting the Aisquith Street apartment, eating food intended for Veronda\u2019s children, and stealing \u201cmoney and stuff\u201d from Reid if he left it lying about.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">At sentencing proceedings before the same jury the State introduced the presentence investigation report which contained Reid\u2019s extensive criminal record and to which was appended the victim impact statement. Reid called five witnesses whose testimony was brief. The thrust of their evidence was that they were not aware of Reid\u2019s ever having hurt anyone physically. One of these witnesses told of Reid\u2019s having run errands for him following the witness\u2019 hospitalization. Cross-examination developed that the described events had occurred in 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Reid then offered two letters which the court refused to admit. Each letter was typewritten on the letterhead stationery of the warden of the Baltimore City Jail. They read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-9\">[Defendant\u2019s Exhibit No. 1 for identification at sentencing]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-10\">June 23, 1984</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Judge James Murphy</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad\">Baltimore City Circuit Courts</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW\">Calvert and Fayette Streets</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE2\">Baltimore, Maryland 21202</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\">RE: WILLIE REED</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">Your Honorable Judge Murphy:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">It is with great concern that I write this letter on behalf of Mr. Willie Reed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-8\">I have been a correctional officer at Baltimore City Jail for eleven (11) years.

Following that colloquy, Reid exercised his right of allocution to the jury and the court adjourned at 2:45 p.m. The court directed counsel to be in chambers at 9:30 the next morning. The record for Tuesday, July 24, begins with proceedings in open court at 11:35 a.m. No testimony was taken. There is no explanation why the authors of the two letters, or the Ms. Budd referred to the preceding day, were not called as witnesses. There was no defense request for a postponement. So far as the record reveals nothing occurred between open court sessions which would bear materially on the ruling under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-16\">Md. Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol., 1985 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 413(c)(1) sets forth the ground rules for the admission of evidence in capital sentencing proceedings. The statute reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-17\">(c) <em>Evidence; argument; </em>instructions.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-18\">(1) The following type of evidence is admissible in this proceeding:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>(i) Evidence relating to any mitigating circumstance listed in subsection (g) of this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\">(ii) Evidence relating to any aggravating circumstance listed in subsection (d) of this section of which the State had notified the defendant pursuant to \u00a7 412(b) of this article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">(iii) Evidence of any prior criminal convictions, pleas of guilty or nolo contendere, or the absence of such prior convictions or pleas, to the same extent admissible in other sentencing procedures;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-8\">(iv) Any presentence investigation report. However, any recommendation as to sentence contained in the report is not admissible; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-9\">(v) Any other evidence that the court deems of probative value and relevant to sentence, provided the defendant is accorded a fair opportunity to rebut any statements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">The proffered letters are relevant. They are relevant to the mitigating factor set forth in \u00a7 413(g)(7): \u201cIt is unlikely that the defendant will engage in further criminal activity that would constitute a continuing threat to society.\u201d The State does not argue that the content of the letters is not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">Nor were the letters inadmissible as hearsay. The reference to \u201cevidence\u201d in \u00a7 413(c) does not establish a requirement that the strict rules of evidence are to be followed in the sentencing phase of a capital case. Section 413(c)(l)(v), by permitting the reception of \u201c[a]ny other evidence that the court deems of probative value and relevant to sentence,\u201d recognizes that the \u201cevidence\u201d which may be received at sentencing need not comply with the rules of evidence applicable at the guilt or innocence phase. All proof which meets the rules of evidence is probative. There would be no need to specify in \u00a7 413(c)(l)(v) that \"evidence\u201d at sentencing be deemed by the court to be of probative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>value unless the reception of proof outside of the rules of evidence were contemplated. Section 413(c) generally follows the law respecting receipt by a sentencing judge of information relevant to the sentence. <em>See Logan v. State, </em>289 Md. 460, 481, 425 A.2d 632, 643 (1981); <em>Henry v. State, </em>273 Md. 131, 147, 328 A.2d 293, 303 (1974); <em>Bartholomey v. State, </em>267 Md. 175, 193, 297 A.2d 696, 706 (1972). In this respect \u00a7 413(c)(l)(v) is like the Model Penal Code provision bearing on the reception of evidence where sentencing is by court and jury in a capital case. The Model Penal Code \u00a7 210.6, 10 U.L.A. 534, 535 (1974) in part provides that \u201c[a]ny such evidence, not legally privileged, which the Court deems to have probative force, may be received, regardless of its admissibility under the exclusionary rules of evidence, provided that the defendant\u2019s counsel is accorded a fair opportunity to rebut such evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The State argues that the trial judge could find that the proffered letters were not sufficiently probative so that there was no abuse of discretion in requiring that the authors be produced in person to testify. There was no question raised below by the State concerning the authenticity of the letters. Further, the letter from Captain Saunders recites that its content is based on his personal knowledge of the appellant over the preceding year. The letter from Mr. Rosenbaum is phrased as a description of personal observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Indeed, the trial judge indicated that he would have admitted the letters but for his concern over the penultimate paragraphs in each. Those paragraphs set forth the' personal opinions of the authors on the sentence which should be imposed and were objectionable as irrelevant. Defense counsel, however, expressly requested that the offending paragraph in the letter from Mr. Rosenbaum be redacted and the same suggestion would apply to the letter from Captain Saunders. There is no explanation why the trial court rejected that suggestion. The relatively simple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>mechanics of blocking out the offending paragraphs would not have delayed the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">We hold that the court abused its discretion in refusing to admit the proffered letters in redacted form. In <em>Johnson v. State, </em>292 Md. 405, 443, 439 A.2d 542, 563 (1982), we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">As is true in all other criminal causes, the sentencing authority in a death penalty case should be presented with a full range of relevant information so as to fashion a particular penalty in accord with \u201cthe prevalent modern penal philosophy of individualized punishment.\u201d <em>Logan v. State, supra, </em>289 Md. at 481, 425 A.2d at 643. The task that the sentencer must perform in this regard is thus basically no different from that carried out daily by trial judges in other types of cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">There is, and has been, nothing unusual about defense counsel presenting to the sentencing judge letters written on behalf of the convicted person by employers, family, clergy, and friends for whatever benefit those letters might bring.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">More important, the exercise of discretion by the trial court in rejecting the proffered letters, even if redacted, should be measured against the type of evidence which is expressly admissible on behalf of the State in a capital sentencing proceeding. Section 413(c)(l)(iv) makes any presentence investigation report admissible. Md. Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol., 1985 Cum.Supp.), Art. 41, \u00a7 124(d) required that the presentence report in this ease include a victim impact statement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The victim impact statement presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>relevant information, <em>see Lodowski v. State, </em>302 Md. 691, 738-42, 490 A.2d 1228, 1252-54 (1985), but presented it in hearsay form. The relevant information in the proffered letters, albeit in hearsay form, was as probative as the information in the victim impact statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Nor was the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Exclusion of the letters describing Reid\u2019s conduct in the year preceding trial enabled the prosecutor to make the following argument to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">[T]he defendant through his attorney could present any witnesses he wanted to you about his background, to say anything that they could possibly come up with that was good and decent about this man. And the people who came into this court said two things about him, that he is just a petty thief and they\u2019d be surprised if he were a killer. And the other thing was, Mr. Rogers came in and said that when he got out of the hospital, the defendant ran some errands for him. Of everybody that knows the defendant, of everything in his background, the best that people can say is, he\u2019s just a thief and that twelve years ago he did some kindness for some person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">The jury found that there were no mitigating circumstances so that the death sentence followed as a matter of course.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">JUDGMENTS OF CONVICTION AND SENTENCES AFFIRMED, EXCEPT AS TO THE IMPOSITION OF THE DEATH SENTENCE FOR MURDER; DEATH SENTENCE VACATED AND CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY FOR A NEW SENTENCING PROCEEDING UNDER \u00a7 413 OF ARTICLE 27.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-7\">. The spelling of appellant\u2019s name appears variously in the record as \"Reid\" or \u201cReed.\u201d We adopt the spelling used in the five indictments, in appellant\u2019s handwritten motions, and in the presentence report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b107-8\">.
