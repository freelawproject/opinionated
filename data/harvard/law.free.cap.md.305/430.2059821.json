The petition alleged violation of Disciplinary Rules 1-102(A)(1), (4), (5) and (6); 6-101(A)(2) and (3); and 7-101(A)(l), (2) and (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Pursuant to Rule BV9 b we referred the matter for hearing to a judge of the Seventh Judicial Circuit of Maryland. He has filed a comprehensive report with us in which he sets forth the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\">\u201c1. In October of 1981, Rick Griffith retained John Howell Sinclair to represent him in connection with his claim for monies due under a contract. A retainer fee of four hundred fifty dollars ($450.00) was paid by Mr. Griffith to Mr. Sinclair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">\u201c2. Mr. Sinclair filed a Declaration on Mr. Griffith\u2019s behalf in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County on October 29, 1981, to wit: <em>Griffith v. Gates, et at.; </em>Law No. 89,066.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-11\">\u201c3. Karl G. Feissner, as attorney for the Defendants in Law No. 89,066, filed a Motion for Production of Written Instruments on November 10, 1981, prior to filing an Answer. The Honorable James M. Rea granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>the Motion for Production of Written Instruments on November 30, 1981.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-4\"><em>\u201c4. </em>Mr. Griffith advised Mr. Sinclair that documents which would assist his case were located at the real estate office and Mr. Griffith\u2019s home and office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">\u201c5. Mr. Griffith and Joan F. Katz, Mr. Griffith\u2019s wife, telephoned Mr. Sinclair on a regular basis to check the status of the case and offer any information that was necessary. Mr. Sinclair repeatedly assured them that the case was progressing well and that no information was needed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">\u201c6. However, as indicated in the letter dated March 15, 1982, from Mr. Feissner to Mr. Sinclair, there had been no compliance by the Plaintiff with the Court\u2019s Order dated November 30, 1981, requesting the production of written instruments. Mr. Sinclair received and read the letter, but no timely response was filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">\u201c7. On April 27, 1982, the Defendants filed a counterclaim in Law No. 89,006. Mr. Griffith and Ms. Katz discussed the counterclaim with Mr. Sinclair. Mr. Sinclair found the claim \u2018funny\u2019 and indicated to Mr. Griffith and Ms. Katz that it would not present a problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">\u201c8. Mr. Sinclair failed to file a timely response to the Defendants\u2019 counterclaim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-9\">\u201c9. The Defendants moved for default judgment on their counterclaim. On July 9, 1982, judgment by default was entered against Rick Griffith because the Respondent had failed to file a timely response to the counterclaim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-10\">\u201c10. On August 6, 1982, Mr. Sinclair moved to set aside the judgment by default. The judgment by default was stricken on September 29, 1982.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-11\">\u201c11. Interrogatories were propounded on Mr. Griffith, care of Mr. Sinclair, on October 8, 1982. The Respondent failed to file timely answers to the Defendants\u2019 Interrogatories.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-12\">\u201c12. Mr. Sinclair received and read the letters dated October 7, 1982, November 8, 1982, and November 11, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>1982, from Mr. Feissner which requested Mr. Sinclair\u2019s immediate attention to the outstanding interrogatories. Mr. Feissner did not receive any timely response from Mr. Sinclair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-4\">\u201c13. On November 18, 1982, the Court granted Defendants\u2019 Motion to Compel Answers to Interrogatories.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">\u201c14. On January 3, 1983, the Court dismissed Plaintiff\u2019s Declaration and entered judgment by default in favor of the Defendants on their counterclaim against the Plaintiff because of the Plaintiff\u2019s incomplete response to the interrogatories.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">\u201c15. Rick Griffith and his wife learned of the default judgment entered on January 3, 1983, either from the Sheriff or when they were notified in writing by the Clerk of the Court. They contacted Mr. Sinclair who advised them that the default judgment was of little consequence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">\u201c16. At no time did Mr. Sinclair indicate to Mr. Griffith that Mr. Griffith may be subject to financial liability on the Defendants\u2019 counterclaim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">\u201c17. On February 23, 1983, the Plaintiff\u2019s Motion to Strike the Order of January 3, 1983, was denied. On March 16,1983, the Court denied the Plaintiff\u2019s Motion to Revise the Judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-9\">\u201c18. On March 21, 1983, Mr. Sinclair filed an Order for Appeal to the Court of Special Appeals from the judgment entered in Law No. 89,066.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-10\">\u201c19. On March 22, 1983, after Defendants\u2019 <em>Ex Parte </em>Proof of Damages, a total judgment of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) was entered in favor of the Defendants and against the Plaintiff, Rick Griffith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-11\">\u201c20. On May 5, 1983, the Court of Special Appeals dismissed Mr. Griffith\u2019s appeal from the judgment in Law No. 89,066 filed on his behalf by Mr. Sinclair because of Mr. Sinclair\u2019s failure to file an information report as required by Rule 1023.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-12\">\u201c21. Mr. Sinclair never communicated to Mr. Griffith the fact that he had lost the case or that the appeal had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>been dismissed. When Mr. Griffith telephoned Mr. Sinclair to question him on the One Hundred Thousand Dollar Judgment assessed against him, Mr. Sinclair advised Mr. Griffith that it was not his fault and that he should consider filing for bankruptcy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-4\">\u201c22. Mr. Griffith\u2019s wages were garnished and he had to refinance his home to satisfy the judgment. Mr. Griffith contacted a second attorney and a settlement in the amount of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) was negotiated with the Defendants. This amount was paid by Mr. Griffith to the Defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">In finding that Sinclair \u201cdid unethically and unprofessionally violate\u201d DR 1-102(A)(1), (4), (5) and (6); 6-101(A)(2) and (3), and 7-101(A)(l), (2) and (3), the judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">\u201cUnder all of the facts found above, it is this Court\u2019s opinion that it can reasonably conclude that Mr. Sinclair intentionally failed to seek the lawful objectives of his client and carry out his contract of employment entered into with Mr. Griffith. Further, since his intentional failure to pursue his client\u2019s claim resulted in a judgment of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00) against his client and dismissal of his client\u2019s claim, his actions prejudiced not only his client\u2019s rights to seek damages but also his client\u2019s financial status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">\u201cNeglect is evident. Mr. Sinclair\u2019s inattention to the case he accepted and his numerous failures to prepare timely responses resulted in the dismissal of his client\u2019s claim. Accordingly, Mr. Sinclair violated Disciplinary Rule 6-101(A)(2) and (3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">\u201cMr. Sinclair has committed an act of misconduct as defined in Maryland Rule BVlj by violating the aforesaid Disciplinary Rules. By consistently misrepresenting the status of the case to his client, Mr. Sinclair has violated Disciplinary Rule 1-102(A)(4). By his repeated failures to comply with the Maryland Rules of Procedure, by his repeated failures to respond to opposing counsel\u2019s requests and by his repeated failures to zealously represent his client\u2019s interests, Mr. Sinclair has engaged in a course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>of conduct in violation of Disciplinary Rule 1-102(A)(5) and (6).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Sinclair filed no exceptions to the findings of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">We suspended Sinclair for one year in <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Sinclair, </em>302 Md. 581, 490 A.2d 236 (1985). That case also involved neglect. Bar Counsel notes that the negligence found here occurred between 1981 and 1983 which is the same time period involved in that case. Sinclair was the prior recipient of a reprimand from us for neglect of legal matters entrusted to him. See <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Sinclair, </em>299 Md. 644, 474 A.2d 1338 (1984). We are advised that Sinclair was privately reprimanded by the Review Board in 1978 for two instances of neglect of a client\u2019s legal matters. Under the circumstances we see no alternative to disbarment. <em>See Md. St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Phoebus, </em>276 Md. 353, 347 A.2d 556 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE BV15 c, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST JOHN HOWELL SINCLAIR.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
