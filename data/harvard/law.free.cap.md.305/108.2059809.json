The question presented is whether this is such a collateral attack that no direct appeal is available. We hold that it is and thus we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals which dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b197-15\">On October 24, 1983, appellant Glenn Paul Valentine entered a plea of guilty in the Circuit Court for Baltimore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>County to a charge of child abuse. He was sentenced to twelve years in prison to run from April 27, 1983. On November 4, 1983, an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney addressed a letter to the trial judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">\u201cOn October 24, 1983, this defendant entered a guilty plea to child abuse in your court under an agreement for a 12 year sentence with credit for time served. The defendant was on parole at the time of the offense to which he pled guilty and the plea agreement did not deal with whether his new sentence shall be served concurrently or consecutively with his remaining parole time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\">\u201cIt has been brought to my attention that Article 41, \u00a7 123, mandates that new sentences given a parolee are consecutive to remaining parole time, unless the judge expressly orders to the contrary. Since your commitment in this case specified the 12 year sentence dates from April 27, 1983, you have, in effect, imposed a sentence concurrent with the defendant\u2019s remaining parole time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">\u201cSince there was no mention of this issue either in the plea agreement or during the sentencing hearing, it occurs to me that you may have imposed a concurrent sentence without intending to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">\u201cIt <em>was </em>the intention of the agreement to allow the defendant credit for time served awaiting trial. It <em>was not </em>the intention of the agreement to recommend a sentence concurrent or consecutive to the remaining parole time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">\u201cPlease treat this letter as a request for modification of sentence under Maryland Rule 774. I believe that Maryland Rule 777 concerning commitment records, and Article 27, \u00a7 638C, control this matter.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">The matter came on for hearing on December 6, 1983. Counsel for Valentine took the position that the action requested by the State would be an impermissible increase in the sentence. The trial judge agreed that it was not his intention to make the sentences concurrent. He ordered that Valentine serve the twelve-year term consecutively to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>the time to be served in his other case and gave credit for time served from April 27 to October 24, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">On December 12, 1983, Valentine entered an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. The appeal was withdrawn on December 19, 1983, and on the same day he filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This came on for hearing on January 20, 1984, where he argued, as he had done previously, that the modification from concurrent to consecutive was an illegal increase in sentence. The trial court denied his motion. An appeal to the Court of Special Appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The intermediate appellate court, in an unreported opinion (No. 108, September Term, 1984), dismissed the appeal, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">\u201cThe State maintains, and we agree, that an alleged illegal sentence is not a proper matter for review on direct appeal. The procedure the appellant should follow is that for relief under the Maryland Post Conviction Act. <em>See Preston v. State, </em>57 Md.App. 403[, 470 A.2d 395, <em>cert. denied, </em>300 Md. 89, 475 A.2d 1201] (1984).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">We granted Valentine\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari which set forth the questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">\u201c1. Is the denial of a defense motion to correct an illegal sentence directly appealable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-9\"><em>\u201c2. </em>When the court grants a State motion to modify a sentence, so that a concurrent sentence is made to run consecutively to a sentence from which the defendant was on parole, is the modified sentence illegal because it amounts to an increase in violation of former Maryland Rule 774b?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">In light of our determination of the first question we shall not be obliged to answer the second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">It is asserted that we have two distinct lines of cases on the subject, <em>Brady v. State, </em>222 Md. 442, 160 A.2d 912 (1960), and its progeny on the one hand and <em>State ex rel. Sonner v. Shearin, </em>272 Md. 502, 325 A.2d 573 (1974), and <em>Coles v. State, </em>290 Md. 296, 429 A.2d 1029 (1981), on the other. We believe our cases are reconcilable, although there may be some unfortunate dictum in <em>Coles.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Maryland\u2019s version of the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act came into the picture with the enactment of Ch. 44 of the Acts of 1958. In <em>State v. D\u2019Onofrio, </em>221 Md. 20, 28-29, 155 A.2d 643, 647 (1959), the Court quoted from then Code (1957, 1959 Cum.Supp.) Art. 27, \u00a7 645A(b) (now Code (1957, 1982 Cum.Supp.) Art. 27, \u00a7 645A(e)) to the effect that the remedy it provides \u201cis. not a substitute for, nor does it affect any remedies which are incident to the proceedings in the trial court ... or any remedy of direct review of the sentence or conviction.\u201d Judge Henderson then went on to say for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">\u201cThese provisions are virtually identical with those of the Uniform Acts, Post-Conviction Procedure Act, 9B U.L.A., sec. 1. In a comment by the Commissioners who prepared the Uniform Acts, it was noted: \u2018The aim of this section is to bring together and consolidate into one simple statute all the remedies, beyond those that are incident to the usual procedures of trial and review, which are at present available for challenging the validity of a sentence of imprisonment. * * * [It] is aimed to incorporate and protect all rights presently available under habeas corpus, coram nobis, or other remedies. The change is a procedural one.\u2019 \u201d 221 Md. at 29, 155 A.2d at 647.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number><em>Brady, </em>222 Md. 442, 160 A.2d 912, is the first case in which we were obliged to consider the impact of the Post Conviction Procedure Act in a context similar to that in the case at bar. After Brady had been convicted of murder and sentenced to death and the conviction affirmed on appeal by this Court, he filed a pleading in the trial court which, as Judge Horney put it for this Court, \u201ccombined a motion for new trial with a motion to set aside the judgment and sentence.\u201d The Court said, \u201c[I]f the motion is treated as one to strike out a judgment and sentence, it is ... clear that the provisions of the Post Conviction Procedure Act ... bar a direct appeal to this Court from an order refusing the motion,\u201d adding that the only way in which he might \u201ceffectively obtain a review by this Court of his claim that he was deprived of his constitutional right to due process ... [was] by instituting a proceeding for relief under the provisions of ... Code (1959 Cum.Supp.) Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 645A-645J.\u201d The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-4\">\u201cThe pertinent parts of \u00a7 645A, <em>supra, </em>read as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A71\">\u2018(a). Any person convicted of a crime and incarcerated under sentence of death or imprisonment, * * * who claims that the sentence or judgment was imposed in violation of the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution or laws of this State, or that the court * * was without jurisdiction to impose the sentence, or <em>that the sentence exceeds the maximum authorized by law, </em>or that the sentence is otherwise subject to collateral attack upon any ground of alleged error heretofore available under a writ of habeas corpus, writ of coram nobis, or other common law or statutory remedy, may institute a proceeding * * * to set aside or correct the sentence, provided the alleged error has not been previously and finally litigated or waived in the proceedings resulting in the conviction or in any other proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>that the petitioner has taken to secure relief from his conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\">(b). The remedy * * * is not a substitute for, nor does it affect any remedies which are incident to the proceedings in the trial court * * *, or any remedy of direct review of the sentence or conviction. A petition for relief * * * may be filed at any time. Hereafter no appeals to the Court of Appeals of Maryland in habeas corpus or coram nobis cases, or from other common law or statutory remedies which have heretofore been available for challenging the validity of incarceration under-sentence of death or imprisonment shall be permitted or entertained * * V \u201d 222 Md. at 446-47, 160 A.2d at 915. (Former emphasis deleted; new emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">After referring to that which we have previously quoted from <em>D\u2019Onofrio, </em>the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">\u201cWhile the P.C.P.A. did not abrogate the remedies formerly available under writs of habeas corpus and coram nobis and other common law and statutory remedies, it clearly took away the right of appeal from an order denying any of them. The act further provides, however, that \u2018any person, including * * * [the State], aggrieved by the order * * * passed in accordance with * * * [the act],\u2019 may apply to this Court within a 30-day period for leave to prosecute an appeal. See \u00a7 6451, <em>supra.\" </em>222 Md. at 447, 160 A.2d at 916.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Atc\">The appeal was dismissed without prejudice to Brady\u2019s right to seek post conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\"><em>Wilson v. State, </em>227 Md. 99, 175 A.2d 775 (1961), involved the precise issue here before the Court. Wilson was sentenced on July 6, 1960. On February 17, 1961, he filed a motion under then Rule 744 a to strike out and correct an illegal sentence. The rule provided, \u201cThe court may correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>an illegal sentence at any time,\u201d just as Rule 4-345 a now provides. Judge Hammond said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">\u201cThe case came here and was briefed and argued by appellant and the State on the premise or assumption that there now exists the same right of appeal from a refusal to correct a sentence, which we held, in <em>Roberts v. Warden, </em>206 Md. 246 [111 A.2d 597], existed before the enactment of the Post Conviction Procedure Act. That Act specifically provides in Code (1961 Supp.), Art. 27, Sec. 645A(b), that there no longer is an appeal to this Court \u2018in habeas corpus or coram nobis cases, or from other common law or statutory remedies which have heretofore been available * * *.\u2019 Maryland Rule 744 a has \u2018the force of law, until rescinded, changed or modified\u2019 by this Court or the Legislature under the express terms of Art. IV, Sec. 18, of the Constitution of Maryland and is, therefore, to be considered a \u2018statutory remedy\u2019 within the meaning of the Post Conviction Procedure Act (Sec. 645A(b) of Art. 27 of the Code).\u201d 227 Md. at 101, 175 A.2d at 776.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">After quotation from <em>D\u2019Onofrio </em>and citation to <em>Brady, </em>the Court dismissed the appeal \u201cunder Maryland Rule 835b(l) as an appeal not allowed by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\"><em>Harris v. State, </em>241 Md. 596, 217 A.2d 307 (1966), is yet another case involving the issue now before the Court. Harris took no direct appeal from his conviction and sentence. He did seek post conviction relief. His petition was dismissed without prejudice with his acquiescence. Thereafter he invoked the provisions of then Rule 764 a contending that a portion of his sentence was illegally imposed. He appealed the decision which \u201callow[ed] the three \u2018illegal\u2019 sentences to stand.\u201d The State moved to dismiss the appeal. The Court dismissed the appeal, referring to that portion of the Post Conviction Procedure Act which states that there is no longer an appeal to this Court \u201cin habeas corpus or coram nobis cases, or from other common-law or statutory remedies which have heretofore been available . . . . \u201d Judge Marbury said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>\"In <em>Wilson v. State, </em>227 Md. 99, 101, 175 A.2d 775, we held Rule 744 a, the predecessor of the present Rule 764 a, to be a \u2018statutory remedy\u2019 within the meaning of the above quoted portion of the Act, and we therefore held that an over-ruled motion to strike out a judgment and sentence was not reviewable by this Court, unless the proceeding below was brought under the Post Conviction Procedure Act. See also <em>Burley v. State, </em>239 Md. 342, 344, 211 A.2d 714 [ (1965) ]; <em>Costello v. State, </em>237 Md. 464, 470, 206 A.2d 812 [(1965)], and cases cited at page 101 of 227 Md.[, 175 A.2d 775].\u201d 241 Md. at 598, 217 A.2d at 308.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">It will be seen that <em>Brady, Wilson, </em>and <em>Harris </em>were collateral attacks after the time for direct appeal had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\"><em>Sonner, </em>272 Md. 502, 325 A.2d 573, was a direct appeal by the State. Notwithstanding the provisions of Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl.Vol., 1973 Cum.Supp.) Art. 27, \u00a7 36B making mandatory the imposition of no less than a minimum sentence of five years for the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony, providing that notwithstanding any other provisions of the law to the contrary no court should enter a judgment for less than the mandatory minimum sentence, and further providing that no court should suspend the mandatory minimum sentence, a trial judge had suspended a portion of a five year sentence. This action took place on March 20, 1974. On March 27, in an attempt to compel the revision of the sentence as to the handgun violation, the State\u2019s Attorney for Montgomery County filed a petition with us for the writ of mandamus, the writ of certiorari, \u201cor other appropriate relief.\u201d The trial judge was named as a defendant in that petition. We passed an order on April 4 directing that the petition should be held in abeyance pending application by the State\u2019s Attorney to the respondent judge pursuant to then Maryland Rule 764 a for an order nullifying the suspension of three years of the sentence. Such a motion was filed and denied. The State then appealed that denial to the Court of Special Appeals. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>We granted the State\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari prior to consideration in the intermediate appellate court and consolidated the case with the earlier petition for mandamus, certiorari, or other appropriate relief. We ultimately dismissed the latter proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">We were troubled in <em>Sonner </em>as to whether the State had a right of appeal. We observed that under then Rule 764 a an illegal sentence might be corrected at any time. Citing <em>Carter v. Warden, </em>210 Md. 657, 659, 124 A.2d 574 (1956), we said that this was true under the predecessor rule. We quoted from <em>Roberts v. Warden, </em>206 Md. 246, 255, 111 A.2d 597 (1955). That case was an appeal, pursuant to leave to appeal, from a denial of a writ of habeas corpus. The Court assumed without deciding that contentions that the sentences amounted to cruel and unusual punishment could not be considered on habeas corpus until the defendant had served so much of the sentence as was within the power of the trial court to impose. The appeal was dismissed as premature. Judge Hammond then cited for the Court <em>Madison v. State, </em>205 Md. 425, 109 A.2d 96 (1954); <em>Duker v. State, </em>162 Md. 546, 549, 160 A. 279 (1932); <em>Miller v. State, </em>135 Md. 379, 382, 109 A. 104 (1919); and <em>Dutton v. State, </em>123 Md. 373, 91 A. 417 (1914), for the proposition that there would be a right of appeal from the action of the trial court if it refused to strike out an illegal sentence. The language in <em>Madison </em>is dicta. The other three cases are appeals pertaining to motions to strike out judgments and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">We relied in <em>Sonner </em>upon <em>State v. Fisher, </em>204 Md. 307, 104 A.2d 403 (1954), where the State contended on appeal that the trial court had no right to suspend a sentence. Judge Henderson pointed for the Court in <em>Fisher </em>to the statutory provision then in force by which cases were reviewable \u201cas on\u201d a writ of error. He then went on to say for the Court, in a statement which we quoted in <em>Sonner:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">\u201cWhile the State\u2019s right to appeal \u2018as on\u2019 writ of error in Maryland has been chiefly recognized in cases where the indictment was quashed, we think the principle has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>somewhat wider application, and appeal lies in the circumstances of the instant case.\u201d 204 Md. at 312, 104 A.2d at 405.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">We noted that neither the Maryland Rules nor the statute any longer specifically referred to appeal \u201cas upon Writ of Error\u201d as did both the rule and statute when <em>Fisher </em>was decided in 1954. Nevertheless, we found evidence of an intent not to change the law and concluded that the State had a direct right of appeal where a trial judge imposed an illegal sentence. In the process we observed, \u201cA lower court which thus exceeds its power must be bridled by a court of last resort,\u201d and that \u201cif there were no right of appeal in th[at] case, we would have no hesitancy in saying that we would act by issuance of the writ of prohibition.\u201d 272 Md. at 526, 325 A.2d 586. Valentine in this case seizes upon our statement relative to bridling lower courts which exceed their powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The General Assembly apparently approved the view we took in <em>Sonner </em>because it enacted Ch. 49 of the Acts of 1976, now embodied in Code (1974, 1984 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 12-302(c)(2), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, providing that in a criminal case \u201c[t]he State may appeal from a final judgment if the State alleges that the trial judge failed to impose the sentence specifically mandated by the Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Valentine also relies upon <em>Coles v. State, </em>290 Md. 296, 429 A.2d 1029 (1981). That appeal was not from the initial conviction and sentence but from the subsequent revocation of probation and reinstatement of the balance of seven concurrent ten year prison terms previously suspended at the time probation was granted. In the course of that opinion Judge Digges said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">\u201cIn addressing appellant\u2019s attack on the propriety of the original sentencing order, we note that he took no appeal from the final judgment embodying that sentence. In fact, at sentencing, both appellant and his counsel urged the court to order restitution in lieu of incarceration, and it was not until the probation revocation hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>that appellant questioned the validity of his original sentence. The correctness of conditions of probation must be determined on an appeal from the final judgment of conviction and sentence, <em>e.g., Bird v. State, </em>231 Md. 432, 437-38, 190 A.2d 804, 807 (1963), and not on the subsequent revocation of probation, \u2018because to do so, would, in effect, permit a circumvention of [Md.Rule 1012] which requires an appeal to be taken within thirty days\u2019 following the entry of final judgment. <em>Coleman v. State, </em>231 Md. 220, 223, 189 A.2d 616, 618 (1963); see <em>Stone v. State, </em>43 Md.App. 329, 405 A.2d 345 (1979). To this, however, there is at least one exception. A trial court clearly has the authority and responsibility to correct an illegal sentence at any time, Md.Rule 774a; <em>Carter v. Warden, </em>210 Md. 657, 124 A.2d 574 (1956), <em>cert. denied, </em>352 U.S. 900 [77 S.Ct. 136, 1 L.Ed.2d 89] (1956), and the refusal to do so, no matter when the correction request is made, is appealable. <em>State ex rel. Sonner v. Shearin, </em>272 Md. 502, 520, 325 A.2d 573, 583 (1974); <em>Roberts v. Warden, </em>206 Md. 246, 255, 111 A.2d 597, 601 (1955).\u201d 290 Md. at 303, 429 A.2d at 1032.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">We today conclude that the comment that the refusal to correct an illegal sentence is appealable no matter when the correction request is made was in error. It was clearly dictum not necessary to the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Valentine relies, too, upon <em>Gerald v. State, </em>299 Md. 138, 472 A.2d 977 (1984). In the course of that opinion Judge Orth noted for the Court, \u201cThe trial judge, without a hearing, denied the motion to correct an illegal sentence. Gerald noted an appeal from the denial.\u201d 299 Md. at 140, 472 A.2d at 978. Then followed a citation to <em>Sonner, </em>272 Md. 502, 325 A.2d 573, and <em>Roberts, </em>206 Md. 246, 111 A.2d 597. From the opinion and the earlier opinion in the Court of Special Appeals, <em>Gerald v. State, </em>55 Md.App. 483, 462 A.2d 85 (1983), one cannot ascertain whether the challenge was on direct appeal from the original sentence. However, we have examined the briefs in this Court and the Court of Special Appeals. We find that the appeal was from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>denial of a motion to correct an illegal sentence filed after the time for appeal from the original sentence had expired. Appellate courts are not omniscient. We depend upon counsel to bring to our attention issues which we shoujd address. The question of the propriety of Gerald\u2019s appeal was not presented to the Court of Special Appeals or to us. Because jurisdiction was involved, that court or we could well have dismissed the appeal on its or our own motion had the point occurred to either of us.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Md. Const, art. IV, \u00a7 18(a) provides that we \u201cfrom time to time shall adopt rules and regulations concerning the practice and procedure in and the administration of the ... courts of this State\u201d which rules \u201cshall have the force of law until rescinded, changed or modified by [us] or otherwise by law.\u201d It was this constitutional provision which Judge Hammond had in mind and quoted when he said for the Court in <em>Wilson, </em>227 Md. 99, 175 A.2d 775, that our rule pertaining to correction of illegal sentences was a statutory remedy within the meaning of the Post Conviction Procedure Act, now \u00a7 645A(e). We reaffirm that holding. The motion is in the nature of a collateral attack. An appeal from its denial is not a direct appeal from the original sentence. The refusal of a trial judge to correct an illegal sentence can only reach the appellate courts when the procedures of the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act are followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">There is no denial here of due process. The Post Conviction Procedure Act provides means for litigating the propriety of the sentence and ultimate bridling by this Court, if such be necessary, of a recalcitrant judge who refuses to correct an illegal sentence. Likewise, there is no denial of equal protection to such individuals.

State, </em>290 Md. 296, 303, 429 A.2d 1029 (1981), which took the position that the denial of such a motion <em>is </em>directly appealable. In my view, the earlier opinions upon which the majority relies misinterpreted the Maryland Post Conviction Procedure Act. I would instead adhere to the position expressed in our more recent opinions. Therefore I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">It is not disputed that before the enactment of the Maryland Post Conviction Procedure Act, Ch. 44 of the Acts of 1958, Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol., 1985 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 645A, the denial of a motion to correct an illegal sentence could be directly appealed. <em>Roberts v. Warden, </em>206 Md. 246, 111 A.2d 597 (1955). In <em>Wilson v. State, </em>227 Md. 99, 101, 175 A.2d 775 (1961), this Court held that the Post Conviction Procedure Act had abolished that right of direct appeal. <em>Accord Harris v. State, </em>241 Md. 596, 598, 217 A.2d 307 (1966). <em>See Brady v. State, </em>222 Md. 442, 160 A.2d 912 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The Post Conviction Procedure Act, in pertinent part, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">\u201c(a) <em>Right to institute proceeding to set aside or correct sentence. </em>\u2014 Any person convicted of a crime and either incarcerated under sentence of death or imprisonment or on parole or probation, including any person confined or on parole or probation as a result of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>proceeding before the District Court who claims that the sentence or judgment was imposed in violation of the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution or laws of this State, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose the sentence, or that the sentence exceeds the maximum authorized by law, or that the sentence is otherwise subject to collateral attack upon any ground of alleged error which would otherwise be available under a writ of habeas corpus, writ of coram nobis, or other common-law or statutory remedy, may institute a proceeding under this subtitle in the circuit court for the county or the Criminal Court of Baltimore to set aside or correct the sentence, provided the alleged error has not been previously and finally litigated or waived in the proceedings resulting in the conviction, or in any other proceeding that the petitioner has taken to secure relief from his conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">\u201c(e) <em>Not substitute for remedies incident to trial proceedings; ... other common-law and statutory remedies superseded. </em>\u2014 The remedy herein provided is not a substitute <em>for, </em>nor does it affect any remedies which are incident to the proceedings in the trial court or any remedy of direct review of the sentence or conviction____ <em>No appeals to the Court of Appeals or the Court of Special Appeals in habeas corpus or coram nobis cases, or from other common-law or statutory remedies </em>which have heretofore been available for challenging the validity of incarceration under sentence of death or imprisonment shall be permitted or entertained____\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">In <em>Wilson, supra, </em>227 Md. at 101, 175 A.2d 775, the Court held that a motion to correct an illegal sentence, which was provided for in Maryland Rule 744 a at the time, was a \u201cstatutory remedy\u201d within the meaning of the Act and that, therefore, the denial of such a motion was not appealable unless the procedures of the Post Conviction Procedure Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>were followed. This holding was incorrect for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">First, a motion to correct an illegal sentence is not a \u201cstatutory\u201d remedy. Statutes are enacted by the General Assembly of Maryland.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Maryland Rules are adopted by the Court of Appeals. As the <em>Wilson </em>court noted, the Maryland Constitution does provide that rules adopted by the Court \u201cshall have the force of law until rescinded, changed or modified by the Court of Appeals or otherwise by law.\u201d Maryland Constitution, Art. IV, \u00a7 18(a). Nonetheless, the fact that the Maryland Rules have the force of law does not mean that a rule is a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">In addition, the rulemaking power of the Court of Appeals is limited in scope. The Court is authorized to \u201cadopt rules and regulations concerning the practice and procedure in and the administration of the appellate courts and in the other courts of this State____\u201d Art. IV, \u00a7 18(a). It is doubtful if this grant of authority includes the power to create a new cause of action comparable to a writ of habeas corpus or coram nobis. Consequently, the motion authorized by former Rule 774 a and present Rule 4-345(a) should not be deemed an \u201cother common-law or statutory\u201d remedy within the meaning of the Post Conviction Procedure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">Moreover, the Post Conviction Procedure Act, by its terms, \u201cis not a substitute for, nor does it affect any remedies which are incident to the proceedings in the trial court or any remedy of direct review of the sentence or conviction.\u201d Code \u00a7 645A(e). <em>See State v. D\u2019Onofrio, </em>221 Md. 20, 28-29, 155 A.2d 643, 647 (1959); Legislative Council of Maryland, Report to the General Assembly of 1958, Proposed Bills, at 107 (Dec. 31, 1957). A motion to correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>an illegal sentence is clearly both incident to the proceedings in the trial court and a direct review of the sentence. Such motions are directed to the trial court and decided pursuant to the revisory power which the trial court has over a judgment. <em>See </em>former Rule 774 and present Rule 4 \u2014 345<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; <em>Coles v. State, supra; State ex rel. Sonner v. Shearin, </em>272 Md. 502, 325 A.2d 573 (1974); <em>Harris v. State, supra; Wilson v. State, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The Court\u2019s decision today is also inconsistent with rule making actions taken by this Court subsequent to the enactment of the Post Conviction Procedure Act. As pointed out in <em>State v. D\u2019Onofrio, supra, </em>221 Md. at 29, 155 A.2d 643, quoting from the Commissioners On Uniform Laws, one purpose of the Post Conviction Procedure Act was \u201c \u2018to bring together and consolidate into one simple statute all the remedies, beyond those that are incident to the usual procedures of trial and review, which are at present available for challenging the validity of a sentence of imprisonment.\u2019 \u201d If a motion to correct an illegal sentence were viewed as one of the common law or statutory remedies to be consolidated into the Post Conviction Procedure Act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>there would have been no reason for the subsequent enactment of rules providing for a motion to correct an illegal sentence. Nevertheless, since the enactment of the Post Conviction Procedure Act, this Court has on several occasions enacted new rules containing the provision for a motion to correct an illegal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Finally, the Court\u2019s decision promotes inefficiency and the waste of valuable judicial resources. Where a convicted defendant\u2019s complaint relates solely to the legality of the sentence imposed, the normal proceeding for him to institute would be one under present Rule 4-345(a) to correct an illegal sentence. If at the conclusion of such proceeding the defendant is denied relief, even though as here his complaint is clearly meritorious, he will have to institute a second trial court proceeding, this time under the Post Conviction Procedure Act, as a prerequisite for obtaining appellate review. As a result of the majority\u2019s decision today, two trial court proceedings instead of one will be required. This makes little sense in light of the already heavy work load imposed on the trial judges of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">For the above reasons, I would follow <em>Coles v. State </em>and <em>State ex rel. Sonner </em>in which this Court took the position that a trial court\u2019s refusal to correct an illegal sentence may be directly appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">I also note that defendant\u2019s argument on the merits is clearly correct. The trial court had originally sentenced Valentine to twelve years in prison, to commence running on April 27, 1983, the date of his incarceration on the child abuse charge. The sentence imposed ran concurrently with Valentine\u2019s remaining parole time. <em>See Burkett v. Warden, </em>214 Md. 603, 134 A.2d 77 (1957). Pursuant to the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s request for modification of sentence, the trial court changed the sentence, ordering that Valentine\u2019s two sentences run consecutively. This modification amounted to an increase in sentence. <em>Wilson v. State, </em>45 Md.App. 675, 415 A.2d 605 (1980); <em>Schultz v. United States, </em>384 F.2d 374, 375 (5th Cir.1967). Rule 774 a states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>that the court \u201cmay not increase the length of ... a sentence\u201d pursuant to a motion for modification. More importantly, such an increase violates the Fifth Amendment and the Maryland common law prohibition against double jeopardy. <em>Ex parte Lange, </em>18 Wall. 163, 173, 21 L.Ed. 872 (1874); <em>Brown v. State, </em>237 Md. 492, 503, 207 A.2d 103 (1965); <em>Schultz v. United States, supra. </em>A situation like that here was presented in the <em>Schultz </em>case, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit specifically held that changing a sentence to run consecutively instead of concurrently \u201cincreased appellant\u2019s ... sentence\u201d in \u201cviolation of the constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy.\u201d 384 F.2d at 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Judges COLE and COUCH have authorized me to state that they concur with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b209-9\">.
