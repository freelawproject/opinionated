They were consolidated in the Court of Special Appeals. The Court of Special Appeals, pursuant to Maryland Rule 1015 a, certified to us questions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">\u201c1. On January 1, 1982, did Maryland common law recognize an implied warranty of habitability in connection with the rental of a fully equipped ski chalet for a single weekend?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">\u201c2. If so, is lack of a smoke detector in the chalet a breach of that warranty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-9\">a. as a matter of law, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-10\">b. only if found, as a matter of fact, to render the premises unreasonably unsafe?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">We elected to consider the entire case. Hence, we issued a writ of certiorari prior to decision in the intermediate appellate court. In the view we take of the case the answer is found in Maryland Code (1957, 1981 Cum.Supp.) Art. 38A, \u00a7 12A.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">Two suits were filed in the Circuit Court for Howard County arising out of a fire on January 1, 1982, at what was known as Seasons Four Chalet in Garrett County. The trial judge granted motions to dismiss in each case without leave to amend pursuant to Rule 2-322.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The basis was the failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">We have said that in considering the sufficiency of a declaration on demurrer we are required to assume the truth of all material and relevant facts that are well pleaded as well as all inferences which reasonably can be drawn from those well-pleaded facts. <em>Tadjer v. Montgomery County, </em>300 Md. 539, 542, 479 A.2d 1321, 1322 (1984); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number><em>Schwartz v. Merchant\u2019s Mort.

The same would be true of what we now call a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">William L. Salvatore, individually and as personal representative of Patricia Ann Salvatore and also as father and sole guardian of Steven Philip Salvatore, and Stephen Derek Coster, personal representative of the estate of Robert Y. Coster, Jr., sued Brian Timothy Cunningham and Lynda Anne Cunningham. The declaration contained two counts; one was a negligence and survival action and the other was for the wrongful death of Patricia Anne Salvatore. Kenneth Walter Cunningham, Jr.; Linda Hughes Cunningham, individually and as mother and next friend of Mandy Hughes Cunningham, a minor child; Mary Ann Pierorazio; John Richard Coster; Edna Alvirta Isennock; Michael Scott Coster; JoAnn Coster, as mother and next friend of Erin Kathleen Coster; and State Auto Mutual Insurance Company also sued Brian Timothy Cunningham and Lynda Anne Cunningham for negligence and wrongful death. The allegations in the latter case are similar to those in the former. Hence, we shall repeat only the facts as set forth in the Salvatore case.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">On January 1, 1982, at approximately 11:00 p.m. a fire destroyed Seasons Four Chalet owned by Brian Timothy Cunningham and Lynda Anne Cunningham. The building had been rented to Kenneth Cunningham \u201cand the following people, who shared the chalet and occupied it at the time of the fire: Linda Hughes Cunningham, his wife; Mandy Hughes Cunningham, her daughter; Patricia Ann Salvatore, his sister; William L. Salvatore, his brother-in-law; Robert Y. Coster, Jr., his friend; Mary Ann Pierorazio; John Richard Coster, his friend; and Edna Alvirta Isennock.\u2019\u2019 The chalet had been rented by these people for the New Year\u2019s holiday and, according to the declaration, \u201cwas not used by the occupants as a single family dwelling, nor was it used by the occupants as a two or three family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>dwelling.\u201d It was further alleged that Brian Cunningham and his wife \u201crented said Seasons Four Chalet to the occupants as a temporary accomodation, not intended as a one, two or three family dwelling.\u201d The chalet was advertised as completely furnished and equipped except for linens. It had accommodations capable of sleeping twelve persons in three bedrooms and a loft. Seasonal weekly and weekend rates were set forth in the advertisements. The \u201cadvertisements indicate the Seasons Four Chalet was not intended as a one, two or three family dwelling.\u201d The chalet \u201cdid in fact sleep twelve persons in three closely grouped bedrooms and a loft____\u201d It contained a common kitchen, bathroom and living facilities for all occupants. It was alleged that it was not intended as a one, two, or three family dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">All of the occupants retired by approximately 10:45 p.m. on the night in question. As indicated, a fire broke out at approximately 11:00 p.m. There was no smoke detector or fire alarm in the chalet. Patricia Ann Salvatore and Robert Y. Coster, Jr., perished as a result of the fire. Others were injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">It was asserted that Brian Cunningham and his wife \u201cwere negligent in that they had a duty, pursuant to Article 38A, Section 12A ... to equip the chalet with a manual fire alarm system, and smoke detectors, but failed to equip the chalet with either device____\u201d It was further alleged that \u201cthey had a duty, pursuant to Maryland common law, to take reasonable care to not subject others to an unreasonable risk of harm, and to provide a reasonably safe premises for their tenants, and breached that duty by failing to equip the chalet with a smoke alarm system, fire alarm system, or similar warning system____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">The trial judge (Kane, J.) found \u201cthe more persuasive authority supports the conclusion that there is no common law duty to install fire detection devices____\u201d Accordingly, he held \u201cthat the common law duty to maintain safe premis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>es for a tenant does not encompass the installation of fire detection devices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Art. 38A, \u00a7 12A, as in effect at the time of the fire, provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">\u201c(a) <em>Smoke detector required in sleeping area; light signal for deaf or hearing impaired occupants; compliance by hotels and multifamily buildings. </em>\u2014(1) Each sleeping area within all occupancies classified residential, as defined in Chapter 11 of the National Fire Protection Association Life Safety Code, 1976 Edition, shall be provided with a minimum of one approved smoke detector sensing visible or invisible particles of combustion installed in a manner and location approved by the Fire Prevention Commission. When activated, the detector shall provide an alarm suitable to warn the occupants____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">\u201c(b) <em>One, two or three family dwellings. </em>\u2014An occupant of a one, two or three family residential dwelling constructed prior to July 1, 1975 shall by July 1, 1982:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apr\">\u201c(1) Equip each occupant\u2019s living unit with a minimum of one approved battery or AC primary electric powered smoke detector; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATt\">\u201c(2) Maintain the smoke detector.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">The trial judge set forth the statute and then observed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3Y\">\u201cIt is, of course, the facts alleged which determine this Court\u2019s application and construction of this statute to the instant case. The facts alleged include the following: the premises, called the Seasons Four Chalet, was a completely furnished and equipped accommodation capable of sleeping twelve persons in three bedrooms and a loft. Furthermore, the chalet had three closely grouped bedrooms and a loft and contained common kitchen, bathroom and living facilities for all occupants. The Amended Declaration does not allege the date of construction of the chalet. With these facts noted, this Court may consider if they set forth a breach of the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">\u201cThis Court finds, upon consideration of these facts, that the Season Four Chalet was indeed a \u2018one, two, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>three family residential dwelling\u2019 within the meaning of subsection (b) of said section 12A. It is an axiom of statutory construction that \u2018A statute should be construed according to the ordinary and natural import of its language.\u2019 M.L.E. Statutes \u00a7 87. A building with closely grouped bedrooms and a loft with common areas and a sleeping capacity of twelve persons is a residential dwelling. Moreover, the presence of such common areas serving all dwellers, as alleged, indicates a dwelling constructed for one family. It is, of course, this premises\u2019 status as a one, two or three family dwelling which may preclude a finding of statutory duty pursuant to subsection (a) of said section 12A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">\u201cAs is evident from the Amended Declaration, Plaintiffs seek to distinguish the premises from a \u2018one, two or three family residential dwelling\u2019 by alleging that the premises were not intended to be used as such a family residential dwelling at the time of the fire. However, the statute does not set forth the intention of the parties as a criterion for classification. Consequently, it is the construction and configuration of the interior of the premises which must determine its classification and it is these criteria which compel the classification of these premises as a \u2018one, two or three family dwelling.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">\u201cThe fact missing from the Amended Declaration is the date of construction of the building. This Court finds that Plaintiff must allege the facts necessary to support a statutory duty breached and consequently must allege the date of construction so as to remove the premises from the provisions of subsection (b) of said section 12A.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] It is, of course, a duty alleged by the operation of a statute read <em>in toto </em>which would give rise to a cause of action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">\u201cIn summary then, this Court finds Plaintiffs fail, as a matter of law, to allege facts which impose upon Defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>ants a duty to install fire detection devices. According to the facts alleged, Defendants have not breached any common law duty owed to Plaintiffs. Moreover, the Plaintiffs fail to set forth a breach of a statutory duty pursuant to the mandates of Md.Code Ann. Art. 38A \u00a7 12A by failing to allege facts which remove the one, two or three family residential dwelling from the delayed compliance requirements of subsection (b) of said section 12A. Thus, Plaintiffs have failed to allege a duty breached by Defendants and thus fail to state a cause of action. In that this Court sustained a Demurrer to the original Declaration and now shall sustain a Demurrer to the Amended Declaration, such Demurrer shall be sustained without leave to amend.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">In the second case the trial judge referred to the opinion that he had handed down in the first case and reached a similar result.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Art. 38A, \u00a7 12A was originally enacted by Ch. 860 of the Acts of 1975. Section 2 of that chapter provided that with the exception of \u00a7 12A(b) of the original act, not applicable here, \u201cthe provisions of this Act do not apply to any residential building including hotels, apartments, and other multi-family dwellings constructed, or under construction, prior to July 1, 1975.\u201d Present subsection (b) was added by Ch. 667 of the Acts of 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Chapter 11 of the National Fire Protection Association Life Safety Code, 1976 Ed., mentioned in \u00a7 12A(a) states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">\u201c11-1.3 Classification of Occupancy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">\u201c11-1.3.1 Residential occupancies shall include all occupancies so classified in 4-1.6. They shall be classified in the following groups, subject to determination by the authority having jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-9\">\u201c(a) Hotels....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-10\">\u201c(b) Apartment Buildings____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-11\">\u201c(c) Dormitories____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>\u201c(d) Lodging or Rooming Houses. Includes buildings in which separate sleeping rooms are rented providing sleeping accommodations for a total of 15 or less persons, on either a transient or permanent basis; with or without meals, but without separate cooking facilities for individual occupants, except as provided in (e).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-4\">\u201c(e) 1- and 2-Family Dwellings. Includes dwellings in which each living unit is occupied by members of a single family, with rooms rented to outsiders, if any, not accommodating more than 3 persons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Section 4-1.6, mentioned in \u00a7 11-1.3.1 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-6\">\u201cResidential <em>(for requirements see Chapter </em>11). Residential occupancies are ones in which sleeping accommodations are provided for normal residential purposes and include all buildings designed to provide sleeping accommodations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\">\u201c <em>Exception: Those classified under Institutional Occupancies.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-8\">\u201cResidential occupancies are treated separately in this <em>Code </em>in the following groups:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-9\">\u201c(a) Hotels Motels</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-10\">\u201c(b) Apartments</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ast\">\u201c(c) Dormitories</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-11\">Orphanages for age 6 years and older</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFqB\">\u201c(d) Lodging or rooming houses</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATh\">\u201c(e) 1- and 2-family dwellings\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">We think the trial judge was correct when he said, after reference to the assertions in the declaration, that the chalet \u201cwas indeed a \u2018one, two, or three family residential dwelling\u2019 within the meaning of subsection (b) of said section 12A,\u201d that \u201cthe statute does not set forth the intention of the parties as a criterion for classification,\u201d but \u201cit is the construction and configuration of the interior of the premises which must determine its classification____\u201d We fur-</p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">ther think he was correct in his conclusion from the description given in the declaration that this was a single family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>dwelling. As a single family dwelling it follows that under \u00a7 12A(b) there was no obligation on the part of the owner as of the relevant date to install smoke detectors or other warning devices. We find the argument relative to a common law obligation to be without merit. If any common law obligation ever existed it was rooted out when the General Assembly passed Ch. 860 of the Acts of 1975 which by its terms exempted residential buildings erected prior to July 1, 1975 from any obligation to install smoke detectors.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; APPELLANTS TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-14\">.
