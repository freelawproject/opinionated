These rates must enable the company to recover its \u201cnecessary and proper expenses\u201d and to provide a \u201creasonable return\u201d to the company\u2019s investors. \u00a7 69(a); <em>see Potomac Edison Co. v. PSC, </em>279 Md. 573, 579-82, 369 A.2d 1035 (1977); <em>Public Serv. Comm\u2019n v. Baltimore Gas &amp; El., </em>273 Md. 357, 363-64, 329 A.2d 691 (1974); <em>C. &amp; P. Tel. Co. v. Public Service, </em>230 Md. 395, 400-01, 187 A.2d 475 (1963). <em>See generally </em>E. Nichols, <em>Ruling Principles of Utility Regulation </em>1-9 (1955 &amp; Supp.1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Prior to 1955, changes in a company\u2019s expenses, including its fuel costs, were reviewed by the Commission only as part of a lengthy base rate proceeding. As a result, a substantial regulatory lag generally existed between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>time increased or decreased costs were incurred by a company and the time those costs were reflected in customer rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">As part of its comprehensive revision of the Public Service Commission Law in 1955, the General Assembly acted to alleviate this regulatory lag with regard to fuel cost recovery by enacting chapter 441 of the Acts of 1955. This statutory provision, now codified as part of \u00a7 54, provided that \u201c[a]ny ... electric company may establish a sliding scale for the automatic adjustment of charges for ... electricity ____\u201d Under the authority of this provision, most electric utility companies, including the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (\u201cBG &amp; E\u201d), amended their tariff schedules to include fuel rate adjustment clauses. A fuel rate adjustment clause permits a company to adjust its rates automatically, subject to later Commission approval, to reflect changes in fuel costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">As fossil fuel prices increased dramatically during the mid-1970s, the General Assembly acted to subject the rising fuel costs experienced by electric utility companies, and ultimately paid by consumers, to closer scrutiny by the Commission. By chapter 418 of the Acts of 1975, the legislature enacted \u00a7 54D, which required companies using fuel rate adjustment clauses \u201cto verify and justify the adjusted fuel costs to the Commission\u201d on a monthly basis. Section 54D was amended by chapter 695 of the Acts of 1977 to direct the Commission to disallow any charge a company had passed on to its customers through a fuel rate adjustment clause if the company \u201chas improperly calculated the charge, has failed to use proper fuel procurement practices, or has used this charge to the detriment of the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">In 1978, the General Assembly removed large electric utility companies from the purview of \u00a7 54D and enacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>\u00a7 54F, which provides a discrete procedure through which these companies may adjust their fuel rates.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Acts of 1978, chapter 173. The procedure provided by \u00a7 54F differs from that of \u00a7 54D in several significant respects, two of which are particularly relevant here. First, \u00a7 54F furnishes the Commission with more definite standards than does \u00a7 54D for evaluating fuel rate adjustment applications. Specifically, \u00a7 54F(f) directs the Commission to base its decision in a fuel rate adjustment proceeding upon its findings regarding whether</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-4\">\u201c(1) Only changes in the actual costs of the components of the fuel rate are included in the proposed change;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">(2) The applicant has used the most economical mix of all types of generation and purchase;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">(3) The applicant has made every reasonable effort to minimize fuel costs and followed competitive procurement practices;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">(4) The applicant has maintained the productive capacity of all its generating plants at a reasonable level.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Section 54F(g) authorizes the Commission to disallow recovery of increased fuel costs that were incurred as a result of a company\u2019s failure to comply with these requirements. In addition, while \u00a7 54D sets no limit upon the amount of time within which the Commission must review an application and issue a final order, \u00a7 54F(c) expressly provides that \u201c[t]he Commission\u2019s final order shall be issued promptly but in no event later than 90 days after the filing of the application.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">This appeal arises from three fuel rate adjustment cases initiated by BG &amp; E and conducted by the Commission under the authority of \u00a7 54F. BG &amp; E filed its application in the first of these cases, Case No. 7238-0 (\u201cCase 0\u201d), on March 2, 1981. In conformance with industry custom, BG &amp; E included among the fuel costs stipulated in its application certain costs it incurred in purchasing supplemental power for its customers during a forced outage that occurred in December 1980 and January 1981 at one of its nuclear generating units.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Commission suspended BG &amp; E\u2019s proposed fuel rate adjustment for 30 days, the maximum suspension permitted by \u00a7 54F(c), and authorized BG <em>&amp; </em>E to apply the proposed rate, subject to further review by the Commission, beginning with its April 1981 billings.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">After conducting evidentiary hearings, the Commission issued its Order No. 65299 on June 1, 1981, 90 days after the application\u2019s filing. In the order, the Commission discussed the circumstances surrounding the forced outage and concluded that, because BG &amp; E had failed to demonstrate that the forced outage was not the result of imprudent management, it had not met its burden of proving that it had maintained the productive capacity of all its generating plants at a reasonable level, as required by \u00a7 54F(f)(4). The Commission also recognized, however, that BG &amp; E had achieved an excellent overall record in maintaining the output of its nuclear units. The Commission therefore concluded that BG &amp; E would be permitted to recover 50% of the purchased power costs occasioned by the outage. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>The order further provided that the Commission would retain jurisdiction to consider additional evidence regarding the extent of BG <em>&amp; </em>E\u2019s responsibility for the outage, and indicated that the Commission might reconsider its apportionment of the purchased power costs in light of this additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The Commission issued its Order No. 66011 in Case 0 on November 22, 1982, 630 days after BG &amp; E filed its application. In its order, the Commission concluded that, in light of the additional evidence it had reviewed, BG &amp; E would be permitted to recover 75% of the purchased power costs resulting from the forced outage. The order also purported to terminate Case 0 on the Commission\u2019s docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The second fuel rate adjustment case before us in this appeal, Case No. 7238-T (\u201cCase T\u201d), was initiated by BG &amp; E\u2019s filing of its application on February 1, 1982. The Commission suspended the proposed rate adjustment for the maximum permissible period of 30 days and authorized BG &amp; E to apply the proposed rate, subject to further review by the Commission, beginning with its March 1982 billings. BG &amp; E filed its application in the third proceeding, Case No. 7238-U (\u201cCase U\u201d), on March 1, 1982. Again, the Commission suspended the proposed adjustment for 30 days and authorized BG &amp; E to apply the proposed rate, subject to further Commission review, beginning with its April 1982 billings. Cases T and U were then consolidated for evidentiary hearings before the Commission. The fuel costs submitted in BG &amp; E\u2019s applications in Cases T and U included certain purchased power costs occasioned by a forced outage at one of the company\u2019s nuclear generating units during July 1981.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">On April 2, 1982, the hearing examiner issued a proposed order in Case T authorizing BG &amp; E to continue to assess the full amount of the proposed fuel rate adjustment, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>providing that the Commission would retain jurisdiction to further review all the issues in the case. The proposed order became final by its terms as Commission Order No. 65755 on May 3, 1982, 90 days after BG &amp; E had filed its application in Case T. Subsequently, after conducting evidentiary hearings, the Commission issued its Order No. 65800 in the consolidated Cases T and U, by which it allowed the full fuel rate adjustment requested in BG &amp; E\u2019s application in Case U to remain in effect pending further Commission review and indicated that it would retain jurisdiction over the consolidated cases. Order No. 65800 was issued on May 28, 1982, 88 days after the filing of BG &amp; E\u2019s application in Case U.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">On November 22, 1982, the Commission issued its Order No. 66012 in the consolidated Cases T and U, 266 days and 294 days, respectively, after BG &amp; E\u2019s filing of its applications in these cases. In the order, the Commission discussed the circumstances surrounding the forced outage in July 1981 and concluded that, in light of the additional evidence it had reviewed, BG &amp; E would be permitted to recover from its customers only 25% of the purchased power costs occasioned by the forced outage. This conclusion was based upon the Commission\u2019s findings that, although BG &amp; E had achieved a superior overall record at the nuclear generating unit during the previous year, the July outage was attributable to managerial imprudence, and the company had therefore failed to prove that it had maintained the productive capacity of all its generating units at a reasonable level, as required by \u00a7 54F(f)(4). The order also purported to terminate the consolidated Cases T and U on the Commission\u2019s docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">On November 29, 1982, BG &amp; E filed a notice of appeal from the Commission\u2019s Order No. 66011 in Case O and Order No. 66012 in the consolidated Cases T and U, seeking full recovery of the disputed purchased power costs. On December 10, 1982, the Maryland People\u2019s Counsel cross-appealed, contending that BG &amp; E was not entitled to recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>any of the disputed costs. These appeals were consolidated and tried before the Circuit Court for Calvert County.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">BG &amp; E raised numerous issues in the circuit court, challenging the accuracy of the Commission\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 54F(f), the legality of the procedure through which the Commission had evaluated BG &amp; E\u2019s applications, and the correctness of the Commission\u2019s final decisions in the three cases. The circuit court reversed both of the Commission\u2019s orders on two grounds: (1) that \u00a7 54F(f)(4) did not authorize the Commission to inquire into the cause of specific forced outages, and (2) that the standards the Commission had applied in implementing \u00a7 54F(f) were rules illegally promulgated by the Commission in violation of the State Documents Law, Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.) Art. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 256B-256T. The court remanded the cases to the Commission for entry of orders allowing BG &amp; E to recover all of the disputed fuel costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">From the judgment of the circuit court, both the Commission and the People\u2019s Counsel filed notices of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Judge Bishop, writing for the intermediate appellate court, reversed and remanded the case for affirmance of the Commission\u2019s orders. <em>Public Serv. Comm\u2019n v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec., </em>60 Md.App. 495, 483 A.2d 796 (1984). We granted BG &amp; E\u2019s petition for certiorari, and shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">A. The 90-Day Provision of \u00a7 54F(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">As a preliminary matter, BG &amp; E maintains that \u00a7 54F(c) constitutes a limitation on the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction over fuel rate adjustment proceedings. As BG &amp; E reads the statute, \u00a7 54F(c) not only requires the Commission to issue its final order within 90 days of the filing of an application, but also divests the Commission of jurisdiction after the ninetieth day, thereby rendering any further action by the Commission \u201cineffectual\u201d and a \u201ctotal nullity.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>From this premise, BG &amp; E concludes that the orders the Commission issued in Cases O, T, and U within the 90-day periods constitute the Commission\u2019s final actions in these cases, and are therefore still in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">By reading \u00a7 54F(e) in isolation from the rest of the Public Service Commission Law, BG &amp; E has misconstrued the nature of the 90-day deadline. As we have indicated frequently, a provision contained within an integrated statutory scheme must be understood in that context and harmonized to the extent possible with the other provisions of the statutory scheme. <em>See, e.g., Guardian Life Ins. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>293 Md. 629, 643-45, 446 A.2d 1140 (1982); <em>In re Stephen K., </em>289 Md. 294, 298-99, 424 A.2d 153 (1981); <em>Comptroller v. John C. Louis Co., </em>285 Md. 527, 538-39, 404 A.2d 1045 (1979); <em>Mazor v. State Dep\u2019t of Correction, </em>279 Md. 355, 361, 369 A.2d 82 (1977); <em>Blumenthal v. Clerk of Cir. Ct., </em>278 Md. 398, 403, 365 A.2d 279 (1976); <em>Parker v. Junior Press Printing, </em>266 Md. 721, 725-26, 296 A.2d 377 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">To understand the effect of the Commission\u2019s purported exercise of jurisdiction beyond the 90-day period of \u00a7 54F(c), we must consider other relevant provisions of the Public Service Commission Law. Section 86(d) provides that \u201c[t]he Commission shall have the authority, on its own motion, to rehear any final order____\u201d Furthermore, \u00a7 86(c) states that \u201c[t]he Commission may consider on rehearing facts not presented in the original hearing ... and may by new order abrogate, change, or modify its original order.\u201d Reading these sections in conjunction with \u00a7 54F(c), it is clear that the Commission possesses the requisite jurisdiction to rehear a final order issued in a \u00a7 54F fuel rate adjustment proceeding, and to consider additional facts on rehearing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>That the Commission did not characterize its actions as final orders followed by rehearings is not dispositive. Section 1 of the Public Service Commission Law requires that \u201c[t]he powers of the Commission shall be liberally construed,\u201d and to exhalt form over substance would be inconsistent with this mandate. Furthermore, we are satisfied that by issuing orders in each of the three cases by the 90-day deadlines, the Commission accomplished the purpose underlying \u00a7 54F(c): providing expedited adjustment of electric utility companies\u2019 fuel rates. We therefore conclude that the orders issued by the Commission in Cases 0, T, and U within the 90-day periods were final orders within the meaning of \u00a7 54F(c), and that the subsequent issuance of the two orders on November 22, 1982, was a valid exercise of the Commission\u2019s authority under \u00a7 86(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">BG &amp; E places great weight on the introductory phrase in \u00a7 54F(c), \u201c[notwithstanding any other provisions of this article,\u201d interpreting it to mean that in construing \u00a7 54F we must not look beyond the language of this single section. As we read it, this phrase simply means that the procedure set forth in \u00a7 54F controls within its area of applicability in spite of any apparent conflict with other parts of the Public Service Commission Law. It does not mean that \u00a7 54F must be interpreted in a vacuum, without due consideration of other consistent and complementary portions of the article.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">B. The Commission\u2019s Interpretation of \u00a7 54F(f)(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">In reviewing BG &amp; E\u2019s applications in Cases 0, T, and U, the Commission concluded that BG &amp; E had satisfied the requirements of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of \u00a7 54F(f). In each case, the Commission denied BG &amp; E recovery of a portion of its fuel costs solely on the ground that BG &amp; E had failed to meet its burden of proving that it had \u201cmaintained the productive capacity of all its generating plants at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>a reasonable level,\u201d as required by \u00a7 54F(f)(4). BG &amp; E argues that the Commission has misinterpreted this statutory language, and that both of the Commission\u2019s orders issued on November 22, 1982, must therefore be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">The controversy turns upon the meaning to be ascribed to the term \u201creasonable level.\u201d In BG &amp; E\u2019s view, these words are susceptible of but a single interpretation: a level of productive capacity that compares favorably with a statistical reference standard accepted by the Commission. The Commission has acknowledged that the overall performance of the nuclear unit that experienced the two forced outages was outstanding compared to industry averages during each of the years in which the outages occurred. BG <em>&amp; </em>E insists that the level of productive capacity at this unit was therefore reasonable as a matter of law, and that the Commission lacked statutory authority to conduct further inquiry into the cause of specific forced outages.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We do not agree that the term \u201creasonable level\u201d is susceptible of only one interpretation. \u201cReasonable level\u201d is a vague term, and its presence in an administrative statute such as the Public Service Commission Law suggests that the General Assembly intended to entrust the formulation of specific standards to the technical expertise of those charged with enforcing the statute. <em>See Springfield Ed. Ass\u2019n v. Springfield, Etc., </em>290 Or. 217, 621 P.2d 547, 555-57 (1980); <em>Brix v. City of San Rafael, </em>92 Cal.App.3d 47, 50-51, 154 Cal.Rptr. 647 (Cal.Ct.App.1979); <em>Roberts v. Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Retirement, Etc., </em>412 A.2d 47, 50 (D.C.1980); <em>Kopp v. State, </em>100 Idaho 160, 595 P.2d 309, 312 (1979); <em>WIPE v. Illinois Pollution Control Bd., </em>55 Ill.App.3d 475, 13 Ill.Dec. 149, 152, 370 N.E.2d 1176, 1179 (Ill.App.Ct.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The Commission has interpreted \u201creasonable level\u201d to mean a level that compares favorably with a statistical reference standard and that has not been reduced as a result of managerial imprudence. In its Order No. 66011 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>issued in Case 0, the Commission summarized the procedure through which it implements \u00a7 54F(f)(4) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avh\">\u201c[T]he first step in determining whether the requirements of Section 54F(f)(4) have been met is to measure the plant\u2019s performance on the basis of equivalent availability factors which take into account outages, partial outages and deratings. The productive capacity of the plant will be measured by a comparison of the performance for the most recent 12-month period against (a) the plant\u2019s own performance record averaged over the last three years, or (b) the availability factor, such as compiled by the North American Electric Reliability Council (\u2018NAERC\u2019), for similar size units, whichever is higher. If the plant\u2019s actual performance equals or exceeds the higher of the two standards, then there is a rebuttable presumption that the Company has complied with Section 54F(f)(4).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\">\u201cHowever, if the actual performance falls below the higher of the two standards or if evidence indicates that a specific outage or series of outages may be the result of imprudent management, the Commission will review the facts and circumstances surrounding the specific outages at the generating plant in question. In reviewing the factual circumstances associated with a particular outage, the Commission recognizes that forced outages cannot be completely eliminated or controlled____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">\u201c... Therefore, an outage occasioned by human error is not a <em>per se </em>violation of this statutory standard. However, a decision must be made by the Commission as to whether the facts and decisions associated with the incident constituted mismanagement. In making this determination, the Commission will examine the extent to which the increased costs for replacement generation could have been avoided through better planning, preventive maintenance, more diligent efforts, closer supervision, and more prudent management. Specifically, in reviewing a particular outage, the Commission will examine whether the Company had instituted reasonable and appropriate procedures to prevent human error or equip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>ment failure and to minimize the consequences of those occurrences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-4\">\u201cThe Commission recognizes that as more review and monitoring steps are added to a plant\u2019s maintenance procedures, the cost of maintenance will increase as will the length of planned outages thereby lowering the plant\u2019s operating factor and efficiency. Thus, in determining whether the Company\u2019s management has taken reasonable steps to prevent employee error or equipment failure and to minimize the consequences of such occurrences, the Commission will weigh the costs associated with the additional control procedures against the foreseeable cost consequences of operating the plant without those procedures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The weight to be accorded an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute depends upon a number of considerations. Although never binding upon the courts, the contemporaneous interpretation of a statute by the agency charged with its administration is entitled to great deference, especially when the interpretation has been applied consistently and for a long period of time. <em>See National Asphalt v. Prince Geo\u2019s Co., </em>292 Md. 75, 80, 437 A.2d 651 (1981); <em>Holy Cross Hosp. v. Health Services, </em>283 Md. 677, 685, 393 A.2d 181 (1978); <em>Demory Brothers v. Bd. of Pub. Works, </em>273 Md. 320, 327, 329 A.2d 674 (1974); <em>Farber\u2019s, Inc. v. Comptroller, </em>266 Md. 44, 50-51, 291 A.2d 658 (1972); <em>see also </em>5 K. Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 29.16 (2d ed. 1984); 2A N. Singer, <em>Sutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 49.05, .07, .08 (rev. 4th ed. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Another important consideration is the extent to which the agency engaged in a process of reasoned elaboration in formulating its interpretation of the statute. When an agency clearly demonstrates that it has focused its attention on the statutory provisions in question, thoroughly addressed the relevant issues, and reached its interpretation through a sound reasoning process, the agency\u2019s interpretation will be accorded the persuasiveness due a well-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>considered opinion of an expert body. <em>See SEC v.

If the interpretation is the product of neither contested adversarial proceedings nor formal rule promulgation, it is entitled to little weight. <em>See John C. Louis, supra, </em>285 Md. at 544, 404 A.2d 1045; 2A N. Singer, <em>Sutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 49.05 (rev. 4th ed. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The Commission\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 54F(f)(4) originated in a series of public proceedings conducted shortly after the statute\u2019s enactment. On June 19, 1978, by its Order No. 63190, the Commission instituted proceedings to develop guidelines and procedures to implement \u00a7 54F. Separate proceedings were instituted for each of the four electric utility companies affected by this section.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> During the proceedings, representatives of the electric companies, the People\u2019s Counsel, and the Commission staff testified and presented evidence in support of their views regarding the implementation of \u00a7 54F. Public hearings were also conducted to elicit the views of the companies\u2019 customers.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">On August 23, 1978, the Commission issued virtually identical interim orders in each of the four cases.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>orders, the Commission adopted standards and procedures for the evaluation of the companies\u2019 initial applications filed in response to \u00a7 54F. Appended to each order were several uniform reporting forms. One of these forms, Md. PSC Form No. 3, required that each company provide the Commission with information regarding individual outages at generating plants. Each order further provided that \u201cif the information which is provided [in Form No. 3] raises questions, more detailed information can then be requested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">On August 31, 1978, each of the four electric companies filed its initial application under \u00a7 54F. On November 29, 1978, after conducting additional adjudicatory proceedings, the Commission issued orders in which it concluded that each company had maintained the productive capacity of all its generating plants at a reasonable level, in compliance with \u00a7 54F(f)(4).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In evaluating the levels of productive capacity of the companies\u2019 plants, the Commission considered relevant industry statistics as well as evidence regarding specific outages and other incidents of reduced generation at the companies\u2019 plants. For example, in its Order No. 63453, the Commission based its approval of BG &amp; E\u2019s initial application in part upon evidence that \u201cthe availability of the company\u2019s generating units is well above industry averages.\u201d However, in the same order, the Commission observed that the Keystone and Conemaugh plants, of which BG <em>&amp; </em>E was a joint owner, \u201cseem to be beset with boiler problems which result in reduced generation availability----\u201d Although concluding that based upon the record in that proceeding BG &amp; E\u2019s application should be approved as filed, the Commission indicated that it would continue to \u201cexamine the effect on the fuel rate of any inefficiencies in the operation of these plants in subsequent fuel rate adjustment proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>The following year the Commission, applying the same interpretation of \u00a7 54F(f)(4), disallowed BG <em>&amp; </em>E\u2019s recovery of increased fuel costs incurred as a result of a forced outage at one of BG &amp; E\u2019s nuclear generating units. <em>See </em>Case No. 7238-B, Order No. 63804 (May 29, 1979). Again, evidence was introduced that BG &amp; E\u2019s level of productive capacity compared favorably to industry averages. The Commission, nevertheless, conducted further investigation into the cause of the outage, observing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-4\">\u201c[t]he inquiry has to be directed to what extent the increased costs for replacement generation could have been avoided through, i.e., better planning, preventive maintenance, more diligent efforts, closer supervision, and more prudent management. Such a finding can only be made if the performance of each individual plant is examined and cannot be based solely on the satisfactory performance level of the system as a whole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">\u201c... Based upon the need to examine circumstances surrounding any outage, the commission finds that conclusions with respect to the reasonableness of performance levels cannot automatically be made on the basis of the statistical comparison.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">In light of this standard, and the evidence in the record, the Commission concluded that BG &amp; E had failed to meet its burden under \u00a7 54F(f)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">In another case conducted later in 1979, the Commission repeated the language quoted above, adding that \u201c[a] comparison of the equivalent availability factors will indicate where further inquiry into the performance level of an individual plant is required____\u201d Case No. 7239-B, Order No. 63810 (June 12, 1979). Essentially the same interpretation was applied in every subsequent fuel rate adjustment proceeding.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>It is clear that the interpretation the Commission initially placed upon \u00a7 54F(f)(4) was further developed and refined in subsequent contested proceedings during the four years between the initial proceedings in 1978 and the issuance of the two orders which are the subject of the case now before us. Of course, the orderly growth and development of legal principles is an important function of such contested proceedings. We find no merit, however, in BG &amp; E\u2019s contention that the interpretation of \u00a7 54F(f)(4) set forth in the November 22, 1982, orders represented a significant departure from the Commission\u2019s past practice. We conclude that the interpretation of \u00a7 54F(f)(4) applied by the Commission in the present case is entitled to considerable weight as a contemporaneous agency interpretation consistently adhered to for four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">The analysis provided in the orders issued by the Commission during the initial proceedings in 1978, as well as in its subsequent orders, demonstrates the thoroughness with which the Commission considered the scope of its mandate under \u00a7 54F, the legislative policy underlying the statute, and the evidence presented during the proceedings. The interpretation of \u00a7 54F(f)(4) which the Commission formulated and applied in these contested proceedings is entirely consistent with the language and purpose of the statute. Furthermore, the interpretation is consistent with the general principle of utility regulation that costs incurred by a utility company as a result of managerial imprudence cannot be recovered from the company\u2019s customers. <em>See C. &amp; P. Tel. Co., supra, </em>230 Md. at 411-14, 187 A.2d 475; <em>Florida Power Corp. v. Cresse, </em>413 So.2d 1187, 1189-91 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>(Fla.1982); <em>Virginia Elec. v.

We are therefore persuaded that the Commission has correctly interpreted \u00a7 54F(f)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">C. The State Documents Law</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">BG &amp; E next argues that the standards through which the Commission implemented \u00a7 54F(f)(4) constituted rules illegally promulgated in violation of the State Documents Law, Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.) Art. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 256B-256T.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The State Documents Law requires, <em>inter alia, </em>that notice of proposed agency rulemaking and the text of proposed agency rules be published in the Maryland Register, \u00a7 256F(b)(2), (3), and that the text of the adopted agency rules be published in both the Maryland Register and the Code of Maryland Regulations, \u00a7\u00a7 256C(b)(2), 256F(b)(l). The Commission was made subject to the State Documents Law by chapter 858 of the Acts of 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The word \u201crule\u201d is defined for purposes of the State Documents Law by reference to the Administrative Procedure Act, Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.) Art. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 244-256A.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Section 244(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act broadly defines \u201crule\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\"><em>\u201c\u2018Rule\u2019 </em>includes every regulation, standard, guideline, or statement of policy or interpretation of general application and future effect, including the amendment or repeal thereof, adopted by an agency, whether with or without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>prior hearing, to implement or make specific the law enforced or administered by it or to govern its organization, procedure, or the practice before such agency, but does not include regulations concerning only the internal management of the agency and not directly affecting the rights of or procedures available to the public, responses to petitions for adoption of rules issued pursuant to \u00a7 248 of this article, or declaratory rulings issued pursuant to \u00a7 250 of this article.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">Section 85(a) of the Public Service Commission Law provides that \u201c[ejvery decision and order of the Commission in any contested proceeding shall be based upon a consideration of the record, shall be in writing and shall state the grounds for the Commission\u2019s conclusions.\u201d Thus, the Commission is required to articulate the standards through which it applied the applicable law to the relevant facts in reaching its decision in a contested proceeding. Furthermore, such standards will often have a degree of general application and future effect. Although the principle of <em>stare decisis </em>has limited applicability to administrative agencies, as a practical matter agencies frequently do use their prior decisions as precedents, and the standards through which a statute is implemented in one proceeding may well reappear in later proceedings. <em>See </em>4 K. Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 20:9, :11 (2d ed. 1983); 73A C.J.S. <em>Public Administrative Law &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 157 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">To conclude, however, that every time an agency explains the standards through which it applies a statute in a contested proceeding it is promulgating rules, and must therefore comply with the notice requirements of the State Documents Law, would be patently unreasonable. The administrative adjudicatory process is designed primarily to resolve concrete disputes between parties, rather than to establish abstract principles of general applicability. BG &amp; E\u2019s interpretation would impose a tremendous, and unnecessary, burden upon state agencies, rendering the administrative adjudicatory process all but unworkable. Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>should be construed to avoid such absurd consequences. <em>See In re Special Investigation No. 281, </em>299 Md. 181, 200, 473 A.2d 1 (1984); <em>Mazor, supra, </em>279 Md. at 361, 369 A.2d 82; <em>Blocker v. Harlow, </em>268 Md. 571, 584, 303 A.2d 395 (1973); 2A N. Singer, <em>Sutherland on Statutes and Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 45.12 (rev. 4th ed. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">In the cases before us, the Commission did not abstractly formulate new rules of binding and universal future effect, but simply articulated the standards through which it interpreted and implemented \u00a7 54F(f)(4) during the course of specific contested proceedings, as it was required to do by \u00a7 85(a). The standards were applied only to the facts and circumstances of those proceedings, and necessarily determined the legal rights and obligations of only the parties to the proceedings. We hold, therefore, that the standards through which the Commission implemented \u00a7 54F(f)(4) did not constitute rules within the meaning of the State Documents Law, but were simply part of the \u201cgrounds for the Commission\u2019s conclusions\u201d announced in compliance with \u00a7 85(a). <em>See generally 2 </em>K. Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 7:2 (2d ed. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">D. Rulemaking <em>versus </em>Adjudication</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">BG &amp; E further argues that, if the standards applied in Cases O, T, and U were not rules, then this in itself constituted error by the Commission. That is, BG &amp; E maintains that in developing these standards the Commission should have proceeded by formal rulemaking rather than by adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">It is a well settled principle of administrative law that \u201cthe choice made between proceeding by general rule or by individual, ad hoc litigation is one. that lies primarily in the informed discretion of the administrative agency.\u201d <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 203, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 1580, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947). <em>See also NAACP v. FPC, </em>425 U.S. 662, 668, 96 S.Ct. 1806, 1810, 48 L.Ed.2d 284 (1976); <em>NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., </em>416 U.S. 267, 291-95, 94 S.Ct. 1757, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>1770-72, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1974); <em>Consumer Protection v. Consumer Pub., </em>304 Md. 731, 753-54, 501 A.2d 48 (1985). As the Supreme Court of the United States explained in <em>Chenery,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-4\">\u201c[t]he function of filling in the interstices of the Act should be performed, as much as possible, through this quasi-legislative promulgation of rules to be applied in the future. But any rigid requirement to that effect would make the administrative process inflexible and incapable of dealing with many of the specialized problems which arise. ... Not every principle essential to the effective administration of a statute can or should be cast immediately into the mold of a general rule. Some principles must await their own development, while others must be adjusted to meet particular, unforeseeable situations. In performing its important functions in these respects, therefore, an administrative agency must be equipped to act either by general rule or by individual order. To insist upon one form of action to the exclusion of the other is to exalt form over necessity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeS\">332 U.S. at 202, 67 S.Ct. at 1580.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-6\"><em>See generally 2 </em>K. Davis, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 7:25 (2d ed.1979 &amp; Supp.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">We find no evidence that the Commission abused its discretion in choosing to proceed by adjudication in interpreting and implementing \u00a7 54F(f)(4). As already indicated, the interpretation of \u00a7 54F(f)(4) that the Commission applied in the cases before us does not differ significantly from that originally articulated by the Commission shortly after the statute\u2019s enactment. This is not a case, therefore, in which materially modified or new standards were applied retroactively to the detriment of a company that had relied upon the Commission\u2019s past pronouncements. <em>Cf. National Gas, Etc. v. Fed. Energy Reg. Com\u2019n, </em>590 F.2d 664, 669-70 (7th Cir.1979) (agency not permitted to reverse abruptly during adjudication long-standing practice where regulated companies had acted in substantial reliance upon existing practice).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Furthermore, at the time the orders in question were issued in Cases O, T, and U, the Commission was already well aware of the views of the other three companies affected by the statute. Indeed, the standards applied in these cases were originally developed and subsequently refined during contested proceedings involving all of the companies subject to \u00a7 54F. The Commission was therefore entirely justified in rendering its decisions in Cases 0, T, and U without conducting rulemaking proceedings to elicit the views of these other three companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">E. The Commission\u2019s Orders</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Having upheld both the Commission\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 54F and the legality of the procedure through which it implemented this statute in Cases O, T, and U, we turn lastly to BG&amp;E\u2019s challenge that the Commission\u2019s orders in these cases were \u201cunlawful, arbitrary, and capricious.\u201d In reviewing an order of the Commission, we are constrained by \u00a7 97 to limit the scope of our inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">\u201cEvery final decision, order, rule or regulation of the Commission shall be prima facie correct and shall be affirmed unless clearly shown to be (1) in violation of constitutional provisions, or (2) not within the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the Commission, or (3) made upon unlawful procedure, or (4) arbitrary or capricious, or (5) affected by other error of law, or (6) if the subject of review is an order entered in a contested case after hearing, such order is unsupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">In light of \u00a7 97, we have consistently held that Commission orders enjoy a high degree of judicial deference on review. <em>See, e.g., Public Service Comm\u2019n v. Patuxent Valley, </em>300 Md. 200, 216-17, 477 A.2d 759 (1984); <em>Potomac Edison, supra, </em>279 Md. at 582-83, 369 A.2d 1035; <em>Baltimore Gas, supra, </em>273 Md. at 361-63, 329 A.2d 691. Recognizing the experience and special expertise of the Commission and its staff, a reviewing court must not substitute its judgment for that of the Commission. <em>Potomac Edison, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number><em>supra, </em>279 Md. at 582-83, 369 A.2d 1035; <em>Baltimore Gas, supra, </em>273 Md. at 362, 329 A.2d 691; <em>Baltimore Trans. Co. v. Pub. Ser. Comm., </em>206 Md. 533, 558, 112 A.2d 687 (1955). Indeed, a reviewing court must uphold a Commission order on appeal unless the party challenging the order demonstrates by clear and satisfactory evidence that the order is unlawful or unreasonable. <em>Baltimore Gas, supra, </em>273 Md. at 362, 329 A.2d 691; <em>Baltimore Trans., supra, </em>206 Md. at 558, 112 A.2d 687; <em>Montgomery Co. v. Pub. Ser. Comm., </em>203 Md. 79, 84, 98 A.2d 15 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">In <em>Baltimore Gas, supra, </em>we reaffirmed our adherence to the principles of judicial review articulated for the Court by Chief Judge Hammond in <em>Insurance Comm\u2019r v. Nat\u2019l Bureau, </em>248 Md. 292, 236 A.2d 282 (1967):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">\u201c[The court\u2019s] appraisal or evaluation must be of the agency\u2019s fact-finding results and not an independent original estimate of or decision on the evidence. The required process is difficult to precisely articulate but it is plain that it requires restrained and disciplined judicial judgment so as not to interfere with the agency\u2019s factual conclusions---- [J]udicial review essentially should be limited to whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached. This need not and must not be either judicial fact-finding or a substitution of judicial judgment for agency judgment.\u201d 248 Md. at 309-10, 236 A.2d 282.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">BG&amp;E first argues that in holding the company\u2019s management responsible for the forced outages in Cases O, T, and U, the Commission imposed a standard requiring perfect hindsight and nearly perfect performance. The record in these cases belies this argument. In investigating both of the outages in question, the Commission carefully considered the likelihood of the types of accidents that occurred, the foreseeable costs resulting from such accidents, and the cost and efficacy of preventive measures. The Commission concluded that BG&amp;E had failed to implement cost-effective procedures that might well have pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>vented the outages. We believe this conclusion was reasonable and supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">In Case 0, the record contained substantial evidence that the outage was caused by a standard <em>xk </em>inch nut having fallen into the thrust bearing of the main turbine during a routine maintenance procedure. There was undisputed evidence that similar accidents had occurred before, although none had ever resulted in an outage. BG&amp;E offered testimony that it has a policy of requiring its employees to notify a supervisor if they are unable to account for a tool or piece of equipment that may have been lost in the vicinity of a critical maintenance project. BG&amp;E also indicated that, to encourage compliance with this policy, it takes no disciplinary action against employees who report missing tools or equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">While endorsing this policy, the Commission concluded that it had been poorly implemented. The policy was apparently never written down; employees learned of it, if at all, by word of mouth. In addition, the Commission found no documentation chronicling the measures actually taken in instances in which articles were reported missing. In the Commission\u2019s opinion, cost-effective measures could have been instituted by BG&amp;E to ensure that employees were aware of the policy and to verify that appropriate procedures were followed when articles were reported missing. The Commission\u2019s order clearly indicates that BG&amp;E was not denied recovery of 25% of its replacement power costs merely because the outage was caused by human error; indeed, the Commission emphasized that \u201can outage occasioned by human error is not a <em>per se </em>violation of this statutory standard.\u201d Rather, BG&amp;E was denied full recovery because it had failed to implement cost-effective procedures that might have prevented such an outage.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">In Cases T and U, the Commission determined that the outage in question was caused by a mechanic\u2019s failure to install a dummy plug in a condenser tube sheet after having removed a leaking condenser tube from the sheet for metal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>lurgical examination. Because the plug was not installed, salt water from the Chesapeake Bay entered the condenser through the tube sheet and contaminated the reactor\u2019s secondary cooling system. The Commission further found that the contamination was worsened and the subsequent outage lengthened because BG&amp;E had too few chemistry personnel on duty during the maintenance procedure, thereby delaying detection of the leak, and because BG&amp;E had failed to train adequately its chemistry and operations personnel regarding the proper procedure for detection and control of gross salt water leakage.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-4\">In its order, the Commission concluded that,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">\u201cin light of the importance of the proper insertion of dummy condenser tubes as a defense against cooling system contamination by bay water, and in consideration of the significant consequences which would result from an error in the performance of the maintenance activity, management should have foreseen the need for and benefit of additional control procedures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The Commission identified several cost-effective control procedures it believed might have prevented this type of accident: \u201clead repairman documenting the position of tubes which were plugged as well as tubes which were pulled; conducting an inventory of the number of tubes removed and the number of plugs utilized; and/or having a quality control inspector verify the maintenance work.\u201d The Commission also found that BG&amp;E\u2019s management should have foreseen the need for additional chemistry personnel during the maintenance procedure, and the need for more thorough training for its chemistry and operations personnel. Again, the Commission denied a portion of BG &amp; E\u2019s recovery not merely because the accident occurred, but because BG&amp;E had failed to implement cost-effective procedures that might have prevented the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">BG&amp;E next argues that no substantial evidence was introduced that the outage reviewed in Case 0 would have been prevented by the precautionary measures advocated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>by the Commission. Implicit in this argument is a basic misconception regarding the burden of proof in these proceedings. Section 54F(i) places the burden on the applicant to prove that it has complied with the requirements of \u00a7 54F(f). Thus, it was incumbent upon BG&amp;E to prove that the outage was not the result of its failure to implement cost-effective precautionary measures. As we have already indicated, the record contains substantial evidence that the measures advocated by the Commission were cost-effective and might well have prevented the outage. The burden of proof was therefore upon BG&amp;E to demonstrate that these measures would not in fact have prevented the outage, rather than upon the Commission or People\u2019s Counsel to prove the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Finally, BG&amp;E asserts that \u201c[t]he failure of a utility to perceive and implement each and every conceivable maintenance control is not tantamount to imprudence or mismanagement.\u201d We agree. As the Commission indicated in its orders in these cases, it is only the failure to implement <em>cost-effective </em>controls that is tantamount to imprudence. A reasoning mind could reasonably have concluded, as did the Commission, that the precautionary measures advocated in these orders were cost-effective. We, therefore, defer to the Commission\u2019s judgment in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">McAULIFFE, J., concurs in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">McAULIFFE, Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">I concur in the result only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-9\">.
