State, </em>304 Md. 439, 499 A.2d 1236 (1985), <em>Evans v. State, </em>304 Md. 487, 499 A.2d 1261 (1985), and <em>Huffington v. State, </em>304 Md. 559, 500 A.2d 272 (1985), this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Court affirmed the judgments in these three capital cases, thereby upholding the imposition of death sentences upon the three defendants. The defendants Foster, Evans and Huffington, all represented by the Office of Public Defender, have now filed motions for reconsideration. The chief argument in each motion is identical, and it relates to the contention that had been made and rejected in all three cases that the Maryland capital punishment statute, in \u00a7 413(h) of Art. 27, unconstitutionally places the burden of persuasion on the defendant with regard to the weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. In addition, related arguments concerning the trial courts\u2019 jury instructions are made in each motion. Finally, the defendant Evans makes an unrelated contention. Because the principal thrust of each motion is the same, we have chosen to rule upon the three motions in a single opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">As indicated above, in these three cases the defendants had argued that Art. 27, \u00a7 413(h), violates due process principles because it \u201cplaces the burden on the capital defendant \u2018to convince [the sentencer] that mitigating circumstances outweigh ... the aggravating circumstances\u2019 \u201d and thus \u201cplaces the ultimate burden of ... persuasion on the capital defendant____\u201d (Foster\u2019s brief, pp. 40, 44; Evans\u2019s brief, pp. 82, 87; Huffington\u2019s brief, pp. 48, 52). Part IV C of the opinion in <em>Foster, </em>304 Md. at 476-480, 499 A.2d 1236, flatly rejected this contention, stating that \u201cwe need not decide whether a statute imposing such a \u2018burden\u2019 on a capital defendant would be constitutional, for the Maryland statute, as interpreted in <em>Tichnell I [Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 730, 415 A.2d 830 (1980) ] and later cases, places no such burden on the defendant.\u201d We went on to point out in <em>Foster </em>that subsection (h) of \u00a7 413, while employing the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d test, \u201cdoes not specify which side has the burden of proof or of persuasion.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 304 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Md. at 477, 499 A.2d 1236. We further took the position that just because the Legislature in \u00a7 413(h) referred in paragraph (2) to whether \u201cmitigating circumstances do not outweigh the aggravating circumstances\u201d and in paragraph (3) to whether \u201cmitigating circumstances outweigh the aggravating circumstances,\u201d instead of using the reverse order or some other language, did not show a legislative intent to place any burden or risk upon the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 477-478, 499 A.2d 1236. The Court in <em>Foster </em>then quoted from <em>Tichnell I </em>where we unequivocally held that, because it is the prosecution which is attempting to establish that the death penalty is appropriate, \u201c \u2018the statute places the risk of nonpersuasion on the prosecution with respect to whether the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 479, 499 A.2d 1236, quoting 287 Md. at 730, 415 A.2d 830. The Court in <em>Foster </em>also quoted <em>Trimble v. State, </em>300 Md. 387, 415 n. 16, 478 A.2d 1143 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1231, 84 L.Ed.2d 368 (1985), which again specifically stated that we have construed \u00a7 413(h) \u201cto place the burden of persuasion on the prosecution\u201d with regard to the weighing of mitigating and aggravating circumstances. Finally, we made it clear in <em>Foster </em>that we were adhering \u201cto our prior holdings that the burden of persuasion for purposes of \u00a7 413(h) is upon the prosecution.\u201d 304 Md. at 479, 499 A.2d 1236. The <em>Evans </em>and <em>Huffington </em>opinions, in rejecting the identical argument by the defendants, simply referred to the <em>Foster </em>opinion. <em>See </em>304 Md. at 536, 499 A.2d 1261; 304 Md. at 587, 500 A.2d 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>In the motions for reconsideration, the defendants assert that the above-described holding in the <em>Foster </em>opinion effected a change in this Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 413(h), and that several earlier opinions of this Court had held that the burden is on the defendant regarding the weighing of mitigating and aggravating circumstances. The three defendants argue that this \u201cCourt\u2019s reconstruction of the plain language and decisional history of \u00a7 413(h), depriving [each] Appellant of her [or his] constitutional challenge to the statute while denying her [or him] the benefit of the reconstruction, violates the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.\u201d (Foster\u2019s motion for reconsideration, p. 5). The defendants go on to argue that the statute \u201cwas rendered unconstitutionally vague by the Court\u2019s unprecedented reconstruction.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 6). Next, Foster, Evans and Huffington contend that the Court\u2019s \u201cbelated reconstruction of \u00a7 413(h),\u201d when \u201ccoupled with the Court\u2019s refusal to allow [the defendants] to realize the benefit of the clarification,\u201d violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution, Art. 1, \u00a7 9. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 8). Finally the defendants assert that \u201c[s]witehing the burden of proof as to aggravating and mitigating circumstances ... creates the possibility that identically situated persons will be treated differently in violation of the eighth and fourteenth amendments.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">It is unnecessary to explore in detail or treat separately these constitutional arguments, for they all rest upon the same faulty premise. They are all based upon the defendants\u2019 assertions that this Court\u2019s opinions prior to <em>Foster </em>had construed \u00a7 413(h) to place the burden of persuasion on the accused with regard to weighing aggravating and mitigating circumstances and that the opinions in the instant cases changed such construction of the statute. These assertions are flatly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The opinions (and specific pages therein) relied on by the defendants for their contention that this Court had previously construed \u00a7 413(h) to place the burden of persuasion on the accused, are <em>Maziarz v. State, </em>302 Md. 1, 6, 485 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>245 (1984); <em>Thomas v. State, </em>301 Md. 294, 334, 483 A.2d 6 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1856, 85 L.Ed.2d 153 (1985); <em>Stebbing v. State, </em>299 Md. 331, 374, 473 A.2d 903, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 276, 83 L.Ed.2d 212 (1984); <em>Colvin v. State, </em>299 Md. 88, 122, 472 A.2d 953, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 226, 83 L.Ed.2d 155 (1984); <em>Tichnell v. State (Tichnell III), </em>297 Md. 432, 449, 468 A.2d 1 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 2374, 80 L.Ed.2d 846 (1984); and <em>Johnson v. State, </em>292 Md. 405, 438, 439 A.2d 542 (1982). Not a single one of these opinions dealt with which side had the burden of proof, or burden of persuasion, or risk of nonpersuasion, as to the weighing of mitigating and aggravating factors under the provisions of \u00a7 413(h). In fact, none of these opinions even used the words \u201cburden,\u201d \u201crisk,\u201d \u201cproof,\u201d \u201cpersuasion\u201d or \u201cnonpersuasion\u201d in connection with subsection (h) of \u00a7 413. The issue of which side had the burden of persuasion or the risk of nonpersuasion under \u00a7 413(h) was simply not ruled upon or even mentioned in. the opinions relied on by the defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">The opinions cited in the motions for reconsideration in support of the assertion that this Court had previously construed \u00a7 413(h) to place the burden of persuasion on the accused, do either quote or repeat some or all of the statutory language in \u00a7 413(h), and it is this language upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>which the defendants specifically rely. For example, the <em>Maziarz </em>opinion, 302 Md. at 6, 485 A.2d 245, quoted \u00a7 413(h)(3) and then repeated that the \u201cstatute requires that a sentence of life imprisonment be imposed if, by a preponderance of the evidence, the sentencing authority finds that the mitigating circumstances outweigh the aggravating circumstances.\u201d Similar language, quoting or repeating \u00a7 413(h)(2) or 413(h)(3), is found in the other cited opinions, and such language is referred to in the motions for reconsideration. Nevertheless, in <em>Tichnell I, </em>the first case under Maryland\u2019s present death penalty statute, the Court repeated the same language as that now relied on by the defendants and immediately thereafter held that the prosecution bore the risk of nonpersuasion under \u00a7 413(h). Chief Judge Murphy there stated for the Court (287 Md. at 730, 415 A.2d 830):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-4\">\u201cFinally, if the sentencing authority finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the mitigating circumstances do not outweigh the aggravating circumstances, the death penalty must be imposed. \u00a7 413(h)(2). Because the State is attempting to establish that the imposition of the death penalty is an appropriate sentence, the statute places the risk of nonpersuasion on the prosecution with respect to whether the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">And in the <em>Foster </em>opinion, 304 Md. at 477-478, 499 A.2d 1236, we discussed this point in detail, holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag8\">\u201cmerely because the General Assembly in \u00a7 413(h) referred in paragraph (2) to whether \u2018mitigating circumstances do not outweigh the aggravating circumstances\u2019 and in paragraph (3) to whether \u2018mitigating circumstances outweigh the aggravating circumstances,\u2019 instead of using the reverse order or some other phraseology, does not reflect a legislative intent to place any burden or risk upon the accused. If the Legislature had added a fourth paragraph to subsection (h), specifying the result if the sentencing authority found that mitigating and aggravating circumstances were in a state of even balance or if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>the sentencing authority was unable to determine which outweighed the other, there would have been a clear inference regarding the allocation of the burden or risk. But the Legislature added no such fourth paragraph.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">As pointed out above, <em>Tichnell I </em>was the first appellate opinion under the present capital punishment statute. Because of that, and because counsel for Tichnell had made a broad multi-issue attack upon the statute\u2019s constitutionality, this Court rendered a comprehensive opinion interpreting the statute and upholding its constitutionality. <em>See </em>287 Md. at 720-741, 415 A.2d 830. In virtually every opinion in a capital case since then, where an issue concerning the meaning of \u00a7 413(f), (g) or (h) has arisen or an argument about the statute\u2019s constitutionality has been made, we have for the most part disposed of the matter on the basis of <em>Tichnell I. </em>The interpretation of \u00a7 413(h) set forth in <em>Tichnell I </em>has not been departed from or questioned in any subsequent opinion of this Court, and it was expressly reaffirmed in the <em>Trimble </em>case and the present cases. Consequently, we reject the assertion in the motions for reconsideration that the <em>Foster </em>opinion changed this Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 413(h). Since that assertion forms the entire basis for the constitutional arguments advanced, we likewise reject those arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">In none of these three cases did the defendants in this Court challenge the jury instructions, or a refusal to give an instruction, concerning the jurors\u2019 responsibilities under \u00a7 413(h). Instead, as indicated in our opinions in the cases, the constitutional arguments with respect to \u00a7 413(h) were exclusively directed to the statutory provision on its face. <em>See Foster, </em>304 Md. at 472, 499 A.2d 1236; <em>Evans, </em>304 Md. at 536, 499 A.2d 1261; <em>Huffington, </em>304 Md. at 586-587, 500 A.2d 272. Therefore, as we pointed out in the <em>Evans </em>opinion, 304 Md. at 536 n. 18, 499 A.2d 1261, any complaints about the jury instructions were waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Now, in their motions for reconsideration, the defendants do for the first time on appeal raise questions concerning the jury instructions relating to \u00a7 413(h). Foster argues that the trial court committed error by refusing to give a requested instruction concerning the burden of proof under \u00a7 413(h). Evans contends that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that the language of \u00a7 413(h) places no burden or risk upon the accused. Huffington asserts that an instruction, which essentially referred to the statutory language and the wording of the verdict sheet, was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">As pointed out above, the defendants\u2019 failure to make these contentions in their briefs and oral arguments constitutes a waiver or abandonment of them. <em>See, e.g., Health Serv. Cost Rev. v. Lutheran Hosp., </em>298 Md. 651, 664, 472 A.2d 55 (1984); <em>Logan v. Town of Somerset, </em>271 Md. 42, 67, 314 A.2d 436 (1974); <em>Ricker v. Abrams, </em>263 Md. 509, 516, 283 A.2d 583 (1971); <em>Wooddy v. Wooddy, </em>256 Md. 440, 450-451, 261 A.2d 486 (1970); <em>Harmon v. State Roads Comm., </em>242 Md. 24, 30-32, 217 A.2d 513 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">We recognize that the failure of counsel to raise certain types of issues on appeal, whether by inadvertence or deliberate decision, would not necessarily preclude their consideration in a subsequent proceeding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such issues include rights which cannot be waived absent intentional and knowing action by the defendant, rights which can only be waived personally by a defendant, matters which are deemed more appropriate for resolution in proceedings subsequent to an appeal such as proceedings under the Post Conviction Procedure Act, Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 645A <em>et seq., </em>or issues where there exist special circumstances excusing waiver. <em>See </em>the discussion in <em>Curtis v. State, </em>284 Md. 132, 395 A.2d 464 (1978). As to other matters, however, \u201c[tjactical decisions, when made by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>authorized competent attorney, as well as legitimate procedural requirements, will normally bind a criminal defendant.\u201d <em>Curtis v. State, supra, </em>284 Md. at 150, 395 A.2d 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">We further recognize that in a capital case the Court is less strict about the failure to preserve issues for review, and the Court may under appropriate circumstances exercise its discretion to decide such issues. <em>Johnson v. State, supra, </em>292 Md. at 412 n. 3, 439 A.2d 542. Even in a death penalty case, however, counsel should not be able to continually relitigate the same matter by withholding issues or framing the questions differently each time. Otherwise, in cases such as these involving jury instructions and verdicts pursuant to a statutory provision, counsel could on the initial appeal argue that the statutory provision is facially unconstitutional, argue in the next proceeding <em>(e.g., </em>a motion for reconsideration or the first post conviction proceeding) that the trial judge should have given certain instructions under the provision, bring a second post conviction proceeding and contend that the instructions actually given were erroneous, and bring a third post conviction proceeding at which the verdict sheet was challenged. Even where the penalty in a case is as awesome as death, there must at some point be an end to litigation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, we hold that the present complaints concerning the jury instructions have been waived by the failure to raise them in the briefs and oral arguments before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">As an alternate ground for our decision, however, we hold that even if the jury instruction matters had been raised in the briefs or oral arguments, the defendants have failed to show reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Foster claims that the trial court erred in refusing to give her proposed instruction No. 9, which she attaches to her motion for reconsideration. The first and second sentences of this proposed instruction, concerning the weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, constituted a correct statement of the law; if that portion alone had been requested, the trial judge would have erred in refusing to give the instruction or its equivalent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But the very next sentence of the requested instruction contained language going beyond the weighing or balancing process contemplated by the statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the very least, the language of the third sentence was confusing, and this was pointed out by the trial judge. Under the circumstances, the trial judge did not err in refusing Foster\u2019s proposed instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">Evans also contends that the trial judge erred in not advising the jury \u201cthat the State has the burden of establishing that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances.\u201d But, insofar as we can determine from the record or from the motion for reconsideration, Evans neither submitted a proposed instruction to the trial judge in this regard nor orally requested any such instruction. As explained in the <em>Evans </em>opinion, 304 Md. at 536 n. 18, 499 A.2d 1261, Evans\u2019s counsel did no more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>object when the trial judge read the jury verbatim the language of \u00a7 413(h). Also as indicated in the <em>Evans </em>opinion, <em>id. </em>at 537 n. 18, 499 A.2d 1261, the instruction was not erroneous because the \u201clanguage of \u00a7 413(h) does not place any burden or risk upon the accused.\u201d Therefore, the trial court in <em>Evans </em>committed no error in regard to the jury instructions under \u00a7 413(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Huffington argues that the trial court committed error when it read the jury Part III of the verdict sheet, essentially embodying the language of \u00a7 413(h). As acknowledged in the motion for reconsideration, however, no objection was made at trial to the judge\u2019s action. Consequently, the matter would not have been preserved for appellate review even if raised in the briefs or oral argument. Moreover, as we held in the <em>Foster </em>and <em>Evans </em>opinions, the language of \u00a7 413(h), which is reflected on the verdict sheet, does not place the risk of nonpersuasion upon the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Evans argues in his motion for reconsideration that this Court\u2019s opinion did not fully consider his question No. 11, which he sets forth in his motion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">\u201c11. Is Appellant entitled to a new sentencing because the trial court refused to allow him to introduce evidence on his eligibility for parole, or because the trial court refused to instruct the jury that a life sentence means exactly that and the jury should presume that Appellant would spend the rest of his life in prison?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Nevertheless, the question as set forth in his brief did not relate to a proposed jury instruction concerning the meaning of a life sentence, although the argument made a reference to such an instruction. Question No. 11 in the brief was in its entirety as follows (Evans\u2019s brief, p. 71):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2a\">\u201cXI. APPELLANT IS ENTITLED TO A NEW SENTENCING BECAUSE THE TRIAL COURT REFUSED <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>TO ADMIT EVIDENCE AS TO WHEN APPELLANT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">We fully answered in the <em>Evans </em>opinion the question presented, reaffirming a well-established principle of Maryland law that evidence concerning parole eligibility under statutes and administrative procedures is inadmissible at a criminal trial or sentencing proceeding before a jury, as it may suggest to the jury that it might shift its statutory responsibilities to another body. 304 Md. at 530, 499 A.2d 1261. Under this reasoning, it is inadmissible whether it arguably relates to the statutory mitigating circumstance dealing with the likelihood of future criminal activity constituting a threat to society (\u00a7 413(g)(7)), or any other possible mitigating circumstance, statutory or not.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Turning to the merits of the contention now made by Evans concerning the failure to instruct that a \u201clife sentence means exactly that,\u201d the trial judge committed no error. Such an instruction would have been incorrect under Maryland law. <em>See </em>Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol, 1985 Cum. Supp.), Art. 41, \u00a7 122(b)(2), and Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol., 1985 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 638C and 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Finding no merit in the three motions for reconsideration, the motions are hereby denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-7\">. Art. 27, \u00a7 413(h), provides in its entirety as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>\"(h) <em>Weighing mitigating and aggravating circumstances. </em>\u2014 (1) If the court or jury finds that one or more of these mitigating circumstances exist, it shall determine whether, by a preponderance of the evidence, the mitigating circumstances outweigh the aggravating circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">\"(2) If it finds that the mitigating circumstances do not outweigh the aggravating circumstances, the sentence shall be death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">\"(3) If it finds that the mitigating circumstances outweigh the aggravating circumstances, the sentence shall be imprisonment for life.\"</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b400-13\"><em>. </em>One of the cases cited by the defendants, <em>Maziarz, </em>302 Md. at 5-6, did decide a different matter under \u00a7 413(h), namely that the \"preponderance of the evidence\u201d standard rather than an \"overwhelming\" standard was the appropriate standard for weighing aggravating and mitigating circumstances under subsection (h). The Court, however, did not discuss which side bore the risk of nonpersuasion under subsection (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-14\">Two of the other cases cited in the motions for reconsideration dealt with the matter of the defendant bearing the risk of nonproduction or nonpersuasion as to the presence of a mitigating circumstance under subsection (g) of \u00a7 413. <em>Stebbing, </em>299 Md. at 373, 473 A.2d 903; <em>Colvin, </em>299 Md. at 121, 472 A.2d 953, 126-127. As discussed in the <em>Foster </em>opinion, however, 304 Md. at 475-476, 499 A.2d 1236, this is a quite different issue than which side bears the risk of nonpersuasion under subsection (h).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b403-6\">. The motions for reconsideration suggest that the attorneys\u2019 decisions in these cases to challenge \u00a7 413(h) on its face, and to raise no issues concerning instructions under \u00a7 413(h), were deliberate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b404-6\">. We note that all three of the instant cases had previously been before us. <em>See Foster v. State, </em>297 Md. 191, 464 A.2d 986 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1073, 104 S.Ct. 985, 79 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984); <em>Evans v.

The beginning of Foster\u2019s requested jury instruction was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1J\">\"DEFENDANT\u2019S PROPOSED INSTRUCTION NO. 9</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">\"Your next duty will be to weigh any mitigating circumstances which exist against any aggravating circumstances which exist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">\"Because the State is attempting to establish that death is the appropriate punishment, the State bears the burden of establishing that the aggravating circumstances which you find outweigh the mitigating circumstances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The above-quoted language is in accord with the type of instruction which, as pointed out in the <em>Evans </em>opinion, 304 Md. at 537 n. 18, 499 A.2d 1261, should be given if requested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b405-9\">. The third sentence of Foster\u2019s Proposed Instruction No. 9 was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-10\">\"Unless you find, after considering the totality of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, that the aggravating factors, discounted by whatever mitigating circumstances exist, are sufficiently serious to require the sentence of death, you must impose life imprisonment.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b407-10\">. In this connection, it should be noted that the evidence proffered concerning parole eligibility did not relate to the particular crime in this case or to this particular defendant. Instead, it was evidence concerning the provisions of Maryland law and administrative procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b407-8\">McAULIFFE, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ank\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">I adhere to the views expressed in the concurring and dissenting opinion in <em>Evans v. </em>State, 304 Md. at 539, 499 A.2d 1261.
