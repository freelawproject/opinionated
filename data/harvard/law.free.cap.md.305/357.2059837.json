Vol.), \u00a7 4-302(d)(2)(ii) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which limits a criminal defendant\u2019s right to be tried by a jury under certain circumstances,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as applied to one charged with driving while intoxicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>under Code (1977, 1984 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 21-902(a) of the Transportation Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Under \u00a7 4-302(d)(2)(i) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, a criminal defendant in the District Court is entitled to a jury trial in any case where the maximum authorized penalty for the offense with which he is charged is imprisonment for greater than ninety days. If a defendant in such a case demands a jury trial, the District Court is deprived of jurisdiction, and jurisdiction is vested in the appropriate circuit court so that a jury trial may proceed. Under \u00a7 4 \u2014 302(d)(2)(ii), however, if the prosecutor recommends that the district judge <em>not </em>impose a term of imprisonment for more than ninety days, and if the judge so agrees, the defendant is not entitled to a jury trial and the case remains in the District Court to be tried without a jury. In <em>Kawamura v. State, </em>299 Md. 276, 473 A.2d 438 (1984), this Court held that \u00a7 4-302(d)(2)(ii), as applied to one charged with theft under Code (1957, 1982 Repl. Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 342(f)(2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was unconstitutional because it denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>defendant his right to a jury trial under the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">In the instant case, we previously filed a per curiam order, reversing the judgment of the Circuit Court for Wicomico County \u201cbecause the right to trial by jury established in <em>Kawamura v. State </em>... extends to a charge of driving a vehicle while intoxicated filed in the District Court of Maryland under ... \u00a7 21-902(a).\u201d We shall now give in more detail the reasons for our per curiam order.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The relevant facts are as follows. On June 5, 1984, Eloise H. Fisher appeared for trial, in the District Court of Maryland sitting in Wicomico County, to answer charges of driving while intoxicated (\u00a7 21-902(a) of the Transportation Article) and failure to obey a traffic control device (\u00a7 21-201 of the Transportation Article). Both of these offenses are misdemeanors. Under \u00a7 27-101(b) of the Transportation Article, failure to obey a traffic control device is punishable by a fine of not more than $500. Section 27-101(i) of the Transportation Article (1985 Supp.) provides that driving while intoxicated is punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than one year or both for a first offense, and by a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than two years or both for a second offense. Moreover if a person is convicted of a second offense of driving while intoxicated within three years of the first conviction, a period of imprisonment or community service is mandatory.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Fisher made a timely demand for a trial by jury. The State then recommended, and the district judge agreed, that Fisher would receive a sentence of not longer than ninety days should she be found guilty. Pursuant to \u00a7 4-302(d)(2)(ii) the judge denied Fisher\u2019s demand for a jury trial. Fisher requested that her trial be stayed pending resolution of her assertion that she was constitutionally entitled to a trial by jury, but the request was denied. After a trial in the District Court, Fisher was found guilty of driving while intoxicated and not guilty of failure to obey a traffic control device, and she was sentenced to pay a $245.00 fine plus $5.00 court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Fisher then petitioned the Circuit Court for Wicomico County for a writ of certiorari. In support of the petition, Fisher argued that her timely demand for a trial by jury deprived the District Court of jurisdiction and that the application of \u00a7 4 \u2014 302(d)(2)(ii) unconstitutionally deprived her of a trial by jury. After a hearing, the circuit court ruled that \u201cSection 4-302(d)(ii) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, as applied to the charge of driving while intoxicated, ... is not in violation of the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of the State of Maryland.\u201d The circuit court therefore concluded that Fisher\u2019s demand for a jury trial did not deprive the District Court of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Fisher filed an order of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and, before any proceedings in that court, we issued a writ of certiorari. As previously indicated, our order disposing of this case held that, under'the Maryland constitutional principles reviewed in <em>Kawamura v. State, supra, </em>\u00a7 4-302(d)(2)(ii) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article is invalid as applied to one charged with driving while intoxicated under \u00a7 21-902(a) of the Transportation Article, that Fisher was entitled to a trial by jury in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>first instance under the Maryland Declaration of Rights,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that her timely demand for a jury trial deprived the District Court of jurisdiction, and that the case should be remanded for a jury trial in the circuit court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In <em>Kawamura v. State, supra, </em>the State argued that because application of \u00a7 4-302(d)(2)(ii) imposes a ninety-day limit on incarceration, theft under $300 was a \u201cminor\u201d or \u201cpetty\u201d offense for purposes of the state constitutional right to a jury trial, and thus there was no right to trial by jury. Alternatively, the State argued that, even if there were a jury trial right for theft under $300, the right was fully satisfied by affording Kawamura a jury trial in a de novo appeal to the circuit court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After reviewing this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Court\u2019s prior decisions dealing with the state constitutional right to a jury trial at the initial trial level in criminal cases, we rejected both of the State\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The <em>Kawamura </em>opinion began by discussing <em>State v. Glenn, </em>54 Md. 572 (1880), where the Court had recognized that \u201cdespite the broad language of several Declaration of Rights sections, jurisdiction could be conferred upon a justice of the peace to try, without a jury, certain minor offenses.\u201d 299 Md. at 288, 473 A.2d 438. In <em>Glenn, </em>Judge Alvey pointed out for the Court that the Maryland Legislature, both in the colonial period and after the Revolution, had conferred jurisdiction upon justices of the peace to try certain types of offenses without a jury, 54 Md. at 602-603, and that English statutes had provided for such summary jurisdiction over minor and statutory police offenses \u201cfor centuries past,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 600. Reasoning that the framers of the Declaration of Rights \u201cwere well acquainted with the history of [such] legislation,\u201d and that \u201cit is difficult to suppose\u201d that they intended to \u201caltogether interdict the use of a long and well-established summary jurisdiction,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 605-606, the Court in <em>Glenn </em>held that the constitutional right to a jury trial does not extend to offenses which historically had been covered by statutes conferring summary jurisdiction upon justices of the peace. <em>Id. </em>at 606. Vagrant and habitually disorderly conduct, the offense at issue in <em>Glenn, </em>was held to be one such offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">In <em>Kawamura, </em>we reviewed later cases concerning the Maryland constitutional right to trial by jury and delineated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>the important factors which must be considered in determining whether the state constitutional right attaches to a particular offense at the initial trial level.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">As indicated above, the first significant consideration is whether the offense had historically been subject to the summary jurisdiction of justices of the peace or whether it had historically been tried before juries. <em>Kawamura v. State, supra, </em>299 Md. at 291, 473 A.2d 438; <em>Danner v. State, </em>89 Md. 220, 224, 226, 42 A. 965 (1899); <em>State v. Glenn, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The second important factor is whether the offense is an infamous crime or subject to infamous punishment. In <em>Danner </em>the Court held that, even though historically in England and in many states the right to a jury trial did not attach to petit larceny, in Maryland the constitutional right to a jury trial in the first instance attached to that offense because it was subject to infamous punishment. The <em>Danner </em>opinion held (89 Md. at 226, 42 A. 965):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">\u201cIt may, however, be stated as a general rule that for any criminal offense for which a person is liable to infamous punishment, a trial by jury cannot be denied him____ It cannot be questioned that confinement in the penitentiary is an infamous punishment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">In light of the <em>Glenn </em>and <em>Danner </em>cases, we concluded in <em>Kawamura </em>as follows (299 Md. at 291, 473 A.2d 438):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjY\"><em>\u201cGlenn </em>and <em>Danner, </em>therefore, establish that the right to a jury trial guaranteed by the Maryland Declaration of Rights does not attach, at least at the initial trial level, to certain minor criminal offenses, although this class cannot be precisely defined. Nevertheless the state constitutional jury trial right does attach in the first instance to offenses which historically had been tried before juries. It also attaches to any infamous offense or any offense subject to infamous punishment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">The third significant factor in determining whether the Maryland constitutional right to a jury trial in the first instance attaches to a particular offense, is the seriousness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>of the offense. In <em>Baum v. Warden of Jail, </em>110 Md. 579, 585, 73 A. 294 (1909), the Court held that the constitutional jury trial right attached to an assault offense created by local statute, even though it was not a felony and was not punishable by confinement in the penitentiary. The conclusion was based on the Court\u2019s view that the offense was \u201ccertainly of a more serious character than vagrancy or habitually disorderly conduct.\u201d 110 Md. at 585, 73 A. 294. <em>See also State v. Stafford, </em>160 Md. 385, 153 A. 77 (1931). And in holding that the constitutional right to a jury trial attached to the offense of theft under $300, we stated in <em>Kawamura, </em>299 Md. at 296, 473 A.2d 438: \u201cTheft, regardless of the amount involved, is and always has been regarded as an extremely serious offense in Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Finally, we emphasized in <em>Kawamura </em>that, insofar as the place or length of incarceration is pertinent in determining whether the offense is subject to infamous punishment or is regarded as a serious offense, \u201cit is the maximum sentence and place of incarceration established by the legislature for the particular offense which controls, and not the maximum sentence or place of incarceration decided by the court in a particular case.\u201d 299 Md. at 292, 473 A.2d 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">In light of the principles set forth in <em>Kawamura, Baum, Danner </em>and <em>Glenn, </em>the state constitutional right to a jury trial at the initial level certainly attaches to the offense of driving while intoxicated. The consideration of whether the offense had been tried before juries or had been subject to the summary jurisdiction of justices of the peace at and before the time when the Declaration of Rights was adopted is, of course, totally inapplicable, as the offense was unknown at that time. Nevertheless, the other significant considerations set forth in our cases clearly require a holding that the jury trial right attaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">First, the offense is subject to infamous punishment. As previously discussed, driving while intoxicated is punishable by maximum imprisonment terms of one year for the first offense and two years for the second offense. No statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>tory provisions limit the place of confinement to local jails. Consequently, under Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 690, a person convicted of driving while intoxicated is subject to being sentenced to the custody of the Commissioner of Correction and may be required by the Commissioner to serve his sentence in the Penitentiary. See the discussion in <em>Kawamura, </em>299 Md. at 295-296, 473 A.2d 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Second, the offense of driving while intoxicated is extremely serious. This is shown by the terrible consequences of the offense upon human lives and the manner in which the offense is regarded by the public. The maximum terms of imprisonment authorized by the Legislature constitute further indication of the offense\u2019s seriousness. Moreover, as previously noted, <em>supra </em>n. 3, the General Assembly has provided a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment, which cannot be suspended, for a second offense committed within three years of the first offense. A mandatory minimum term of imprisonment, not subject to suspension, is unusual for a second offense.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Additionally, the seriousness of driving while intoxicated is illustrated by the decision in <em>United States v. Woods, </em>450 F.Supp. 1335 (D.Md.1978). In that case, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland held that driving while intoxicated in national park land in contravention of 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.28(c) is a serious offense for which an accused must be accorded a right to trial by jury under the Sixth Amendment to the federal constitution. Although the maximum prescribed punishment for this federal offense was less than six months and fell within the federal definition of \u201cpetty offenses,\u201d the court found that Maryland treated driving while intoxicated as a serious offense. The Court in <em>Woods, </em>450 F.Supp. at 1349, quoted the uncompromising evaluation of driving while intoxicated set forth in <em>United States v. Barner, </em>195 F.Supp. 103 (N.D.Cal.1961):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>\u201cWhoever drives under the influence of intoxicating liquor risks death and destruction, not only for himself and his property, but for the person and property of innocent bystanders as well. Under these circumstances, it is apparent that such a person is guilty of an innately reprehensible act which every reasonable person would decry. And this such a reasonable person would do regardless of whether the act was proscribed by statute. The offense is, in truth, <em>malum in se. </em>He who drives while under the influence of intoxicating liquor drives at his own risk in more ways than one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-5\"><em>See also United States v. Craner, </em>652 F.2d 23 (9th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">We hold, therefore, that the Maryland constitutional right to a jury trial in the first instance attaches to the offense of driving while intoxicated in violation of \u00a7 21-902(a) of the Transportation Article, and that \u00a7 4-302(d)(2)(h) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article is unconstitutional as applied to that offense. Nevertheless, we point out that the Legislature has provided a way for the prosecution to accomplish essentially the same result as under \u00a7 4-302(d)(2)(ii) in a case not sufficiently serious to warrant transfer to the circuit court for a jury trial. Prior to 1969, there was one offense of driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle while \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor.\u201d Code (1957, 1967 Repl.Vol.), Art. 66x/2, \u00a7 206. In 1969 the General Assembly replaced this offense with two offenses. Ch. 158 of the Acts of 1969. The first and more serious offense is driving while intoxicated, which is the offense charged in the present case. The second and less serious offense is driving while under the influence of alcohol,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and is punishable by a fine of not more than $500 or not more than two months imprisonment or both for the first offense. \u00a7 21-902(b) of the Transportation Article. One charged with such lesser offense cannot receive a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>sentence of more than two months imprisonment. Consequently, in our view, the constitutional right to a jury trial would not attach. Accordingly, if the prosecution did not wish to seek the stronger penalties and desired the case to be tried in the District Court, the State could simply charge the defendant, as a first offender, with the lesser offense of driving while under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b447-11\">.
