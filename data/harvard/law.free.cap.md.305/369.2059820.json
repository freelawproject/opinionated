Ode H. Hines, appellant, was an employee of Potomac Electric Power Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>(PEPCO) and was injured in an automobile accident with an uninsured motorist<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the District of Columbia. At the time of the accident, Hines was driving a vehicle provided to him by PEPCO and owned by Prulease, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PEPCO. The vehicle was self-insured by PEPCO, as evidenced by a certificate of self-insurance issued by the Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA). The certificate of self-insurance provided for, <em>inter alia, </em>PIP and UM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">At the time of the accident, Hines maintained a policy of automobile insurance with Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO). The policy provided for PIP benefits up to $7,500 and UM benefits up to $20,000 per person or $40,000 per accident. Hines made a claim with PEPCO, Prulease and GEICO for payment of both PIP and UM benefits from each. His claims were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">By virtue of his employment in the District of Columbia, Hines also made claim for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. He recovered approximately $35,000 in such benefits. However, feeling aggrieved by the denial of PIP and UM benefits, Hines filed suit in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County for a declaratory judgment as to his entitlement to PIP and UM benefits from PEPCO, Prulease and GEICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The Circuit Court declared that PEPCO, Prulease and GEICO had no obligation to pay PIP or UM benefits to Hines because Hines\u2019s recovery of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits exceeded the maximum coverage provided by PEP-CO, Prulease and GEICO. Hines appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. Prior to consideration by the intermediate appellate court, we issued a writ of certiorari on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Initially, Hines contends that the trial court erred in ruling that PEPCO\u2019s<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> obligation as a self-insurer is limited to the minimum UM coverage required by Maryland Code (1957, 1979 Repl.Vol.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c). Before determining the extent of PEPCO\u2019s obligation as a self-insurer, it is necessary to review a number of statutes. Maryland Code (1984), \u00a7 17-104(a) of the Transportation Article provides that MVA may not \u201cissue or transfer the registration of a motor vehicle unless the owner or prospective owner furnishes evidence satisfactory to [MVA] that the required security is in effect.\u201d \u201cRequired security\u201d is defined as \u201csecurity in the form and providing for the minimum benefits required under this subtitle____\u201d Maryland Code (1984), \u00a7 17-101 of the Transportation Article. Section 17-103(a)(2) of the Transportation Article provides that the required security may be either a vehicle liability insurance policy or another form of security, as long as MVA finds that the security adequately provides the benefits required by subsection (b). MVA recognizes a certificate of self-insurance as a permissible form of security, as long as the self-insurer provides the same benefits available under a required motor vehicle liability policy. Md.Admin. Code tit. 11, \u00a7 18.02.01A (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Section 17-103(b)(l)-(4) of the Transportation Article establishes the required minimum benefits for a motor vehicle liability policy and for all other forms of security. Section 17-103(b)(3) states that \u201cthe security required under this subtitle shall provide for at least the benefits required under Article 48A, \u00a7 539 of the Code as to basic required primary coverage.\u201d These benefits are commonly referred to as PIP benefits. Section 539 requires each motor vehicle liability policy to provide for PIP benefits of up to $2,500. Section 17-103(b)(4) states that \u201cthe security required under this subtitle shall provide for at least the benefits required under Article 48A, \u00a7 541 of the Code as to required addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>tional coverage.\u201d Section 541 provides that \u201c[i]n no case shall the uninsured motorist coverage be less than the coverage afforded a qualified person under Article 48A, \u00a7\u00a7 243H and 243-1.\u201d Section 243-1 sets forth the required coverage as $20,000 for injury or death of any one person per accident, $40,000 for injury or death of two or more persons per accident, and $10,000 for property damage in any one accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Because PEPCO is self-insured, Hines argues that PEP-CO\u2019s potential liability for PIP and UM claims is not limited to the minimum coverages required by \u00a7\u00a7 539 and 541. In support of his argument, Hines points to the phrases \u201cat least\u201d and \u201cno less than\u201d in the statutes that establish the minimum required benefits. Based on this language, Hines asserts that the amount of uninsured motorist coverage and personal injury protection that a self-insured employer is required to provide is not limited to the minimum required coverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">In <em>Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mut. v. Gartelman, </em>288 Md. 151, 416 A.2d 734 (1980), Judge Davidson noted for the Court a fundamental rule of statutory construction: \u201cWhere statutory language is plain and unambiguous and expresses a definite meaning consonant with the statute\u2019s purpose, courts must not insert or delete words to make a statute express an intention different from its clear meaning.\u201d 288 Md. at 159, 416 A.2d at 737 (citing <em>Dep\u2019t of St. Planning v. Hagerstown, </em>288 Md. 9, 15, 415 A.2d 296, 299 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">We think that the statutory language in question is plain and unambiguous in <em>requiring </em>an insurer, whether a private insurance carrier or a self-insurer, to provide only the minimum benefits as set forth in the statutes. Clearly, insurers are free to provide <em>more </em>than the minimum benefits, but only the statutory amounts, and these amounts alone, are mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Hines also contends that it is inconsistent to maintain that a self-insurer cannot limit its liability to a third party injured by one of its employees while in the course of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>employment, but can limit its liability to an employee who is injured in the course of his employment by an uninsured motorist. This argument ignores the basic purpose behind the statutory requirement of uninsured motorist coverage. Judge Eldridge, speaking for the Court in <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. v. Webb, </em>291 Md. 721, 436 A.2d 465 (1981) articulated the policy behind the requirement of UM coverage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-4\">The courts have repeatedly stated that the purpose of uninsured motorist statutes is \u201cthat each insured under such coverage have available the full statutory minimum to exactly the same extent as would have been available had the tortfeasor complied with the minimum requirements of the financial responsibility law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 737, 436 A.2d at 474 (quoting <em>Webb v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., </em>479 S.W.2d 148, 152 (Mo.App. 1972). Thus, the purpose of mandating UM coverage is to provide some measure of compensation to the innocent victims of financially irresponsible uninsured motorists. <em>See Rafferty v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>303 Md. 63, 70, 492 A.2d 290, 294 (1985). The adoption of Hines\u2019s position would lead to an anomalous result: \u201c[it] would give a victim of an uninsured motorist greater insurance protection than would be available if he had been injured by an insured motorist having only the minimum required liability insurance.\u201d <em>Rafferty v. Allstate Insurance Co., supra, </em>303 Md. at 70, 492 A.2d at 294 (quoting <em>Yarmuth v. Government Employees Insurance Co., </em>286 Md. 256, 265, 407 A.2d 315, 319 (1979)). Indeed, the practical effect of requiring a self-insurer to maintain unlimited UM coverage would be to place the self-insurer in the shoes of the tortfeasor, the uninsured motorist, with respect to liability for the total amount of the claimant\u2019s damages. This we refuse to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">With regard to the insurance requirements applicable to a self-insurer, MVA regulations provide that \u201cthe administration (MVA) in its discretion, may, upon the application of the person, issue a certificate of self-insurance when it is satisfied that the person is able and will continue to be able <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>to pay the <em>same benefits </em>available under a required motor vehicle insurance policy.\u201d Md.Admin.Code tit. 11, \u00a7 .18.02.-02 (1985) (emphasis supplied). Thus the certificate of self-insurance is evidence that the self-insurer is able to meet the minimum requirements of the mandatory insurance law. Item No. 5 of PEPCO\u2019s application for self-insurance reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-4\">5. Indicate coverage you wish to self-insure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-5\">(X) Bodily Injury</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">(X) Economic Loss</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">(X) Property Damage</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">(X) Uninsured Motorist Coverage</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-9\">(Note: Mandatory minimum limits are $20/$40/$10, uninsured motorist coverage in like amounts and $2,500 economic loss (PIP)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-12\">As evidenced by the marks in the parentheses and the note below the marks, the face of the application clearly indicates PEPCO\u2019s obligation to provide PIP benefits in the amount of $2,500 and UM benefits in the amount of $20,000 for a single individual. With regard to PIP and UM coverage, we see no reason to distinguish a certificate of self-insurance from a motor vehicle liability insurance policy. Indeed, by making the minimum amounts of required coverage applicable to motor vehicle liability policies as well as to all other forms of security, we think the legislature demonstrated a clear intent to treat all forms of insurance equally. Maryland Code (1984), \u00a7 17-103(a) of the Transportation Article. <em>See City of Baltimore v. Rose, </em>47 Md.App. 481, 485, 424 A.2d 160, 162 (1981); <em>Modesta v. S. Eastern Pa. Transp. Auth., </em>503 Pa. 437, 445, 462 A.2d 1019, 1024 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-13\">We find nothing in the Transportation Article or in Article 48A that requires a self-insurer to provide more than the statutory minimum amounts of required coverage as set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 539 and 541. Therefore, we hold that the obligation of a self-insurer with regard to required PIP and UM coverage is limited to the minimum required amounts, unless the self-insurer in the self-insurance application ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>pressly obligates himself to provide more than the minimum amounts of PIP and UM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">We turn next to determine what effect, if any, Hines\u2019s recovery of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits had on his right to recover PIP or UM benefits. Section 543(d) of Article 48A provides that \u201c[bjenefits payable under the coverages required in \u00a7\u00a7 539 and 541 of this article shall be reduced to the extent that the recipient has recovered benefits under workmen\u2019s compensation laws of any state or the federal government.\u201d As we discussed above, \u00a7\u00a7 539 and 541 require that every motor vehicle liability policy issued, sold or delivered in Maryland contain PIP and UM coverage, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">We answered part of this question in <em>Smelser v. Criterion Ins. Co., </em>293 Md. 384, 444 A.2d 1024 (1982). In that case Willie Leon Smelser, a mechanic, was struck by a customer\u2019s vehicle in the course of his employment. Smelser sought and recovered workmen\u2019s compensation benefits in excess of the benefits payable under the vehicle\u2019s PIP coverage. Speaking for the Court, Judge Smith held that the plain meaning of Article 48A, \u00a7 543(d) required PIP benefits to be reduced to the extent the recipient has recovered workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. <em>See State Farm Mut. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>283 Md. 663, 392 A.2d 1114 (1977). Because Smelser had received workmen\u2019s compensation benefits in excess of the limit of PIP coverage, he was entitled to nothing from the PIP carrier. In <em>Smelser, </em>Judge Smith observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">The purpose of the act is to put a limited amount of money in the hands of an injured individual under certain circumstances without regard to whether another person is liable for the injuries which the claimant sustained. Where a person is injured while covered under the Workmen's Compensation Act, this purpose has already been achieved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">293 Md. at 393, 444 A.2d at 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">In the instant case, Hines recovered workmen\u2019s compensation benefits of over $35,000, an amount far exceeding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>$2,500 in PIP coverage that PEPCO was required to provide under \u00a7 539. As to Hines\u2019s claim for PIP benefits, we find that <em>Smelser </em>is controlling where the claimant has recovered workmen\u2019s compensation benefits in an amount in excess of the limit of PIP coverage. Additionally, we believe that <em>Smelser\u2019s </em>reading of \u00a7 543(d), based upon the plain language of the statute, is no less applicable to benefits payable under the UM coverage required by \u00a7 541. The statute clearly provides that \u201c[b]enefits payable under the coverage required in \u00a7\u00a7 539 <em>and 541 </em>of this article shall be reduced to the extent that the recipient has recovered benefits under workmen\u2019s compensation laws____\u201d Art. 48A, \u00a7 543(d) (emphasis supplied). With respect to <em>both </em>PIP and UM coverage, \u00a7 543(d) demonstrates a clear and unambiguous legislative intent to require the reduction of <em>both </em>categories of benefits by the amount of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits already recovered. In the instant case, the benefits payable under PEPCO\u2019s PIP and UM coverage, $2,500 and $20,000, respectively, are reduced by the amount of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits already recovered by Hines, approximately $35,000. Because the workmen\u2019s compensation benefits recovered exceed the total of PIP and UM coverage, PEPCO, under \u00a7 543(d), has no obligation to Hines.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Hines further contends that his workmen\u2019s compensation recovery failed to compensate him for certain elements of his damages, such as pain and suffering, and that this failure entitles him to UM benefits from PEPCO. The short answer to this contention is that \u00a7 543(d) draws no distinction between damages that have been compensated for and damages that have not been compensated for. As we stated in <em>Smelser </em>with regard to wage losses that had not been compensated for, \u201c[this] proposed interpretation would contravene the established principle of statutory construction that a court may not insert or omit words to make a statute express an intention not evidenced in its original form.\u201d <em>Smelser, supra, </em>293 Md. at 393, 444 A.2d at 1029 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>With regard to GEICO\u2019s obligation to Hines, we believe that \u00a7 543(d) is controlling. Nonetheless, based upon a single provision in the GEICO policy, Hines contends that GEICO failed to construct a ceiling on its obligation to pay UM benefits to Hines. Thus GEICO is liable, Hines asserts, for the full amount of his damages, less the amount recovered in the form of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. This contention is clearly without merit. As Chief Judge Murphy observed for the Court in <em>Aragona v. St. Paul Fire and Mar. Ins., </em>281 Md. 371, 378 A.2d 1346 (1977), \u201cInsurance contracts, like other contracts, must be read as a single document and construed as a whole to ascertain what the parties really meant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375, 378 A.2d at 1348 (citations omitted). Hines relies upon a provision in the GEICO policy that declares: \u201cWe will pay damages for bodily injury and property damage caused by accident which the insured is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle____\u201d On the very same page of the contract, however, another provision states, \u201cThe limit of liability for uninsured motorist coverage stated in the declarations as applicable to \u2018each person\u2019 is the limit of our liability for all damages ... due to bodily injury sustained by one person as the result of one accident.\u201d The last page of the policy, entitled \u201cFamily Automobile Policy New Business Declarations,\u201d limits the UM coverage applicable to \u201ceach person\u201d to $20,000. Therefore, reading the policy\u2019s provisions and declarations together, we believe that UM coverage under the GEICO policy is limited to $20,000 per person. Adding the total amount of PIP coverage, $7,500, to the $20,000 in UM coverage, the maximum amount of benefits payable by GEICO to Hines is $27,500. As discussed above with regard to PEPCO, the language of \u00a7 543(d) is clear and unambiguous in requiring the reduction of PIP and UM benefits to the extent that the recipient has recovered workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. Because Hines\u2019s recovery of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits in the amount of $35,000 exceeds the maximum amount of benefits payable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>by GEICO to Hines, we hold that GEICO has no obligation to Hines.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that neither PEPCO nor GEICO has any obligation to Hines because the amount of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits recovered by Hines exceeds the maximum PIP and UM coverage provided by PEPCO and GEICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b459-7\">. Although the trial court did not specifically find as a fact that the vehicle that collided with Hines\u2019s vehicle was uninsured, the trial court did proceed, in its order declaring rights of parties, to declare the rights of the parties upon the basis that the vehicle in question was uninsured.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b460-6\">.
