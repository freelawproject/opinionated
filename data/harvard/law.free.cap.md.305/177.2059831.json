We shall hold to the contrary. Hence, we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Beatrice Mudge was robbed by two black males at approximately 7:15 a.m. on April 14,1983, while enroute to her employment at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. She immediately reported the incident to security at the hospital who called the Baltimore City Police. At approximately 8:30 a.m. she advised the police that the individual who held the gun on her was a black male, approximately 5 feet 7 inches tall, 15 to' 16 years of age, weighing 110-125 pounds, wearing a dark jacket, and carrying a silver handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">Miss Mudge was later interviewed by yet another police officer, unacquainted with the description given by her earlier, who asked her to look through two books containing a total of approximately 600 photographs. She was unable to identify any of those photographs as being' of her assailant. Thereupon the police officer showed her three additional photographs. At about 10:45 a.m. she identified a picture of Larry Andre Branch as the individual who held the gun on her.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This photograph had on it no indication of height and weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Branch at the time in question was 19 years of age, 6 feet 3 inches tall, and weighed 185 pounds. Miss Mudge is approximately 5 feet 6 inches in height. Branch is said to have two missing front teeth. Miss Mudge did not note such a feature. The photograph which she selected does not show missing front teeth.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">At trial Miss Mudge testified that there was no question in her mind when she saw Branch\u2019s photograph that he was the individual that had robbed her and that this was the same individual she saw as the defendant in the trial court. She said her assailant was taller than she, that they \u201cwere on a slant, too.\u201d In court she was asked on cross-examination if she remembered saying that her assailant weighed 110 to 125 pounds and was 15 to 16 years of age. The record then is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">\u201cA Well, wait\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">\u201cQ Go on. Finish. Excuse me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\"><em>\u201cA </em>When somebody asked me how much did he weigh I said oh, God, are you asking me that?

And, so you basically know the difference between someone who is five foot seven and someone who is six foot three or four, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">\u201cA Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-9\">\u201cMR.

Could you just turn towards her, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-16\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: That\u2019s him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-17\">\u201cBY MR. PURPURA:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-18\">\u201cQ Now, Miss Mudge, when you turned and you said that\u2019s the man in the Courtroom you pointed right to Mr. Branch, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-19\">\u201cA Uh-huh. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-20\">\u201cQ And, you were sure you didn\u2019t point to anybody else, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-21\">\u201cA No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-22\">\u201cQ As a matter of fact, you didn\u2019t look around the Courtroom to see if anyone else could possibly be the person, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>\u201cA Well, I looked at him when I came in. I sat down here. I mean, he was here all day. I\u2019ve seen him. I mean, looking at him \u2014 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">The above demonstration was immediately followed up on redirect examination:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">\u201cQ Having just stood very close to the Defendant in this case is his height consistent with the person that robbed you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">\u201cA You\u2019re asking me\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">\u201cQ Is his height consistent with the person that robbed you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\"><em>\u201cA </em>Yes. Yeah. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-10\">\u201cQ Now, it doesn\u2019t surprise you that he\u2019s tall or anything like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-11\">\u201cA No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">Branch claimed to have an alibi which was corroborated by his girlfriend, his aunt, and a ticket from a pawn shop for the day in question for a television set which he claimed to have pawned for his aunt at her request.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">Branch appealed his conviction to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court affirmed in an unreported opinion (No. 351, September Term, 1984, decided Dec. 4, 1984). We granted a writ of certiorari to address the issue framed in the petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-14\">\u201cWhether the Court of Special Appeals erred in affirming a blatant case of misidentification in that the victim had described the robber as being 5'7\", 110-125 pounds, 15-16 years old, with no unusual facial features \u2014 when the evidence revealed that Petitioner, convicted of this crime, was 6'3\" tall, 185 pounds, 21 years old, with missing front teeth.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-15\">We point out that <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), and its holding that an accused \u201cis entitled to habeas corpus relief if it is found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>that upon the record evidence adduced at the trial no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d 443 U.S. at 324, 99 S.Ct. at 2791-92, in no way changed the standard in effect in Maryland. In <em>Williams and McClelland v. State, 5 </em>Md.App. 450, 247 A.2d 731 (1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>252 Md. 731, 734 (1969), Judge Orth carefully reviewed for the Court of Special Appeals a number of the prior cases of this Court such as <em>Gibson v. State, </em>238 Md. 414, 209 A.2d 242 (1965); <em>Shelton v. State, </em>198 Md. 405, 84 A.2d 76 (1951); <em>Edwards v. State, </em>198 Md. 132, 81 A.2d 631, 83 A.2d 578 (1951); and <em>Lambert v. State, </em>196 Md. 57, 75 A.2d 327 (1950). All of those cases arose subsequent to the constitutional amendment now embodied in Maryland Declaration of Rights, Art. 23 which provides that a trial court \u201cmay pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction,\u201d and, hence, that this was open to appellate review. Judge Orth then said for the Court of Special Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">\u201cOnce the question of the sufficiency of the evidence is properly before us, we believe that the criteria used to determine the question is the same, be the verdict rendered by the court or a jury. Whether the test applicable to jury cases is stated in the affirmative \u2014 the judgment will be affirmed if there is any relevant evidence before the jury to sustain a conviction \u2014 or in the negative \u2014 to overturn a judgment there must be no legally sufficient evidence on which the defendant could be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 it is inherent that to be sufficient in law to justify the conviction within the intent of [Maryland Code (1957, 1967 Repl.Vol., 1967 Cum. Supp.) ] Art. 27, \u00a7 593 the admissible evidence adduced must show directly or <em>support a rational inference of the facts to be proved, </em>from which the jury could fairly be convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offense charged.\u201d 5 Md.App. at 458-59, 247 A.2d at 737 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Applying this standard under <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560, Chief Judge Murphy said for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Court in <em>State v. Rusk, </em>289 Md. 230, 240, 424 A.2d 720, 725 (1981), \u201c[T]he applicable standard is \u2018whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 443 U.S. at 319 [99 S.Ct. at 2789] (emphasis in original).\u201d <em>Accord Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 717, 415 A.2d 830, 842 (1980).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">This Court said in <em>Walters v. State, </em>242 Md. 235, 218 A.2d 678 (1966):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">\u201cIdentification by the victim is ample evidence to sustain a conviction. <em>Davis v. Warden, </em>235 Md. 637, 201 A.2d 672 (1964); <em>Rakes v. State, </em>227 Md. 172, 175 A.2d 579 (1961) and cases cited therein. The testimony of a victim, unlike that of an accomplice, needs no corroboration. <em>Gregoire v. State, </em>211 Md. 514, 128 A.2d 243 (1957); <em>Basoff v. State, </em>208 Md. 643, 119 A.2d 917 (1956). The testimony of Mrs. Mollinary was legally sufficient to convict.\u201d 242 Md. at 237-38, 218 A.2d at 680.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">For a more recent application of the rule see <em>Mobley and King v. State, </em>270 Md. 76, 89, 310 A.2d 803, 811 (1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 975, 94 S.Ct. 2003, 40 L.Ed.2d 564 (1974); <em>Kirby v. State, </em>48 Md.App. 205, 211, 426 A.2d 423, 427, <em>cert. denied, </em>291 Md. 777 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">No useful purpose would be served by reviewing the numerous cases dealing with identification cited by both sides. In the final analysis the responsibility is ours to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to permit a rational trier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt there was sufficient evidence to establish the essential elements of the crime and that Branch was the criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>agent. The issue of credibility, of course, is one for the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Admittedly we have here a substantial discrepancy between the description given by the victim of the crime almost immediately after the incident and the actual description of the accused. We view this as going to the weight and not to the sufficiency of the evidence. It was while the facts were still fresh in the victim\u2019s mind, approximately three and a half hours after the incident, that she selected a picture of the accused as being of her assailant. In the courtroom she positively identified the accused as being the perpetrator of the robbery. We hold that this was enough for a rational trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Branch was the culprit.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-11\">.

Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b272-7\">ELDRIDGE, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Avb\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">The Court today relentlessly applies the rule that testimony of a single eyewitness identifying the accused as the perpetrator of the crime is sufficient evidence to permit a rational judge or jury to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In light of the circumstances of this case, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">On April 14, 1983, at approximately 7:00 a.m., Beatrice Mudge was robbed by two black males while on her way to work in Baltimore. One of the assailants pointed a gun at Mudge, told her not to move, and grabbed her purse. The two then fled. The entire incident lasted approximately five minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">Later on the day of the incident, Mudge described the gunman to police as approximately 15 to 16 years old, 5'7\" tall, between 110 and 125 pounds, wearing a dark jacket, and carrying a silver handgun. According to Mudge, he was also wearing a stocking on his head which covered his ears but not his face. Mudge mentioned no distinctive facial features. Mudge could give no description of the other assailant. She was shown several books containing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>about 500 photographs but did not select any. A police officer then took three photographs from his pocket and showed them to Mudge. She picked one of the three as a photograph of the gunman. The police investigation ceased once this photo identification was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Solely on the basis of the photo identification, Larry Andre Branch was arrested and charged with robbery with a deadly weapon and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. Mr. Branch was 19 years old, 6'3\" tall, and weighed 185 pounds. On January 30, 1984, at the jury trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, the State presented two witnesses, Mudge and one police officer. Mudge testified to the events of April 14, 1983, and identified Branch in court as the one carrying the gun on that day. On cross-examination, she acknowledged the details of the original description which she had given to police and stated her own height as 5'6\". The second state witness testified only to the circumstances of the photo identification which Mudge had made. The prosecution produced no other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">For the defense, Sharon Vincent, a woman with whom the defendant was living at the time of the crime, testified that she was in bed with the defendant until 10:00 a.m. on the morning of the crime. In response to questioning as to Branch\u2019s physical characteristics, Vincent stated that he was 6'3\" or 6'4\" tall, and had been missing two front teeth since November 1982. The defendant\u2019s aunt, Pauline Wright, testified that at approximately 10:00 a.m. she arrived at the house where the defendant was living and found him in his night clothing in the room he shared with Sharon Vincent. Wright testified that she needed Branch\u2019s help that morning to carry a television set to a pawn shop. She stated that, after dressing, Branch helped her take the set to the shop. The defense introduced the pawn ticket, dated April 14, 1983, into evidence. The defendant recounted the same story as his alibi witnesses and denied participating in the robbery. He also described himself as 6'3\" tall, 185 pounds, and 19 years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>On the sole basis of Mudge\u2019s identification, the jury convicted Branch of both charges. Branch appealed to the Court of Special Appeals which affirmed the convictions in an unreported opinion. The appellate court, although recognizing \u201c[t]hat an eminently reasonable jury could have harbored serious doubts as to [Branch\u2019s] guilt,\u201d applied the rule that \u201cthe positive identification of a single eyewitness, if believed by the trier of fact, is ample evidence to sustain a conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">In light of the testimony presented, it is difficult to conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Branch perpetrated the crime described here. The evidence simply falls short of that required to support a conviction under the constitutional standard set forth in <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). There the Supreme Court held that an accused \u201cis entitled to ... relief if it is found that upon the record evidence adduced at the trial no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 443 U.S. at 324, 99 S.Ct. at 2791-92. The same standard has been applied in Maryland courts since 1950. <em>See Bedford v. State, </em>293 Md. 172, 174-176, 443 A.2d 78 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">In examining the testimony in particular cases to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to support a verdict, this Court has often been suspicious of certain inherently unreliable forms of testimony. Thus a verdict founded on testimony that is \u201ctoo inconclusive, contradictory, and uncertain to be the basis of a legal conclusion,\u201d requires reversal. <em>Slacum v. Jolley, </em>153 Md. 343, 351, 138 A. 244 (1927). In <em>Slacum, </em>the Court reversed a judgment for the plaintiff and ordered judgment for the defendant because, <em>inter alia, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s medical expert\u2019s testimony as to the cause of death was contradictory.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">In a case concerning the highway collision of the Governor\u2019s motorcade with a bakery truck, the Court observed: \u201cThese accidents generally occur so quickly that the recol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>lection of what happens, even to the participants, is not always accurate, and the evidence often unreliable.\u201d <em>Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. v. Baking Co., </em>172 Md. 24, 28, 190 A. 768 (1937). The Court rejected the plaintiffs contradictory evidence that the motorcade had a green light, <em>id. </em>at 33, 190 A. 768, and affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment that there was insufficient evidence against the defendant Baking Company. In <em>Oberfeld v. Eilers, </em>171 Md. 332, 189 A. 203 (1937), another collision case, the Court reversed a judgment for the plaintiff. The case hinged on which truck crossed the center line of the road. The Court rejected the plaintiff\u2019s testimony as too uncertain, because his distance estimates were inconsistent with the width of his truck and the width of the pavement. 171 Md. at 336-337, 189 A. 203. <em>See also, Kaufman v. Balto. Transit Co., </em>197 Md. 141, 78 A.2d 464 (1951); <em>Eisenhower v. Balto. Transit Co., </em>190 Md. 528, 59 A.2d 313 (1948). In <em>Butler v. Reed-Avery Co., </em>186 Md. 686, 693, 48 A.2d 436 (1946), the Court affirmed a directed verdict for the defendant because the plaintiff\u2019s testimony was \u201ctoo confused, indistinct, uncertain and contradictory\u201d to prove that he suffered burns by falling into defendant\u2019s chemical effluent.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The above-cited opinions show that, in civil cases at least, this Court has generally been willing to take notice of the inherent unreliability of certain forms of eyewitness testimony, and to conclude in some cases that a verdict cannot be based on such testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For example, the Court recognized that the speed, surprise and shock of an auto accident may leave the people involved unable to recall the state of traffic signals or precisely to describe the position of vehicles. <em>Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. v. Baking Co., supra, </em>172 Md. at 28, 190 A. 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>The same phenomena attend a fleeting street robbery. There is no reason to assume that the victim of a mugging can always reliably identify the assailant. In fact, the inherent unreliability of eyewitness testimony has been well documented.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The Supreme Court noted in <em>United States v. Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218, 228, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 1933, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149 (1967), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">\u201c[t]he vagaries of eyewitness identification are well-known; the annals of criminal law are rife with instances of mistaken identification. Mr. Justice Frankfurter once said: \u2018What is the worth of identification testimony even when uncontradicted? The identification of strangers is proverbially untrustworthy. The hazards of such testimony are established by a formidable number of instances in the records of English and American trials. These instances are recent \u2014 not due to the brutalities of ancient criminal procedure.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">In an analysis of the unreliability of eyewitness identification, Judge Bazelon, dissenting in <em>United States v. Butler, </em>636 F.2d 727, 732 (D.C.Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 1019, 101 S.Ct. 3010, 69 L.Ed.2d 392 (1981), commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5L\">\u201cThere is now a wealth of literature demonstrating the tendency of [eyewitness testimony] to be inaccurate____ [M]any experts have concluded that convictions based solely on \u2018one eyewitness\u2019 identifications represent \u2018con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>ceivably the greatest single threat to the achievement of our ideal that no innocent man shall be punished.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOI\">Generally in cases where this Court has sustained convictions involving single eyewitness identification testimony, there have been other indicia of the reliability of the testimony and the resulting conviction. In <em>Mobley and King v. State, </em>270 Md. 76, 89, 310 A.2d 803, 811 (1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 975, 94 S.Ct. 2003, 40 L.Ed.2d 564 (1974), the Court rejected King\u2019s contention that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for armed robbery, citing the single eyewitness rule. There, however, the reliability of the identification was enhanced by the fact that the police apprehended King minutes after the crime with cash and a weapon, and with clothes and a car described by the eyewitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">In <em>Wilkins v. State, </em>239 Md. 692, 211 A.2d 308 (1965), the witness knew the man he identified; in addition, the man who was identified admitted to being at the scene of the robbery at the time it occurred and to eluding arrest for three days thereafter. In <em>Tucker v. State, </em>237 Md. 422, 206 A.2d 691 (1965), and <em>Davis v. Warden, </em>235 Md. 637, 201 A.2d 672 (1964), there were two eyewitnesses whose testimony dovetailed. <em>See also Bedford v. State, supra. </em>In <em>Rakes v. State, </em>227 Md. 172, 175 A.2d 579 (1961), the eyewitness knew his assailants. <em>But cf. Walters v. State, </em>242 Md. 235, 218 A.2d 678 (1966); <em>Coates v. State, </em>232 Md. 72, 191 A.2d 579 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Several cases, dealing with situations involving substantial discrepancies between the description furnished by an eyewitness to police and the actual appearance of the person convicted on the basis of that eyewitness\u2019s testimony, have reversed the convictions in part because of those discrepancies. <em>See, e.g., People v. Martin, 2 </em>Cal.3d 822, 87 Cal.Rptr. 709, 471 P.2d 29 (1970); <em>Crawley v. United States, </em>320 A.2d 309 (D.C.App.1974); <em>People v. Ash, </em>102 Ill.2d 485, 82 Ill.Dec. 373, 468 N.E.2d 1153 (1984); <em>State v. Gluff </em>285 Minn. 148, 172 N.W.2d 63 (1969). <em>See also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number><em>Jackson v. Fogg, </em>589 F.2d 108 (2d Cir.1978); <em>United States v. Russell, </em>532 F.2d 1063 (6th Cir.1976); <em>Clemons v. United States, </em>408 F.2d 1230, 1242 (D.C.Cir.1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>394 U.S. 964, 89 S.Ct. 1318, 22 L.Ed.2d 567 (1969); <em>United States v. Levi, </em>405 F.2d 380 (4th Cir.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">In a case such as this, where the sole evidence was the victim\u2019s identification testimony, where that testimony followed an extremely suggestive photo identification procedure, where the testimony was uncorroborated, where the victim\u2019s opportunity to observe and remember the appearance of her assailant was brief and fraught with fear, where her \u201cdescription\u201d depicted an individual six inches shorter, sixty pounds lighter, several years younger and omitted the telling detail of missing front teeth, and where the defendant\u2019s witnesses and documentary evidence corroborated his alibi, I would hold the single eyewitness identification testimony insufficient to convict.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Judge COLE has authorized me to state that he concurs with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-6\">. In a criminal case, <em>Kucharczyk v. State, </em>235 Md. 334, 201 A.2d 683 (1964), this Court held that the contradictory testimony of a mentally deficient sixteen year old was insufficient to establish the facts required for a sodomy conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b276-10\">. <em>See generally </em>E.
