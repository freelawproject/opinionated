State </em>(Unreported, No. 1040, September Term, 1984, decided April 19, 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">Crowder was convicted of burglary in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County and sentenced to a term of twenty-five years imprisonment without the possibility of parole. In affirming that judgment the Court of Special Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-12\">\u201cThe record shows that appellant had appeared in court on May 16, 1983, and June 30, 1983. On both occasions his request for a postponement was in order that he might obtain counsel. He was also advised of his right to be represented by the office of the public defender. Nevertheless, he appeared for trial on September 26, 1983, and insisted that Morris Kaplan was going to repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>sent him. Kaplan represented the then co-defendant, Taylor, and could not represent appellant. The court (DeWaters, J.) determined that there was a conflict of interest on Kaplan\u2019s part and that Kaplan could not represent appellant. Judge DeWaters noted that appellant had on several prior occasions been advised to obtain an attorney, but had failed to do so. The court then deemed that he had waived his right to counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">\u201cAn accused is afforded an opportunity to employ counsel of his own choosing, <em>English v. State, </em>8 Md.App. 330 [259 A.2d 822] (1969), or if he is indigent, to have an attorney appointed to represent him. Notwithstanding that right, an accused, through the use of postponements, cannot be allowed to manipulate the system in order to preclude the orderly administration of justice. Although Crowder asserts that he was forced to go to trial without an attorney, we think that by his own conduct he waived his right to counsel. <em>Brown v. State, </em>50 Md.App. 651 [441 A.2d 354] (1982). He will not be permitted to manipulate the judicial system so as to delay the trial and then claim a denial of counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">We granted Crowder\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari in order that we might address the important public issue here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">The Court of Special Appeals recognized in <em>Brown v. State, </em>50 Md.App. 651, 441 A.2d 354 (1982), that one might by his conduct waive the right to counsel. In <em>Howell v. State, </em>293 Md. 232, 241, 443 A.2d 103, 107 (1982), we said, \u201cUnder certain circumstances, the assertion of the right to counsel, if part of a strategy for delay, may be conduct that constitutes a waiver.\u201d (Citing cases.) <em>See also, Leonard v. State, </em>302 Md. 111, 126, 486 A.2d 163, 170 (1985). The doctrine has been recognized in a number of cases. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Weninger, </em>624 F.2d 163, 167 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1012, 101 S.Ct. 568, 66 L.Ed.2d 470 (1980); <em>United States v.

State, </em>75 Wis.2d 502, 509, 249 N.W.2d 773, 777 (1977). In <em>Arlen </em>the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-7\">\u201c[WJhere a defendant able to retain counsel has been advised by the court that he must retain counsel by a certain reasonable time, and where there is no showing why he has not retained counsel within that time, the court may treat his failure to provide for his own defense as a waiver of his right to counsel and require such defendant to proceed to trial without an attorney. Such a waiver is similar in its consequences to an election made by an indigent defendant.\u201d 252 F.2d at 494-95.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">No useful purpose would be served by a review of what has and has not been regarded by various courts as a waiver of the right of counsel by conduct because such cases are decided upon their own facts on a case by case basis. Hence, we turn to a review of the undisputed facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">A criminal information was filed against Crowder and two others on March 2, 1983. On March 21 he was brought before one of the judges of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County and advised of his rights under then Maryland Rules 723 and 731, pertaining to the right of counsel and pleas, respectively.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Notice of a trial date of May 16, 1983, was filed on April 6. Crowder appeared on May 16 with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>counsel whom he had paid. The attorney also represented Crowder\u2019s brother, a co-defendant. The judge concluded there was a conflict. Accordingly, at Crowder\u2019s request, a postponement was granted. Crowder waived his right to a speedy trial and his right under then Rule 746 pertaining to a trial date within 180 days.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge advised him to get counsel within fifteen days or to apply to the Public Defender\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">On May 18 notice of a trial date of June 30 was filed. On June 30, Crowder appeared before the administrative judge for the purpose of requesting a postponement. Morris Kaplan, Esq., who was present on behalf of then co-defendant Michael Taylor and requesting a postponement of his own, spoke on behalf of Crowder \u201cin the goodness of [his] heart____\u201d He proffered that Crowder, on the previous occasion that he had been before the court, had been</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK9\">\u201cadvised by Judge Raine, I believe, to the effect that his counsel \u2014 he had a lawyer, Mr. Cocoros at the time, that his lawyer could not represent a third co-defendant [i.e., Carl Crowder] and Mr. Crowder because it was a conflict of interest, and he had been assured by Mr. Cocoros that another lawyer would be obtained for him, and, as of this date, he has not heard from Mr. Cocoros.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">Crowder said further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8GQ\">\u201c[T]he Judge ruled that any money I had gave Mr. Cocoros, for him to give it back, but since he had represented me, all the money I had gave him, he used it as his fee for the previous arraignment, right, and, so, what happened is that he told me that he would get someone to represent me, and, well, when I came here, and, I don\u2019t know, I have called, and his secretary said that he was out but she didn\u2019t say \u2014 I assumed that he was coming here, that someone was coming here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">The Assistant State\u2019s Attorney agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-12\">\u201cIt is my understanding that Mr. Cocoros represented [appellant\u2019s] brother, and that\u2019s why it was postponed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>before. He had a conflict and couldn\u2019t represent both Carl Crowder and Brodie Crowder____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The administrative judge said that he \u201cwould have to give [Crowder] further opportunity to retain a lawyer under the circumstances if the case is to be tried on solid grounds, as far as his Constitutional right to have a lawyer is concerned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">The judge questioned Crowder with respect to whether he had funds to employ counsel. Crowder stated that he did. He was advised that if he did not he might possibly get the Public Defender to represent him. Crowder repeated that he was able to employ counsel. Kaplan interjected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-8\">\u201cFor the record, your Honor, ask him in the event that he was [sic] granted a postponement, to come to my office with Mr. Taylor because I have to discuss the case with both of them, and, at that time, I will recommend a lawyer to him, and I assure the Court that by that Saturday he will have a lawyer, and, furthermore, I will give the Court a firm date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">The administrative judge, at the request of the State, advised Crowder of his rights under then Rule 723. Crowder indicated that he was 33 years of age and had a year and a half of schooling at Essex Community College. He waived his rights under Rule 746 and also waived his right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">In response to a question from Kaplan, the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney indicated that Kaplan would have a conflict of interest if he were to represent Taylor and Crowder. Kaplan then said, \u201cThen I\u2019m out, okay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">Notice of a trial date of September 26 was filed on July 1. On August 30, Crowder appeared for rearraignment at the request of the State. He was advised of his rights under then Rules 723 and 731. He indicated that he had attempted to procure the services of Askew Gatewood, Esq., but had not secured his services at that time. The State handed him a card from the Public Defender\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>On September 26, 1983, Crowder appeared for trial. He was asked if he had a lawyer. He replied that he did, Morris Kaplan. Kaplan was summoned from a nearby courtroom. He was asked if he represented Crowder in this case. He replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">\u201cThat\u2019s not correct, Your Honor. I told him if I had been assured that there would not be a conflict then I would represent him. I have not received any money from him, and if I did then I would tell you I represent him. But if he gets a postponement, and that\u2019s up to Judge DeWaters, of course, because he is without counsel, and I would take a chance and enter my appearance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYg\">The Assistant State\u2019s Attorney indicated there would be a possible conflict if Kaplan represented Crowder. Kaplan said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">\u201cLet me say this, Your Honor. I don\u2019t think there is any conflict. The statements are exculpatory from what I gathered talking to him and talking to the police officers. If he gets a postponement I said I would take a chance and would enter my formal appearance and my word as you, Your Honor, \u2014.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Kaplan was involved in a jury trial in Baltimore City and thus unable to go to trial on that day. The matter was referred to the administrative judge (DeWaters, J.) to consider a request for postponement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-8\">Kaplan told the administrative judge:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-9\">\u201cMr. Crowder saw me yesterday and after discussing the matter with him, in my opinion, there was no conflict as between the two defendants. I spoke to the officers this morning, and they had taken a statement from each of the two defendants, but the statements were exculpatory. So, it would not be a matter of conflict, in my opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-10\">\u201cWell, now, I had not been retained by Mr. Crowder in the sense that I had received any monetary consideration, but if the Court is inclined to give a postponement \u2014 and I would like to say that this is a very serious case, your Honor \u2014 and even though he had been told to get a lawyer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>and has not done so, he has made efforts to do so. I think that, in the interest of justice, that he should have a lawyer. I will take a chance, and even though I have not received any money, in order to accommodate the Court because I have embarrassed the Court to a degree this morning, I will enter my appearance. If Mr. Crowder doesn\u2019t pay me, then, I\u2019m stuck. You have my word for it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-4\">The administrative judge stated to Crowder:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-5\">\u201cNow, Mr. Crowder, you understand that if this case doesn\u2019t go forward as to you today, that is it, as far as the lawyer is concerned. As a matter of fact, I wouldn\u2019t have any hesitancy in directing this case be tried as to you today without a lawyer, to be perfectly honest with you. I have no qualms about doing that, anyway, whatsoever. I think you\u2019ve had plenty of opportunity to hire a lawyer, but the only reason I am not going to do that is because it seems like, to me, that for the convenience of the State\u2019s witnesses and everybody else concerned, and the Court, the Court\u2019s time and the jurors and everything, that it behooves the Court to try to set a time when this case can be tried with the witnesses just coming in here and getting it over with once and for all. Mr. Kaplan said he is going to enter his appearance for you if the case is postponed today, and, that way both defendants can be tried at the same time with the State\u2019s witnesses here. If I have you tried today, then, obviously, the State\u2019s witnesses are going to have to come back for Mr. Taylor\u2019s case, so they don\u2019t really, gain anything by staying here and forcing you to trial today, and that\u2019s the only reason, believe me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">October 5 was agreed upon as a new trial date and Kaplan stated, \u201cI will enter my appearance.\u201d Crowder was again questioned as to whether he understood that he could not later complain that he had not been tried under the 180-day provision of then Rule 746. Crowder and Taylor were both questioned as to whether they desired a postponement. The record then is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>\u201cMR. KAPLAN: Now, Mr. Crowder, I have discussed with you that there is a matter of a possible conflict, you understand that, do you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-5\">\u201cMR. CROWDER: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-6\">\u201cMR. KAPLAN: And we went over it very thoroughly, and we went over it again this morning with the officers in which each officer stated that you had given a statement and Mr. Taylor had given a statement, and I used the word, \u2018exculpatory statements,\u2019 which, really, means that, in your statement you said you were not involved in the participation or in any way with the offense, do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-7\">\u201cMR. CROWDER: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-8\">\u201cMR. KAPLAN: So, I want you to know that I am entering my appearance but if you feel still there is a possible conflict, even though you and I have agreed that there is not, then, you are satisfied to go ahead with me, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-9\">\u201cMR. CROWDER: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-10\">\u201cMR. KAPLAN: How about Mr. Taylor, same with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-11\">\u201cMR. TAYLOR: Same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Crowder, I want to tell you the same thing, that you waived your rights under the hundred and eighty day rule on June 30th, 1983, and I want you to distinctly understand when you did that, you waived them for the future, and, so, that you can\u2019t come back at any time and have this case dismissed for noncompliance with the hundred and eighty day rule, and, especially, since you are the one getting the postponement here again today, do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-13\">\u201cMR. CROWDER: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-14\">\u201cMR. SMITH: Judge, I know you have heard enough, but there is a conflict. On January 13th, 1983, Brodie Crowder was interviewed in the lock up in this Court House by Detective Bruce McGrady (phonetic), and he stated orally that he was at the car with Carl and Taylor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>All three were drinking. He didn\u2019t want to get involved in the breaking and entering, so he left. If that doesn\u2019t pose a conflict between him and his co-defendant, I don\u2019t know what does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-4\">\u201cMR. KAPLAN: Well, then, he will have to get another lawyer, then, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: He won\u2019t, because the case is going to be tried on the 5th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">\u201cMR. KAPLAN: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: If the case is not tried on the 5th, if the case is asked to not be tried on the 5th because of the conflict, then I am telling you, gentlemen, what is going to happen is, Mr. Kaplan is going to represent one of you in front of one Judge, and the other one is going to go before another Judge and be tried without a lawyer, do you understand, because I will be sure that I have another Judge available in case the case splits, because I\u2019m not going to have any more of this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\">\u201cMR. KAPLAN: Your Honor, at this point, even though he denies such a statement, there is a Bruton conflict, and I would, certainly, have to tell Mr. Crowder that he is going to have to get his own lawyer; I could not, in all good conscience, represent Mr. Taylor and Mr. Crowder at the same time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, then, Mr. Crowder is going forward today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-10\">\u201cMR. KAPLAN: I will get him a lawyer, though.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: No, Crowder is going forward today. Who is he going to be tried by?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-12\">\u201cMR. SMITH: Judge Brizendine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: Judge Brizendine. All right. As I said on the record a minute ago, he has had plenty of time to get a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-14\">\u201cMR. CROWDER: Judge, is there any way possible that I can still try to get a lawyer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: You have had all the opportunity in the world to get a lawyer and you still don\u2019t have one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Crowder represented himself throughout the trial which lasted two days. He w\u00e1s found guilty of burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The State makes the point that on June 30 Kaplan was advised in Crowder\u2019s presence of a potential conflict and thus that Crowder should have known Kaplan was not available. It is apparent from the record, however, that up until the latter part of the hearing before the administrative judge on September 26 Kaplan perceived no conflict. Crowder, being untrained in the law, cannot be charged with knowledge of a conflict of interest not perceived by an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">We do not agree with the Court of Special Appeals that Crowder was \u201cmanipulating] the judicial system so as to delay the trial____\u201d He retained an attorney. A conflict of interest was found. His first attorney did not return any part of the fee he received. Crowder believed his first attorney was going to procure another one for him who would appear on June 30. At the June 30 hearing, Kaplan, who spoke on behalf of Crowder \u201cin the goodness of [his] heart,\u201d suggested that Crowder go to his office with his co-defendant, Taylor, and at that time Kaplan would recommend a lawyer to Crowder. Kaplan \u201cassure[d] the Court that by that Saturday he will have a lawyer, and, furthermore, I will give the Court a firm date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">It is apparent that on September 26 Crowder thought Kaplan represented him. He had talked with Kaplan the day before. At the hearing before the administrative judge Kaplan actually entered his appearance on behalf of Crowder before he bowed out when the State pinpointed the potential conflict of interest. Under all of the circumstances we cannot say that Crowder by his conduct waived his constitutional right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">JUDGMENT REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS FOR PASSAGE OF AN ORDER REVERSING THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AND RE<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>MANDING THE CASE TO THAT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL; BALTIMORE COUNTY TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-10\">.
