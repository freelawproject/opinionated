The alleged possession occurred in his home, but defendant had previously been convicted of a crime. He claims that under Penal Law \u00a7 265.03 (3) he is entitled, despite his prior conviction, to rely on the so-called \u201chome or business\u201d exception in the definition of second degree weapon possession. We reject that argument and hold that defendant\u2019s indictment for second degree possession was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Defendant was charged in two indictments with a variety of crimes, but only a single count is now before us. That count was based on evidence before the grand jury that a loaded gun was found in a bathroom; the bathroom, it is now conceded, was part of defendant\u2019s home. The indictment alleges simply that defendant committed criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree in violation of Penal Law \u00a7 265.03 (3) in that he \u201cpossessed a loaded firearm.\u201d With the indictment, the People filed a special information, alleging that defendant had previously been convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Supreme Court, concluding that possession of the weapon in defendant\u2019s home did not constitute second degree possession, reduced the charge to third degree possession. On the People\u2019s appeal, the Appellate Division reversed and reinstated the second degree charge <em>(People v Jones, </em>103 AD3d 411 [1st Dept 2013]). A Judge of this Court granted leave to appeal (21 NY3d 944 [2013]), and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">Before reaching the merits of the appeal, we must consider a jurisdictional issue. Defendant says that the People\u2019s appeal to the Appellate Division was untimely, and that therefore the Appellate Division could not consider it. He says that the appeal was not taken \u201cwithin [30] days after service upon [the People] of a copy\u201d of Supreme Court\u2019s order reducing the second degree count to third degree possession (CPL 460.10 [1] [a]).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">Defendant\u2019s theory is that the 30-day time to appeal began running when, according to defendant\u2019s brief, Supreme Court \u201cprovided copies\u201d of its order \u201cto the parties in open court.\u201d In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>fact, the record does not show that the court did any such thing. At the transcript page defendant cites, the court only says that there is \u201ca decision on file.\u201d But even if the factual premise of defendant\u2019s argument were correct, his argument would have no merit. We have interpreted CPL 460.10 (1) (a) \u201cto require prevailing party service\u201d\u2014not just the handing out of an order by the court\u2014\u201cto commence the time for filing a notice of appeal\u201d <em>(People v Washington, </em>86 NY2d 853, 854 [1995]). Here, it is undisputed that defendant, the prevailing party at Supreme Court, never served the order on the People.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">On the merits, this appeal requires us to interpret the \u201chome or business\u201d exception to the second degree weapon possession statute, Penal Law \u00a7 265.03 (3). Under that statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">\u201cA person is guilty of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree when: . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">\u201c(3) such person possesses any loaded firearm. Such possession shall not, except as provided in subdivision one ... of section 265.02 of this article, constitute a violation of this subdivision if such possession takes place in such person\u2019s home or place of business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">Section 265.02 (1), to which the above quoted language refers, defines criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree. Under Penal Law \u00a7 265.02 (1), a person is guilty of third degree criminal possession when he or she \u201ccommits the crime of criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree . . . and has been previously convicted of any crime.\u201d The Appellate Division read the reference in section 265.03 (3) to section 265.02 (1) as creating an exception to the home or business exception\u2014i.e., to make that exception inapplicable when the defendant has a previous criminal conviction. We agree with this reading of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">The language of the statute, fairly read, supports the Appellate Division\u2019s holding. The home or business exception is qualified by the words \u201cexcept as provided in subdivision one ... of section 265.02\u201d and section 265.02 (1) applies to a person who \u201chas been previously convicted of any crime.\u201d Thus such a person may not rely on the home or business exception in a prosecution under Penal Law \u00a7 265.03 (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-11\">Defendant would have us read the \u201cexcept as provided\u201d phrase of section 265.03 (3) not as excluding certain cases from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>the home or business exception, but as stating the fact that those cases are covered by the third degree statute, Penal Law \u00a7 265.02 (1). Thus defendant would paraphrase the statute as saying: \u201cpossession in the home or place of business is not second degree possession, but it is third degree possession, as Penal Law \u00a7 265.02 (1) says.\u201d This argument alters the plain meaning of the statutory words: it reads the word \u201cexcept\u201d out of Penal Law \u00a7 265.03 (3). The argument also makes the statute a strange one. Why should the law defining second degree possession include a remark about what the third degree statute says? It is not the normal function of a Penal Law section to provide information about what other sections contain.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Defendant argues that his reading of the statute is less strange when the history of Penal Law \u00a7 265.03 (3) is considered. Until 2006, possession of a loaded firearm outside of one\u2019s home or place of business was third degree possession only, and the predecessor statute to Penal Law \u00a7 265.03 (3) was a subdivision of Penal Law \u00a7 265.02 <em>(see </em>former Penal Law \u00a7 265.02 [4], as repealed by L 2006, ch 742). At that time, subdivisions (1) and (4) of Penal Law \u00a7 265.02 said that a person commits the third degree offense when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">\u201c(1) Such person commits the crime of criminal possession of a weapon in the fourth degree . . . and has been previously convicted of any crime; or ... .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">\u201c(4) Such person possesses any loaded firearm. Such possession shall not, except as provided in subdivision one . . . constitute a violation of this section if such possession takes place in such person\u2019s home or place of business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">Thus, until 2006, Penal Law \u00a7 265.02 (1) governed the case where a defendant convicted of a prior crime possessed a firearm (loaded or unloaded) in his home or place of business. The \u201cexcept as provided\u201d phrase in subdivision (4) was necessary to make clear that the home or business exception did not apply to subdivision (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">When former Penal Law \u00a7 265.02 (4) was repealed and replaced by section 265.03 (3), the legislature tracked the language of the former statute. It retained the \u201cexcept as provided\u201d phrase, altering it to refer to \u201csubdivision one ... of section 265.02.\u201d On defendant\u2019s theory, the phrase was no longer necessary, because the two subdivisions were now in different sections, but the legislature, in mechanically transposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>language, overlooked this. Defendant says that the legislature did not intend to change the meaning of the \u201cexcept as provided\u201d phrase, which he says still means, as it did before the 2006 legislation, that Penal Law \u00a7 265.02 (1) governs cases like the one before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Defendant\u2019s speculation\u2014essentially, that the 2006 legislature blundered\u2014is contradicted by legislative history showing that the legislature knew precisely what it was doing. A month and a half after enacting Penal Law \u00a7 265.03 (3), the 2006 legislature amended it to correct an error. The Senate sponsor of the corrective legislation provided a memorandum in its support, in which he described the purpose of section 265.03 (3). The new subdivision was, he said, \u201cintended to increase the penalty for criminal possession of a loaded firearm under the circumstances where ... [a] person possesses a loaded firearm in his home or place of business and has previously been convicted of a crime\u201d (Senate Introducer Mem in Support, Bill Jacket, L 2006, ch 745 at 3). Thus a memorandum by a knowledgeable legislator virtually contemporaneous with the enactment of Penal Law \u00a7 265.03 (3) describes it as meaning what it says. We hold that interpretation to be correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Defendant also argues that, regardless of the meaning of the home or business exception, the indictment here is insufficient because it does not allege defendant\u2019s prior criminal conviction. It is improper, defendant says, to allege that conviction separately, in a special information. The Appellate Division held the special information proper under CPL 200.60, which says that a previous conviction shall not be included in an indictment, but in a special information, where that previous conviction \u201craises an offense of lower grade to one of higher grade and thereby becomes an element of the latter.\u201d (CPL 200.60 [1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">We see no need to decide the CPL 200.60 question, because in our view defendant\u2019s previous conviction was not an \u201celement of the offense charged\u201d\u2014criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree\u2014and so did not have to be alleged at all <em>(see </em>CPL 200.50 [7] [a]). No doubt, in a more typical second degree possession case, where the home or business exception is factually inapplicable\u2014i.e., where the alleged possession took place somewhere else\u2014the inapplicability of the exception is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>element of the offense, and either the indictment or a special information must allege the fact that makes it inapplicable. But where the defendant has a previous conviction, the exception never comes into play, its inapplicability is not an element of the offense, and the indictment need not allude to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b132-6\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Graffeo, Read, Pigott and Rivera concur; Judge Abdus-Salaam taking no part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
