It may not be considered cumulative simply because it would repeat or be consistent with an opposing party\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">On February 13, 2006, plaintiff Theresa DeVito, who was in her late 70s, was injured in a motor vehicle accident in New York City; a van operated by Dennis Feliciano and owned by Paragon Cable Manhattan \u201crear-ended\u201d the car in which plaintiff was a passenger and her daughter Margaret was the driver. Plaintiff alleges that, as a result of the collision, she suffered serious injuries as defined in Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 (d), specifically fractures of her nose and back.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Plaintiff was taken by ambulance to a hospital, complaining of back pain. The hospital\u2019s emergency department discharge checklist contained negative notations with respect to head trauma, facial trauma, and ear, nose and throat problems, and indicated that she walked with a steady gait. No X rays were taken of plaintiffs nose or back at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">According to plaintiff, she suffered back, head, and nasal pain in the weeks that followed her accident. Her primary care physician referred her to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist, Dr. Ashutosh Kacker. As Dr. Kacker later recalled, plaintiff exhibited no pain upon palpation of her nose when examined on March 13, 2006, one month post accident. However, Dr. Kacker referred her for a CT scan, which indicated a nondisplaced fracture of the nose.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">Approximately two months after the accident, plaintiff went to the emergency department at a hospital near her home in New Hampshire, again complaining of back pain. An MRI revealed a compression fracture of the T12 vertebra.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">Plaintiff commenced this action against Feliciano and Paragon Cable Manhattan in 2006, alleging that their negligence caused her to suffer serious injuries within the meaning of Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 (d). These injuries, plaintiff alleges, include nasal and T12 fractures.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">In June 2008, plaintiff consulted with Dr. Silvester Lango, an orthopedic surgeon, who ordered further MRI scans, and confirmed the T12 fracture. Given plaintiff\u2019s age, Dr. Lango recommended that she consult pulmonary and heart specialists to determine whether she should undergo back surgery, which she declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Plaintiff was examined by four physicians designated by defendants pursuant to CPLR 3121, a neurologist, an orthopedist, an ENT specialist, and a radiologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Following discovery and depositions, plaintiff proceeded to a jury trial on damages in December 2008. Medical records from the two hospitals were admitted into evidence. The records from the hospital in New Hampshire indicated that in October 2005, four months before the motor vehicle accident, plaintiff had fallen and sustained a minor concussion and a fractured left wrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">At the trial, both plaintiff and her daughter Margaret testified as to her medical condition. Plaintiff volunteered that she had fallen a couple of times since the accident, but did not mention the October 2005 fall that preceded it. Her daughter, meanwhile, was asked specifically about her mother\u2019s October 2005 fall, and denied any knowledge of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Dr. Lango, the orthopedic surgeon, testified on behalf of plaintiff, telling the jury that plaintiff had sustained a T12 fracture; that a motor vehicle accident of the type alleged \u201cwould be the competent producing cause\u201d of such an injury; and that both plaintiff\u2019s T12 fracture and her nasal fracture were permanent injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">On cross-examination, however, Dr. Lango acknowledged that plaintiff was \u201cnot a good historian\u201d of her health, in that she would not give him \u201call the details,\u201d and that his determination \u201cwas based on limited and . . . incorrect information\u201d (as defense counsel put it), insofar as plaintiff had not told him about her October 2005 fall. Moreover, on re-cross-examination, Dr. Lango conceded that, based on the records from the New York hospital, it appeared that plaintiff had not suffered an injury to her nose on the date of the car accident. But Dr. Lango found no inconsistency between plaintiff\u2019s steady gait at the hospital a few hours after the motor vehicle accident and the allegation that she had suffered a T12 fracture in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">Dr. James B. Naidich, a radiologist, also testified on behalf of plaintiff. Reviewing the CT scan and MRI, Dr. Naidich testified that plaintiff suffered from a fractured nose and a T12 compression fracture, superimposed on arthritic changes, and that both fractures were the result of the motor vehicle accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">Dr. Naidich declined to speculate whether a person of plaintiffs age would have been able to walk with a steady gait if she had suffered a compression fracture only hours before. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Informed on cross-examination of plaintiffs October 2005 fall, Dr. Naidich testified that \u201c[t]he mechanism of the injury in February [2006] was more likely to cause a compression fracture than a patient who fell onto her outstretched hand and probably struck her head if she had a concussion.\u201d He further testified that, given the extent of the compression shown on the MRI, the T12 fracture was \u201cless likely\u201d to have occurred in October 2005 than in February 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Regarding the nasal fracture, Dr. Naidich testified that he would be \u201cuneasy about . . . dismissing\u201d plaintiffs allegations simply because the New York hospital\u2019s emergency department records did not indicate nasal problems. However, Dr. Naidich conceded on re-cross-examination that it is possible that plaintiff sustained her nasal fracture at some point before the date of the car accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">For its part, the defense read into the record portions of a transcript of the deposition of Dr. Kacker, plaintiff\u2019s ENT specialist. Dr. Kacker had testified that when he examined plaintiff on March 13, 2006, she had shown no pain on palpation of the nose. His testimony was that nasal pain would \u201c[p]robably\u201d be expected if a patient had suffered a fracture of the nasal bone only a month before, and that he could not say with certainty that plaintiffs nasal fracture had been caused by the car accident. Dr. Kacker had also testified that his notes about plaintiff included a comment that she was \u201cnot a very reliable historian.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Defendants declined to call any of the physicians who had examined plaintiff on their behalf. Plaintiffs counsel, in turn, requested a missing witness charge, under Pattern Jury Instructions (PJI) 1:75. A discussion followed outside the presence of the jury, during which Supreme Court mentioned a citation in the PJI to <em>Getlin v St. Vincent\u2019s Hosp. &amp; Med. Ctr. of N.Y. </em>(117 AD2d 707 [2d Dept 1986]). In <em>Getlin, </em>the Appellate Division ruled that a trial court properly refused to give a PJI 1:75 charge because the uncalled witness\u2019s testimony would \u201chave been merely cumulative of the testimony of the plaintiffs treating physician and . . . experts\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 709). Supreme Court, addressing plaintiffs counsel, suggested that the defense physicians\u2019 testimony \u201cwould be cumulative to what your doctors have already said.\u201d The court denied the request for an uncalled witness charge, but permitted counsel to argue the issue on summation.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Defense counsel\u2019s closing arguments focused on \u201ca thread of dishonesty\u201d throughout plaintiffs case, particularly with reference to plaintiffs October 2005 fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel, in his summation, exhorted the jury to draw the strongest inference against the defendants from the absence of their physician witnesses. \u201c[D]on\u2019t you think if these doctors had something to tell you that could help their case, that could show my client didn\u2019t suffer these injuries as a result of this accident, don\u2019t you think they would be here?\u201d he asked, urging the jury \u201cto draw the strongest inference based on the [failure] to call witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Following deliberations, the jury returned a verdict in defendants\u2019 favor, finding that the motor vehicle accident was not a substantial factor in bringing about plaintiffs nasal and T12 fractures.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The Appellate Division affirmed Supreme Court\u2019s judgment dismissing plaintiffs complaint (84 AD3d 645 [2011]), holding that plaintiff had failed to satisfy the elements that are a prerequisite for receiving a missing witness charge and citing, inter alia, <em>Getlin v St. Vincent\u2019s Hosp. &amp; Med. Ctr. of N.Y. </em>We granted plaintiff leave to appeal from the Appellate Division\u2019s order (19 NY3d 813 [2012]) and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">An \u201cuncalled witness\u201d or \u201cmissing witness\u201d charge instructs a jury that it may draw an adverse inference based on the failure of a party \u201cto call a witness who would normally be expected to support that party\u2019s version of events\u201d <em>(People v Savinon, </em>100 NY2d 192, 196 [2003]). The charge, found in Pattern Jury Instructions at 1:75, advises a jury that if a party fails to offer a reasonable explanation for its failure to call a witness to testify on a question, then the jury \u201cmay, although [it is] not required to, conclude that the testimony of [the witness] would not support [that party\u2019s] position on the question . . . and would not contradict the evidence offered by [the opposing party] on this question\u201d (PJI 1:75). The jury is instructed that it \u201cmay draw the strongest inference that the opposing evidence permits against a witness who fails to testify in a civil proceeding\u201d <em>(Matter of Nassau County Dept. of Social Servs. v Denise J., </em>87 NY2d 73, 79 [1995]; see PJI 1:75).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">The preconditions for this charge, applicable to both criminal and civil trials, may be set out as follows: (1) the witness\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>knowledge is material to the trial; (2) the witness is expected to give noncumulative testimony; (3) the witness is under the \u201ccontrol\u201d of the party against whom the charge is sought, so that the witness would be expected to testify in that party\u2019s favor; and (4) the witness is available to that party <em>(see Savinon, </em>100 NY2d at 197; <em>People v Macana, </em>84 NY2d 173, 177 [1994]; <em>People v Gonzalez, </em>68 NY2d 424, 428 [1986]; <em>see also e.g. Brueckner v Simpson, </em>206 AD2d 448 [2d Dept 1994]). Here, the defendants do not deny that their witnesses\u2019 knowledge was material, or that their relationship with the uncalled witnesses makes it natural to expect that the witnesses would testify in their favor; and they do not deny the uncalled witnesses\u2019 availability. Rather, defendants argue that the testimony of the uncalled witnesses would have been \u201ccumulative of the plaintiffs treating physician and plaintiffs radiology expert,\u201d relying on <em>Getlin. </em>We reject, as a matter of law, defendants\u2019 analysis of whether the uncalled witnesses\u2019 testimony would have been cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The appropriate analysis is found in <em>Leahy v Allen </em>(221 AD2d 88 [3d Dept 1996]), in which the Third Department held that \u201cone person\u2019s testimony properly may be considered cumulative of another\u2019s only when both individuals are testifying in favor of the same party\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 92), noting that to hold</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">\u201cotherwise would lead to an anomalous result. Indeed, if the testimony of a defense physician who had examined a plaintiff and confirmed the plaintiffs assertion of a serious injury were deemed to be cumulative to the evidence offered by the plaintiff, thereby precluding the missing witness charge, there would never be an occasion to invoke such charge\u201d <em>(id.).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Accordingly, our holding is that an uncalled witness\u2019s testimony may properly be considered cumulative only when it is cumulative of testimony or other evidence favoring the party controlling the uncalled witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">In short, a witness\u2019s testimony may not be ruled cumulative simply on the ground that it would be cumulative of the opposing witness\u2019s testimony. Because the record indicates that the latter was Supreme Court\u2019s rationale in this case, Supreme Court erred in denying plaintiffs request for a missing witness charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>m</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Nor can that error be deemed harmless. It is true that plaintiffs counsel conveyed to the jury, in his closing statements, much of the substance of the missing witness charge that plaintiff was denied, as it pertained to the present case. But a trial counsel\u2019s appeal to the jury during summation is not ordinarily a substitute for the appropriate jury charge by the court; the error here was not cured by the summation. It is also true that defense counsel, through vigorous cross-examination, was able to cast doubt upon plaintiffs claim that the fracture of her nose was caused by the February 2006 car accident. But the testimony leading to the conclusion that plaintiffs T12 fracture was caused by the February 2006 car accident was not so thoroughly challenged. We are unable to conclude that the evidence so clearly supported a verdict in favor of the defendants that Supreme Court\u2019s error did not prejudice a substantial right of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Finally, we have considered defendants\u2019 remaining arguments, and we conclude that they lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b239-8\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Graefeo, Read, Smith and Rivera concur; Judge Abdus-Salaam taking no part.</judges>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Order reversed, with costs, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
