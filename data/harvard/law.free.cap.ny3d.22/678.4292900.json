A Transit Division police officer observed this take place and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>arrested defendant. The unwitting victim confirmed to the police officer that he had not consented to defendant\u2019s sexual advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Defendant was charged with third-degree sexual abuse (Penal Law \u00a7 130.55), forcible touching (Penal Law \u00a7 130.52) and public lewdness (Penal Law \u00a7 245.00). The accusatory instrument, a misdemeanor complaint dated April 9, 2009 and attested to by the arresting officer, stated as relevant to this appeal that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">\u201cthe defendant subjected another person to sexual contact without the latter\u2019s consent; in that the defendant intentionally, and for no legitimate purpose, forcibly touched the sexual and other intimate parts of another person for the purpose of degrading and abusing such person, and for the purpose of gratifying the defendant\u2019s sexual desire; . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-7\">\u201c[Djeponent observed the defendant (i) approach and stand directly behind [the victim], (ii) defendant then removed defendant\u2019s penis from defendant\u2019s pants exposing defendant\u2019s penis to open and public view, and (iii) rubbed defendant\u2019s groin area and exposed penis against [the victim\u2019s] buttocks. Deponent further states that deponent is informed by [the victim], of an address known to the District Attorney\u2019s Office, that [the victim] did not consent to defendantfs] touching [him] in any manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">In a supporting deposition dated April 16, 2009, the victim swore to his lack of consent, thus converting the accusatory instrument into an information by providing a nonhearsay basis for the allegation that the touching was nonconsensual.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">On October 21, 2009, after a hearing, the judge denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress identification evidence and statements. The next day defendant pleaded guilty to forcible touching in full satisfaction of the information. Section 130.52 of the Penal Law defines this crime as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-10\">\u201cA person is guilty of forcible touching when such person intentionally, and for no legitimate purpose, forcibly touches the sexual or other intimate parts of another person for the purpose of degrading or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>abusing such person; or for the purpose of gratifying the actor\u2019s sexual desire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">\u201cFor the purposes of this section, forcible touching includes squeezing, grabbing or pinching.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The judge sentenced defendant to a conditional discharge with three days of community service in lieu of 30 days in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Defendant appealed, arguing that the information was jurisdictionally defective because simply stating that he \u201crubbed\u201d his groin and exposed penis against the victim\u2019s intimate parts did not fulfill the forcible component of the crime. Defendant took the position that rubbing did not entail force as called for by the statute because it was not akin to the statutory examples of \u201csqueezing, grabbing or pinching.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">In a decision and order dated June 27, 2012, the Appellate Term unanimously affirmed the judgment (36 Misc 3d 128[A], 2012 NY Slip Op 51203[U] [App Term, 1st Dept 2012]). The court concluded that \u201c \u2018given a fair and not overly restrictive or technical reading,\u2019 \u201d the information\u2019s factual allegations were \u201csufficient for pleading purposes to establish reasonable cause to believe and a prima facie case that defendant committed the crime of forcible touching\u201d <em>(id. </em>at *1, quoting <em>People v Casey, </em>95 NY2d 354, 360 [2000]). Further, \u201c[a]t the pleading stage, the sworn allegation that the victim did not consent to any sexual contact is \u2018sufficiently evidentiary in character\u2019 to support the lack of consent element of the charged crime\u201d <em>(id., </em>citing <em>People v Allen, </em>92 NY2d 378, 385 [1998]). On October 4, 2012, a Judge of this Court granted defendant leave to appeal (19 NY3d 1102 [2012]). We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">To be facially sufficient, the allegations in the factual portion of a misdemeanor complaint, together with any accompanying supporting depositions, must provide \u201c \u2018reasonable cause\u2019 to believe that the defendant committed the charged offense\u201d <em>(People v Kalin, </em>12 NY3d 225, 228 [2009]; <em>see </em>CPL 100.40 [4] [b]). Additionally, \u201can information must set forth \u2018nonhearsay allegations which, if true, establish every element of the offense charged and the defendant\u2019s commission thereof\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kalin </em>at 228-229, quoting <em>People v Henderson, </em>92 NY2d 677, 679 [1999]). This is known as the \u201cprima facie case requirement,\u201d which is not nearly so stringent as the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt required to convict or even the legally sufficient evidence necessary to survive a motion to dismiss <em>(id. </em>at 229-230; CPL 100.40 [1] [c]). Rather, as the Appellate Term noted, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>have held that \u201c[s]o long as the factual allegations of an information give an accused notice sufficient to prepare a defense and are adequately detailed to prevent a defendant from being tried twice for the same offense, they should be given a fair and not overly restrictive or technical reading\u201d <em>(Casey, </em>95 NY2d at 360).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Here, defendant claims that the information does not meet even these minimal standards because the factual allegation that he \u201crubbed\u201d his groin and exposed penis against the victim\u2019s buttocks does not establish the kind or level of force required by Penal Law \u00a7 130.52. This is so, he argues, because \u201csqueezing, grabbing or pinching,\u201d the statutory examples, \u201cshare a common core\u201d; namely, \u201c[i]n all three, a sexual or intimate part of the victim is compressed between two objects.\u201d And while a squeeze, grab, or pinch \u201ccan be so gentle as to entail virtually no manual pressure,\u201d these acts are more likely to result in \u201cpain or at least non-trivial physical discomfort.\u201d By contrast, he contends, rubbing does not involve compression and is unlikely to cause pain or nontrivial physical discomfort.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Additionally, defendant protests that if the act of rubbing constitutes a forcible touch, the distinction between the crimes of forcible touching, a class A misdemeanor, and third-degree sexual abuse, a class B misdemeanor, is effectively obliterated and someone who commits third-degree sexual abuse with the purpose of gratifying <em>the actor\u2019s </em>sexual desire may be prosecuted for forcible touching at the whim of the prosecutor. In defendant\u2019s view, then, \u201cforcibly touches\u201d is the same as \u201cany touching\u201d unless the former is limited to contact that compresses the victim\u2019s sexual or intimate parts between two objects and is likely to cause pain or at least nontrivial physical discomfort, the common threads he finds in the statutory examples of \u201csqueezing, grabbing or pinching.\u201d Absent this proposed limitation, defendant urges, the \u201cat best quixotic result\u201d would be that any conduct establishing the \u201clesser offense\u201d of third-degree sexual abuse would necessarily also establish \u201cthe essential elements of the forcible touching offense, even though the latter offense is a more serious crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">In making this argument, defendant does not adequately take into account the mens rea element of third-degree sexual abuse. Specifically, to be guilty of third-degree sexual abuse, the actor must \u201csubject[ ] another person to sexual contact without the latter\u2019s consent\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 130.55); and, as relevant to the mens rea element, the term \u201csexual contact\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>\u201cany touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of a person <em>for the purpose of gratifying sexual desire of either party. </em>It includes the touching of the actor by the victim, as well as the touching of the victim by the actor, whether directly or through clothing, as well as the emission of ejaculate by the actor upon any part of the victim, clothed or unclothed.\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 130.00 [3] [emphasis added].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Because third-degree sexual abuse criminalizes nonconsensual sexual touching for purposes of <em>either </em>party\u2019s sexual gratification, the People are not required to plead or prove whether the touching is for the actor\u2019s or the recipient\u2019s sexual gratification <em>Csee </em>CJI2d[NY] Penal Law \u00a7 130.55).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Additionally, defendant presupposes a fundamental relationship between the two statutes which does not, in fact, exist. Rather, third-degree sexual abuse is part of a family of crimes that also includes second- and first-degree sexual abuse, where punishment is elevated if additional factors are present. In short, third-degree sexual abuse is not \u201cthe lesser crime\u201d as compared to forcible touching, and we do not conflate the two crimes if we fail to adopt defendant\u2019s proposed limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">In any event, the People dispute defendant\u2019s argument that \u201cforcibly touches,\u201d unless limited as he proposes, is no different than \u201cany touching.\u201d They point out that \u201cforce\u201d is commonly defined as \u201cstrength or energy exerted or brought to bear\u201d <em>(see </em>Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, http://www.merriamwebster.com/dictionary/force); and \u201crub\u201d (as an intransitive verb) \u201cto move along the surface of a body with <em>pressure, </em>\u201d or (as a transitive verb) \u201cto subject to or as if to the action of something moving especially back and forth with <em>pressure and friction\u201d (see </em>Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, http:// www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rub [emphasis added]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And \u201c[s]ince the use of \u2018pressure\u2019 or \u2018friction\u2019 obviously brings strength or energy to bear,[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] the act of \u2018rubbing\u2019 qualifies as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>forcible touch.\u201d Moreover, the People add, the information here was plainly sufficient even under defendant\u2019s alternative construction of \u201cforcibly touches.\u201d Specifically, \u201cby rubbing his groin and exposed penis against the victim\u2019s buttocks without . . . consent, defendant could certainly have caused the victim \u2018non-trivial physical discomfort\u2019 [and f]or that matter, [defendant] also clearly compressed his penis between his body and the victim\u2019s body.\u201d Because the crime of forcible touching requires the application of some level of pressure to the victim\u2019s sexual or other intimate parts, the People continue, the actus reus for this crime differs from the actus reus for third-degree sexual abuse, which may only entail bringing a bodily part into fleeting contact with another\u2019s sexual or intimate parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">We agree with the People and conclude that \u201cforcibly touches\u201d is not restricted in the way defendant advocates. Indeed, we understand the examples set out in the statute (i.e., \u201csqueezing, grabbing or pinching\u201d) as intended by the legislature to signal a low threshold for the forcible component of this crime\u2019s actus reus. Accordingly, we hold that, when done with the relevant mens rea, any bodily contact involving the application of some level of pressure to the victim\u2019s sexual or intimate parts qualifies as a forcible touch within the meaning of Penal Law \u00a7 130.52. The allegation in the information here easily meets this test.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Legislative history supports our broad construction of the statutory language. The legislature enacted the crime of forcible touching as part of the Sexual Assault Reform Act of 2000. This legislation was designed to update the state\u2019s laws dealing with sexual assault for the first time in 30 years and to assist victims in their efforts to recover psychologically from these crimes. It was a compromise measure introduced by message of necessity in both houses of the legislature on June 22, 2000, on the wane of the legislative session. The \u201cimpetus\u201d for the new crime of forcible touching, which did not appear in the several earlier versions of a reform bill passed by the Senate, but not the Assembly, was \u201ca notorious series of forcible touchings of the sexual parts of women walking through Central Park\u201d that took place less than two weeks before the legislature acted <em>(see </em>William C. Donnino, Practice Commentary, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 39, Penal Law \u00a7 130.52 at 234; <em>see also </em>Budget Report on Bills, Bill Jacket, L 2000, ch 1 at 3 [remarking that the creation of the new crime of forcible touching was a \u201cresponse to the recent Central Park \u2018Wilding\u2019 \u201d]). The victims of these public sexual attacks generally were physically unhurt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number><em>(see </em>C. J. Chivers &amp; Kevin Flynn, <em>35 Scary Minutes: Women Tell Police of Assaults in Park, </em>NY Times, June 13, 2000, cited in the Practice Commentary). Given this context, it is hard to believe that the legislature meant for \u201cforcibly touches\u201d to cover only contact that compresses and is painful or physically discomforting.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Term should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b752-11\">. Lack of consent is an element of every sexual offense in article 130 of the Penal Law, and, with respect to the crime of forcible touching, results from \u201cany circumstance[ ] ... in which the victim does not expressly or impliedly acquiesce in the actor\u2019s conduct\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 130.05 [2] [c]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b755-8\">. Similarly, the first definition given in the Oxford English Dictionary for \u201crub\u201d as a transitive verb is \u201c[t]o subject (a surface or substance) to the action of something (as a hand, a cloth, etc.) moving over it, or backwards and forwards upon it, with a certain amount of pressure and friction\u201d; and, as an intransitive verb, \u201c[t]o exert or employ friction accompanied by pressure; to move and at the same time press <em>upon </em>or <em>against </em>something\u201d (14 Oxford English Dictionary 189, 190 [2d ed 1989]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b755-9\">. \u201cPressure\u201d is commonly defined as \u201cthe weight or force that is produced when something presses or pushes against something else\u201d <em>(see </em>Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ pressure).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b757-6\">Chief Judge Lippman</author>\n<p id=\"Anb\">(concurring). I agree with the result, but not the majority\u2019s proposed rule. The primary question in this case is whether the factual allegations in the misdemeanor information gave defendant adequate notice to prepare a defense and were detailed enough to prevent him from being tried twice for the same offense <em>(see People v Casey, </em>95 NY2d 354, 360 [2000]). I would hold simply that the information was sufficient under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">The majority goes far beyond what is necessary and delineates the entire realm of forcible touching by defining \u201cforcible touch\u201d under Penal Law \u00a7 130.52 as \u201cany bodily contact involving the application of some level of pressure to the victim\u2019s sexual or intimate parts\u201d (at 684). To the extent the test is a rejection of defendant\u2019s argument that the touching must consist of compression of a victim\u2019s sexual or intimate parts between two objects, I agree. If the test means that there is some requisite level of pressure, but the Court declines to provide any guidance, I find it unhelpful. If, however, the test intends \u201csome level of pressure\u201d to mean \u201cany pressure,\u201d I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">To define \u201cforcible\u201d as \u201cany pressure\u201d reads \u201cforcible\u201d out of the statute, abolishing an important distinction between forcible touching, an A misdemeanor, and sexual abuse in the third degree, a B misdemeanor, where the touching is performed for sexual gratification. \u201cA person is guilty of sexual abuse in the third degree when he or she subjects another person to sexual contact without the latter\u2019s consent\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 130.55). \u201cSexual contact\u201d is defined as <em>\u201cany touching </em>of the sexual or other intimate parts of a person for the purpose of gratifying sexual desire of either party\u201d (Penal Law \u00a7 130.00 [3] [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">The legislature evidently has made a distinction between \u201cany touching\u201d and \u201cforcible touching\u201d with regard to sex crimes. This distinction would be artificial under the majority\u2019s test because any touching inherently involves the application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>\u201csome level of pressure.\u201d The contention that the actus rei of forcible touching and third-degree sexual abuse are distinct because the latter encompasses \u201cfleeting contact\u201d is but a strained attempt to differentiate the critical elements of the two crimes as defined by the majority (at 684). \u201cFleeting\u201d describes only the transitory nature of the contact, which is irrelevant under the statute.</p>\n<judges id=\"b758-5\">Judges Graffeo, Smith, Pigott and Rivera concur with Judge Read; Chief Judge Lippman concurs in result in an opinion; Judge Abdus-Salaam taking no part.</judges>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
