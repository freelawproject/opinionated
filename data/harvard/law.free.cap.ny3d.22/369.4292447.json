The trial court committed three legal errors that grossly distorted the evidence on a central issue in the case and denied Anthony Oddone a fair trial. <em>(People v Borges, </em>69 NY2d 1031; <em>People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230; <em>People v Tarantola, </em>178 AD2d 768; <em>People v Wesley, </em>83 NY2d 417; <em>Parker v Mobil Oil Corp., </em>7 NY3d 434; <em>People v Cronin, </em>60 NY2d 430; <em>Marso v Novak, </em>42 AD3d 377; <em>Muhammad v Fitzpatrick, </em>91 AD3d 1353; <em>Rosati v Brigham Park Co-operative Apts., </em>36 Misc 3d 1214[A], 2012 NY Slip Op 51315[U].)

The verdict must be set aside because Anthony Oddone was denied his right to an impartial jury. <em>(People v Branch, </em>46 NY2d 645; <em>Dyer v Calderon, </em>151 F3d 970; <em>People v Estella, </em>68 AD3d 1155; <em>People v Maragh, </em>94 NY2d 569; <em>People v Brown, </em>48 NY2d 388; <em>People v De Lucia, </em>20 NY2d 275; <em>Clyde Mattox v United States, </em>146 US 140; <em>People v Buford, </em>69 NY2d 290; <em>People v Borges, </em>69 NY2d 1031; <em>People v Harris, </em>19 NY3d 679.)

II. Dr. Penrod\u2019s proposed testimony was based upon generally accepted principles and would have aided the jury in its evaluation of the eyewitness testimony. <em>(People v Lee, </em>96 NY2d 157; <em>People v Cronin, </em>60 NY2d 430; <em>People v Le-Grand, </em>8 NY3d 449; <em>People v Abney, </em>13 NY3d 251; <em>People v Santiago, </em>17 NY3d 661; <em>People v Bedessie, </em>19 NY3d 147; <em>People v Williams, </em>20 NY3d 579; <em>People v Spicola, </em>16 NY3d 441; <em>United States v Graves, </em>465 F Supp 2d 450; <em>United States v Hines, </em>55 F Supp 2d 62.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b444-5\"><em>Sharon McCarthy, </em>New York City, and <em>Dorothy Heyl, </em>for New York City Bar Association, amicus curiae.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZi\">I. Testimony on the effect on memory of post-event information satisfies the requirements of <em>Frye v United States </em>(293 F 1013 [DC Cir 1923]) and testimony on the tendency to overestimate duration should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>have been excluded without a <em>Frye </em>hearing. <em>(Parker v Mobil Oil Corp., </em>7 NY3d 434; <em>People v Magri, </em>3 NY2d 562; <em>People v Wesley, </em>83 NY2d 417; <em>People v Mooney, </em>76 NY2d 827; <em>People v Drake, </em>188 Misc 2d 210, 19 AD3d 209, 7 NY3d 28; <em>People v Beckford, </em>141 Misc 2d 71; <em>People v Lewis, </em>137 Misc 2d 84; <em>People v Brooks, </em>128 Misc 2d 608; <em>People v LeGrand, </em>8 NY3d 449; <em>People v Santiago, </em>17 NY3d 661.) II. Studies on the tendency to overestimate the duration of a short, stressful event and the malleability of memory are \u201cbeyond the ken\u201d of the average juror. <em>(People v Diaz, </em>20 NY3d 569; <em>De Long v County of Erie, </em>60 NY2d 296; <em>Selkowitz v County of Nassau, </em>45 NY2d 97; <em>People v Cronin, </em>60 NY2d 430; <em>People v Lee, </em>96 NY2d 157; <em>People v Jones, </em>73 NY2d 427; <em>People v Young, </em>7 NY3d 40; <em>People v Abney, </em>13 NY3d 251; <em>People v Beckford, </em>141 Misc 2d 71.) III. The exercise of sound discretion in determining whether to allow expert testimony requires a careful analysis of the relevant factors, rather than application of a per se standard. <em>(People v Williams, </em>56 NY2d 236; <em>People v Lee, </em>96 NY2d 157; <em>People v Aphaylath, </em>68 NY2d 945; <em>People v LeGrand, </em>8 NY3d 449.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b445-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b445-6\">Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Defendant was convicted of manslaughter in the first degree for causing the death of a man by holding him in a headlock. The duration of the headlock was an important issue at trial. Defendant argues that several of the trial court\u2019s rulings in admitting and excluding evidence related to that issue were mistaken. As to one of those rulings\u2014the court\u2019s refusal to permit defendant to refresh his witness\u2019s recollection with a statement the witness had previously given\u2014we agree with defendant, and order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">The victim, Andrew Reister, was a bouncer in a bar. On the night in question, defendant and a young woman were in the bar, dancing on a table. Reister asked defendant to get off the table, defendant refused, and Reister pushed him off. There followed a fight. In short order, defendant got behind Reister and put his arms around his neck; one of defendant\u2019s hands was grasping the other. After an interval, Reister fell to the floor and defendant fell on top of him, not releasing his grip, though Reister seemed to onlookers to be unconscious. Several people screamed at defendant to let Reister go, and some tried without success to pull defendant away. Finally, defendant let go and ran <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>out of the bar, leaving Reister unconscious on the floor. Reister was declared brain dead two days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Defendant was indicted for murder and relied on a defense of justification (self-defense). At his trial, the People asked seven of their witnesses to estimate the duration of the headlock. The estimates varied, but most put the total time, beginning when defendant\u2019s arms first went around Reister\u2019s neck and ending when he released him, at somewhere near three minutes. Two defense witnesses gave shorter estimates; by their telling, the headlock may have lasted less than a minute.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The jury acquitted defendant of murder, but convicted him of manslaughter in the first degree (causing death with the intent to cause serious physical injury [Penal Law \u00a7 125.20 (1)]) as a lesser included offense. The Appellate Division affirmed <em>(People v Oddone, </em>89 AD3d 868 [2d Dept 2011]). A Judge of this Court granted leave to appeal (20 NY3d 1102 [2013]), and we now reverse and order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Of the issues raised by defendant on this appeal, we find three\u2014all related to what witnesses were or were not allowed to say about the duration of the headlock\u2014that call for discussion. Defendant challenges the following evidentiary rulings:</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">(1) James Wilson, the doctor who performed an autopsy on Reister\u2019s body, was permitted to testify that in his opinion Reister\u2019s neck had been compressed for \u201csomething in the range of 2, 3, 4 minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">(2) When Megan Flynn, a defense witness, testified that the duration of the part of the incident she observed \u201ccould have been a minute or so,\u201d defense counsel was not allowed to refresh her recollection with a prior statement that put the same interval at \u201cmaybe 6 to 10 seconds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">(3) Steven Penrod, an expert in eyewitness observation, was not permitted to testify that eyewitnesses routinely overestimate, by a large margin, the duration of relatively brief events.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">We reject defendant\u2019s attack on Wilson\u2019s testimony. We agree with defendant that the restriction placed on his questioning of Flynn was error requiring a new trial. Whether the exclusion of Penrod\u2019s testimony was an abuse of discretion is a close question that we do not need to decide, but we offer some observations about it for the guidance of the court at a retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>A. Wilson</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Wilson, a deputy medical examiner, inferred a 2-4 minute duration for the headlock principally from two facts: his own observation at the autopsy of \u201cpetechiae\u201d\u2014red spots caused by bursting of blood vessels\u2014on and around Reister\u2019s eyes; and the observations of several witnesses that, by the time the incident ended, Reister\u2019s face had turned purple. As to the petechiae, Wilson testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">\u201cQ. Could you tell us, Doctor in your experience how long it would take for this type of petechia to be present in Mr. Reister\u2019s\u2014around his eyes, in the skin surrounding his eyes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">\u201cA. Well, in my experience and understanding of how this process occurs an injury of this sort would take matter of a few minutes, 2, 3 perhaps 4, with neck compression on type some kind of a struggle. So there may be slight variations in the pressure from time to time, but matter of a few minutes, something in the range of 2, 3, 4 minutes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">Similarly, as to the discoloration of Reister\u2019s face, Wilson testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-10\">\u201cQ. In your opinion, Doctor, how long would it take for the blood in the veins that is not able\u2014that is being squeezed and kept in the head, how long would it take in order for that purple cast or coloration to occur in Mr. Reister\u2019s face?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-11\">\u201cA. Well, in my opinion and experience the blood that is built up over a period of time, then loss of oxygen, to get very dark it would be a matter of a few minutes minimum, something in the order of 2, 3, 4 minutes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">Defendant attacks this testimony as lacking a scientific basis. He does not dispute that petechiae and purple coloring can result from neck compression, but he says\u2014and the People do not dispute\u2014that no scientific studies have been published to show how lengthy a compression is required to produce those results. Thus, defendant argues, Wilson was advancing a scientific principle that had not gained general acceptance in its field, in violation of the rule of <em>Frye v United States </em>(293 F 1013 [DC Cir 1923]), which is followed by the courts of New York <em>(People v </em>Wesley, 83 NY2d 417 [1994]).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>The flaw in defendant\u2019s reasoning is that Wilson did not claim to rely on any established scientific principle. He made clear that his testimony was based on his personal \u201cexperience\u201d\u2014meaning what he had observed, heard and read about particular cases. Such evidence is not barred by <em>Frye (see Johnson v State, </em>933 So 2d 568, 570 [Fla App 2006] [\u201cAn expert opinion based on personal training and experience is not subject to a <em>Frye </em>analysis\u201d]; <em>Commonwealth v Devlin, </em>365 Mass 149, 155, 310 NE2d 353, 357 [1974] [\u201cDr. Sosman\u2019s medical opinion . . . was not the product of a \u2018scientific theory\u2019 but was, rather, the product of years of experience\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Defendant argues in substance that an expert who is a scientist can express no opinion based on his own experience, but must rely only on published studies or texts. We reject the argument. It is true that an opinion based on experience alone is ordinarily less reliable than one based on generally accepted science. An expert may well overvalue his own experience, or even exaggerate or fabricate it. But these flaws can be exposed by cross-examination, and by the opinions of opposing experts\u2014as the alleged flaws in Wilson\u2019s testimony were in this case. There will ordinarily be no unfairness as long as the jury is not misled into thinking that the expert\u2019s opinion reflects a generally accepted principle <em>(see Flanagan v State, </em>625 So 2d 827, 828 [Fla 1993] [an expert\u2019s reliance on \u201csome scientific principle or test . . . implies an infallibility not found in pure opinion testimony\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">We acknowledge that it may not be possible to draw a neat line between scientific principles and experience-based testimony. Indeed, it has been observed that the many cases applying <em>Frye </em>to evidence based on scientific principles shed little light on exactly what a \u201cscientific principle\u201d is <em>(see </em>22 Charles A. Wright &amp; Kenneth W. Graham, Jr., Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence \u00a7 5168.2 [2d ed Apr. 2013]). We do not imply that an expert is allowed to say anything he or she likes to a jury if the statement is prefaced by the words \u201cin my experience.\u201d To allow an expert to say, based only on his or her alleged experience, that smoking does not cause lung cancer or that baldness is related to the phases of the moon would be to tolerate the admission of junk science and to undermine the basic purpose of <em>Frye.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">But Wilson\u2019s testimony in this case does not trigger a concern of that kind. The parties here appear to agree that petechiae and discoloration are caused by neck compression; how long the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>neck must be compressed is a question that scientific studies do not seem to have answered. To allow a pathologist who has examined many dead bodies, and heard and read many accounts of how victims met their deaths, to express an opinion on the subject accords with common sense, and does not open the door to every expert\u2019s flight of fancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">B. Flynn</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Flynn, a waitress at the bar where the fatal event took place, saw part of the incident and later told an insurance company investigator that the part she saw lasted \u201cfor maybe 6 to 10 seconds.\u201d The People interviewed her before trial but decided not to call her as a witness. The defense did call her, and asked essentially the same question the insurance investigator had asked: \u201c[F]rom the time that you walked in to the time you saw the guy let go how long of a period of time was it?\u201d On the witness stand, Flynn gave a different answer: \u201cI didn\u2019t have a watch. I wasn\u2019t keeping track of time. But it could have been a minute or so. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Defense counsel tried to show Flynn her previous statement to refresh her recollection, but was not permitted to do so. The trial court ruled that Flynn had \u201cgiven no indication she needs her memory refreshed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">In this, the trial court erred. When a witness, describing an incident more than a year in the past, says that it \u201ccould have\u201d lasted \u201ca minute or so,\u201d and adds \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the inference that her recollection could benefit from being refreshed is a compelling one. More fundamentally, it was simply unfair to let the jury hear the \u201ca minute or so\u201d testimony\u2014 testimony damaging to the defense, from a defense witness\u2019s own lips\u2014while allowing the defense to make no use at all of an earlier, much more favorable, answer to the same question. The trial court suggested to defense counsel that this was \u201can effort to impeach your own witness,\u201d but counsel had not yet got to the point of impeachment; she only wanted to refresh the witness\u2019s recollection. And in any event, technical limitations on the impeachment of witnesses must sometimes give way, in a criminal case, to a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial <em>(Chambers v Mississippi, </em>410 US 284 [1973]).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Though Flynn was certainly not the central witness in the case, we conclude that the error in limiting counsel\u2019s examination of her was important enough to justify reversal. Indeed, the People do not argue that the error was harmless. It may be that her original \u201c6 to 10 seconds\u201d statement, if repeated on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>stand, would have been of little consequence, for Flynn saw only the last part of what occurred. But the testimony of a defense witness that that fragment of the event might have lasted as long as a minute gave significant support to the People. The prosecutor used\u2014indeed, overstated\u2014Flynn\u2019s testimony in her closing argument: \u201cMegan Flynn even told you, the defense\u2019s own witness, told you it was one to two minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">C. Penrod</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Defendant sought to call Penrod, a psychology professor, \u201cas an expert on the issue of eyewitness observations,\u201d explaining in a detailed offer of proof, accompanied by an affidavit from Penrod, what he would testify to. Much of his proposed testimony was on matters within the ken of the average juror, and the trial court was plainly right to exclude it. But one point that Penrod proposed to make, relating to the accuracy of estimates of duration, cannot be put aside so readily. Penrod said in his affidavit: \u201cIt is generally accepted in the field of forensic psychology that eyewitnesses routinely overestimate the duration of relatively short events lasting a few minutes or less.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Penrod offered specific support for this assertion, quoting another psychologist who had studied the topic:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">\u201cTheoretical and empirical investigation of duration estimations date back to the nineteenth century with Vierordt\u2019s (1868) discovery that short intervals tend to be overestimated and longer ones underestimated. This finding is now commonly referred to as \u2018Vierordt\u2019s Law\u2019. Consistent with this law, forensically related research has shown that witnesses tend to overestimate the duration of relatively short events lasting a few minutes or less .... Yarmey and Yarmey (1997) found that witnesses in field situations (involving) ... a 15-second interaction with a \u2018culprit\u2019 . . . overestimated this encounter by a 3 to 1 ratio.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Citing <em>People v LeGrand </em>(8 NY3d 449 [2007]), defendant argues that the exclusion of expert testimony about \u201cVierordt\u2019s Law\u201d was error. <em>LeGrand, </em>as the trial court observed, is not directly in point. The issue in <em>LeGrand </em>was the reliability of an eyewitness\u2019s identification of defendant as the person who committed the crime, and we held it an abuse of discretion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>exclude expert testimony about the reliability of such identifications where the case \u201cturned solely on the accuracy of the witnesses\u2019 identification,\u201d for which there was \u201cno corroborating evidence\u201d (8 NY3d at 457). Here, defendant\u2019s identity was never in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\"><em>LeGrand, </em>however, can be read to stand for the broader principle that there are cases in which it is unfair to deprive the jury of expert testimony about the reliability of eyewitness observations. Whether this is such a case is a debatable question. We must assume on this record that \u201cVierordt\u2019s Law\u201d is a generally accepted scientific principle; defendant sought, and was denied, a <em>Frye </em>hearing on that issue. The proposition that estimates of the duration of brief incidents tend to err significantly on the high side is not one within the ken of the average juror. And the accuracy of witnesses\u2019 estimates of duration was undoubtedly relevant to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">On the other hand, applications to admit evidence of this kind\u2014in essence, testimony by an expert witness advising the jury on how to evaluate the testimony of fact witnesses\u2014must be approached with caution. Such testimony is collateral to the main issues in the case, and we have warned that the exploration of collateral issues tends \u201cto obscure the main issue in the minds of the jury, to lead them away from the principal matters which require their attention and to protract trials to an unreasonable extent without any corresponding advantage to any one concerned\u201d <em>(People v Harris, </em>209 NY 70, 82 [1913]). This explains the limitations we placed on our holding in <em>LeGrand, </em>requiring the admission of testimony about eyewitness identifications only where uncorroborated identification evidence is of critical importance. Courts do not normally exclude relevant evidence merely because the case against the defendant is strong. But the overall strength of the case is important to issues arising under <em>LeGrand, </em>because where the eyewitness testimony is not crucial, expert testimony about the collateral issue of eyewitness reliability can be a harmful distraction.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Here, it can be argued that it was not crucial for the jury to decide how many seconds or minutes defendant held Reister in a headlock. The evidence that Reister fell unconscious, that defendant still maintained a grip on his neck, and that onlookers screamed for defendant to stop and tried to pull him away without result, would support a finding that, however long it was, it was far too long. The decisive issue in the case is not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>duration of the headlock, but whether defendant caused Reister\u2019s death while intending to cause him serious physical injury. The theory that defendant\u2019s purpose was only to defend himself might be rejected by a factfinder even in the absence of any evidence of duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Yet the People chose to put in much evidence of duration, from fact and expert witnesses, and relied on it heavily. This might well have justified the trial court in allowing Penrod to give the testimony defendant proffered. Whether it was an abuse of discretion to exclude that testimony is now\u2014since we reverse the conviction on other grounds\u2014an academic question. A similar question may arise on retrial, but because no two trials are ever identical the considerations governing the court\u2019s exercise of its discretion will not necessarily be the same. We decide only that the question should be addressed in light of the factors discussed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b452-7\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Graffeo, Read, Pigott, Rivera and Abdus-Salaam concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Order reversed and a new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
