Application of the two-year suit limitations clause to the policyholder\u2019s claim for replacement costs creates an ambiguity that must be resolved in favor of the policyholder. <em>(Campanile v State Farm Gen.

Co., </em>82 AD3d 650.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b588-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b588-6\">Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">This case involves a fire insurance policy that contains a clause limiting the time in which the insured may bring suit under the policy. The limitation period is two years, running from the date of the fire. The policy also says that the insured may recover the cost of replacing destroyed property\u2014but only after the property has already been replaced. Thus, if (as happened in this case) the process of replacing the property takes more than two years, the insured\u2019s claim will be time-barred before it comes into existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Answering a question from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, we hold that such a contractual limitation period, applied to a case in which the property cannot reasonably be replaced in two years, is unreasonable and unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">Plaintiff owned an office building in Island Park, New York, that was severely damaged in a fire on February 23, 2007. It cost more than a million dollars to restore the building to its previous condition. Plaintiff had $1 million in insurance coverage from defendant, under a policy that gave the insured a choice between the payment of \u201cactual cash value\u201d and \u201creplacement cost.\u201d The policy said, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-11\">\u201cWe will not pay on a replacement cost basis for any loss or damage:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-12\">\u201c(i) Until the lost or damaged property is actually repaired or replaced; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-13\">\u201c(ii) Unless the repairs or replacement are made as soon as reasonably possible after the loss or damage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-14\">The policy also had a \u201cLegal Action Against Us\u201d clause, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-15\">\u201cNo one may bring a legal action against us under this insurance unless: . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>\u201cb. The action is brought within 2 years after the date on which the direct physical loss or damage occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Defendant paid plaintiff the \u201cactual cash value\u201d of the destroyed building, $757,812.50. Plaintiff notified defendant that it would be making a replacement cost claim up to the $1 million policy limit\u2014i.e., it would be seeking another $242,187.50. Defendant replied that, to collect that amount, plaintiff would have to provide \u201cdocumentation verifying the completion of repairs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Plaintiff alleges that it acted reasonably to replace the damaged building, but was not able to do so before the second anniversary of the fire, February 23, 2009. On that date, plaintiff sued defendant in Supreme Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that defendant was liable for replacement costs up to the policy limit. Defendant removed the action to federal court, and successfully moved to dismiss it on the ground that, since plaintiff had not finished replacing the building, the action was premature <em>(Executive Plaza, LLC v Peerless Ins. Co., </em>2010 US Dist LEXIS 99602 [ED NY, Feb. 8, 2010, No. CV 09-1976]).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">The replacement building was completed in October 2010, and plaintiff demanded payment of the unpaid portion of the policy limits. Defendant denied liability on the ground that the two-year period had expired, and plaintiff brought another action, the present one, against defendant in Supreme Court. Defendant again removed the case to federal court and again moved to dismiss. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York granted the motion, finding that the policy \u201cunambiguously bars any and all suits commenced more than two years after the date of the damage or loss\u201d <em>(Executive Plaza, LLC v Peerless Ins. Co., </em>2012 WL 910086, *6, 2012 US Dist LEXIS 36174, *16 [ED NY, Mar. 13, 2012, No. 11-CV-1716 (JS)(GRB)]). The District Court found \u201cthat the two-year limitation period in the Policy is reasonable, as New York courts have consistently upheld two-year limitations periods in insurance contracts as reasonable\u201d (2012 WL 910086, *3, 2012 US Dist LEXIS 36174, *9-10).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Plaintiff appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which certified the following question to us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-9\">\u201cIf a fire insurance policy contains</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-10\">\u201c(1) a provision allowing reimbursement of replacement costs only after the property was replaced and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>requiring the property to be replaced \u2018as soon as reasonably possible after the loss\u2019; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">\u201c(2) a provision requiring an insured to bring suit within two years after the loss;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">\u201cis an insured covered for replacement costs if the insured property cannot reasonably be replaced within two years?\u201d <em>(Executive Plaza, LLC v Peerless Ins. Co., </em>717 F3d 114, 118 [2d Cir 2013].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">We accepted certification (21 NY3d 975 [2013]) and now answer the question yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">\u201c[A]n agreement which modifies the Statute of Limitations by specifying a shorter, <em>but reasonable, </em>period within which to commence an action is enforceable\u201d <em>(John J. Kassner &amp; Co. v City of New York, </em>46 NY2d 544, 551 [1979] [emphasis added]). We conclude that the contractual period at issue here\u2014two years from the date of \u201cdirect physical loss or damage\u201d (i.e., from the date of the fire)\u2014is not reasonable if, as the Second Circuit\u2019s question requires us to assume, the property cannot reasonably be replaced within two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">It is true, as the District Court pointed out, that there is nothing inherently unreasonable about a two-year period of limitation. In fact, we have enforced contractual limitation periods of one year <em>(Blitman Constr. Corp. v Insurance Co. of N. Am., </em>66 NY2d 820 [1985]; <em>Sapinkopf v Cunard S.S. Co., Ltd., </em>254 NY 111, 114 [1930]) and six months <em>(Continental Leather Co. v Liverpool, Brazil &amp; Riv. Plate Steam Nav. Co., </em>259 NY 621 [1932]; <em>Aron &amp; Co. v Panama R.R. Co., </em>255 NY 513, 519 [1931]; <em>see also John J. Kassner, </em>46 NY2d at 552). The problem with the limitation period in this case is not its duration, but its accrual date. It is neither fair nor reasonable to require a suit within two years from the date of the loss, while imposing a condition precedent to the suit\u2014in this case, completion of replacement of the property\u2014that cannot be met within that two-year period. A \u201climitation period\u201d that expires before suit can be brought is not really a limitation period at all, but simply a nullification of the claim. It is true that nothing required defendant to insure plaintiff for replacement cost in excess of actual cash value, but having chosen to do so defendant may not insist on a \u201climitation period\u201d that renders the coverage valueless when the repairs are time-consuming.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>We have found no case in which we have squarely held that an otherwise reasonable limitation period may be rendered unreasonable by an inappropriate accrual date. We think, however, that the law was correctly stated in Judge Crane\u2019s dissenting opinion in <em>Continental Leather Co.: </em>\u201c[T]he period of time within which an action must be brought . . . should be fair and reasonable, in view of the circumstances of each particular case. . . . The circumstances, not the time, must be the determining factor\u201d (259 NY at 622-623). While that rule was stated in a dissent, the majority, in affirming without opinion, apparently disagreed not with the principle but with its application to the case. The Appellate Division opinion that we affirmed in <em>Continental Leather </em>stated essentially the same rule in saying that the issue was whether the plaintiff had \u201ca reasonable opportunity to commence its action within the period of limitation\u201d <em>(Continental Leather Co. v Liverpool, Brazil &amp; Riv. Plate Steam Nav. Co., Ltd., </em>234 App Div 386, 387 [2d Dept 1932]).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><em>Blitman </em>also supports our holding here. In that case, we enforced an agreed-upon 12-month limitation period, rejecting the insured\u2019s argument that it was \u201ccommercially unreasonable\u201d under the circumstances (66 NY2d at 823). But in doing so, we pointed out that the policy enabled the insured to \u201cprotect itself by . . . beginning an action before expiration of the limitation period\u201d <em>(id.). </em>Here, the insured did begin an action on the last day of the limitation period\u2014and the insurer successfully argued that that action was brought too soon. It is unreasonable for it now to say, as it in substance does, that a day later would have been too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Accordingly, the question certified should be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<judges id=\"b591-6\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Graffeo, Read, Pigott, Rivera and Abdus-Salaam concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Following certification of a question by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and acceptance of the question by this Court pursuant to section 500.27 of this Court\u2019s Rules of Practice, and after hearing argument by counsel for the parties and consideration of the briefs and the record submitted, certified question answered in the affirmative.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
