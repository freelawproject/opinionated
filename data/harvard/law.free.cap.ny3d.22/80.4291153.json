In light of the terms of the settlement in this case, we conclude that the carrier is entitled to offset the full amount of the settlement proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">In late 2004, claimant Beth <em>V. </em>was employed at the Cass Residential Center, a secure juvenile detention facility operated by the State of New York\u2019s Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS) in Rensselaerville, New York <em>(see </em>Executive Law art 19-G; Family Ct Act art 3). Beth V was hired by OCFS as a youth division aide and was assigned to work in the kitchen. M.E., a male resident, was given kitchen duty as part of a facility work program. On December 23, 2004, when M.E. momentarily stepped away from the dining room, Beth V confiscated a notebook that he had brought with him to the kitchen. According to Beth <em>V., </em>she took away the notebook because M.E. had told her that he was writing notes about her of a sexual nature, and had made crude, sexually explicit gestures. She gave the notebook to the youth division aide on duty, and M.E. \u201cthrew a fit\u201d when he discovered this. After this incident, Beth V claims to have told various supervisors and OCFS employees that she felt \u201cunsafe, uncomfortable and fearful of physical and sexual harm\u201d from M.E.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">On December 28, 2004 at 5:50 p.m., near the end of her shift, Beth V was in an office off the kitchen, logging out from work, with her back to the door. M.E. accosted Beth V from behind, taking her by surprise. He choked, punched and raped her at knifepoint. After forcing Beth V to turn over the keys to her jeep, he abducted her from Camp Cass. But when M.E. stopped in Albany to make a phone call at a pay phone, he left Beth V in the jeep with the keys in the ignition. Beth V escaped to a local police station where she reported what had happened to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">As a consequence of M.E.\u2019s attack, Beth V suffered physical and mental injuries. She made a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and by a decision filed on April 24, 2008, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law Judge (WCLJ) adjudged Beth <em>V. </em>to be permanently partially disabled as a result of work-related injuries to her back, head, neck, left hand, right foot and teeth, as well as rape, post-traumatic stress symptoms and consequential low back injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">In the meantime, on March 5, 2007, Beth V filed a lawsuit in federal court against OCFS and three supervisory OCFS employees (collectively, defendants). She claimed that defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>knew or should have known about M.E.\u2019s \u201chistory of being assaultive towards women and carrying knives,\u201d and the \u201cgang-related customs\u201d practiced by Camp Cass\u2019s residents, including \u201cmisogynistic statements, gestures and conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">As a first cause of action, Beth V alleged in her amended complaint that the individual defendants denied her civil rights pursuant to 42 USC \u00a7 1983 by various omissions in the training and supervision of OCFS and/or Camp Cass employees, causing her to suffer \u201cphysical injuries, pain and mental suffering, embarrassment, humiliation and fear, and to incur expenses for medical care, and deprivation of her liberty.\u201d As a second cause of action, Beth V alleged a hostile work environment in violation of the Human Rights Law, Executive Law \u00a7 290 <em>et seq., </em>created by M.E.\u2019s \u201cunwelcome sexual comments, threats and contact,\u201d which the defendants caused her to endure, resulting in \u201cpsychological, mental and emotional damages.\u201d As a third cause of action, Beth V alleged that OCFS violated 42 USC \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>by failing to investigate and remedy M.E.\u2019s \u201charassing and inappropriate conduct . . . toward her,\u201d and as a result she suffered physical, psychological, mental and emotional damages; and for a fourth cause of action, again grounded in the state Human Rights Law, she alleged that OCFS had knowledge of M.E.\u2019s harassment of her, inadequately investigated her complaints and so acquiesced in and effectively condoned M.E.\u2019s \u201cdiscriminatory conduct,\u201d again causing her to suffer physical, psychological, mental and emotional damages. Beth V demanded compensatory damages from OCFS and the individual defendants, punitive damages from the individual defendants, attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 USC \u00a7 1988 and such further relief as the court deemed proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">In addition to denying the operative allegations of Beth V\u2019s complaint, defendants interposed, among other defenses, that the complaint failed to state a cause of action, the individually named defendants were entitled to qualified immunity, Beth V\u2019s injuries resulted from an intervening cause, the complaint was barred by the Eleventh Amendment and, since defendants were not personally involved in the alleged constitutional or statutory violations, there was no liability under 42 USC \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The federal lawsuit was settled by a stipulation and order of discontinuance filed on May 14, 2008, a week after the close of discovery, for \u201cthe sum of $650,000 in <em>compensatory damages </em>in full settlement of any and all claims, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs\u201d (emphasis added) arising from or in any way related to M.E.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>attack on Beth <em>Y. </em>The stipulation further recited in paragraph 10 that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\">\u201c[t]he parties acknowledge that [Beth V]\u2019s claim includes claims for <em>personal injuries of a physical nature </em>and that <em>the entire settlement sum is allocated to [her] personal physical injuries and the loss of enjoyment of life and emotional response related thereto. </em>The parties further acknowledge that the settlement payment is for <em>personal physical injuries as set forth in Internal Revenue Code Sec. 104(a)(2)\u201d </em>(emphases added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Section 104 (a) (2) excludes from an individual\u2019s gross income \u201cthe amount of any damages (other than punitive damages) received (whether by suit or agreement and whether as lump sums or as periodic payments) on account of personal physical injuries or physical sickness.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">After payments of roughly $220,500 ($218,000 in attorney\u2019s fees and $2,500 to satisfy the New York State Crime Victims Board\u2019s lien),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Beth V netted about $430,000 from the settlement. By letter dated May 6, 2008, the New York State Insurance Fund (SIF), the workers\u2019 compensation carrier in this case, approved the settlement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In so doing, SIF waived its lien<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> against the settlement proceeds, but reserved its right under Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (4) to take a credit against Beth V\u2019s future benefits in the amount of her net recovery. SIF announced that it would make no additional payments of benefits after September 3, 2008 until this credit was exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Beth V protested the cutoff of compensation payments at a hearing on October 17, 2008, when the stipulation\u2019s terms were placed on the record. Beth V took the position that SIF was not entitled to a credit because she sued for damages to compensate a deprivation of civil rights; that in her federal lawsuit she alleged discrimination and creation of a hostile work environment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>which \u201cdemonstrates that such constitutional claims are in a different category from those to which WCL \u00a7 29 is normally directed [because] insofar as she was allowed to sue her employer without running afoul of WCL \u00a7 ll\u2019s exclusivity provision[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] the offset provisions should be treated differently as well\u201d; and that the credit was intended to prevent a double recovery for wage benefits whereas Beth V\u2019s injuries \u201cderive in part from violations of civil rights amendments to the United States Constitution, and the settlement she negotiated involved demands for punitive relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">SIF contended that the settlement resolved a third-party action within the meaning of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (1), entitling it to a credit against future payments for the full amount of Beth V\u2019s recovery. Citing <em>Matter of Petterson v Daystrom Corp. </em>(17 NY2d 32 [1966]), <em>Dietrick v Kemper Ins. Co. (American Motorists Ins. Co.) </em>(76 NY2d 248 [1990]) and <em>Hanford v Plaza Packaging Corp. </em>(2 NY3d 348 [2004]), SIF espoused the position that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">\u201cwhere the employer and/or co-employees are accused of intentional torts, the claimant/plaintiff has the right to sue these parties, since the workers\u2019 compensation remedy exclusivity defense does not apply, and to collect workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Thus, as the employer and co-employees are treated as third parties in these cases, WCL Section 29 applies in order to prevent the claimant/plaintiff from receiving a double recovery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">By decision filed on January 29, 2009, the WCLJ decided that SIF was not entitled to offset the proceeds of a civil rights lawsuit that sought punitive damages. The WCLJ\u2019s decision seems to have been informed, in part, by his view that a civil rights lawsuit was not a tort action, or at least was not treated the same as other intentional torts for purposes of section 29. SIF appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>In a decision filed on June 11, 2009, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board (the Board) found that a suit against an employer is a third-party action within the meaning of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (1); nothing bars the Board\u2019s application of section 29 (4) to a claimant\u2019s recovery in a federal civil rights lawsuit; and SIF was only entitled to claim a credit against so much of the settlement as compensated Beth V \u201cfor the same injuries which were the basis for the award of compensation.\u201d Finding the record inadequate to apply this last principle, the Board returned the case to the trial calendar. The Board instructed the parties to \u201cproduce evidence of how [Beth V\u2019s] net proceeds from her third-party action were allocated between the types of damages sought,\u201d and directed the WCLJ to \u201cdetermine the amount of the net recovery which compensated [Beth V] for her established physical and psychological injuries and the medical expenses for those injuries, and make a finding that the carrier is entitled to a credit for that amount pursuant to WCL \u00a7 29.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">At the hearing on remand, the attorney who represented Beth V in federal court testified about the nature of that lawsuit and the settlement. He explained that Beth V came to him to explore her options for \u201cbringing an action against her employer, co-employees concerning an event. . . that occurred at Camp Cass in Rensselaerville in which she was . . . first raped and attacked and then kidnapped by one of the [residents].\u201d He testified that although \u201ca number of different cause[s] of action[ ] were stated,\u201d the \u201cprimary [claim] was for the deprivation of her constitutional right[s] by virtue of the violation of her right to substantive due process\u201d; and \u201ca 42 USC 1983 action was the primary claim where the constitutional deprivation was alleged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">When asked if the settlement was allocated in any way, the attorney replied</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">\u201cfrom the four corners of the document itself you really can\u2019t determine that. But the nature of the claim was ... a constitutional deprivation. [She] was kidnapped. Her Liberty interest was compromised as a result of the allegations that we made. And paragraph ten was very important in the sense that under the Internal Revenue Code 104 ... if we had strictly a civil rights claim, the award could potentially be taxable. If there is a claim for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>violation of civil rights and the person has some physical injury, then you can allocate the recovery entirely towards Section 104, which is a non-taxable provision for pain and suffering . . . Clearly [Beth V] had physical injury. But ... if you\u2019re asking me what the thrust of the claim was, the thrust of the claim was for her - the constitutional deprivation, her Liberty interest being deprived, the emotional response to the event. The physical injuries [were] a component, yes. Was it a major component? No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">He added that wage loss and medical expenses \u201cwere perhaps a strategic part of the case\u201d that he \u201cnever had to use\u201d and, in any event, any such damages would have been \u201cbacked out\u201d from Beth V\u2019s gross recovery under the collateral source rule and so \u201cmeant nothing to her as far as the bottom line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">On cross-examination, Beth V\u2019s attorney was pressed to explain where in the stipulation there was any expression that the payments were made for something other than Beth V\u2019s personal injuries. He pointed to the statement in paragraph 10 that Beth V was being compensated, in part, for \u201closs of enjoyment of life and emotional response,\u201d which he attributed to \u201cher deprivation of her liberty and all the constitutional deprivations that she suffered in the context of this event.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The attorney acknowledged there was no reference in the stipulation to punitive damages, stating \u201c[w]as there a punitive aspect to the settlement and our claim, absolutely. Was it characterized in the settlement agreement as punitive damages per se, no.\u201d SIF did not call any witnesses, but rather submitted a letter from the Assistant Attorney General who had represented the State in the federal action. This letter simply stated that punitive damages were not involved in the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">In a decision filed on August 9, 2010, the WCLJ opined that, contrary to the Board\u2019s decision, a lawsuit against an employer and coemployees was not a third-party action within the meaning of section 29 (1) and, in any event, the settlement resolved claims \u201cfor violation of [Beth V\u2019s] civil and constitutional rights, recovery not included in Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29.\u201d SIF again appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">In a decision filed on December 23, 2010, the Board found in SIF\u2019s favor, allowing it to take a credit against the whole of the settlement proceeds. Citing <em>Petterson </em>and <em>Hanford, </em>the Board observed that \u201ca civil lawsuit against an employer or a person in the same employ for sexual harassment or [other] intentional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>tort is a third-party action to which WCL \u00a7 29 applies.\u201d The Board also noted that under section 29 (1), a carrier has a lien \u201con the proceeds of <em>any </em>recoveryand turning to the facts, that \u201c[t]he damage award resulting from the settlement . . . [was] the result of the same injuries arising from the compensation claim.\u201d The Board went on to suggest there was no distinction between categories of damages that might be encompassed within a claimant\u2019s settlement anyway, citing section 29 (1)\u2019s \u201cany recovery\u201d language and the Appellate Division\u2019s decisions in <em>Matter of Simmons v St. Lawrence County CDP </em>(147 AD2d 323 [3d Dept 1989] [carrier\u2019s offset rights apply to any recovery by a claimant in a third-party action with the exception of benefits in lieu of \u201cfirst-party benefits\u201d which the no-fault insurer would have been obligated to pay]) and <em>Matter of Parmelee v International Paper Co. </em>(157 AD2d 878 [3d Dept 1990] [stating that whether the claimant\u2019s third-party settlement purported to be for pain and suffering was irrelevant in light of the \u201cany recovery\u201d language]). Having previously remanded the case for a determination of how the settlement was allocated as to types of damages, the Board invoked \u201cits WCL \u00a7 123 continuing jurisdiction\u201d to the extent its findings were inconsistent with its prior decision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Beth <em>V. </em>appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The Appellate Division affirmed (98 AD3d 1200 [3d Dept 2012]). The court held that \u201c[w]hen a claimant obtains recovery in a civil action for the same injuries that were the predicate for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, the carrier has a lien against any recovery, even where the action is brought against an employer or a co-employee\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 1201 [citations omitted]). And here, the Appellate Division continued, the settlement stipulation and the testimony of Beth V.\u2019s attorney supplied substantial evidence to support \u201cthe Board\u2019s conclusion that the injuries for which claimant recovered in the settlement were the same injuries for which workers\u2019 compensation benefits were awarded\u201d <em>(id.). </em>We granted Beth <em>Y. </em>leave to appeal (20 NY3d 857 [2013]), and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">IL</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (1) provides that an employee injured by \u201cthe negligence or wrong of another not in the same employ\u201d may commence an action against \u201csuch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>other.\u201d If the employee has received workers\u2019 compensation benefits, SIF or the other entity or person liable for the payment of these benefits</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">\u201cshall have a lien on the proceeds of any recovery from such other, whether by judgment, settlement or otherwise, after the deduction of the reasonable and necessary expenditures, including attorney\u2019s fees, incurred in effecting such recovery, to the extent of the total amount of compensation awarded under or provided or estimated . . . for such case and the expenses for medical treatment paid or to be paid by it and to such extent such recovery shall be deemed for the benefit of\u2019 SIF or the other entity or person liable for the payment of compensation benefits (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 [1]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALl\">Concomitantly, section 29 (4) specifies that \u201c[i]f such injured employee . . . [shall] proceed against such other,\u201d SIF or the other entity or person liable for the payment of compensation benefits \u201cshall contribute only the deficiency, if any, between the amount of the recovery against such other person actually collected, and the compensation provided or estimated . . . for such case\u201d (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 [4]).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Section 29 (4) is referred to as the carrier\u2019s credit against or right to offset the proceeds of a lawsuit brought pursuant to section 29 (1). The lien and offset provisions in section 29 (1) and (4), respectively, \u201ccushion[ ] the inflationary impact of the cost of compensation insurance and avoid[ ] double recovery by the claimant for the same predicate injury\u201d <em>(Matter of Granger v Urda, </em>44 NY2d 91, 97-98 [1978]). Additionally, the statute \u201cshift[s] the burden of paying compensation from the carrier or self-insured employer to the party actually responsible for . . . the same injury as the settlement of the third-party action\u201d <em>(Matter of Murphy v New York City Police Dept., </em>270 AD2d 733, 733-734 [3d Dept 2000]).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Beth <em>V. </em>contends that Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (4), the only recoupment provision at issue here since SIF waived its lien, does not apply when the injured employee recovers in a lawsuit against his employer or a fellow employee rather than a third party. She relies on the language stating that Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (1) provides for satisfaction of the carrier\u2019s lien when the employee recovers for injuries caused by \u201canother not in the same employ\u201d from the proceeds of a lawsuit against \u201csuch other\u201d; and that Workers\u2019 Compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Law \u00a7 29 (4) limits the carrier\u2019s obligation to the deficiency between the compensation benefits awarded and the recovery from \u201csuch other person.\u201d We rejected the selfsame arguments almost 50 years ago in <em>Petterson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Einar Petterson, who was returning from an out-of-state work assignment in an automobile leased by his employer and driven by a coemployee, died when the automobile crashed into a tree in Connecticut. His estate brought a wrongful death action in federal court in Connecticut against the driver and the automobile leasing company, which impleaded Petterson\u2019s employer. The action eventually settled, and the employer\u2019s carrier sought to have the net proceeds of the settlement credited against its obligations to make future compensation payments to Petterson\u2019s survivors. The Board turned down the claim on the ground the settlement did not resolve a third-party action within the meaning of section 29 since the lawsuit was against Petterson\u2019s coemployee, not \u201canother not in the same employ.\u201d A divided Appellate Division affirmed, and we reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">We observed that \u201c[a] mechanical reading\u201d of section 29 \u201cwould seem to support the board\u2019s view and require an affirmance,\u201d but that we were not \u201cbound to accord a literal interpretation to this language if to do so would lead to an egregiously unjust or unreasonable result\u201d (Petterson, 17 NY2d at 38). We also noted that since section 29 (6) made workers\u2019 compensation the exclusive remedy where the wrongdoer is a fellow employee <em>(see </em>n 5, <em>supra), </em>it was \u201c[q]uite natural[ ]\u201d for the legislature, when \u201caddressing] itself to the possibility of a recovery at law for the same injuries, ... to describe the basis for that lawsuit as tortious conduct by \u2018another not in the same employ\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at 38-39). We therefore held that \u201c[s]ection 29, read in its entirety and in context, clearly reveals a legislative design to provide for reimbursement of the compensation carrier <em>whenever a recovery is obtained in tort for the same injury that was a predicate for the payment of compensation benefits,\u201d </em>remarking that \u201c[i]t would be unreasonable to read the statute as mandating a different result merely because the recovery came out of the pockets of a coemployee and not from the resources of a stranger\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 39 [internal quotation marks omitted and emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">We have never deviated from this position. Most recently, while holding that the exclusivity provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law did not preclude an employee from bringing an action against a fellow employee for intentional wrongdoing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>we cautioned that our decision did not mean that the employee could recover twice for the same injuries; specifically, \u201c[t]o the extent that [the employee] recovers damages from [the coemployee] her recovery may be subject to recoupment by the workers\u2019 compensation carrier, <em>as with any recovery by a workers\u2019 compensation claimant against a third party,\u201d </em>citing Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (1) <em>(Hanford, </em>2 NY3d at 351 n 3 [emphasis added]). The plaintiff in <em>Hanford </em>alleged violations of the state Human Rights Law by a coworker.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Beth <em>Y. </em>and the dissent contend that the offset provision in section 29 (4) does not apply because the \u201cconstitutional deprivations\u201d that she suffered are distinct from the physical and mental injuries for which SIF was paying compensation benefits. In particular, Beth <em>Y </em>emphasizes that her federal lawsuit sought punitive damages. The Appellate Division has stressed that it is \u201cthe character or nature of the compensation benefits for which the lien is sought and not . . . the character or nature of the claimant\u2019s recovery in the third-party action\u201d that is important <em>(Simmons, </em>147 AD2d at 325-326). But here, we need not and do not decide whether a carrier is entitled to offset a claimant\u2019s recovery of punitive damages. The stipulation alone supplies substantial evidence that the settlement proceeds were intended to compensate Beth V for the personal physical and mental injuries she suffered at the hands of M.E.\u2014 i.e., the same injuries for which she was awarded compensation benefits. The settlement may have been structured as it was solely to afford Beth <em>Y </em>a presumed tax advantage, but the Board was certainly entitled to rely on the stipulation\u2019s unambiguous terms. Moreover, the first cause of action in the federal lawsuit was essentially a common-law claim for negligent supervision, even though pleaded as a section 1983 claim in order to fall within the exception from exclusivity for intentional torts. And the other causes of action turned on the sexually abusive conduct of M.E.; unlike <em>Hanford, </em>there are no allegations that the individually named defendants committed intentional torts violating Beth V\u2019s civil rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-8\">.

Section 11 provides that, once the employer\u2019s liability for providing workers\u2019 compensation benefits is established, the employee cannot sue the employer for damages sustained from the injury or death that arose out of and in the course of the employment, unless one of a few exceptions applies (see <em>also </em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 [6] [providing that workers\u2019 compensation benefits are the exclusive remedy when an employee is injured or killed through the negligence of a coemployee]).

I disagree that a settlement of statutory and constitutional civil rights claims, including claims of conduct that led to harm other than personal injuries, may be credited against a workers\u2019 compensation award under Workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (4). To the extent the majority authorizes the State Insurance Fund to take a credit against proceeds that were not associated with the physical and mental injuries suffered as a proximate result of Beth V\u2019s assault, rape, and kidnapping, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The State Insurance Fund demands a credit under Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (4) against the settlement of Beth V\u2019s federal lawsuit for the assault, rape, and kidnapping she suffered while employed by the State. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Board had ordered the carrier to pay benefits for Beth V\u2019s \u201cinjury to the right foot, rape and post-traumatic stress disorder\u201d as well as \u201cteeth and consequential [lower] back [injuries].\u201d The carrier now claims that a credit from Beth V\u2019s settlement proceeds would avoid a double recovery for the same injuries. However, because the claimant\u2019s federal lawsuit asserted claims which were part of the settlement, but which were not compensated by workers\u2019 compensation, those claims should remain beyond the reach of the carrier\u2019s statutory credit. To hold otherwise is to extend the coverage of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law beyond its intended application, and to deny the claimant settlement proceeds for harms that are independent of the harms remedied by workers\u2019 compensation insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The federal complaint alleged, among other things, claims of a hostile workplace and gender-based discrimination that preceded Beth V\u2019s assault, rape, and kidnapping. The parties entered a \u201cfull settlement of any and all claims.\u201d The attorney who represented Beth V in the federal lawsuit testified that the settlement resolved civil rights and constitutional claims apart from the personal injury claims. Notably, the State Attorney General gave no accounting of the settlement, averring only that it did not include punitive damages. Given that this was a global settlement, and the lack of accounting from the State, it cannot be said with certainty that substantial record evidence supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that the settlement compensated Beth V for the same injuries compensated by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Law does not contemplate compensation for injuries to a person\u2019s civil rights. Instead, it applies to \u201cdisability or death from injury arising out of and in the course of . . . employment\u201d (Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 10 [1]). The complaint asserted claims for harms separate and apart from Beth V\u2019s personal injuries, and the settlement resolved those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>I would reverse and remand for the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board to develop a more robust factual record.</p>\n<judges id=\"b166-5\">Chief Judge Lippman and Judges Graffeo, Smith, Pigott and Abdus-Salaam concur with Judge Read; Judge Rivera dissents and votes to reverse in an opinion.</judges>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
