The answer to the question depends upon the meaning to be ascribed to the words \u201cfinal judgment\u201d as those words are used in the statute which permits an \u201cappeal . . . from a final judgment entered in an action ...\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 963, subd. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">The common law allowed an appeal only after final decision, i.e.', after the last of all possible decisions in the progress of an action <em>(Metcalfe\u2019s Case, </em>11 Coke 38a [1614]). This rule followed by Chief Justice Marshall in 1835 in the ease of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>9 Pet. (U.S.) 267, 272 [9 L.Ed. 124], is likewise the rule in California. <em>(Gunder </em>v. <em>Gunder, </em>208 Cal. 559 [282 P. 794].) The reason back of the rule as stated by Chief Justice Marshall is to prevent the delay and expense incident to repeated trials of error on appeal from various decisions reached, in the progress of an action, and to have instead one trial of error on appeal from final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">Appellant contends that the judgment should be regarded as a final\" judgment despite the fact that the trial court des<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>ignated it as interlocutory, because the finality of the judgment appears from the imperative form of its provisions, as for instance, that \u201cdefendant shall forthwith return and deliver to plaintiff\u201d certain personal property. The short answer to the contention is that the trial court would exceed its jurisdiction if it attempted to enforce the provision, if the judgment is interlocutory rather than final. That the judgment must be regarded as being interlocutory we think is plain under the controlling decisions in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The case before us is not distinguishable in its material facts from that of <em>Gunder </em>v. <em>Gunder, </em>208 Cal. 559 [282 P. 794]. In that case, as in this, the interlocutory judgment purported to decide all the issues except to determine by means of an accounting the amount due from one of the parties to the other. As this involved a further decree in \u25a0that case it was held the judgment was not final and hence not appealable. The same is true here.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Some of the seeming exceptions to the general rule in the decisions of this state, to which our attention is called by appellants are not exceptions to the rule, as we view them, \u25a0and at all events are distinguishable and not applicable here. Among the cases thus cited to us are <em>Zappettini </em>v. <em>Buckles, </em>167 Cal. 27 [138 P. 696], and <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Dunnam, </em>46 Cal. 204. In distinguishing these two cases from the case it had before it the Supreme Court said in the Gunder case: \u201cIt is contended by the appellant that the judgment is a final judgment in accordance with the rule stated in the case of <em>Zappettini </em>v. <em>Buckles, </em>167 Cal. 27 [138 P. 696]. As stated by the court in that case, however, the decree there was similar to the decree from which an appeal was taken in the case of <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Dunnam, </em>46 Cal. 204, and the decision of the latter case was followed by the court in the Zappettini case. In neither of those cases did the decree involve a reference for an accounting, but in each case it ordered a sale of property and specified the distribution to be made of the proceeds. There .was therefore in those cases <em>no further judicial action </em>required on the part of the court to adjudicate finally the rights of the parties.\u201d (Italics supplied.) Later in <em>Hollar </em>v. <em>Saline Products, Inc., </em>3 Cal.2d 80, 82 [43 P.2d 273], it was said: \u201cIn the Di Blasi case, <em>supra, </em>this court affirmed the ruling in the Gunder case and said (p. 754) that an earlier case <em>(Zappettini </em>v. <em>Buckles, </em>167 Cal. 27 [138 P. 696]) might be distinguished \u2018but even if this were not so, said case would have to be considered as modified to conform to the holdings\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>referred to, i.e., the Gunder case.\u201d Accordingly, it follows from the holdings in these cases that we may not entertain the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The motion to dismiss the appeal is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
