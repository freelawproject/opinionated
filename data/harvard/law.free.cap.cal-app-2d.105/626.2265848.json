Proc., \u00a7 1060) in any case where its declaration or determination is not necessary or proper at the time under all the circumstances. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1061.)</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Mr. Justice Wilson, speaking for this court in <em>Pacific Electric Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Dewey, </em>95 Cal.App.2d 69, 71 [212 P.2d 255], thus accurately declares the rules:</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">\u201cThe entertainment of an action for declaratory relief is within the discretionary power of the court (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1061) and is not reviewable upon appeal except for an abuse of discretion. (Citing cases.) Permission to resort to declaratory relief is a matter of sound discretion of the court.  Such an action is usually unnecessary where an adequate remedy exists under some other form of action (citing cases) . . .\u201d (See, also, <em>Cutting </em>v. <em>Bryan, </em>206 Cal. 254, 257 [274 P. 326].)</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">The foregoing rules are applicable to the facts of the present case. Plaintiff had an entirely adequate remedy in the actions in which he was endeavoring to take the depositions by applying to the trial court, pursuant to the provisions of section 1991, Code of Civil Procedure, for an order requiring the witnesses to answer the questions, and if upon the trial court\u2019s determination that such questions should be answered, they refused to do so, the trial judge could have punished them for contempt of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">Such procedure afforded plaintiff a speedy and adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>remedy. Therefore the trial court properly sustained the demurrer in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Moore, P. J., and Wilson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied September 20, 1951.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
