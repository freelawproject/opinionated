The same information also included a third defendant, one De Meo who testified for the prosecution. The information as to De Meo was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>It is contended on appe\u00e1l that, \u201cThe only eye witness testimony with respect to the commission of the crime came from the Ups of Joseph De Meo, the self-confessed accomplice, who testified on behalf of the prosecution in exchange for a dismissal of the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u201cThe principal point which wiU be raised on this appeal is whether or not the independent evidence other than that of the accomplice is sufficient to constitute the corroboration required by law. It is the position of this defendant that the accomplice\u2019s testimony was not legally and sufficiently corroborated and that there is no evidence of the corpus delicti with respect to this defendant, except that found in the uncorroborated testimony of the accomplice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The evidence reveals that a clothing store in San Pedro was entered by cutting a hole in the ceiUng. Quantities of men\u2019s clothing including suits, slacks, neckties, etc., were removed. The corpus delicti was established beyond question. The only question on appeal is whether the evidence is sufficient to corroborate the testimony of the accomplice. Respondent summarizes that evidence as follows, which is supported by the record, \u201cThe above independent evidence shows, we submit, that the appellant had in his possession shortly after the crime here, articles which were taken during the burglary. Particularly considering his inconsistent and necessarily false statements concerning where he got them, and his denial to the officer that he had sold the suede jacket, the jury was justified in finding that his \u2018explanations\u2019 of how they innocently came into his possession, were untrue, and that such statements indicated a consciousness of guilt of the burglary with which he knew he was charged. Such evidence, we submit, sufficiently corroborated the testimony of the accomplice as to the burglary and the appellant\u2019s aiding and abetting therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">\u201cThe appellant\u2019s inconsistent statements concerning his residence in San Pedro, the town in which the burglary was perpetrated, and his statement, which the jury was justified in finding, in the light of Mr. Kanaster\u2019s testimony to the contrary, to be false, to the effect that he had never made a purchase in the Kanaster store, were further corroboration of the testimony of the accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The corroborating evidence was sufficient. The judgment and order denying motion for new trial are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
