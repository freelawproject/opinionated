As recited in appellant\u2019s brief, \u201cThis is an action by Plaintiffs, sellers of certain real estate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-15\">\u201c(a) To compel specific performance of a purported purchase agreement for real estate (for the sum of $45,000.00);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>\u201c (b) To require the payment of $4,500.00 brokerage fee into Court by the bank holding same;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-6\">\u201c (c) For $50.00 per month rental for the property pending the Court\u2019s decision, and following Plaintiff's Notice of Rescission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-7\">\u201cDefendant and Cross-Complainant R. L. P. Smith served a Notice of Rescission upon the Plaintiff before the action was commenced, which fact is alleged in the Third Amended Cross-Complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-8\">\u201cDefendant R. L. P. Smith answered and filed a Cross-Complaint against the brokers doing business as Charles B. Hopper Associates, and against the Security-First National Bank for rescission to recover the deposit of $4,500.00 cash made by Defendant and Cross-Complainant. This Cross-Complaint was amended three times, and it is the Third Amended Cross-Complaint which is before the Court on appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-9\">\u2018 \u2018 Cross-Defendants Charles B. Hopper Associates demurred specifically to both causes of action in the Third Amended Cross-Complaint on the ground that neither cause of action set forth facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and upon the ground of uncertainty. The trial court sustained the Demurrer without leave to amend.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">Briefly, it appears from the cross-complaint that the Charles B. Hopper Associates represented the seller in the transaction. The cross-complaint alleges, as correctly recited in appellant\u2019s brief, that Smith visited the seller\u2019s broker and stated, \u201cThat he wanted to buy a place that was immediately contiguous to unimproved and unrestricted terrain where he could ride his horse; that he wanted to buy a place that was immediately contiguous to unimproved and unrestricted terrain approachable without having to ride over paved streets or restricted private property; that he wanted unimproved and unrestricted hill country where there would be no interference or <em>restrictions </em>by fences or <em>private estates.\u201d </em>The cross-complaint further alleges that in reply to Smith\u2019s statement, \u201cThat Defendants had exactly what this Cross-Complainant wanted; that it was made to order for Cross-Complainant\u2019s use; that it complied with all of Cross-Complainant\u2019s requirements as this Cross-Complainant had stated his requirements and described his needs to the said R. V. Crowe (the broker) which are particularly set forth in Paragraph VI hereof.\u201d Thee cross-complaint further alleges that appellant then drove to the area where the property described by the broker was located and it appeared from the highway, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>\u20181 That the said contiguous land appeared from its exposure toward said highway to be extensive, wild, and unimproved and unrestricted terrain suitable for horseback riding, and that said contiguous land then and there appeared to satisfy and comply with all of Cross-Complainant\u2019s said requirements as described to said brokers by this Cross-Complainant, and as set forth in Paragraph VI hereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">\u2018 \u2018 That said contiguous land was covered with trees and wild shrubbery. That as viewed by this Cross-Complainant from the highway as aforesaid, Cross-Complainant did not and could not see any houses or other buildings or improvements upon said contiguous land. That thereupon this Cross-Complainant went to the office of the said Charles B. Hopper Associates and signed the purported \u2018Purchase Agreement\u2019. It is further alleged that appellant relied upon the statements of the broker, but \u201cThat shortly thereafter this Cross-Complainant returned to said premises and walked over the said contiguous land, portions thereof being concealed from the highway by the contours of the land and by trees and shrubbery, and that this Cross-Complainant thereupon discovered and learned for the first time that behind said trees and concealed behind the said contours of the land were numerous private estates and property and improvements, none of which could be observed or seen from said highway, and learned that all of said contiguous land was privately owned land, restricted and not available for passage nor for use for horseback riding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">It will be seen from the foregoing that the purchaser was more interested in the character of the \u201ccontiguous land\u201d than the property sold, which was about 1% acres. And the cause of action is based upon the alleged misrepresentations as to the contiguous land, not the land purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">It is respondents\u2019 contention that \u201cThe third amended Cross-Complaint failed to state a cause of action because it showed on its face that appellant did not rely and could not properly have relied on any alleged misrepresentations or mistakes as to whether or not there were houses and fences on the contiguous property.\u201d Respondent cites 16 California cases in connection with the argument relating to the above contention. All of these cited cases are appeals from the judgment following a trial. There can be no controversy as to such phases of the within action at this time.  The appeal herein is from an order sustaining a demurrer and it is well settled that for the purpose of determining the sole issue in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>such circumstances, the allegations of the complaint must be accepted as true. <em>(Carruth </em>v. <em>Fritch, </em>36 Cal.2d 426 [224 P.2d 702] ; <em>Schaffer </em>v. <em>Kerber, </em>105 Cal.App.2d 645 [234 P.2d 109] (filed July 26, 1951).)  There can be no question that appellant\u2019s complaint states a cause of action and if at the trial the facts are established as alleged and appellant prevails, the evidence would, under the law, support the judgment. Such questions of fact may not be settled by demurrer. Indeed the evidence may include a \u201cview of the premises\u201d by the trial judge which definitely would be unwarranted in connection with the ruling on a demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">The judgment and order are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
