Under such circumstances it is clear that the juvenile court of Merced County had no jurisdiction either to order said children into custody or to make them wards of the juvenile court of Merced County because, under section 721 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, such jurisdiction is limited to minors found \u201cwithin the county or residing therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">As was said in <em>Guardianship of Casella, </em>133 Cal.App. 80, at page 82 [23 P.2d 782] :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">\u201cAs the minors were actually living in Contra Costa County and, as their legal residence was in that county while their mother resided there, both essentials of jurisdiction of the person of the minors placed that jurisdiction in the Juvenile Court of Contra Costa County and withheld it from the court of Santa Clara County.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">For the reasons hereinbefore set forth, it is therefore ordered that the minor children, Ronald William Lukasik and Kenneth Mathew Lukasik be discharged from the illegal detention and custody in which they are now held by respondents, Mr. and Mrs. Matheus Lukasik and the juvenile officer of Merced County, and committed forthwith to the custody of petitioner, and that they be delivered by the respondents to petitioner at her residence in Fresno.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
