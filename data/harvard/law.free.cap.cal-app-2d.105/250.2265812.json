No new evidence was offered at the hearing in superior court, the matter being submitted upon the record of the proceedings before the board, together with written briefs and oral argument of the parties hereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">According to' the appellant\u2019s brief, appellant\u2019s license was issued on December 17, 1945. On July 8, 1949, appellant was charged with a violation of section 2377 of the Business and Professions Code in the procuring and performing of a criminal abortion upon the person of one Gayle R\u00fabin on or about May 31, 1949. The respondent board found the appellant guilty as accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The record discloses that Gayle Rubin, a single girl aged about 20, was some five weeks pregnant when the appellant woman physician was first consulted. One Jean Warfield accompanied Miss Rubin on this first visit, at which time appellant, according to Gayle Rubin, set a price of $150, ordered Miss Rubin to take' a laxative and to return May 31, 1949, with $100; appellant would do the rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">On the designated day, accompanied by a boy friend, Miss Rubin went to appellant\u2019s office when according to the victim\u2019s testimony, the physician used some sort of liquid in a syringe. No scraping or cutting was felt but the girl felt a little pain and had some cramps. Thereafter, in response to a telephone call and due to the fact that Miss Rubin had been bleeding for two days, Dr. Bogart came to the patient\u2019s apartment, ordered everyone to leave the room and stated that there was nothing to worry about.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Dr. Walter Williams, who was called on June 4, 1949, diagnosed the trouble as \u201ca threatened or incomplete miscarriage with localized peritonitis.\u201d Miss Rubin was sent to the general hospital on June 5th; Dr. Donald J. Crawford there examined the girl and concluded that there had been a completed abortion following a criminal induction.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">Appellant denied the accusation; claimed to have first seen Miss Rubin at the latter\u2019s apartment on June 2d in response to a telephone call that a girl was sick and wanted a woman doctor; denied even making a pelvic examination, and claimed to have merely given the patient a business card with instructions \u201cto return tomorrow morning to my office for complete physical check-up and X-ray of the back be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>cause it was the only complaint at the time, that she told me a funny feeling in the hack and funny sensation in the legs.\u201d Appellant\u2019s son corroborated appellant\u2019s testimony that Dr. Bogart was at the son\u2019s house during the evenings of May 29, 30 and 31, 1949, and that the mother did not make any calls during that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">It is appellant\u2019s contention that \u201cThe decision is not supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record, nor by any evidence whatsoever.\u201d In this connection appellant argues that \u201cthe only evidence that an abortion had been attempted or committed by the appellant came from the lips of Gayle Rubin, the alleged victim.\u201d It is further contended that the diagnoses of Dr. Williams and of Dr. Crawford were based upon Miss Rubin\u2019s statement that a criminal abortion had been committed; that, in effect, the board ordered revocation of appellant\u2019s license \u201con the testimony of Miss Rubin alone corroborated only by hearsay evidence wherein the two physicians repeated what she had told them.\u201d Alleged discrepancies in Gayle Rubin\u2019s testimony are also pointed out and that \u201can analysis of Miss Rubin\u2019s testimony shows it to be of practically no value.\u201d The trial court\u2019s findings are said to be based upon only surmises in respect to the commission of the alleged act.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">It is elementary, as stated in <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, </em>32 Cal.2d 301, 308 [196 P.2d 20], that \u201cthe power of the appellate court begins and ends with a determination as to whether there is any <em>substantial </em>evidence, contradicted or uncontradicted, which will support the conclusion reached by the jury (or by a trial judge). When two or more inferences can be reasonably deduced from the facts, the reviewing court is without power to substitute its deductions for those of the trial court. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Under the rule as above stated, appellant\u2019s contentions in reference to alleged insufficiency of the evidence do not furnish ground for reversal of the trial court\u2019s findings. That these findings to the effect that appellant was guilty of the act charged are here supported by substantial evidence, cannot well be doubted. It is quite true that the appellant\u2019s version of what took place is diametrically opposed to that offered by Gayle Rubin. This fact in no manner affects the application of the above rule; it would be difficult to find a case where no contradiction exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Appellant has pointed out various alleged discrepancies and inconsistencies in the victim\u2019s testimony. Discrepancies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>may also be found in the appellant\u2019s explanations, as pointed out in respondents\u2019 brief.  Any conflict in testimony was a matter to be initially determined by the board, and once again by the trial judge. The record fails to indicate that the trial judge did not \u201cexercise independent judgment in reviewing the evidence,\u2019\u2019 as argued by the appellant. Nor does it appear that the trial court\u2019s findings were based upon mere surmises of guilt. Substantial evidence and reasonable inferences support these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">As stated in respondents\u2019 brief, \u201can examination of the petition for a Writ of Mandate shows that no complaint whatever was made to the introduction of any hearsay testimony. \u201d  And, as said in <em>Dare </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, </em>21 Cal.2d 790, 800 [136 P.2d 304], \u201cIf the proceedings before the board are to be questioned at the trial it would be the duty of the petitioner to set forth his objections in the petition for the writ. \u201d  Moreover, the testimony of Dr. Williams and Dr. Crawford was not, as appellant argues, based upon mere hearsay statements made by Miss Rubin, but upon personal examination of the patient indicating that an abortion had been recently performed. No merit is found in any of the appellant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The judgment is afBrmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
