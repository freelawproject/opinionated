Defendant cross-complained for $375 rent owing from plaintiff to defendant. The court gave judgment to plaintiff for $1,000 and defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">The evidence most favorable to plaintiff is that he and defendant\u2019s brother undertook to rent and remodel a building, that after plaintiff had done some work of remodeling it was agreed by defendant that he would rent the building and sublet one room to plaintiff and defendant\u2019s brother for $75 per month, which was done. As to the work and labor performed by plaintiff in remodeling the building plaintiff testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-9\">\u201cI had been working for a week before Glenn (the defendant) showed up ... He would pay me for my labor from the time I started up ... He told me to go ahead . . . and put the place together. He would pay me for every hour that I had worked on the place . . . He said he would pay me the current rate ... He says, \u2018Whatever carpenters get, I will pay you for that, and whatever the sheet metal man\u2019, and so we just averaged it up.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">From this it appears that the court was entitled to. find that defendant as a condition of taking over the building agreed to pay plaintiff for work already done by him and for future work. Plaintiff produced a time book from which he testified that he had worked a total of 964 hours for which he \u201ctook an average figure of $3 an hour.\u201d Defendant asserts that there was no testimony that this was the reasonable value of the work. He overlooks the following which went in without objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-11\">\u201cQ. And you feel that this rate of $3 an hour ... is a reasonable charge? A. I think it is very reasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">Plaintiff admitted his agreement to pay $75 per month rent amounting for five months to $375. He explained that he had not paid this rent \u201c (f)or the simple reason that the man owed me for my labor and my time. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-13\">The court found that \u201cdefendant . . . became indebted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>plaintiff for work and labor performed by plaintiff . . . (and) the agreed and reasonable value of said work and labor was . . . the sum of One Thousand ($1000.00) Dollars.\u201d On the cross-complaint the court found that \u201ccross-defendants paid all rentals due. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The findings must be read together and reconciled if possible to support the judgment. <em>(Menghetti </em>v. <em>Dillon, </em>10 Cal.2d 470, 472 [75 P.2d 596]; 2 Cal.Jur. 872-873.) We are satisfied from the whole record that the court\u2019s finding that the rent was paid was based upon a deduction of $375 from the total value of the work and labor performed, and that the indebtedness of $1,000 found by the court represents the balance found to be due after this offset. This would figure about $1.42% per hour.  The trial judge may draw on his own knowledge in fixing the value of services of a nontechnical character <em>(Estate of Willardson, </em>101 Cal.App.2d 777, 779-780 [226 P.2d 369] ; <em>Stiles </em>v. <em>Nunes, </em>98 Cal.App.2d 739 [220 P.2d 792] ; <em>Estate of Reinhertz, </em>82 Cal.App.2d 156. 160 [185 P.2d 858, 186 P.2d 755] ; <em>Collier </em>v. <em>Landram, </em>67 Cal.App.2d 752, 759 [155 P.2d 652]) and we cannot find any abuse of discretion in the value fixed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Nourse, P. J., and Goodell, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
