The lease provided for rental of 1% cents for each gallon of respondent\u2019s first grade and premium gasolines, and 1 cent for each gallon of respondent\u2019s third grade gasoline, sold by respondent at the premises, \u201ca minimum rental of $100.00 per month to be paid in any event.\u201d On March 23, 1949, the property was sold to appellants and the lease assigned to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Plaintiff sought to have the court declare that the lease in question \u201cis binding upon the parties solely as a lease of the premises from month to month until terminated by either party upon thirty days\u2019 notice to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\u201c2. That if the Court finds and declares that said purported lease Exhibit A is not valid as a lease for a term of five years or more; then in such event that the Court give judgment to plaintiffs; that said lease has been terminated or may be terminated as a month to month lease by proper notice from plaintiff to defendant.\u201d It is alleged, \u201cThat said premises are improved for operation as a gas station with office building and pumps. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">It is noteworthy, as pointed out by respondent, that \u201cappellants <em>do not allege </em>that respondent is not operating, or causing to be operated, the premises as a service station disbursing respondent\u2019s products; <em>do not allege </em>that appellants are not receiving, and have not received, a gallonage rental at all times in excess of the $100.00 per month minimum, and <em>do not allege </em>that respondent intends to or threatens to, cease the sale of its gasoline there, or cease the operation of a service station on the premises. Appellants do not allege these things because they cannot. The premises have been at all times operated as the lease contemplates, and the rental has always exceeded the minimum set forth in the lease. . . . Appellants are apparently dissatisfied with the contract made by their assignors, and wish to cancel it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">It is argued by appellant that the contract in question should not be construed as an \u201centire contract\u201d but \u201cshould be construed as two or more severable contracts independent of each other\u201d and that the contract \u201cis severable and consists of a contract for a term of years at a rental based upon sales of gasoline and a separate contract for the minimum rental of $100.00 per month for every month which lessee occupies the premises.\u201d It is also argued that the contract \u201clacks mutuality\u201d and is void \u201cbecause in restraint of trade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Appellants\u2019 contentions are destitute of merit as a mere reading of the contract in the light of well-established law on the subject will reveal; indeed the appeal could be regarded as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
