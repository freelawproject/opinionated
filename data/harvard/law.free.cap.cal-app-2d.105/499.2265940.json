Sheriff of the City and County of San Francisco, to be by him taken before the municipal court of said city and county, for rearraignment and further proper action in connection with a prior proceeding out of which the said Bernard Ford was convicted and sentenced to the state prison for robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-15\">The basis of the above order was that the respondent Ford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>had, in the said prior proceeding, entered a plea of guilty to the crime of robbery without being represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In part, the transcript of said habeas corpus proceeding shows that on January 3, 1944, when respondent appeared for arraignment in the Municipal Court of the City and County of San Francisco on the charge of robbery, the following occurred :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">\u201cThe Court: Are you ready to proceed, Mr. Dresow?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\">\u201cMr. Dresow : Yes, your Honor, ready for arraignment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-8\">\u201cThe Court: All right, Bernard Ford. Let the record show Bernard Ford is represented in court by Mr. Abraham Dresow, Assistant Public Defender. Mr. Bernard Ford, I instruct and caution you that you are hereby charged with the commission of a felony, to-wit: a violation of section 211 of the Penal Code; that under the law you are entitled to a reasonable continuance for the purpose of preparing your defense, to subpoena or summon witnesses and also to engage the services of an attorney to defend you. It is your right to be represented by counsel at any and all stages of the proceedings. Arraign the defendant, Mr. Clark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-9\">\u201c (Here the defendant was arraigned and answered his true name as set forth in the complaint on file herein.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-10\">\u201cMr. Dresow : Your Honor, this man has requested me to ask for a continuance. It seems he has retained Mr. Harry Whitthorn as his attorney, who had to be in Oakland this morning. He suggested further, if there is no objection, I ask it to go over to January 7th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-11\">\u2018 \u2018 The Court : All right. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-12\">The transcript of the proceedings on January\" 7 is in part as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-13\">\u201cMr. Kenny: Your Honor, the defendant informs me he has entered a plea of not guilty and desires to change the plea and plead guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-14\">\u201cThe Court: What case is this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-15\">\u201cMr. Courneen: No. 1 on the continued, Bernard Ford, charged with robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-16\">\u20181 The Court : He has been instructed and arraigned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-17\">\u201cMr. Kenny : He entered a plea of not guilty, I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-18\">\u201cThe Court: (To the defendant) You desire to change your plea to a plea of guilty, now, do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-19\">\u2018 \u2018 The Defendant : Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-20\">\u201cThe Court : Certified to the Superior Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-21\">\u201cMr. Kenny: Certified to the Superior Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-22\">\u2018 \u2018 The Court : All right, the case is certified to the Superior Court. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>From the testimony of petitioner at the habeas corpus proceeding it appears that prior to his arraignment he talked to Mr. Whitthorn on the telephone; that Whitthorn then called upon him at the jail telling him that he would be out of town on the day of the arraignment but that a Mr. Meadows would appear for him. Thereafter Meadows conferred with defendant at the jail advising him to plead not guilty when he was arraigned and that he, Meadows, would take care of the matter at the preliminary in the municipal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">On January 11, the date set for the hearing in the superior court, Mr. Lynch, the assistant district attorney, informed the court that Mr. Meadows was not there and suggested that in view of that fact the case be continued for one day, and it was so ordered. When the case was called on the following day Mr. Lynch stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">\u201c. . . the defendant yesterday raised a question of being represented by counsel. He stated he was represented by Mr. Meadows and Mr. Meadows tells me he does not represent him but that Mr. Whitthorn did, but I don\u2019t think Mr. \"Whit-thorn is actively engaged in the practice of law now.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">The defendant then stated to the court that Mr. Whitthorn did represent him in the municipal court but that he pleaded guilty and \u201ctook him (Whitthorn) off the case. I was under misapprehension, and I called him and he said he would have Mr. Meadows to represent him.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\">\u20181 The Couet : Do you want time to engage other counsel <em>f</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1S\">\u201cThe Dependant: No, sir, I want to plead guilty'.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">\u201cThe Clebk: He has already pleaded guilty and to-day is the fifth day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-11\">\u201cThe Couet: Let the public defender, Mr. Dresow, represent him for the purpose of judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">It is not denied that neither Kenny nor Dresow had consulted with respondent about the facts of his case. Respondent, however, had consulted his own attorney, Mr. \"Whitthorn, who, defendant testified, advised him to enter a plea of not guilty and that he followed such advice. At the hearing in the habeas corpus proceeding in the Sacramento Superior Court respondent testified that the two officers who had arrested him had attempted to persuade him to plead guilty, that they hit him in the face a couple of times and had told him if he pleaded guilty he would get off with a county jail sentence. He also testified that Attorney Meadows called upon him at the county jail, and upon learning that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>changed his plea from not guilty to guilty, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">\u201cWhy did you plead? I was busy. Why didn\u2019t you ask for a continuance?\u201d And I says, \u201cI didn\u2019t know. I have been advised by the police officers if I plead guilty, why, I would get a County Jail sentence.\u201d He says, \u201cWell, you are crazy. I wash my hands of it if you want to take it in your own hands. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The record further shows that during the Sacramento County hearing he was asked by the district attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">\u201cWell, as I understand your testimony now regardless of the advice given to you by Mr. Meadows when these officers promised you the County Jail sentence it was your idea to change your plea to guilty, is that true?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">To which question respondent answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-9\">11 That is right, Mr. Sheehy. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">Additional testimony in the record shows that both the attorney, whom defendant originally retained to represent him, and one of the arresting officers were dead at the time the habeas corpus proceeding was commenced, and that respondent had been previously convicted and sentenced in California for the crime of extortion and for the crime of forgery in Nevada.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">As has been stated, the basis of the order here appealed from and the position now taken by respondent is that the circumstances under which the plea of guilty was entered amounted to a denial of respondent\u2019s constitutional right to effective aid of counsel. It is contended that the representation afforded respondent by Mr. Kenny and Mr. Dresow was merely a <em>pro forma </em>appearance. With this argument we cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">The record shows without contradiction that at the outset respondent talked with and was advised by counsel of his own choice, that pursuant to that advice he entered a plea of not guilty but that he thereafter voluntarily abandoned such advice and entered a plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">Having in effect voluntarily waived the aid of counsel of his own choice, he cannot now be heard to argue that he should have received and was denied that same aid by the public defender.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-14\">It is well settled that a defendant is not denied his constitutional rights where he has voluntarily waived his right to counsel with an intelligent conception of the consequences of his act. <em>(In re </em>Tedford, 31 Cal.2d 693 [192 P.2d 3].) There is nothing in the record before us to indicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>that respondent, who appears to have been somewhat familiar with criminal procedures, did not have an intelligent conception of the consequences of his act when he entered the plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Furthermore it should be noted that respondent has failed to disclose any reasons or make any excuse for the six-year delay in the presentation of the facts raised by his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. He is therefore confronted by the further rule that \u201cone who belatedly presents a collateral attack such as this [must] explain the delay in raising the question.\u201d <em>(In re Swain, </em>34 Cal.2d 300 [209 P.2d 793].)</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The order is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Adams, P. J., and Van Dyke, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
