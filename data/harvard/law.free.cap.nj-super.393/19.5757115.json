We conclude that Pennsylvania\u2019s interest in applying its law subjecting charities to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>the same liability as profit-making entities outweighs New Jersey\u2019s interest in immunizing New Jersey charities from liability for alleged tortious conduct in another state.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Plaintiff P.V., a mentally challenged New Jersey resident, was an attendee at a summer camp in Effort, Pennsylvania, operated by defendant Camp Jaycee, a New Jersey charitable corporation. While at the camp, plaintiff was allegedly sexually assaulted by another attendee, causing her to suffer personal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">P.V. and her parents, T.V. and L.V., as guardians ad litem for P.V. and individually, brought this personal injury action, alleging that Camp Jaycee and its agents, servants and employees were \u201ccareless and negligent in the supervision of the patrons at the camp.\u201d After the end of discovery, Camp Jaycee moved for summary judgment on the ground that plaintiffs\u2019 action is barred by the Charitable Immunity Act. Plaintiffs opposed the motion on the ground that the alleged negligent conduct and sexual assault occurred in Pennsylvania, which does not immunize charitable organizations from tort liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">The trial court concluded in a written opinion that, applying New Jersey\u2019s \u201cgovernmental interests\u201d test for determining choice of law issues, New Jersey\u2019s interest in protecting New Jersey charities from liability for their charitable endeavors outweighs Pennsylvania\u2019s interest in subjecting charities to the same rules of tort liability as other private entities. Accordingly, the court granted summary judgment dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">When a lawsuit is brought in this State, New Jersey\u2019s choice-of-law rules are applied to determine which state\u2019s laws should govern the litigation. <em>Emy v. Estate of Merola, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>86, 94, 792 A.2d 1208 (2002). In making this determination, our courts employ a \u201cgovernmental-interests analysis\u201d that involves \u201ctwo steps.\u201d <em>Rowe v. Hoffman-La Roche, Inc., </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>615, 621, 917 A.2d 767 (2007). First, a court must determine whether there is an \u201cactual conflict\u201d between the laws of the interested states. <em>Ibid. </em>Second, if there is a conflict, a court must \u201cdetermine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>interest ... each state has in resolving the specific issue in dispute!,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 621-22, 917 A.2d 767 (quoting <em>Gantes v. Kason Corp., </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>478, 485, 679 A.2d 106 (1996)), and \u201capply the law of \u2018the state with the greatest interest in governing the particular issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 622, 917 A.2d 767 (quoting <em>Veazey v. Doremus, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>244,248, 510 A.2d 1187 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">There is a clear conflict between the laws of Pennsylvania and New Jersey regarding the immunity of charitable organizations. More than forty years ago, Pennsylvania abolished charitable immunity by judicial decision, and it has not subsequently reinstated the immunity. <em>Flagiello v. Pennsylvania Hosp., </em>417 <em>Pa. </em>486, 208 A.2d 193, 207-08 (1965); <em>Nolan v. Tifereth Israel Synagogue, </em>425 <em>Pa. </em>106, 227 A.2d 675, 677 (1967). Although the Supreme Court of New Jersey also abolished charitable immunity in <em>Collopy v. Newark Eye &amp; Ear Infirmary, </em>27 <em>N.J. </em>29, 42-48,141 A.2d 276 (1958) and <em>Dalton v. St. Luke\u2019s Catholic Church, </em>27 <em>N.J. </em>22, 24-25, 141 A.2d 273 (1958), the Legislature subsequently reinstated that immunity by enactment of New Jersey\u2019s Charitable Immunity Act. <em>L. </em>1959, <em>c. </em>90, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The Act currently provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">No nonprofit corporation, society or association organized exclusively for religious, charitable or educational purposes ... shall ... be liable to respond in damages to any person who shall suffer damage from the negligence of any agent or servant of such corporation, society or association, where such person is a beneficiary, to whatever degree, of the works of such nonprofit corporation, society or association____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>2A:53A-7.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">Since P.V. was a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d of the summer camp operated by Camp Jaycee, this action would be barred by application of the New Jersey Charitable Immunity Act. But since Pennsylvania has abolished charitable immunity, this action could be maintained under Pennsylvania law.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">We must therefore identify the interests of New Jersey and Pennsylvania in applying their laws regarding the tort liability of charities and determine which state has the greater interest in its law governing the immunity issue. New Jersey\u2019s interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>applying its Charitable Immunity Act is the \u201cpreservation of private charitable contributions for their designated purposes.\u201d <em>Bieker v. Cmty. House of Moorestown, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>167,178, 777 A.2d 87 (2001) (quoting <em>Parker v. St. Stephen\u2019s Urban Dev. Corp., </em>243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>317, 326, 579 A.2d 360 (App.Div.1990)). However, the protection the Charitable Immunity Act provides to a charity\u2019s resources is limited. \u201cPersons injured by the negligent conduct of charities domiciled in this State are free to sue them in tort provided they are not beneficiaries thereof, and our courts have tended to construe that status narrowly.\u201d <em>Butkera v. Hudson River Sloop \u201cClearwater, \u201d Inc., </em>300 <em>N.J.Super. </em>550, 555, 693 A.2d 520 (App.Div.1997). Moreover, even a charity\u2019s immunity from suit by beneficiaries is limited to negligence claims; the Charitable Immunity Act does not apply to \u201caggravated wrongful conduct, such as malice or fraud, or intentional, reckless and wanton, or even grossly negligent behavior.\u201d <em>Hardwicke v. Am. Boychoir Sch., </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>69, 97, 902 A.2d 900 (2006) (quoting <em>Schultz v. Roman Catholic Archdiocese, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>530, 542, 472 A.2d 531 (1984) (Handler, J., dissenting)).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Pennsylvania\u2019s interest in subjecting charities to the same rules of tort liability as other private entities is two-fold: \u201c[I]t both assures payment of an obligation to the person injured and gives warning that justice and the law demand the exercise of care.\u201d <em>Flagiello, supra, </em>208 A.2d at 201 (quoting <em>Bing v. Thunig, </em>2 <em>N.Y.2d </em>656, 163 N.Y.S.2d 3, 143 N.E.2d 3, 8 (1957)). These two interests are sometimes referred to as, on the one hand, compensation and loss allocation and, on the other hand, conduct regulation. <em>See </em>Wendy Collins Perdue, <em>Conflict of Laws, Comparative Law &amp; Civil Law: A Reexamination of the Distinction Between \u201cLoss Allocating\u201d and \u201cConduct-Regulating Rules,\u201d </em>60 <em>La. L.Rev. </em>1251 (2000). However, these interests are not separate and distinct. \u201cAll tort rules determine who will bear a loss and thus all are loss-allocating[,]\u201d but most tort rules also \u201caffect conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1252. \u201cLoss allocation creates incentives for those who must bear the loss to behave differently than they would if they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>did not bear the loss.\u201d <em>Ibid.; see also Fu v. Fu, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>108,123, 733 A.2d 1133 (1999) (noting that \u201cevery tort rule, to some extent, is designed both to deter and to compensate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has used strong language to describe Pennsylvania\u2019s conduct-regulating interest in abolishing charitable immunity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">Human nature being what it is, administrators of a hospital, cognizant that the hospital is insulated from tort liability, may be less likely to exercise maximum scrutiny in selecting personnel than if the hospital were held monetarily liable for slipshod, indifferent, and neglectful conduct of employees. As Judge Rutledge said in the <em>Georgetown [College v. Hughes, </em>130 F.2d 810, 824 (D.C.Cir.1942)] case, \u201cimmunity tends to foster neglect while liability tends to induce care and caution.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>[Flagiello, supra, </em>208 A.2d at 202.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Under New Jersey law, derived from section 145(2) of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws </em>(1971), there are four factors that must be considered in determining which state has the greatest interest in its law governing a particular issue of tort liability: \u201cthe place where the injury occurred; the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred; the domicile, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties; and the place where the relationship, if any, between the parties is centered.\u201d <em>Fu, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 125, 733 A.2d 1133. However, these factors are not given equal weight. \u201cIn personal injury eases, ... [wjhen both conduct and injury occur in a single jurisdiction, with only \u2018rare exceptions, the local law of the state where conduct and injury occurred will be applied\u2019 to determine an actor\u2019s liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125-26, 733 A.2d 1133 (quoting <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 145, comment d). \u201cThat is so because \u2018a state has an obvious interest in regulating the conduct of persons within its territory and in providing redress for injuries that occurred there.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126, 733 A.2d 1133 (quoting <em>Restate</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number><em>ment, supra, </em>\u00a7 145, comment d). Similarly, in <em>Mastondrea v. Occidental Hotels Management, S.A., </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>261, 287, 918 A.2d 27 (App.Div.2007), we observed, quoting <em>Spinozzi v. ITT Sheraton Corp., </em>174 F.3d 842, 844-45 (7th Cir.1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">[I]n the absence of unusual circumstances, the highest scorer on the \u201cmost significant relationship\u201d test is [ ] the place where the tort occurred. For that is the place that has the greatest interest in striking a reasonable balance among safety, cost, and other factors pertinent to the design and administration of a system of tort law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">In this case, even though the parties are New Jersey residents and domieiliaries and Camp Jaycee operates primarily in New Jersey, both Camp Jaycee\u2019s negligent conduct and P.V.\u2019s injury occurred in Pennsylvania. Consequently, <em>Fu </em>and <em>Mastondrea </em>indicate that Pennsylvania\u2019s law should determine whether Camp Jaycee is immune from plaintiffs\u2019 suit unless New Jersey\u2019s interest in immunizing Camp Jaycee from liability clearly outweighs Pennsylvania\u2019s interest in subjecting charities to the same rules of liability as other private entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">Pennsylvania has a strong conduct-regulating interest in encouraging parties that engage in business operations within its boundaries, including charitable organizations, to exercise due care in the hiring, training and supervision of their employees. If Camp Jaycee fails to properly control participants in its summer camp program, such as the person who allegedly sexually assaulted P.V., those persons may pose a danger not only to other campers, who may include Pennsylvania residents, but also to employees of the camp, who also may include Pennsylvania residents,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as well as to persons who live in the surrounding area. Therefore, even though P.V. happens to be a New Jersey resident, Pennsylvania\u2019s interest in \u201cindue[ing] care and caution\u201d in the conduct of charitable organizations by subjecting them to liability for negligence that results in injury, <em>Flagiello, </em>208 A.2d at 202, is promoted by application of its law to this litigation in the same way as to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>claim against a Pennsylvania charity that operates a summer camp in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">New Jersey\u2019s only interest in immunizing Camp Jaycee from liability for the injuries P.V. suffered as a result of the alleged sexual assault is to preserve charitable contributions for their designated purposes. However, as previously discussed, the protection this immunity provides for financial resources of charitable organizations is limited because it applies only to negligence claims by beneficiaries. This limited immunity is now further limited by a 2006 amendment to the Charitable Immunity Act that subjects a charity to liability for \u201cthe negligent hiring, supervision or retention of any employee, agent or servant resulting] in a sexual offense being committed against [a beneficiary of the charity] under the age of 18.\u201d <em>L. </em>2005, c. 264, \u00a7 1; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-7.4; see <em>Hardwicke, supra, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>at 99, 902 A.2d 900.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">In view of Pennsylvania\u2019s strong interest in encouraging charities to exercise due care in the conduct of their activities and providing compensation to victims of a charity\u2019s negligence and the limited protection the New Jersey Charitable Immunity Act provides to a charity\u2019s financial resources, we conclude that this case is not one of the \u201crare exceptions\u201d to the general rule that \u201c[w]hen both conduct and injury occur in a single jurisdiction, ... \u2018the local law of the state where conduct and injury occurred will be applied\u2019 to determine an actor\u2019s liability.\u201d <em>Fu, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 125-26, 733 A.2d 1133 (quoting <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 145, comment d).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Accordingly, the order dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is reversed, and the case is remanded to the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b55-9\"> We note that when the Supreme Court of New Jersey abolished charitable immunity, it also observed that \u201cimmunity tends to foster neglect while liability tends to induce care and caution[.]\u201d <em>Collopy, supra, </em>27 <em>N.J. </em>at 41, 141 A.2d 276 (quoting E.H.
