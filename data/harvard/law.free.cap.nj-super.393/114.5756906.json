IAIU found that the charges against appellant were \u201cunfounded,\u201d but nevertheless issued a report to her employing school district that included findings that she made physical contact with a student and that her conduct was \u201cunjustified and inappropriately]\u201d \u201cplacing] the child at some risk of harm.\u201d Appellant also challenges the IAIU\u2019s inclusion of recommendations for \u201cCorrective/Disciplinary Action\u201d in its letter to the District and IAIU\u2019s failure to send appellant a copy of that September 7, 2005 letter report. The corresponding letter sent to appellant on the same date failed to include any mention of those findings or recommendations. Appellant argues that \u201cthe practices and procedures utilized by the IAIU in this matter constitute a violation of due process and the principles of fundamental fairness which have previously been mandated by this eourt[,]\u201d \u201cthe findings of the IAIU improperly include remedial requirements[,]\u201d and \u201cthe conclusions reached by IAIU must be stricken as ultra vires[,][] because they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">Appellant complains that merely stating that a report is \u201cinvestigative\u201d and not \u201cadjudieatory[,]\u201d is a \u201csubterfuge [] belied by the fact that the actual factual conclusions declare appellant guilty of \u2018unjustified and inappropriate conduct.\u2019\u201d She further contends that because investigative findings were reported and recommendations made, IAIU must be compelled by us to (1) provide appellant with copies of all reports and letters it authored concern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>ing the matter, (2) cease the practice of issuing interim reports in the absence of findings of abuse or neglect that warrant those letters, pursuant to <em>NJ.A.C. </em>10:129-5.3(a), (3) cease the practice of including findings of the truth of allegations when the there was a conclusion that the charges of abuse or neglect were \u201cunfounded,\u201d (4) \u201ccease the practice of specifying remedial actions to be taken by an employer child care agency in the context of an unfounded finding and include an express statement that the child care agency is not required to comply with any of IAIU\u2019s remedial recommendations in such a case,\u201d (5) \u201c[e]xclude all recommendations of discipline in the context of an unfounded finding as to the allegations against a school employee[,]\u201d and (6) \u201c[r]ecall and destroy\u201d the September 7, 2002 letters sent to the District, County, and State and \u201cre-issue\u201d the report, and (7) destroy the August 22,2005 interim report.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The State contends that, as the purpose of IAIU is to protect students and not to punish teachers, there was no due process violation, because no consequences flow from the letters. Any action taken in response to IAIU\u2019s letter by the local board of education would be subject to the due process and contract rights incident to that action. The State further suggests that what is recommended need not be told to the teacher, because it is \u201cconfidential,\u201d only a recommendation, and constitutional rights are not implicated because no adverse consequences can flow from the letter itself.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The first IAIU letter in question is the \u201cinterim status report\u201d of August 22, 2005 to the District, which stated the investigation was ongoing but added that, while the student did not \u201csustain any injuries[,]\u201d appellant\u2019s actions \u201cwere unjustified and inappropriate.\u201d The report \u201craised concerns about [appellant\u2019s] judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>and ability to successfully de-escalate situations involving students.\u201d A recommendation for administrative counseling and training, along with monitoring of appellant, was included.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The final report was embodied in three separate letters marked \u201cconfidential,\u201d dated September 7, 2005. Each had the same \u201cInvestigative Finding[,]\u201d but contained a different \u201cEvaluation of Facts\u201d section and added additional statements to certain addressees.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The letter to the student\u2019s father included the \u201cInvestigative Finding\u201d that the charge of \u201c[p]hysical abuse was unfounded,\u201d that \u201cno adjudicative findings have been made,\u201d and that \u201cIAIU\u2019s review herein is solely investigative.\u201d However, following the \u201cInvestigative Finding,\u201d in the \u201c[ejvaluation of [f]acts[,]\u201d it also stated that \u201cconcerns regarding the actions of the teacher\u201d were noted to the District and County authorities. A copy of that letter was sent to the Chief Administrator of the Wayne School District but not to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The \u201cconfidential\u201d letter to appellant contained an identical \u201cInvestigative Finding,\u201d and an \u201cEvaluation of Facts\u201d which stated that \u201c[t]he results of the investigation do not support that physical abuse occurred; however, some information obtained during the investigation raised concerns regarding your actions.\u201d It advised that \u201c[t]he district administration has been notified of this finding.\u201d The letter thereafter noted that, in the absence of certain developments, the findings and records associated with the matter \u201cshall be expunged\u201d in three years. The Chief Administrator of the Wayne Public Schools was also copied on the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">A third \u201cconfidential\u201d letter of September 7, 2005 was sent directly to the Chief School Administrator of the Wayne Public Schools with copies to County school officials and the State\u2019s Office of the Child Advocate. It contained the identical \u201cInvestigative Finding\u201d but included a significantly more developed \u201cevaluation of facts.\u201d It noted the student was the aggressor, but that appellant \u201cescalatefdj\u201d the matter until \u201cthe student became as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>saultive.\u201d It stated that appellant \u201cgrabbed\u201d the student\u2019s \u201cponytail quickly at the same time as [the student] was trying to move away and as a result, the student fell to the floor.\u201d It also noted that \u201c[t]he actions of [appellant] were unjustified and inappropriate. Her actions placed the child at some risk of harm; however, those actions did not meet the statutory requirement to find abuse.\u201d Nevertheless, the IAIU made \u201cRecommendations for Correetive/Disciplinary action,\" including \u201cadministrative counseling,\u201d \u201cmandatory trainmg/re-training in behavior management and identification techniques\u201d and \u201cclose monitoring] ... to assess progress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Upon receipt of an allegation of child abuse or neglect, the Division of Youth and Family Services (\u201cDYFS\u201d) is charged with \u201ctaking] such action as shall be necessary to insure the safety of the child[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.11. <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-7a. In the investigation process, \u201c[t]he primary concern of all public agencies involved with child abuse and neglect is to ensure the safety, well-being, and best interests of the child.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:129-1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The IAIU investigates reports of child abuse or neglect. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:120A-1.3(a). If the charges are substantiated, the charged teacher has the right to contest the findings before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) in the Office of Administrative Law. <em>See Matter of East Park High School, </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>149, 165, 714 A.2d 339 (App.Div.1998); <em>Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. M.R., </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>390, 411-12, 715 A.2d 308 (App.Div.1998). However, \u201c[a] finding by DYFS that child abuse charges have not been substantiated, but that there is some indication a child was harmed or placed at risk of harm, is purely investigatory in nature, with none of the procedural protections of an adjudicatory proceeding.\u201d <em>In re an Allegation of Physical Abuse Concerning R.P., </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>105, 117, 754 A.2d 615 (App.Div.2000) (cita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>tion omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">We have nevertheless \u201cheld that DYE\u2019S has statutory authority to find that child abuse allegations against a teacher were \u2018not substantiated,\u2019 but that it has \u2018concerns\u2019 the teacher\u2019s conduct may pose a risk of harm to his or her students.\u201d <em>R.P., supra, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 111, 754 A.2d 615 (citing <em>In re an Allegation of Physical Abuse Concerning L.R., </em>321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>444, 449-50, 729 A.2d 463 (App.Div.1999)). Therefore, while \u201ca teacher is not entitled to a hearing to contest a finding that child abuse allegations have not been substantiated,\u201d <em>R.P., supra, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 114, 754 A.2d 615, the investigatory findings and \u201cconcerns about the teacher\u2019s conduct,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>warrant \u201csome due process protection,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 115, 754 A.2d 615, by \u201cjudicial review and correction [of the findings] \u2018to curb administrative abuses[,]\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 116, 754 A.2d 615 (quoting <em>Monks v. N.J. State Parole Bd., </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>238, 249, 277 A.2d 193 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">In <em>R.P., supra, </em>DYFS referred to investigative findings using the terms \u201cpreponderance of the credible evidence[,]\u201d and we concluded that the language in its letter inferred that an adjudication had taken place and had to be \u201ccorrected so that it simply states ... that DYFS\u2019s investigation revealed some evidence of harm or risk of harm to R.P., but that there has been no determination of the accuracy of R.P.\u2019s allegations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 117, 754 A.2d 615. We also required that the \u201ccorrected letter\u201d had to \u201cclearly state[] that its finding was purely investigatory and that it made no adjudication of R.P.\u2019s allegations ... [and] that the school district is not required to take any remedial action.\u201d <em>R.P., supra, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 119, 754 A.2d 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>The same principles control this case because, while here the finding of abuse was \u201cunfounded\u201d and, therefore, not substantiated, the final letter to the District referred to \u201cconcerns\u201d about appellant\u2019s conduct and stated that her actions were \u201cunjustified and inappropriate\u201d and \u201cplaced the child at some risk of harm.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Although interim letters are not required by statute or the administrative code, <em>see N.J.AC. </em>10:129-5.1 to 5.4, IAIU issued the August 22, 2005 letter to the District administrator prior to completion of its investigation. As such, finality did not support IAIU\u2019s statements that \u201c[t]he actions of [appellant] were unjustified and inappropriate\u201d or that \u201cthe actions of the teacher raised concerns about her judgment and ability to successfully de-escalate situations involving students.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, neither the regulations nor any concept of due process prevents the IAIU from advising the District of the ongoing interim status of its investigation prior to the start of the new school year to enable the school to plan the student\u2019s schedule to assure her \u201csafety, well-being, and best interestsf,]\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:129-1.4, provided it is clear that the investigation has not been concluded and that no final action is recommended or conclusion reached with respect to the teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Despite its inappropriately conclusive language evaluating appellant\u2019s behavior, the August 22, 2005 letter was clear that the investigation was not complete. However, because the letter implicated appellant and the status of an investigation of her conduct, she should have been sent a copy of the letter. Never<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>theless, as she subsequently received a copy of the August letter, the letter clearly stated that it referred to an incomplete and ongoing investigation and subsequently triggered no significant consequences, and the appellant\u2019s rights are hereinafter addressed as a result of her challenge to the September 7 letters, we need not further address the August 22,2005 letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Appellant argues that IAIU strayed from procedures authorized by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:129A-1.3 and violated due process requirements by sending a detailed account of its concerns to appellant\u2019s employer without notifying appellant of the specific concerns and failing to advise appellant that the County Superintendent of Schools was notified of the report. Appellant requests that the court require that \u201c[t]he \u2018alleged perpetrator\u2019 or her counsel [] receive[] a copy of every letter that [is] sent to anyone which address[es] the appellant\u2019s conduct or concerns about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">By statute, when DYFS or another entity in the Department of Children and Families<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (hereinafter \u201cthe Department\u201d) investigates a complaint alleging that a school employee committed child abuse or neglect, the Department is required to \u201cnotify the school district and the employee of its findings.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-7a. Although the Administrative Code was revised after the commencement of this investigation, it still reaffirms statutory policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>by requiring that, when an allegation is determined to be \u201cunfounded,\u201d the Department notify the accused employee, the \u201ccaregiver with physical custody at the time of the incident\u201d; and \u201c[t]he parent with whom the child normally resides____\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:129-5.4(b), (d), (e)(2007). However, the extent of the required notification is not specified in the Code or by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">New Jersey courts require that reasoning for a decision be given in administrative agency determinations such as teacher tenure denials. <em>See Donaldson v. Board of Education of North Wildwood, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>236, 243, 246, 320 A.2d 857 (1974). In <em>Donaldson, </em>the Court emphasized that the requirement of disclosing the reasoning behind administrative agencies\u2019 decisions is motivated by fairness and, further, that disclosure is \u201c[o]ne of the best procedural protections against arbitrary exercise of discretionary power----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243, 320 A.2d 857 (quoting Kenneth Culp Davis, Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 16.12, 585 (1970 Supp.)). The Court then offered specific reasons why the reasoning behind a teacher tenure denial should be disclosed, all of which also apply to the case at hand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-10\">[plerhaps the statement of reasons mil disclose correctible deficienc[i]es and be of service in guiding his future conduct; perhaps it will disclose that the nonretention was due to factors unrelated to his professional or classroom performance and its availability may aid him in obtaining future teaching employment; perhaps it will serve other purposes fairly helpful to him as suggested in <em>Drown </em>[v. <em>Portsmouth School District, </em>435 F.2d 1182, 1184-85 (1st Cir.1970)], and perhaps the very requirement that reasons be stated would, as suggested in <em>Monks, [(supra, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>at 249, 277 A.2d 193)], serve as a significant discipline on the board itself against arbitrary or abusive exercise of its broad discretionary powers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-11\"><em>[Id. </em>at 245, 320 A.2d 857.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">Furthermore, \u201cdue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the situation demands.\u201d <em>R.P., supra, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 113, 754 A.2d 615 (quoting <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 <em>U.S. </em>471, 481, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>2593, 2600, 33 L.Ed.2d 484, 494 (1972)). As said in <em>R.P., </em>\u201ca person has a constitutional interest in protecting his or her \u2018good name or reputation ... because of what the government is doing to that person____\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112, 754 A.2d 615 (quoting <em>Doe v. Poritz, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>1, 105, 662 A.2d 367 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>IAIU complied with the statutory and administrative requirements of giving appellant notice of its findings by writing to her that its report concluded that the allegations against her were \u201cunfounded,\u201d \u201csome information ... raised concerns[,]\u201d and that \u201c[t]he [District administration ha[d] been notified of this finding.\u201d However, by failing to give an explanation of the reasoning for its recommendations and findings notwithstanding that the charges were \u201cunfounded,\u201d the requirements of due process and fundamental fairness were not honored.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The letter to appellant stated only that the report of \u201cphysical abuse was unfounded,\u201d \u201cno adjudicative findings ha[d] been made,\u201d and \u201c[t]he results of the investigation do not support that physical abuse occurred!,]\u201d but that \u201csome information obtained during the investigation raised concerns regarding your actions.\u201d The letter to the District stated the same, but it then recited specific \u201cinformation obtained during the investigation [which] raised concerns regarding the actions of [the teacher],\u201d concluding that those actions \u201cwere unjustified and inappropriate [and] ... placed the child at some risk of harm[.]\u201d The letter also included \u201cRecommendations for Corrective/Disciplinary Action\u201d that were not in the letter sent to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">As neither the \u201cfindings\u201d nor the \u201cconcerns\u201d were detailed or identified in the letter to appellant, but were explained to the District without notice to appellant, the IAIU acted inappropriately. We recognize that appellant asserts the right to more information while complaining that the agency said too much. We believe that appellant\u2019s legitimate concerns may be accommodated by making sure the teacher receives a copy of whatever the District received and that the District receives whatever is necessary to protect the best interests of a child. All correspondence must make clear that neither an adjudication has occurred and that DYFS has not mandated any action and that the District must take whatever action it deems appropriate, subject to appellant\u2019s right to contest whatever action it takes. Accordingly, we hold that appellant should have been copied on the letter to the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Administrator and that, although it had no direct consequences and did not give rise to a hearing or contest as such, the reasons supporting the findings and recommendations should have been more detailed in the letter to appellant. <em>See N.J.AC. </em>10:129-5.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Appellant contends that what IAIU labeled \u201cconcerns\u201d were actually conclusions \u201cthat the allegations against her were accurate\u201d and that while</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">IAIU has found appellant innocent of the offense within its jurisdiction (i.e.abuse), [it] declared her guilty of a supposedly lesser offense of an \u201c... unjustified and inappropriate ...\u201d grabbing of a child, causing her to fall, and placing her \u201cat some risk of harm.\u201d That offense is not within its jurisdiction and no statute or regulation authorizes it to reach those conclusions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Appellant suggests that such findings have adverse consequences to her and must be deleted from the September 7, 2005 letter to the District.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">As noted at the outset, IAIU is not limited to reporting on abuse in its findings. <em>See L.R., supra, </em>321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 452, 729 A.2d 463. It is authorized to make recommendations to a district for action when it uncovers behavior that falls short of child abuse but is nonetheless undesirable. <em>Ibid. </em>In <em>L.R., </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-10\">[a]n investigation of an abuse complaint against a teacher may disclose conduct which poses a threat to the physical and emotional well-being of the teacher\u2019s students even though it does not rise to the level of \u201cchild abuse\u201d within the intent of <em>N.J.SA </em>9:6-8.21. Therefore, we are satisfied that DYFS has not only the authority but the responsibility to take reasonable measures to protect students from any threat to their well-being. The most obvious available measure to protect students from a teacher who poses a danger to their safety or welfare is for DYNS to communicate its concerns and recommendations to the school district which employs the teacher.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-11\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">While the content of findings is not limited, IAIU must now classify allegations as either \u201cunfounded\u201d or \u201csubstantiated.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:129-1.3. A finding of \u201cunfounded\u201d is currently defined by the Administrative Code as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-13\">i. There is not a preponderance of evidence that the alleged child victim was harmed or placed at substantial risk of harm; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>ii. There is not a preponderance of evidence indicating that a parent or guardian and child were involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\"><em>[N.J.A.C. </em>10:129-1.3.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The finding of \u201csubstantiated\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADk\">a finding when the available information, as evaluated by the child protective investigator, indicates by a preponderance of the evidence that a child is an abused or neglected child as defined in <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:133-1.3 because the alleged child victim has been harmed or placed at risk of harm by a parent or guardian.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\"><em>[N.J.A.C. </em>10:129-1.3.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">These two specific definitions were not in effect at the time of the underlying incident in this case, but they are substantively identical for the purposes of this evaluation. <em>See </em>37 <em>N.J.R. </em>283 (Jan. 18, 2005). <em>See also R.P., supra, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 111, n. 2, 754 A.2d 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">As IAIU is encouraged to report concerns even when no actual child abuse is \u201csubstantiated,\u201d its articulation of \u201cconcerns\u201d about appellant\u2019s behavior was not inappropriate. <em>See L.R., supra, </em>321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 452, 729 A.2d 463. If appellant\u2019s argument is correct, IAIU would be precluded from advising that an investigation found inappropriate behavior or even that a matter warranted further review or attention. This would be contrary to the broad statutory obligations of DYFS, IAIU, and related agencies to protect the safety of the child at the root of the complaint and violative of public policy designed to protect the best interests of our children. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.11, However, in rendering its report, IAIU must emphasize that it has neither adjudicated findings nor can it make binding recommendations. <em>R.P., supra, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 117-119, 754 A.2d 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">Appellant further contends that IAIU\u2019s September 7 letter to the District\u2019s recommendation that she receive \u201cmandatory train-mg/re-training\u201d was an order, not a suggestion. Appellant further asserts that \u201c[a] recommendation of <em>mandatory </em>training can only be viewed as something the employer and the employee <em>must </em>do.\u201d To afford relief, appellant argues that we must order IAIU \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>correct the letters sent in this matter\u201d and \u201cto avoid such actions in the future.\u201d The State argues that IAIU\u2019s remedial recommendations were in concert with its obligation to protect children under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.11, and that \u201cmandatory training\u201d is a <em>recommendation </em>that the school district not give appellant the option of obtaining training but instead require that she do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">As we have noted, the IAIU lacks the authority to instruct \u201ca school district to take remedial action in response to [its] investigatory findings.\u201d <em>R.P., supra, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 118, 754 A.2d 615. Specifically, Judge Skillman has stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">DYPS does not have the statutory authority to order a school district to take any specific corrective action. The district has the sole authority to determine whether to initiate disciplinary proceedings or take other personnel action which may affect a teacher\u2019s employment rights. Any recommendations DYPS may make to the district are advisory only.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\"><em>[L.R., supra, </em>321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 457, 729 A.2d 463.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">However, as previously stated, recommendations for further action based on its investigatory findings are within IAIU\u2019s authority provided it does not <em>direct </em>the District to take action. <em>R.P., supra, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 117-119, 754 A.2d 615. If the District decides to take action, it must accord all the due process and contract rights that must be honored before formal action may be taken,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the IAIU\u2019s findings may not by themselves provide a basis for the action. <em>R.P., supra, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 118, 754 A.2d 615; <em>see L.R., </em>321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 457, 729 A.2d 463. At argument before us, the State so acknowledged, and we were assured by the IAIU that no action has been or will be taken by the State (as opposed to the District). We trust that future letters to the District accompanying a finding that the charges were \u201cunfounded\u201d will contain language such as \u201cthe situation indicates a need for training\u201d but that the need for such training is left to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>discretion of the school district and cannot be mandated by the IAIU.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">In this case, we order the September 7, 2005 letter to the District to be amended to include such language because it also needs to be amended to avoid an improper impression conveyed despite the ultimate finding that the charges of abuse were \u201cunfounded.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although interviews with students and teachers presented conflicting accounts and no adjudication took place, IAIU\u2019s letter to the District stated, as if conclusively found, that appellant \u201cgrabbed [AJ.\u2019s] ponytail quickly at the same time as [the student] was trying to move away and as a result, the student fell to the floor.\u201d Accordingly, even though the section on \u201cInvestigative Findings\u201d states that \u201c[n]o adjudicative findings have been made [and] IAIU\u2019s review herein is solely investigative,\u201d the factual recitation in the \u201cEvaluation of Facts\u201d should be reworded to reflect this distinction. The letter should also note that IAIU\u2019s findings are not binding or conclusive. However, the overall conclusion that appellant\u2019s actions were \u201cunjustified and inappropriate\u201d is supported by the witness accounts, all of which suggest some physical confrontation between A.I. and appellant, and need not be deleted. <em>See L.R., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">We conclude that IAIU acted within its proscribed authority in issuing findings that \u201cunjustified and inappropriate\u201d behavior occurred despite the finding that the allegation of child abuse was \u201cunfounded.\u201d However, although it can have no adjudicatory impact, we hold that the September 7, 2005 letter to appellant and to the Chief Administrator of the Wayne School District must be amended, and we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We further hold that a copy of any letter to a School <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>District or District Administrator related to the conduct of a teacher must be sent to that teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Remanded for further action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-7\"> In the absence of any argument to the contrary, we treat the September 7, 2005 letters as final administrative determinations appealable to us as of right. <em>See, e.g., In re an Allegation of Physical Abuse Concerning R.P., </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>105, 754 A.2d 615 (App.Div.2000); <em>In re Allegation of Physical Abuse Concerning L.R., </em>321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>444, 729 A.2d 463 (App.Div.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b153-8\"> At the time we decided <em>R.P., supra, </em>three categories of abuse determinations existed: \"substantiated,\u201d \"not substantiated,\u201d and \u201cunfounded.\u201d The finding of \"not substantiated\u201d has subsequently been removed as a category.
