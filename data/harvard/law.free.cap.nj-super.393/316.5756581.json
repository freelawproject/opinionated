On July 15, 2005, defendant was sentenced to a thirteen-year prison term on count one, subject to the No Early Release Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2, and a consecutive six-month jail term on count two.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-13\">The facts adduced at trial were as follows. On March 8, 2003, after attending a party in Paterson, Rakema Nelson and her friend Travell Zimmerman stopped for a soda at American Fried Chicken, a 24-hour restaurant on Broadway. It was about 3:40 a.m. when they arrived. The restaurant was small and fairly crowded despite the late hour. While Nelson waited in line with her pocketbook open in anticipation of her purchase, Zimmerman struck up a friendly conversation with a man in the restaurant. At that point, Nelson testified to the following version of events:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH\">I was approached by someone. We was just saying that\u2014I don\u2019t really remember what he was saying in the beginning. But he was like what\u2019s in your bag? He asked me what was in my bag. He had my bag, but I don\u2019t\u2014like I just wasn\u2019t really paying him no attention. I was like whatever. And then he was like give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>me your shit. And I\u2019m like what? And he\u2019s like I\u2019ll take it. And he\u2019s motioning and says waist, like do you know what I have right here? And that\u2019s when my girlfriend stepped in. And she\u2019s like what are you doing? Get off of her. And he\u2019s like\u2014he turned to her. He\u2019s like I\u2019ll take your shit too. You don\u2019t know what I got right here and he\u2019s holding his waist. And she\u2019s like wait a minute. Just go ahead. Like she\u2019s pushing him, like just go. And then he pushed her against the table and he went\u2014like he hit her. And we were like trying to get him off. And we both were hitting him, trying to get him off of her. And we\u2014once we were leaving out the store, he was\u2014he bumped into another person, which is why his attention was taken off of us. He got in a fight with the guy who was walking in. So, that\u2019s how I ended up being able to call the Police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Further on, she testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">I just really didn\u2019t pay him any attention and I like proceeded to get to the window. And he had his hand on the bag, like on the strap. And I\u2019m like what are you doing? And he\u2019s like do you know what I got right here? I\u2019ll take your shit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Alq\">Q. When\u2014when he said, do you know what I got right here; what did you take\u2014 what\u2014what did you think?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">A. Like I just wasn\u2019t really thinking anything of it. I was just trying to ignore him, because I didn\u2019t really know what he was doing. But he wouldn\u2019t let go of my purse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">Q. Were you in fear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-10\">Q. Were you in fear that perhaps he had a weapon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-12\">Q. And that was\u2014and why did you think that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-13\">A Because he was motioning to his waistband, asking me if I knew what he had. Q. So, at this point, he\u2014did he still have his hand on your purse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-14\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-15\">Q. And what was he doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-16\">A He was like tugging on\u2014we were going back and forth. He was tugging and I was tugging.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-17\">Q. Now, ... you indicated you were\u2014you were frightened, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-18\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-19\">Q. Why didn\u2019t you let go and let him have it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-20\">A I don\u2019t know. I just didn\u2019t let go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-21\">Q. What happened then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-22\">A. That\u2019s when my girlfriend saw him. And she\u2019s like what are you doing? Let go of her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-23\">Q. You heard her say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-24\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-25\">Q. What happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-26\">A And he turned to her, and he\u2019s like what? I\u2019ll take your shit too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Q. What happened then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">A. Then she\u2014I don\u2019t remember. Like some words were passed between them. And he ended up pushing her up against the table and she fell over the table, and he hit her. And I\u2019m like get off of her. Like he\u2014when he hit her, then I\u2019m like pulling him, and he turned to me to hit me, but we both were like fighting him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Zimmerman related the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">A. When we arrived in the store, she and I were talking. We walked into the store together. A gentleman walked into the store and he made an off comment to me, but I just ignored it. And he walked up to Miss Nelson. And while Miss Nelson was talking [tol this gentleman, I was talking to another guy slightly right behind her. I saw the conversation ahead of me with Miss Nelson and the gentleman getting a little agitated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\">Q. Early on, could you hear what was being said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">A. I heard some of the conversation. Yes. The majority of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-11\">Q. Alright. When\u2014when was the first that you heard what was taking place? A. Like I heard her say go ahead. Like go ahead. And he\u2019s like\u2014then I heard him saying what? I\u2019ll take your stuff. I\u2019ll rob you. I\u2019ll take your stuff. And that\u2019s when I was like\u2014I said excuse me to the person I was talking to, and I mentioned to the gentleman, I was like, you know, I tapped him, and I was like just go ahead. I was like leave her alone. And that\u2019s when he turned to me and was like what B? I\u2019ll take your stuff too. And so, after that, it got physical between him and I. Out of not thinking, I told Miss Nelson just to like, you know, hold my bag, whatever, because he was getting in my face and I felt threatened. He was in my face telling me well, I\u2019ll take your stuff too. That\u2019s when I like told her to hold my bag. And I was like just go ahead. And he pushed me. I told him to go ahead once again and he pushed me again. That\u2019s when I hit him and he started\u2014 we started fighting. Miss Nelson jumped into the fight, because he and I were fighting. We were fighting in the store. The three of us were fighting. He somehow\u2014like during the fight, he backed me up against the table and I was pushed back onto a table, and he hit me in my eye twice. While I was trying to get up, Miss Nelson was like trying to get out the store, trying to get to her car, and call Police. And he was chasing after her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-12\">Q. Did you see that individual with his hands on Miss Nelson\u2019s purse or any other part of her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-13\">A. Yes, I did. I saw him grabbing her bag. She had it on her shoulder and I saw him like grabbing at it like in a motion to try to pull it off of her arm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-14\">Q. After he said, I\u2019ll take\u2014I\u2019ll take your stuff too, did he attempt to or get his hands on\u2014on your belongings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-15\">A. I don\u2019t really recollect him trying to grab my stuff, because I was telling like Miss Nelson to hold my bag. Like in the hustle of it all, I don\u2019t remember him actually trying to grab my possessions. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>She testified that the conversation between defendant and Nelson \u201cstarted off as friendly.\u201d She did not see defendant gesture to his pants and say \u201csee what I got here or anything like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AWF\">On appeal, through counsel, defendant presents a single argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">THE JURY INSTRUCTION ON ARMED ROBBERY OMITTED THE MENTAL STATE OF \u201cKNOWINGLY\u201d WITH RESPECT TO THE SIMULATION OF A WEAPON BY WORDS AND GESTURES\u2014A CRITICAL ERROR WHERE THE JURY COULD HAVE DOUBTED WHETHER DEFENDANT KNOWINGLY OR PURPOSEFULLY SIMULATED THE POSSESSION OF A WEAPON. (Not Raised Below)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">In a supplemental pro se brief, defendant argues as follows: <em>POINT ONE: </em>THE TRIAL COURT FAILED TO EXPLAIN THE ELEMENTS OF \u201cKNOWINGLY\u201d WITH REGARD TO THE SIMULATION OF A WEAPON, AND THE CULPABILITY THAT IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO INFLICT BODILY INJURY OR USES OF FORCE AS AN ELEMENT OF FIRST DEGREE ARMED ROBBERY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\"><em>POINT TWO: </em>THE TRIAL COURT FAILURE TO MOLD FIRST DEGREE ARMED ROBBERY IN TO THE LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSE OF ATTEMPTED ROBBERY DENIED DEFENDANT A FAIR TRIAL AND WAS CLEARLY CAPABLE OF PRODUCING AN UNJUST RESULT IN THIS CASE. <em>U.S. CONST </em>AMEND. VI, XIV; <em>N.J. CONST </em>(1947) ART I. 1, 9, 10.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Because no weapon was found in defendant\u2019s possession, the armed robbery charge was premised on his having simulated the possession of a deadly weapon. <em>See State v. Harris, </em>357 <em>N.J.Super. </em>532, 545, 816 A.2d 171 (App.Div.2003). In that regard, the judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-9\">The count one charge is first degree robbery. There is an additional element. And it\u2019s this. In this case, the State alleges further that the defendant did not actually possess a deadly weapon, but instead threatened the immediate use of such weapon, and engaged in conduct or gestures which simulated possession of a deadly weapon, and which would lead a reasonable person to believe that the defendant possessed such a weapon. Consequently, I must first explain, to you ... what deadly means in the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-10\">A deadly weapon is any firearm or other weapon, device, instrument, material or substance, which in the manner it is used or is intended to be used, is known to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury, or which in the manner it is fashioned would lead the victim reasonably to believe it to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-11\">[To] simulate means to assume the outward qualities or appearance of, often with the intent to deceive. It is a feigned pretended act usually to mislead or deceive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>The State does not have to prove that the defendant actually possessed a real deadly weapon, rather the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant led Rakema Nelson to reasonably believe, by words and conduct or gestures, that the defendant possessed such a deadly weapon. It is not sufficient that the defendant only made a threat or a reference to a weapon alone. In other words, the Stale must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant not only threatened the ... immediate use of a deadly weapon, but it must also prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant engaged in conduct or gestures which would lead a reasonable person to believe that the defendant did possess an object, which would constitute a deadly weapon, as I just described it to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">In this case, the State alleges that the defendant told Rakema Nelson \u201cgive me your shit, while holding his hand in his waist, and stating do you know what I got here?\u201d You must determine whether the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the combination of words and conduct, or words and gestures created a reasonable belief in the victim to believe the defendant possessed a deadly weapon capable of causing death or serious bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Defendant\u2019s contention is that the judge failed to assign a mental state of knowingly to the simulation of possession of a weapon. He argues that such a charge was critical in this case because the jury could have rationally entertained a reasonable doubt as to his intent. Defendant\u2019s intent, the argument continues, turned on whether his gesture to his pants was meant to convey possession of a weapon or was, in the circumstances, no more than a crude sexual reference. Here, the judge defined \u201cknowingly\u201d in connection with that aspect of robbery requiring infliction of bodily injury or the use or threatened use of force. However, in an entirely separate part of the instructions concerning simulation, quoted above, the judge did not charge any mental state. We agree with defendant that this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">In <em>State v. Sewell, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>133, 134, 603 A.2d 21 (1992), the Court addressed \u201cthe level of culpability necessary to convert theft into robbery.\u201d Specifically, the Court had \u201cto determine the culpability that a defendant must have when he inflicts injury or uses force against another in the course of a theft in order to escalate theft into robbery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 138, 603 A.2d 21. In the absence of legislative intent to the contrary, where no mental state is ascribed to a crime or its material elements, the \u201cgap-filler\u201d provision of the penal code comes into play. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2c(3). That provision provides for a mental state of knowingly where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>none is stated. <em>Sewell, supra, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 188-150, 608 A.2d 21. As a result, the Court ascribed the mental state of knowingly to the injury/force element of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Defendant argues that just as <em>Sewell </em>ascribes the mental state of knowingly to the force/injury element of second-degree robbery, that same mental state should be required for the weapon possession/simulation of a weapon that raises second-degree robbery to first-degree. That conclusion is not, however, inescapable. Indeed, the Model Charge, which the judge followed here, contains no mental state for the elevating armed/simulation element. Model Charges can, of course, be wrong or, as in <em>Sewell </em>itself, incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">In <em>State v. Thomas, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>119, 137-38, 900 A.2d 797 (2006), the Court addressed whether that portion of the eluding statute that raises the offense from third-degree to second-degree (whether the flight or attempt to elude creates a risk of death or injury to any person) requires an appropriate mental state. In resolving that question in the negative, the Court adopted the reasoning of <em>State v. Dixon, </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>126,135-36, 787 A.2d 211 (App.Div. 2001), <em>certif. denied, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>181, 796 A.2d 898 (2002). There, we held that the structure of the eluding statute, N.J.S.A 2C:29-2b, is such \u201cthat the \u2018risk of death or injury\u2019 factor, whether considered a sentence enhancer or element of the second-degree crime,\u201d does not require a knowing mental state; such mens rea is only applicable to the underlying third-degree crime. <em>Id. </em>at 136, 787 A.2d 211. We noted that in the eluding statute, the \u201crisk of death or injury\u201d language is separated from the rest of the statute by a semi-colon and, unlike the first portion of the statute, the clause after the semi-colon is not preceded by \u201cknowingly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135, 787 A.2d 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The robbery statute is structured differently. The deadly weapon possession/simulation enhancer elements are found in a separate sub-section headed \u201cGrading,\u201d which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">Robbery is a crime of the second degree, except that it is a crime of the first degree if in the course of committing the theft the actor attempts to kill anyone, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>purposely inflicts or attempts to inflict serious bodily injury, or is armed with, or uses or threatens the immediate use of a deadly weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>2C:15-1b]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">As is evident, there are three elements that can elevate the offense to first-degree robbery. The first is \u201cattempts to kill.\u201d By definition, an attempt requires purposeful conduct. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-la. The second element, \u201cinflicts or attempts to inflict serious bodily injury\u201d is preceded by a stated mens rea of \u201cpurposely.\u201d The third element, and the one of concern here, is the \u201carmed with, or uses or threatens the immediate use of a deadly weapon.\u201d It would be an anomaly if only the \u201carmed with\u201d element did not require any mens rea, at least where simulation of a weapon is concerned. A reasonable argument could be made that \u201carmed with\u201d a deadly weapon could be viewed as reflecting \u201ca legislative intent to impose strict liability,\u201d <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:2-2c(3), analogous to the risk of harm factor in the eluding statute, discussed in <em>Dixon, supra. </em>One is either armed with a deadly weapon or not. Intent would seldom, if ever, be an issue. The same cannot be said concerning the \u201cthreatens the immediate use of\u2019 language. Words can be ambiguous; a threat may not be explicit, but may be implied. Here, intent becomes significant. Did the defendant intend that his words convey a threat or were they intended as humorous or only an expression of anger such as the common remark, \u201cI could kill you for that.\u201d Examples abound. Justice Albin\u2019s observations in <em>State v. Garron, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>147,173, 827 A.2d 243 (2003), are apt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-8\">[W]e first must say a word on the mystique of language and manners. Men and women express their feelings and desires in many different ways, from the demonstrative and unequivocal to the subtle and suggestive. Communications in the most mundane matters may have many layers of meaning. Interpreting language and conduct concerning our passions and affairs of the heart may be no easier than deciphering hieroglyphics. Some remarks, if taken literally will mean one thing, and if taken in jest another, and if taken half-in-jest, both one thing and another. Unraveling the riddle of the messages we convey through body language and the spoken word requires a high degree of discernment, for often there are surface and underlying meanings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">The need for a mens rea is even more pronounced when the threat is based on simulation. Gestures can be, at least, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>ambiguous as words and, at worst, even more so. The present case presents such an example.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">As a result, we are satisfied that the simulation element requires a mens rea. While, as we have noted, the same logic would apply to the threatening element, we need not resolve that question in this case. Where a statute does not expressly designate a culpable mental state, but, as we have determined, \u201cnecessarily involves such culpable mental state,\u201d the gap-filler provision of the Code imputes a mental state of knowingly. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2c(3). Indeed, that same provision provides that in the absence of a clear indication of legislative intent to impose strict liability, a statute should be construed to contain a knowing mens rea. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">While the use of a mental state of purposely in the two preceding clauses of the enhancer section would suggest that the same mens rea should apply to the threatening/simulation element, the statute itself is silent and, therefore, logic aside, the Code imports only a knowing mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Our conclusion is fortified by the fact that the \u201carmed with\u201d or \u201cthreatens the immediate use\u201d of language was modeled on the <em>New York Penal Code </em>\u00a7 160.15. <em>The New Jersey Penal Code, Volume II Commentary, Final Report of the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission </em>214 (1971). And in construing that statute, New York\u2019s highest court has required that a defendant <em>\u201cconsciously </em>display something that could reasonably be perceived as a firearm <em>with the intent </em>of compelling an owner of property to deliver it up or for the purpose of preventing or overcoming resistance to the taking.\u201d <em>People v. Baskerville, </em>60 <em>N.Y.2d </em>374, 469 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>646, 457 N.E.2d 752, 756 (1983) (citations omitted) (emphasis added). The defendant must \u201cconsciously manifest the presence of an object to the victim in such a way that the victim reasonably perceives that the defendant has a [weapon].\u201d <em>People v. Lopez, </em>73 <em>N.Y.2d </em>214, 538 N.Y.S.2d 788, 535 N.E.2d 1328,1332 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>The State places great reliance on <em>State v. Chapland, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>275, 901 A.2d 351 (2006), in which the Court addressed simulated possession of a weapon under the armed robbery statute. However, the issue there was whether it was necessary \u201cthat the victim actually see some tangible item that is supposed to be the simulated weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 278, 901 A.2d 351. The Court held it was not necessary for the victim to see a tangible concealed object \u201cbut rather that the combination of words and a defendant\u2019s gesture or action can establish the reasonable impression that the defendant possesses a deadly weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290, 901 A.2d 351. The question we address was not before the Court in <em>Chapland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">It is true, as the State asserts, that the Court in <em>Chapland </em>observed that the trial court\u2019s charge on simulation, <em>id. </em>at 280-82, 901 A.2d 351, drawn from the Model Charge, <em>id. </em>at 288, 901 A.2d 351, \u201cprovided the jury with a fair statement of the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 292, 901 A.2d 351. We do not read that comment as constituting an unqualified endorsement of the charge beyond the issue confronting the Court in that case. In particular, we do not agree with the State\u2019s suggestion that the Court \u201ccould have addressed [the present claim] in <em>Chapland sua sponte </em>and ruled against the State.\u201d What the Court might have done is not relevant; what it did do is of significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">In any event, we note a significant deviation between the Model Charge as presently constituted and as given to the jury in <em>Chapland, </em>with the charge given in <em>State v. Harris, </em>357 <em>N.J.Super. </em>532, 816 A.2d 171 (App.Div.2003), quoted in <em>Chapland, supra, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>at 287, 901 A.2d 351. It was the <em>Harris </em>decision that led to revision of the Model Charge to include language on simulation. <em>Id. </em>at 288, 901 A.2d 351. In <em>Harris, </em>the charge required the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt \u201cthat the defendant, through his words and gestures, <em>intentionally led </em>[the victim] to reasonably believe that [he] had a real gun____\u201d <em>Harris, supra, </em>357 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 545, 816 A.2d 171. (emphasis added.) Inexplicably, the Model Charge omitted the critical word \u201cintentionally,\u201d an omission that carried through to the charge delivered in <em>Chapland </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>to the present case as well. As we have said, the need for an intentional act on the part of the defendant is critical in the case of simulation. Otherwise, the charge is left to focus only on the victim\u2019s reasonable belief, without consideration of defendant\u2019s intent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">We agree with the State that defendant did not raise this issue below, requiring that we measure it for plain error. <em>R. </em>2:10\u2014 2. Under the circumstances here, where defendant\u2019s intent at the time he interacted with Ms. Nelson was his central defense, the omission of a mental state on this critical element could easily have resulted in an unjust result. Indeed, the prosecutor spent part of his summation refuting defendant\u2019s suggestion that he was only gesturing to his genitals rather than simulating possession of a weapon. We cannot say this error was harmless. <em>See State v. Pillar, </em>359 <em>N.J.Super. </em>249, 278-79, 820 A.2d 1 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>572, 832 A.2d 322 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-7\">We also agree with defendant that the dictionary definition of simulate contained in the Model Charge requires modification: \"To simulate means to assume the outward qualities or appearance of, <em>often with the intent to deceive. </em>It is a feigned, pretended act, <em>usually to mislead or deceive \" </em>(emphasis added). The emphasized language is, we believe, inappropriate because in the criminal context the act simulated must always\u2014not \u201cusually\u201d or \"often\u201d\u2014be intended to deceive. The use of usually or often could lead one to inappropriately conclude that a gesture not intended to deceive a victim into believing that a weapon is possessed might still constitute prohibited simulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
