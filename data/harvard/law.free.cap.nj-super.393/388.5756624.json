On leave granted, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the Administrator of the New Jersey Spill Compensation Fund appeal from the May 26, 2006 order of the Law Division dismissing on summary judgment the State\u2019s statutory claim against defendant Exxon Mobil Corporation (Exxon Mobil or defendant) to recover such natural resource damages. For reasons that follow, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">By way of background, at all relevant times Exxon Mobil operated petroleum refineries and petrochemical plants in both Linden and Bayonne. The Linden facility commenced operation as early as 1909 on 1300 acres (the Bayway site) and consisted of a refinery, two chemical plants, tank fields, and a distribution station. A waterfront area borders on the Arthur Kill. Two streams on the site join to form Morses Creek. Two tank fields on the site drain to the Rahway River. Land use in the vicinity of the site is residential, commercial, and industrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">The Bayonne site originally consisted of 640 acres, but as of the late 1960s, was reduced to 288 acres including 250 acres of land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>and 38 riparian waterfront acres. The site is surrounded by heavy and light industry, interconnected by a transportation network of roadways, railroads, and the navigable waters of the Kill Van Kull and Upper New York Bay. Platty Kill Creek is located to the west of the site, the Upper New York Bay to the north, and the Kill Van Kull to the south.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">During much of the period between 1909 and 1972, the Bayonne and Bayway refineries were interconnected by pipeline and operated as a single, integrated refinery and petrochemical facility, generally known as the \u201cNew Jersey Works\u201d up until 1954, and thereafter the \u201cJersey Works\u201d. According to Exxon Mobil, the United States government controlled production activities at the New Jersey Works during World War II, resulting in increased production and greater quantities of wastes that needed disposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">It is undisputed that during the course of its ownership and operation of these two sites, Exxon Mobil discharged hazardous substances, including petroleum products, into the natural resources of the State, and as a result extensive contamination exists beneath these properties, for which defendant acknowledges it is jointly and severally liable under the Spill Act. Consequently, in November 1991, Exxon Mobil entered into two administrative consent orders (ACOs) with DEP, in which it agreed to remediate the Bayway and Bayonne sites. The ACOs included provisions that contaminants had been detected in some portions of the soils and groundwater on and under each of the sites, and that Exxon Mobil had undertaken investigation, cleanup, and remediation operations on those sites under the direction and control of DEP. Significant for present purposes, each of the ACOs recognized that the DEP\u2019s site remediation program did not preclude the State from seeking further relief for damages to natural resources:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADU\">This Administrative Consent Order shall not be construed to affect or waive the claims of federal or State natural resource trustees against any party for damages for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Correspondingly, Exxon Mobil acknowledged further that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag\">the police power of the State extends to the protection and conservation of natural resources which are not the private property of any person or entity; admits that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>by a longstanding legal fiction this proposition is sometimes inexactly expressed by saying that the State is the owner of natural resources for the benefit of its people; admits that DEP has certain regulatory authority with respect to natural resources within the State provided by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Apparently, cleanup processes underway at the two sites pursuant to the ACOs for the past fifteen years continue to date.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">As part of its oversight of remediation of contaminated sites, DEP promulgated Technical Rules, <em>(N.J.A.C. </em>7:26E-1.1 to -8.7) and Oversight Regulations that together provide the means, methods and requirements for parties to investigate and remediate contaminated sites in order to qualify for and obtain a \u201cno further action\u201d determination from DEP for such remediation. It has been DEP\u2019s longstanding position that \u201cremediation\u201d is just one of the processes involved in the cleanup of refinery sites and removal of contaminants thereon. According to DEP, remediation involves the cleanup of contaminants to \u201crisk-based\u201d levels, whereas \u201crestoration\u201d and \u201creplacement\u201d requires return of the natural resource to its pre-discharge condition (primary restoration) and replacement of the natural resource \u201cservices and values\u201d lost in the interim between contamination and cleanup completion (compensatory restoration). The latter include both \u201chuman use\u201d and \u201cecological\u201d services, which encompass water uses such as for drinking and irrigation, and recreation such as swimming, fishing, boating, bird watching, or nature viewing. Thus, as one component of \u201cnatural resource damages\u201d (NRD), DEP includes recovery for the residual injury that remains once the remedial cleanup process is completed, that is for the \u201closs of use\u201d of the affected natural resource caused by the polluter\u2019s wrong. In other words, \u201closs of use\u201d is a means of measuring the reduction of services provided by a polluted natural resource and establishing a value for its replacement.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">As DEP noted in its responses to comments on the initial promulgation of the Technical Rules back in 1993, \u201crestoration of natural resources is an important component in any remediation effort and the Department has the authority [under the Spill Act] to require it as appropriate.\u201d 25 <em>N.J.R. </em>2281, 2289 (June 7, 1993) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>(response to comment 56). Upon readoption of the Technical Rules in May 1997, changes included: (i) addition of \u201cnatural resource damages\u201d to the list of components contained in the definition of \u201cremedial action costs\u201d at <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:26E-1.8; (ii) definition of \u201cinjury\u201d, at <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:26E-1.8, as \u201cany adverse change or impact of a discharge on a natural resource or impairment of a natural resource service, whether direct or indirect, long term or short term, and includes the partial or complete destruction or loss of the natural resource\u201d; (iii) definition of \u201cdamages\u201d, at <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:26E-1.8, as \u201cthe amount of money the natural resource trustees, identified pursuant to 42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 9601 et seq., have determined is necessary to restore, rehabilitate, replace or otherwise compensate for the injury to natural resources as a result of a discharge.\u201d DEP published the following comment with the readoption of the Technical Rules:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\">In New Jersey, the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection is the designated trustee charged with the duty of administering and protecting the State\u2019s natural resources. The Department\u2019s Office of Natural Resource Damages represents the Commissioner in this capacity and coordinates with the other trustees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-6\">In keeping with its status as trustee for the public of the State\u2019s natural resources, the Department is concerned about those sites where discharges of hazardous substances impact or may potentially impact natural resources. Also of concern is remedial actions which, through their implementation, injure natural resources (such as dewatering a wetland through ground water extraction for treatment, or loss of functional habitat for roadway construction). The Departs ment is authorized to seek compensation for such natural resource damages through legal means or cooperative settlement, with the objective of restoring the injured or lost resources. The Department\u2019s Office of Natural Resource Damages works closely with the various remediation programs to evaluate contaminated sites for natural resource damage claims. The Department encourages the person responsible for conducting the remediation to consult with and coordinate with the Office of Natural Resource Damages in assessing and estimating natural resource injuries and damages. Much of the information collected in the baseline ecological evaluation and follow-up ecological risk assessment efforts can be used in determining the injury to natural resources and consequently, the damage. Integrating natural resource damage issues into the site remediation program ensures collection of data that is useful for both the cleanup programs and trustees, promotes a remedy selection process that is cognizant of minimizing further potential injuries while creating opportunities for building restoration into the final remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\">[29 <em>N.J.R. </em>2278(b), 2392-93 (May 19, 1997) (response to comment 900).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Consistent therewith, DEP instituted a natural resource damage (NRD) initiative in 2002, memorialized in the agency\u2019s Policy Directive 2003-07 of September 2003. <em>See </em>Bradley M. Campbell, Commissioner, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, Policy Directive 2003-07 (Sept. 24, 2003) http://www.state.nj. us/dep/eommissioner/policy/pdir2003-07.htm (last visited May 17, 2007). This directive stated that responsible parties might alleviate the effects on the public of the loss of use of natural resources by providing \u201csubstitute resources or resource services,\u201d which could be \u201cboth in-kind and out-of-kind.\u201d As to groundwater resources, the Policy Directive\u2019s suggestions included \u201cacquisition of aquifer recharge areas, water re-use or recycling projects, infrastructure improvements to control stormwater or improve recharge, reforestation efforts to improve infiltration and water retention, or any other measure that enhances the water resource base____\u201d For lost recreational uses, the Policy Directive recommended \u201cenhancements to public access, creation of or improvements to state or local parks, or the provision of other alternate recreational opportunities.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">With particular reference to Exxon Mobil, DEP\u2019s review and investigation identified \u201csome preliminary restoration work on natural resources\u201d that was recommended for the Bayway and Bayonne sites. On the former, one natural resource involved was the Morses Creek, which traverses the site and ultimately discharges into the Arthur Kill waterway. Morses Creek was historically used as a discharge trench for the refinery\u2019s waste water, and also received contamination from other facility operations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>discharges. The creek\u2019s sediments were highly contaminated and the vegetation on its banks were severely diminished, if not destroyed. A dam at the creek\u2019s mouth, and \u201c[b]ulkheading and rip-rap of the creek\u2019s banks\u201d had precluded daily tidal influences to the creek\u2019s flood plain and associated marshes. According to John Sacco, Director of DEP\u2019s Office of Natural Resource Restoration, removing the dam and hardened creek banks would restore tidal flow to many of the former floodplain areas, which would be \u201cessential to reestablishing former salt marshes\u201d. Creek dredging, with appropriate air emission controls, \u201cwould remove free product and contaminated sediments, thereby restoring suitable substrate for recolonization of benthic organisms\u201d. Similar dredging and replanting would be needed for the headwaters of Piles Creek, which was another ecosystem that also was compromised by hazardous constituents introduced over an extensive period.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Also on the Bayway site, marshland adjacent to the creek was \u201cnow mostly covered with a tar of petroleum products or filled with other hazardous constituents and debris,\u201d creating a \u201chighly degraded ecosystem\u201d. According to Sacco, the contaminated sediments, fill, and tar would need to be removed, and clean substrate brought in, \u201cto reestablish intertidal elevations\u201d and restore marsh vegetation. Another forty-five acres of the Bayway site were comprised of \u201csludge lagoons,\u201d formerly tidal marshes which were used as hazardous waste disposal facilities. In the site remediation process, the lagoons were capped and walled to contain the contamination, but restoration would require excavation and reestablishment of marsh vegetation.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">On the Bayonne site, \u201cformer tidally influenced wetlands\u201d had been filled with chromium contaminated material, which Sacco recommended should be excavated and the wetlands environments rehabilitated. A portion of this site had been purchased from Exxon Mobil by International Matex Tank Terminals (IMTT), an entity that entered into an NRD settlement with the DEP. Under its settlement agreement, IMTT agreed to provide $3 million in funding over a four-and-a-half year period, for three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>projects: (a) $500,000 for completion of the North Forty Park in Bayonne; (b) construction of a public access walkway and viewing area in the vicinity of the Atlas Yacht Club; and (c) projects to eliminate or control combined sewer overflows in Bayonne. Sacco posited that, as compensation for the destruction of natural resources on its portions of the Bayonne site, Exxon Mobil could implement restoration projects similar to those being undertaken by IMTT.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">No agreement was struck. Consequently, in August 2004, DEP filed two complaints against Exxon Mobil, asserting Spill Act and common law claims of public nuisance and trespass, for natural resource damages for the discharge of hazardous substances at the Bayway site in Linden, and the Bayonne site. The complaints alleged that Exxon Mobil and its predecessors in interest discharged hazardous substances on the sites during decades of oil refining, petrochemical manufacturing and distribution operations. These operations allegedly affected natural resources that included: groundwater, surface water, and ecological resources such as wetlands, the plants and animals of the food chain that wetlands sustain, and the important wetlands functions such as improving water quality, trapping sediment, recharging groundwater, and protecting shorelines and lands from flooding or erosion. Among the cleanup and removal costs sought, plaintiffs asserted claims for \u201cdamages, including lost use ... incurred for any natural resource of this State injured by the discharges of hazardous substances\u201d at the sites.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">On January 11, 2006, DEP moved for partial summary judgment, seeking a determination that Exxon Mobil was strictly liable as a matter of law for all cleanup and removal costs under the Spill Act, including the restoration of natural resources. Exxon Mobil cross-moved for summary judgment on the ground, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Spill Act does not provide liability for loss of use of natural resources. The Law Division granted both motions in part, holding that Exxon Mobil was strictly liable under the Spill Act for natural resource damages including restoration, but dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>missing DEP\u2019s statutory claims for loss of use damages, concluding as to the latter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">Without any legislative or appellate directive, the court will not expand the definition of cleanup and removal costs under the Spill Act to include damages for the loss of use of natural resources. Moreover, the court finds no other language in the Spill Act that would hold a discharger strictly liable for the loss of use of natural resources. Therefore, Exxon Mobil\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment, on this issue, is granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">We first briefly reiterate what is not in issue here. Exxon Mobil does not dispute that it is strictly liable under the Spill Act for the costs of physical restoration of natural resources damaged or destroyed by its discharge of hazardous substances\u2014what DEP refers to as \u201cprimary restoration\u201d costs\u2014as part of the \u201ccleanup and removal costs\u201d expressly stated in the Act. Indeed, the motion judge, on summary judgment, held defendant strictly liable as a matter of law for \u201ccleanup and removal\u201d costs including physical restoration of damaged or destroyed natural resources, and that determination is not before us on leave to appeal. Exxon Mobil also acknowledges that \u201closs of use\u201d damages are available to the State under the common law* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and other state statutes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The only issue therefore is whether the Spill Act affords the State the same relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">We turn then to a review of the Spill Act and its pertinent provisions. The Spill Act was enacted in 1976 as \u201ca pioneering effort by government to provide monies for a swift and sure response to environmental contamination.\u201d <em>Marsh v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot., </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>137, 144, 703 A.2d 927 (1997). In its preamble, the Legislature made detailed findings and a declaration of public policy to guide the interpretation of the Act. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Specifically, the Legislature declared that New Jersey\u2019s lands and waters are \u201ca unique and delicately balanced resource,\u201d deserving of \u201cprotection and preservation\u201d by the State as \u201ctrustee, for the benefit of its citizens,\u201d and that the \u201cdischarge of petroleum products and other hazardous substances ... constitutes a threat to the economy and environment of this State.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11a. Accordingly, \u201c[t]he Legislature intends by the passage of this act to exercise the powers of this State to ... provide liability for damage sustained within this State as a result of any discharge of said substances.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">To provide for swift and adequate compensation, and to implement these legislative goals, the Spill Act levied an excise tax on major chemical and petroleum facilities with the proceeds deposited into a permanent fund, known as the Spill Fund. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11h; <em>Exxon Corp. v. Hunt, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>110, 114, 534 A.2d 1 (1987). Later amendments widened the Spill Fund\u2019s tax base, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11h (as amended by <em>L. </em>1979, c. 346, \u00a7 6), and shifted control of the Fund from the Department of the Treasury to the DEP. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11i (as amended by <em>L. </em>1985, c. 115, \u00a7 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The breadth of the Spill Act\u2019s findings and declaration is matched by its equally expansive strict joint and several liability scheme:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-8\">Except as provided in <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11g22], <em>any person who has discharged a hazardous substance, </em>or is in any way responsible for any hazardous substance, <em>shall be strictly liable, jointly and severally, without regard to fault, for aU cleanup and removal costs no matter by wham incurred. </em>Such person shall also be strictly liable, jointly and severally, without regard to fault, for all cleanup and removal costs incurred by the department or a local unit pursuant to [N.J.S.A 58:10-23,11f],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-9\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11g(c)(1) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">The Spill Act explicitly gives DEP two options regarding a hazardous discharge: (1) cleanup the discharge and bring an action to recover the costs, or (2) direct the discharger to cleanup or arrange for the cleanup of the discharge. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11f(a)(1) and -23.11q. A third option, implicit in DEP\u2019s broad implied powers, is that DEP can require responsible polluters to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>pay for cleanup and removal costs prior to remedial action. <em>In re Kimber Petroleum Corp., </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>69, 74, 539 A.2d 1181, <em>appeal dismissed sub nom. Kimber Petroleum Corp. v. Daggett, </em>488 <em>U.S. </em>935,109 <em>S.Ct. </em>358,102 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>349 (1988). Therefore, under the Spill Act, DEP has two roles, including the managerial role of deploying public funds to restore the environment and abate damages, and as \u201ckeeper of the public purse.\u201d <em>Marsh, supra, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>at 145, 703 A.2d 927. \u201cDEP must attempt to fulfill both those roles in the context of complex environmental cleanups and a finite source of cleanup funds.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The Act \u201cis quite comprehensive in its scope ...,\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot. v. Ventron Corp. (DEP v. </em>Ventron), 94 <em>N.J. </em>473, 496-97, 468 A.2d 150 (1983), and vests DEP with \u201cbroad implied powers.\u201d <em>In re Kimber Petroleum Corp., supra, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 74, 539 A.2d 1181. It is also \u201cconsistent with the long-standing principle that the Legislature may prohibit activities that constitute a nuisance.\u201d <em>DEP v. Ventron, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 494, 468 A.2d 150. <em>See also Dep\u2019t of Tramp, v. PSC Res., Inc., </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. </em>447, 459, 419 A.2d 1151 (Law Div.1980) (\u201cTorts against the environment find their origin in the law of nuisance and trespass.\u201d) In fact, the Act has been viewed as a codification of the common law cause of action in nuisance, under which \u201cthe State has the right to obtain damages for an injury to public resources or the environment.\u201d <em>Ohaus v. Cont\u2019l Cas. Ins. Co., </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>501, 509, 679 A.2d 179 (App.Div.1996) (citing <em>Lansco, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot., </em>138 <em>N.J.Super. </em>275, 283, 350 A.2d 520 (Ch.Div.1975), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>145 <em>N.J.Super. </em>433, 368 A.2d 363 (App.Div.1976), <em>certif denied, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>57, 372 A.2d 322 (1977)). Indeed, our Supreme Court has held that the Spill Act did \u201cnot so much change substantive liability as it established] new remedies for activities recognized as tortious both under prior statutes and the common law.\u201d <em>DEP v. Ventron, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 499, 468 A.2d 150. And in this respect, DEP claims that one of these remedies is the State\u2019s right to recover for the \u201closs of use\u201d of natural resources injured or destroyed by a discharge, a claim embodied in both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>agency regulations and policy directive. In assessing DEP\u2019s claim, we are mindful not only of the Legislature\u2019s explicit directive that <em>\u201c[tjhis act, </em>being necessary for the general health, safety, and welfare of the people of this State, <em>shall be liberally construed to effect its purposes,\u201d N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11x (emphasis added); <em>see also In re Kimber Petroleum Corp., supra, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 74, 539 A.2d 1181; <em>Metex Corp. v. Fed. Ins. Co., </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>95, 114, 675 A.2d 220 (App.Div.1996), but also our own longstanding tradition of deferring, where appropriate, to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its authority. <em>In re Adoption of N.J.A.C. 7:26B, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>442,451-52, 608 A.2d 288 (1992); <em>Lower Main St. Assocs. v.

Bd. of Trs., </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>55, 69-70, 389 A.2d 465 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Governed by these principles, we conclude DEP\u2019s construction is supported by the text of the statute. As noted, the Spill Act provides for strict joint and several liability, without regard to fault, \u201cfor all cleanup and removal costs no matter by whom incurred.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11g(c)(1). \u201cCleanup and removal costs\u201d are specifically defined in the Spill Act as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQr\">all direct costs associated with a discharge, and those indirect costs that may be imposed by the department pursuant to <em>[N.J.S.A </em>58:10B-2.1] associated with a discharge, incurred by the State or its political subdivisions or their agents or any person with written approval from the department in the: (1) removal or attempted removal of hazardous substances, or (2) <em>taking of reasonable measures to prevent or mitigate damage to the public health, safety, or welfare, </em>including, but not limited to, public and private property, shorelines, beaches, surface waters, water columns and bottom sediments, soils and other affected property, including wildlife and other natural resources, and shall include costs incurred by the State for the indemnification and legal defense of contractors pursuant to <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11f8 et seq.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>58:10-23.11b (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Thus, the definition of \u201ccleanup and removal cost\u201d includes costs \u201cincurred\u201d to \u201cmitigate damage to the public ... welfare.\u201d To \u201cmitigate\u201d means \u201c[t]o make less severe or intense.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1023 (8th ed.2004). \u201cMitigation\u201d is a term used in related areas of DEP regulation, as for instance in the Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:9B-1 to -30, which provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>for compensation for the loss or disturbance of wetlands. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-13; -21c. Likewise, DEP\u2019s Policy Directive explicitly states a preference \u201cfor the performance of restoration work and resource protection in lieu of payment of money damages,\u201d and in so doing, has adopted a \u201cforward-looking\u201d approach seeking natural resource improvements to make up for historical lost use, instead of a \u201cbackward-looking\u201d settlement of a dollar judgment owing. In fact, the Policy Directive specifically suggests that responsible parties, such as defendant, might alleviate the effects on the public of the loss of use of natural resources by providing \u201csubstitute resources or resource services\u201d which could be \u201cboth in-Mnd and out-of-kind.\u201d Since, according to the Policy Directive, those substitutes \u201cmust bear a nexus to the injured resource and should be in the same watershed,\u201d it is not unreasonable to conclude that if DEP ultimately proves injury to the public\u2019s use of natural resources in the area, the types of \u201cremedies\u201d DEP identified in its Policy Directive could indeed lessen the severity or intensity of those public injuries by replenishing the natural resources of the area, even if the actual natural resources lost cannot be restored or replaced. Thus, the approach taken in DEP\u2019s Policy Directive, and implemented in this case, is one that seeks to have responsible parties \u201cmitigate damage to the public health, safety, or welfare\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10\u2014 23.11b. Such \u201closs of use\u201d damages, we conclude, are a component of costs of mitigating damage to public natural resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Defendant nevertheless argues that because <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11g(c)(1), the only section of the Spill Act imposing strict liability <em>directly </em>against polluters, does not expressly mention \u201closs of use\u201d damages, then DEP is without authority to seek such relief thereunder and that its removal costs are limited to those incurred under the ACO. We disagree. The Spill Act vests DEP with broad implied powers. <em>In re Kimber Petroleum Corp., supra, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 74-75, 539 A.2d 1181. And \u201cif such a power is implied, it is just as effective as if it had been expressed.\u201d <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot. and Energy, </em>283 <em>N.J.Super. </em>331, 341, 661 A.2d 1314 (App.Div.1995). Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>given the obvious remedial purposes of the statutory scheme, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11v, defendant\u2019s insistence on such a strict interpretation, which leaves the public less than whole for its loss, is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Eather, lending the Act an expansive reading necessary to accomplish its goals, <em>Metex Corp., supra, </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 114, 675 A.2d 220, the definition of \u201ccleanup and removal costs\u201d is sufficiently broad to encompass DEP\u2019s power to assess damages caused to natural resources and to require compensation for their loss of use. Indeed, \u201c[t]he definition of cleanup and removal costs is broad and consistent with the broad authority granted [DEP] under the Spill Act.\u201d <em>E.I. du Pont, supra, </em>283 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 342, 661 A.2d 1314 (internal quotation marks omitted). The term has been interpreted to include administrative oversight costs, <em>id. </em>at 341, 661 A.2d 1314; the costs of legal services necessary to remediate an environmental insult, <em>In re Thomas, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>580, 585-86, 651 A.2d 1063 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>95, 660 A.2d 1194 (1995); and the costs of natural resource physical restoration, <em>In re Kimber Petroleum Corp., supra, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 85, 539 A.2d 1181, even though none of these has been expressly articulated in the Spill Act\u2019s liability provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Nothing in <em>Analytical Measurements, Inc. v. Keuffel &amp; Esser Co., </em>843 <em>F.Supp. </em>920, 931 (D.N.J.1993), on which defendant relies, is to the contrary. That case involved claims by the property owner and her tenant, who had been held liable to DEP for Spill Act cleanup and removal costs, against a prior owner for contribution damages including the loss of a real estate contract, diminution in property value, and attorney\u2019s fees and other fees for defending the contract rescission suit, as well as investigating and overseeing the cleanup, coordinating with DEP, and defending the penalty action brought by DEP. <em>Ibid. </em>In denying relief, the court noted that nothing in the legislative history indicated an intent \u201cto expand the right of contribution under the Spill Act to include other expenses or damages.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>That holding simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>does not address DEP\u2019s authority to recover damages for the loss of use of natural resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">In any event, in discerning the breadth and scope of \u201ccleanup and removal costs,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11b should not be read in isolation, but as part of the statutory scheme as a whole. <em>See State v. Mortimer, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>517, 536, 641 A.2d 257, <em>cert. denied sub nom. Mortimer v. New Jersey, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>970, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>440, 130 L.Ed.2d 351 (1994); <em>State v. Angelo\u2019s Motor Sales, </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>200, 207, 310 A.2d 97 (App.Div.1973), <em>aff'd sub nom. State v. Parmigiani, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>154, 320 A.2d 161 (1974). In other words, all parts of the statute should be harmonized to give effect to the Act\u2019s overall meaning and purpose. <em>See DePalma v. Bldg. Inspection Underwriters, </em>350 <em>N.J.Super. </em>195, 222-23, 794 A.2d 848 (App.Div.2002). Integrated as such, we are satisfied that other provisions of the Spill Act reinforce the DEP\u2019s inclusive interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">For instance, in addressing the obligations of the Spill Fund, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11g.a identifies the types of \u201ccleanup and removal costs\u201d that may be sought from the Spill Fund, which in turn may pursue its subrogation rights against the polluter under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11u.b. Both provisions are structurally similar and have corresponding language. Thus, pursuant to section llg, DEP may go forward with \u201crestoration\u201d using Spill Fund monies, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11g.a(2), and thereafter, pursuant to section llu.b, may bring an enforcement action seeking reimbursement from responsible parties, which includes</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">the cost of restoration and replacement, where practicable, of any natural resource damaged or destroyed by a discharge!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbL\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>58:10-23.11u.b(4)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">These provisions were among the new sections added by <em>L. </em>1990, c. 75, \u00a7 1 enacted, interestingly enough, in the wake of the 1990 rupture of defendant\u2019s interrefinery pipeline connecting its Bay-way and Bayonne refineries.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Senate Environmental Quality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Committee Statement to that amendment (reprinted at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11u), notes that the substitute bill being reported \u201cauthorizes recovery in a civil or civil administrative action of compensatory damages for injuries to persons and damages to property, wildlife, and natural resources, and the replacement thereof.\u201d As evidenced by the clear language of the amendment, by enhancing DEP\u2019s enforcement authority, the Legislature intended to expand, not contract, the agency\u2019s abilities to recover compensatory damages from polluters.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Defendant instead focuses on the \u201cwhere practicable\u201d clause in both provisions, arguing that the Legislature could not have contemplated that restoration costs include compensatory restoration monies, because payment of money is always \u201cpracticable\u201d. The argument is unconvincing. As DEP\u2019s Policy Directive on natural resource damages reflects, loss of use damages may not always be synonymous with monetary compensation, but rather contemplates an array of options including substitute resources or resource services that, depending on the circumstances, may not always be a practicable remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">In any event, it is difficult to reconcile defendant\u2019s constricted interpretation with its concession that the cost of physical restoration is a \u201ccleanup and removal cost\u201d under the Spill Act. <em>See In re Kimber Petroleum Corp., supra, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 85, 539 A.2d 1181. Yet, if the term restoration, by all accounts, applies to the natural resource, no sound reason has been advanced why it should not also be deemed to apply as well to the value, use or benefit that the natural resource provides. Otherwise, if recoverable damages are limited merely to physical restoration, the amount of compensation would have no relation at all to the period of lost use. Such a limiting view of DEP\u2019s authority not only fails to make the public whole for its loss, but creates a disincentive for polluters to undertake timely remedial action. It is, simply put, inconsistent with the purpose and obvious meaning of the Act. We conclude therefore that \u201crestoration and replacement\u201d requires the return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>of natural resources to their pre-discharge condition and the replacement of natural resource \u201cservices\u201d lost in the interim.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Despite defendant\u2019s argument to the contrary, the Act\u2019s definition of \u201cremediation\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A </em>58.T0-23.llb, which specifically exempts natural resource damages, does not detract from this reasoning. The exemption simply does not apply to the broader meaning associated with \u201ccleanup and removal costs\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">As noted earlier, \u201cremediation\u201d to risk-based standards is different from \u201crestoration\u201d of natural resources to pre-discharge conditions (primary restoration) or \u201creplacement\u201d of the ecological services and values lost through compensation (compensatory restoration). Remediation, then, is just one of the processes covered by the broad definition of \u201ccleanup and removal costs\u201d, a more restricted and technical term, whose language of limitation first appeared in the Spill Act in 2001 as part of the amendments approved in <em>L. </em>2001, c. 154, and which was actually imported from other legislation with a different focus and purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">In this regard, the definition of remediation was first enacted in the Industrial Site Remediation Act (ISRA), <em>L. </em>1993, c. 139, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:K-6 to -14, which supplanted the Environmental Cleanup Responsibility Act (ECRA), <em>L. </em>1983, c. 330, and was later amended by the Brownfield and Contaminated Site Remediation Act (Brownfield Act), <em>L. </em>1997, c. 278, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5810B-1 to -31. Unlike the Spill Act, where liability is triggered by a discharge and imposed on the discharger, ECRA (and later ISRA), in an attempt to ensure that contamination is discovered and dealt with when funds are available, required that the seller of an industrial property (or the company seeking to close its business) had to investigate and remediate if contaminants were found. That law, however, led to abandonment of industrial properties, so the Brownfield Act was passed to encourage investment in, and development of, those properties by affording relief from natural resources damages liability. Thus, the exception from \u201cpayment of compensation for damage to, or loss of, natural resources\u201d in the definition of \u201cremediation\u201d is meant to shield new investors and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>developers who undertake to clean up problem sites, and not those entities responsible for the initial discharge and resultant pollution. As its legislative history makes clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">The substitute would also clarify that \u201cremediation\u201d does not include the payment of compensation for damages to, or loss of, natural resources. Therefore, a person who is not a responsible party and therefore eligible to receive a covenant not to sue, would not be hable for the payment of natural resource damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">[Senate Environment Committee Statement to SCR 2345, <em>L. </em>2001, c. 154, \u00a7 5.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">We are therefore satisfied that the term \u201cremediation\u201d in this context focuses on the type of property cleanup to be undertaken by new investors under the Brownfield Act, and not the original property owner (or successor in interest), who is a \u201cresponsible party\u201d for pollution of a site, not protected by the statutory shield.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">Any lingering doubt about the inclusiveness of \u201ccleanup and removal costs\u201d is dispelled not only by the Legislature\u2019s failure to interfere with DEP\u2019s uniform and long-continued construction of the Spill Act, <em>see Med. Soc\u2019y v. Dep\u2019t of Law &amp; Pub. Safety, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>18, 25-26, 575 A.2d 1348 (1990); <em>Malone v. Fender, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>129, 137, 402 A.2d 240 (1979), but, quite the opposite, its seeming ratification of the agency\u2019s NRD program by recent amendments to the Spill Act. <em>See GATX Terminals Corp. v. Dep\u2019t of Environ. Prot., </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>46, 53, 429 A.2d 355 (1981); <em>Borough of Matawan v. Monmouth County Bd. of Taxation, </em>51 <em>N.J. </em>291, 300, 240 A.2d 8 (1968); <em>Edwards v. Borough of Moonachie, </em>3 <em>N.J. </em>17, 24-25, 68 A.2d 744 (1949). In describing the scope of \u201ccleanup and removal costs\u201d, these amendments consistently refer to \u201ccompensation for damage to, or loss of, natural resources.\u201d In our view, in light of the express amendatory language and the obvious legislative intent, the Spill Act allows compensation for the loss of use of natural resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">In the earliest amendment, <em>L. </em>2001, c. 154, \u00a7 5, as described in the Senate Environment Committee Statement to SCR 2345, the Legislature extended the statute of limitations for civil actions brought by the State pursuant to laws concerning the remediation of contaminated sites or the closure of sanitary landfill facilities and \u201cfor the payment of compensation for damage to, or loss of, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>natural resources due to the discharge of a hazardous substance, pursuant to the State\u2019s environmental laws.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10B-17.1b(l). By extending the statute of limitations, the amendatory language reflects a legislative belief that the State has the authority to sue for natural resource damages, including damages for \u201closs of\u2019 natural resources due to hazardous discharges subject to the Spill Act. And in 2005, the Legislature further extended the statute of limitations for natural resource damages liability. <em>L. </em>2005, c. 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Thereafter, in <em>L. </em>2005, c. 4, the Legislature, in corresponding amendments to both the Spill Act and Brownsfield Act, extended the protection from NRD liability for certain non-polluters who acquired contaminated property after the discharge occurred and who met other conditions. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11f22; <em>N.J.S.A </em>58:10B-13.1; Assembly Environment and Solid Waste Committee Statement to Assembly, No. 2444. Specifically, the protection afforded included relief from the obligation to pay \u201ccompensation for damages to, or loss of, natural resources.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11f22. Obviously, the Legislature would not have had to afford non-polluters such liability protection unless the Legislature found them to be otherwise liable for natural resource damages under the Act, specifically, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11g.c, and recognized DEP\u2019s authority to seek such damages. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11f.f.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Most recently, <em>L. </em>2005, c. 348, an act \u201cconcerning protection from contribution suits,\u201d amended <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11f.a(2)(b) to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-7\">A person who has discharged a hazardous substance or is in any way responsible for the discharge of a hazardous substance who has resolved his liability to the State for cleanup and removal costs, <em>including the payment of compensation for damage to, </em>or <em>the lass of, natural resources, or for the restoration of natural resources, </em>and (i) has received a no further action letter from the State, or (ii) has entered into an administrative or judicially approved settlement with the State, shall not be liable for claims for contribution regarding matters addressed in the settlement or the no further action letter, as the case may be. The settlement shall not release any other person from liability for cleanup and removal costs who is not a party to the settlement, but shall reduce the potential liability of any other discharger or person in any way responsible for a discharged hazardous substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>at the site that is the subject of the no further action letter or the settlement by the amount of the no further action letter or the settlement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(emphasis added).] <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Unlike the earlier amendment dealing with Brownfield Act new investors, this one applies to polluters or their responsible party successors and affords them protection against contribution suits after they have settled their claims with DEP, including natural resource damages claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Once again, as with the earlier amendment, the Legislature would have had no need to extend protection against contribution liability for natural resource damages, including compensation damages for the loss of natural resources, unless the Legislature recognized that settling polluters would otherwise be liable under the Spill Act for such damages. Defendant\u2019s contrary argument, that the amendment simply addresses settlements for natural resource damages claims arising under other statutes, is strained. The amendment is to a Spill Act provision, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10-23.11f(a)(2)(b), and affords protection against contribution suits to those, otherwise subject to Spill Act liability, who have \u201cresolved [their] liability to the State for cleanup and removal costs, including the payment of compensation for damage to, or the loss of, natural resources, or for the restoration of natural resources.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">Defendant\u2019s argument also overlooks the fact that the amendment refers to \u201ccompensation for ... loss of natural resources\u201d <em>in addition to </em>\u201crestoration\u201d. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10\u201423.11f.a(2)(b); 58:10B-13.1. If, as defendant contends, only damages for physical restoration of a resource is permitted under the Act, the \u201ccompensation for damage to or loss of\u201d language contained in the amendatory provisions would be unnecessary and meaningless. Clearly, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>not proper statutory construction to reach a result that would render a provision completely meaningless. <em>See, e.g., Gabin v. Skyline Cabana Club, </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>550, 555, 258 A.2d 6 (1969). Stated another way, after a responsible party is ordered to pay primary restoration damages, the only residual uncompensated aspect of the injury and, therefore, what the Legislature intended to address by adopting \u201ccompensation for damage to, or loss of\u2019 language, may reasonably be regarded as the compensatory restoration damages that the DEP now seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">We find in these statutory amendments a clear legislative recognition of DEP\u2019s authority to seek compensation not just for physical injury to natural resources, but also for the loss of the benefits they provide. We deem it significant that the Legislature amended the Spill Act after DEP\u2019s adoption of the Policy Directive, with changes that obviously reflect not only the Legislature\u2019s awareness of the agency\u2019s natural resource damages initiative, but as well that body\u2019s approval of DEP\u2019s interpretation of its regulatory powers under the Spill Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">To conclude, we find that DEP\u2019s claim for \u201ccompensatory restoration\u201d\u2014loss of use damages\u2014is consistent with the Spill Act\u2019s express terms, is harmonious with legislative intent, and is in keeping with legislative directives articulated in the Act\u2019s recent amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-8\"> According to DEP, since inception of the NRD program, responsible parties often come to the agency with restoration plan proposals or seeking suggestions for restorations. Since 2002, DEP had executed voluntary settlements for natural resource damages covering approximately 1500 sites. Along with restoration efforts that predated the 2002 program, these settlements had resulted in preservation of more than 5200 acres for wildlife habitat and aquifer recharge areas, and in recovery of approximately $50 million in compensation for the public. Negotiations were underway at that time involving natural resource damage liability claims on 200 additional sites.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b428-8\"> <em>See Restatement (Second) of Torts, </em>\u00a7 929(1) (1979); <em>Ohaus v.
