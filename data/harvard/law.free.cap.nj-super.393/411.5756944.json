The testimony before the Montague Township Municipal Court revealed the following salient facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-14\">On the afternoon of May 19, 2005, Sussex County Sheriffs Officer Samantha Shpiruk was on patrol driving northbound on Route 23 in Montague Township. She observed a black Corvette proceeding southbound at a high rate of speed. Shpiruk estimat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>ed, and then confirmed through her Doppler radar unit, that it was traveling at sixty-six miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Shpiruk was asked on direct examination,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">Q. What is the speed limit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">A. 40 miles per hour.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">Q. Is there any stretch of that area that you saw him operating that\u2014in which that speed is permitted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-10\">Q. (cont\u2019d.) 66 miles an hour?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-11\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">Shpiruk turned her vehicle around in order to stop the Corvette, and, in doing so, lost sight of it temporarily. When she next saw the car, she estimated it was going 45 miles per hour and confirmed this speed on her radar unit. Shpiruk activated her car lights and stopped defendant\u2019s vehicle. She issued a summons to him for a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-98, specifically driving sixty-six miles per hour in a forty miles per hour zone. She was again asked by the prosecutor,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-13\">Q. All right, and what was the speed limit at that area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-14\">A. 40.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-15\">Q. All right. So he was still in excess of the speed. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-16\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-17\">On cross-examination, Shpiruk admitted that she lost sight of the black Corvette for some thirty seconds. She also acknowledged that she did not know if any property owner along that particular stretch of Route 23 also owned a black Corvette. Shpiruk nevertheless was sure the car she stopped was the car she initially clocked traveling at sixty-six miles per hour because it was the \u201conly black Corvette on that stretch of roadway\u201d and because there were \u201cno turn-offs\u201d on that part of the road, which Shpiruk knew because she was \u201cfrom around there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-18\">The State rested after Shpiruk\u2019s testimony and defendant produced no witnesses. In summation, relying upon <em>State v. Miller, </em>58 <em>N.J.Super. </em>538,156 A.2d 750 (Law Div.1959), defendant sought a judgment of acquittal contending the State had failed to establish what was the lawful rate of speed on that particular portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Route 23. Noting \u201c[t]here was testimony as to the speed [limit] on the highway,\u201d the judge found defendant was \u201cin fact traveling at 66 miles per hour in a 40 mile an hour zone\u201d and was guilty of violating <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-98. After reviewing the defendant\u2019s driving record, which included a number of prior violations, the municipal court judge fined defendant $400, imposed $39 in court costs and suspended defendant\u2019s license for sixty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Defense counsel strenuously objected to the suspension of defendant\u2019s license. The following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">[Defense counsel]: Your Honor, what is the legal basis for doing so?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">[The Judge]: The legal basis is your client has speeding tickets virtually all his life, continues to have speeding tickets and he needs to learn a lesson as to how to drive his vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">[Defense counsel]: That may bo the case, Your Honor, but the Legislature doesn\u2019t authorize you to suspend a license under that circumstance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-10\">[The Judge]: The Legislature authorizes me to suspend his license for driving at 66 in a 40.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-11\">[Defense counsel]: Where does it say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-12\">[The Judge]: That\u2019s the order of the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">Defendant appealed to the Law Division and immediately requested a stay of the license suspension which was granted. After a de novo review of the record, the Law Division judge, relying in large measure upon our holding in <em>State v. Craig, </em>150 <em>N.J.Super. </em>513, 376 A.2d 193 (App.Div.1977), affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction and imposed the same monetary fine and penalty; he vacated the suspension of defendant\u2019s license.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-14\">Defendant raises the following points for our consideration: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>We have carefully considered these arguments in light of the record and appropriate legal standards. We affirm.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-15\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-16\">THE STATE FAILED TO PROVE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT THIS DEFENDANT VIOLATED <em>N.J.SA </em>39:4-98.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-17\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-18\"><em>N.J.SA </em>39:5-31 IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Defendant contends 1) that the State failed to establish what the lawful speed on Route 23 was at the point he allegedly committed the offense, 2) that Shpiruk\u2019s testimony was not credible or, if believed, actually exonerated defendant, and 3) that the State failed to establish defendant was the operator of the speeding vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Defendant correctly notes that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4\u201498 does not proscribe any conduct whatsoever. When read together with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-99, however, the elements of the prima facie unlawful conduct, \u201cspeeding,\u201d are defined.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-99 provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">It shall be prima facie unlawful for a person to exceed any of the foregoing speed limitations or any speed limitation in effect as established by authority of <em>[N.J.S.A </em>39:4-98],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">In every charge of violation of <em>[N.J.S.A </em>39:4-98], the complaint and the summons or notice to appear, shall specify the speed at which the defendant is alleged to have driven and the speed which this article declares shall be prima facie lawful at the time and place of the alleged violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-9\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-98 provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-10\">[E]xcept in those instances where a lower speed is specified in this chapter, it shall be prima facie lawful for the driver of a vehicle to drive it at a speed not exceeding the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-11\">a.

Appropriate signs giving notice of the speed limits authorized under the provisions of subsection a. and paragraph (2) of subsection b. of this section shall be erected by the commissioner or the municipal or county authorities, as appropriate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Defendant contends that the State failed to demonstrate what the lawful speed was along that portion of Route 23 because Shpiruk\u2019s testimony, which was the only evidence adduced on the issue, was legally insufficient to meet the State\u2019s burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">In <em>Miller, </em>the defendant was convicted of driving at a speed of thirty-six miles per hour in a twenty-five miles per hour zone. 58 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 539, 156 A.2d 750. Defendant denied the speed limit in the zone was twenty-five miles per hour. <em>Ibid. </em>At trial, the State presented \u201cno evidence establishing that this was a residence or business district within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:1-1 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-98 and 99,\u201d or \u201cany evidence that any speed limit had been established especially for this area by ordinance or regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540, 156 A.2d 750. The State did produce \u201cevidence that signs showing the number 25 had been erected, but no proof of the authority by which they were placed as required by the statute.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">On appeal, the Law Division noted \u201c[i]n the absence of proof showing that another or lower speed limit applies in the district, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>the presumption must be that the 50 m.p.h. limit applies.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Proof of a sign in the area was insufficient because \u201cthe sign itself does not set the speed limit.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Since there were \u201cmany unauthorized signs in the State which may serve as a warning but have no effect in creating an offense,\u201d the defendant could not be found guilty on that evidence alone. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The court concluded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">The offense of exceeding a speed limit of less than 50 m.p.h. cannot be charged without alleging that it occurred in a business or residence district or in a district for which the stated speed limit has been established in conformity with the statute____The burden of proof is upon the State to establish all elements of the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-9\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">Absent proof as to the nature of the area and absent proof of any regulation, ordinance or resolution setting the speed limit at less than fifty miles per hour, the defendant was entitled to be acquitted. <em>Id. </em>at 541,156 A.2d 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">In <em>Craig, </em>we confronted a similar situation. There, defendant was charged with driving forty miles per hour in a twenty-five miles per hour zone. 150 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 514, 376 A.2d 193. The police officer testified as to the lawful speed at the point of the offense. <em>Ibid. </em>On appeal, the defendant argued that the State \u201cfailed to prove the speed limit at the place where the speeding took place,\u201d because it failed to \u201cintroduce evidence relating to the character and type of the zone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515, 376 A.2d 193. In affirming defendant\u2019s conviction, however, we concluded that when a \u201cpolice officer testifies under oath to the speed limit,\u201d and \u201cthat testimony remains uncontroverted and is believed,\u201d it \u201ccarries with it the presumption, rebuttable though it may be, that that speed limit was legally ordained.\u201d <em>Ibid.; see also State v. Cooper, </em>129 <em>N.J.Super. </em>229, 23.2, 322 A.2d 836 (App.Div.) (holding evidence of a traffic control device creates a presumption that it was official and properly placed at that location), <em>certif. denied, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>329, 331 A.2d 28 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">In <em>Craig, </em>we distinguished our earlier decision in <em>State v. Tropea, </em>142 <em>N.J.Super. </em>288, 361 A.2d 111 (App.Div.1976), recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>nizing that cross-petitions for certification had been granted and were pending in that case. <em>Craig, supra, </em>150 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 515, 376 A.2d 193.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We noted that unlike <em>Tropea, </em>where \u201c \u2018[n]o evidence of the applicable speed limit was offered,\u2019 \u201d \u201chere [ ] there was some hard evidence\u201d\u2014the officer\u2019s testimony\u2014\u201cas to the speed limit.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Tropea, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 290, 361 A.2d 111).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Tropea </em>sets forth the full factual scenario of that case in detail. Defendant was charged with driving forty-four miles per hour in a twenty-five miles per hour zone. <em>State v. Tropea, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>309, 311, 394 A.2d 355 (1978). The police, operating a radar device, timed the defendant speeding and issued a summons to him. <em>Ibid. </em>The officer who testified at trial did not offer any testimony as to the speed limit in the area where the offense occurred. <em>Ibid. </em>At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case, defendant moved for acquittal based upon the insufficiency of evidence, but the motion was denied. <em>Id. </em>at 311-12, 394 A.2d 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The defendant then testified that he was \u201ctrying to keep the car at twenty-five miles per hour,\u201d and was driving at that speed when stopped by the police. <em>Id. </em>at 312, 394 A.2d 355. At the conclusion of his testimony, defendant again moved for acquittal. This, too, was denied, and the municipal court judge found him guilty. <em>Ibid. </em>On de novo review on appeal, the court found that defendant\u2019s attempt to maintain a speed of twenty-five miles per hour was evidence of his knowledge of the applicable speed limit, and affirmed his conviction. <em>Ibid. </em>We deemed that evidence to be insufficient, but remanded the matter for a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 311, 394 A.2d 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">After reviewing the evidence, the Court noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">As the Appellate Division observed, these proofs fell far short of discharging the State\u2019s obligation to establish the applicable speed limit. So insubstantial is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>State\u2019s argument on this point that we need dwell on it only long enough to observe that there is nothing in defendant\u2019s assertion that he was making a conscious effort to maintain his speed at 25 miles per hour which in any way served to establish the speed limit. Furthermore, nothing in the record suggests that either the municipal court or county court judge took judicial notice\u2014or, indeed, any other kind of notice\u2014of any facts indicating that the area in question was residential in character.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 312-13, 394 A.2d 355.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Since the State failed to \u201coffer [ ] any evidence of the applicable speed limit,\u201d the Court affirmed our earlier reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 313, 394 A.2d 355; <em>see also, State v. Ring, </em>85 <em>N.J.Super. </em>341, 342, 204 A.2d 716 (App.Div.1964) (reversing defendant\u2019s speeding conviction where no proof of lawful speed was introduced), <em>certif. denied, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>407, 209 A.2d 142, <em>cert. denied, </em>382 <em>U.S. </em>812, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>24,15 L.Ed.2d 60 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Returning to the case at hand, we determine it is factually distinguishable from <em>Tropea, Ring, </em>and <em>Miller </em>all of which determined that <em>absent any proof </em>of the lawful speed limit at a particular location, a defendant\u2019s conviction for violating <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-98 and 4-99 cannot stand. We accept that in such circumstances, the holdings in those cases have continued vitality and would determine the outcome of this appeal. However, in this ease, there was evidence, Officer Shpiruk\u2019s testimony, which was essentially unchallenged, that the lawful speed limit was forty miles per hour. We, therefore, take this opportunity to reaffirm our holding in <em>Craig </em>to this extent\u2014\u201csworn testimony from a police officer relating the speed limit in a zone in the municipality in which [s]he is employed,\u201d 150 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 515, 376 A.2d 193, if admissible and if believed, may be sufficient proof of the lawful speed limit in the area in question.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If persuaded by such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>testimony, the court need not require the State to prove that fact through the introduction of a certified copy of an ordinance or regulation. To the extent <em>Miller </em>holds otherwise, we disapprove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Although we reaffirm <em>Craig\u2019s </em>general approach to the issue, we reject the suggestion that the officer\u2019s testimony creates a \u201crebuttable presumption\u201d of the lawful speed in the area. In the absence of any specific statutory language, it has been noted that \u201c[cjourts are generally reluctant to create presumptions.\u201d Biunno, <em>N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>comment 1 on <em>N.J.R.E. </em>301 (2007). Moreover, in the thirty years since <em>Craig </em>was decided, we have frequently limited the scope of statutory presumptions in motor vehicle and criminal cases. <em>See State v. Walten, </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>529, 534-35, 575 A.2d 529 (App.Div.1990) (construing the statutory presumption contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-129(e)\u2014leaving the scene of an accident\u2014to allow only a permissible inference of defendant\u2019s knowledge of the accident); <em>State v. Bolton, </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>476, 480-81, 553 A.2d 881 (App.Div.1989) (construing the statutory presumption in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-2a to permit only an inference for the jury\u2019s consideration); <em>State v. McCandless, </em>190 <em>N.J.Super. </em>75, 81-82, 461 A.2d 1205 (App.Div.)(construing the statutory presumption in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-2b to permit only an inference), <em>certif denied, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>210, 470 A.2d 428 (1983). Additionally, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>303, adopted since <em>Craig </em>was decided, significantly limits the effect of any statutory presumption in a criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">In this case, however, where defendant did not object to the officer\u2019s testimony as to the lawful speed limit, the judge was entitled to give that testimony such weight as he deemed appropriate and was permitted to infer from that testimony the speed limit was \u201clegally ordained.\u201d <em>Craig, supra, </em>150 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 515, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>376 A.2d 193. Although defendant vigorously cross-examined Shpiruk at trial about the operation and calibration of her radar device, and her ability to observe defendant\u2019s vehicle, he did not pose a single question relative to the lawful speed limit in the area, the nature of the properties fronting that portion of the road, or whether any signs designating the speed limit were posted. In short, there was not any evidence adduced on cross-examination that rebutted the testimony of the officer as to the lawful speed in the area. Defendant did not introduce any contrary evidence of his own. As such, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that the State\u2019s evidence as to the lawful speed limit along that portion of Route 23 was insufficient to sustain his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Defendant\u2019s two remaining issues on this point require only brief comment. Defendant contends that Shpiruk\u2019s testimony regarding the relative speeds of the vehicles, and the distances and time required to turn her vehicle around and apprehend defendant, defy \u201cthe laws of physics\u201d and are not credible. He also asserts that there was a reasonable doubt that defendant\u2019s vehicle was in fact the speeding black Corvette because the officer lost sight of the car for a period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">It is well-recognized that it is \u201cimproper for [an appellate court] to engage in an independent assessment of the evidence as if it were the court of first instance.\u201d <em>State v. Locurto, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>463, 471, 724 A.2d 234 (1999). Rather, \u201c[a]ppellate courts should defer to trial courts\u2019 credibility findings that are often influenced by matters such as observations of the character and demeanor of witnesses and common human experience that are not transmitted by the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 474, 724 A.2d 234. We conclude, therefore, that the determinations reached by the municipal court judge and the Law Division judge are entitled to that deference and find no basis to disturb those conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">We turn now to defendant\u2019s second point in which he urges that we hold <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:5-31 to be unconstitutional. Though the municipal court judge did not cite this portion of the statute as the basis for suspending defendant\u2019s license, the State acknowledges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>that it was by arguing the suspension was justified under the statute. The State also counters by arguing, in the first instance, defendant\u2019s challenge is moot since the Law Division judge vacated any license suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Defendant argues the statute is archaic and capable of such disparate application as to render it unconstitutional. It provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW3\">The director or any magistrate before whom any hearing under this subtitle is had may revoke the license of any person to drive a motor vehicle, when such person shall have been guilty of such willful violation of any of the provisions of this subtitle as shall, in the discretion of the magistrate, justify such revocation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWE\">[N.J.S.A 39:5-31.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">He contends that the statute provides only for the revocation, not the suspension, of a driver\u2019s license. Moreover, if read to apply to suspensions, the unbridled discretion the statute vests in a municipal court judge invites significant sentencing disparity between those courts where the judge utilizes the statute on a regular basis, and those where the statute is never employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">While defendant has raised significant issues that create concern in our minds whether this provision of the motor vehicle laws is entitled to continued vitality, we decline to address the issue because it is moot. Defendant\u2019s license suspension was vacated by the Law Division, and, thus, our decision can have no \u201cpractical effect on [an] existing controversy.\u201d <em>Greenfield v. N.J. Dept. of Corr., </em>382 <em>N.J.Super. </em>254, 258, 888 A.2d 507 (App.Div.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Defendant argues we should nonetheless consider the challenge he raises because \u201cthe underlying legal issue\u201d is \u201c \u2018one of substantial importance, likely to recur, but evading review.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coyle v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>260, 263, 787 A.2d 881 (2002) (quoting <em>Zirger v. Gen. Accident Ins. Co., </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>327, 330, 676 A.2d 1065 (1996)). At oral argument, defendant likened suspensions imposed pursuant to the statute to a \u201ctrial tax\u201d\u2014an enhanced penalty imposed upon those who choose to challenge their summonses at trial rather than plead guilty\u2014and contended that certain municipal court judges routinely extract such a price in their particular courtrooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Penalizing a defendant for asserting his constitutional right to a trial is clearly inappropriate and we would condemn any court\u2019s exercise of discretion in a manner that would achieve such an unjust result. <em>See Curry v. N.J. State Parole Bd., </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>66, 72, 706 A.2d 769 (App.Div.1998) (holding defendant may not be penalized for exercising his right to appeal by removing jail credits earned prior to successful appeal and subsequent re-conviction). However, as we noted at oral argument, there is nothing in the record before us that would support a determination that the statute is being used as defendant argues.1 *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Furthermore, we find no reason to conclude the issue is likely to evade review in the future. A defendant is free to raise the question of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:5-31\u2019s continued constitutionality in both the municipal court and the Law Division as appropriate, and, we assume, at some point, if a suspension is imposed and not vacated, the issue will be presented in the appropriate context of a true case and controversy requiring this court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">In sum, we agree with the State that the issue presented in defendant\u2019s second point is moot, and we decline the invitation to consider whether <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:5-31 is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b445-19\"> The Law Division judge reserved decision on the appeal at the time it was argued. Two weeks later, he entered an order affirming the conviction and modifying the sentence. The order* does not specify any reason for his decision to vacate the license suspension portion of the sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b446-16\"> We reject any suggestion defendant makes that the summons incorrectly cited the statutory violation and should have been dismissed. The form summons issued to defendant, which presumably complied with <em>R. </em>7:2-1 (e)(1), listed various violations including \"Speeding\u201d in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-98. Defendant was fully apprised of the offense with which he was charged and defended the matter without any suggestion of surprise or prejudice. Moreover, defendant never raised the issue below. <em>Nieder v. Royal Indemnity Ins. Co., </em>62 <em>NJ. </em>229, 300 A.2d 142 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b447-9\"> \"Business district,\u201d \"residential district,\u201d and \"suburban business or residential district\u201d are all terms whose meanings are descriptively defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:1-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b449-11\"><em> State v.

Our prior language in <em>Craig </em>was not intended to be read so narrowly, particularly in circumstances such as these, where the officer, being \"from around [the area],\u201d was familiar with the road and was within her law enforcement agency's jurisdiction, Sussex County.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b454-8\"><em> </em>After oral argument defendant submitted, without leave of court, supplemental materials consisting of a transcript from a wholly unrelated matter to support his position that Sussex County municipal courts routinely sentence motor vehicle offenders in violation of the law. We will not consider the supplemental material because it is entirely outside the record of this case. If counsel wishes to pursue this argument in the future, he must do so before the municipal court within the parameters of the court rules and submit the appropriate statistical analysis along with supporting evidence so that a record is created. He must then pursue the argument through the Law Division before it is ripe for appellate review. <em>R. </em>2:5-4. The mere submission of a single transcript of an unrelated proceeding will not suffice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
