(CSX) and Norfolk Southern Corporation (Norfolk Southern), are the operators of railroads in New Jersey and elsewhere. CSX appealed to the Tax Court from the Railroad Franchise Tax (RFT) assessments imposed by the Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation (Director) for tax years 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003, and Norfolk Southern challenged the assessments for tax years 2000, 2002 and 2003. The tax is based on a calculation of each railroad\u2019s New Jersey-derived net operating income as a percentage of the net <em>income </em>the railroad derives operating world-wide. <em>N.J.S.A </em>54:29A-13 to -15. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the Tax Court affirmed the assessments. <em>CSX Transp., Inc. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>22 <em>N.J.Tax </em>399, 421 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">To compute the percentage of each railroad\u2019s net income attributable to its operations in New Jersey, the Director multiplied a fraction against each railroad\u2019s nationwide net income. <em>Id. </em>at 405. As the numerator of the fraction, he used the miles of track over which the railroad operated within this State, and as the denominator, he used the miles of track over which the railroad operated nationwide. <em>Ibid. </em>He then applied the statutory ten percent tax rate, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>54.-29A-13, to the railroad\u2019s income attributed to its New Jersey operations to arrive at the RFT payable for each tax year. <em>C.S.X., supra, </em>22 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 405; <em>see also N.J.A.C. </em>18:23^4.1(a) (setting RFT at \u201cthe rate of 10 per cent of [the railroad\u2019s] net railway operating income adjusted and allocated on the basis of the percentage of all track miles operated within the State to the total track miles operated everywhere by such railroad\u201d). In affirming the Director\u2019s assessments, the Tax Court upheld his apportionment formula. 22 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>On appeal to this court, plaintiffs maintain that the Director\u2019s formula is facially unconstitutional and unconstitutional as applied to their railroad operations; and that summary judgment in favor of the Director was not warranted as genuine issues of material fact remain in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">CSX raises an additional issue. It claims that the ten percent annual franchise tax rate imposed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:29A-13 is a violation of 49 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 11501, the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (4-R Act). <em>CSX, supra, </em>22 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 420. The 4-R Act prohibits a state from imposing a tax \u201cthat discriminates against\u201d a railroad. 49 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 11501(b)(4). CSX claims that the State has violated the 4-R Act because the ten percent RFT tax rate exceeds the nine percent Corporate Business Tax rate imposed on other corporate franchises. <em>See CSX, supra, </em>22 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 420; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:10A-5(c)(1) (setting tax rate at nine percent for corporations that are not New Jersey S corporations); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>18:7-3.6(a)1 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">We affirm the Tax Court\u2019s determination that the ten percent RFT tax rate does not violate the 4-R Act. Though we agree with the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that the Director\u2019s apportionment formula is not unconstitutional on its face, we reverse summary judgment as to the tax assessments in favor of the Director because we conclude that plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence to establish a genuine issue of fact as to whether the formula is unconstitutional as applied to their New Jersey railroad operations. We remand for further proceedings on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">In 1998, the Surface Transportation Board (STB), which is a governmental body within the United States Department of Transportation that regulates, among other things, railroad track-age rights, <em>see </em>49 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 701, 721; 49 <em>CFR </em>\u00a7 1180 (2006), approved plaintiffs\u2019 joint application for authority to operate the routes and assets of Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail). As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>a result of that approval, plaintiffs each acquired the use of certain Conrail track, some of which is located in New Jersey. On June 1, 1999, plaintiffs entered into operating agreements with Conrail, which permitted them to commence operations in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">All railroads that operate in New Jersey are required to file annual reports with both the STB and the State. <em>See </em>49 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 11145(a); 49 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 1241.11(a) (2006); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>18:23-8.1. Those reports recount the total mileage the railroad operated both in New Jersey and worldwide. The Director used plaintiffs\u2019 mileage statistics as reported to the government agencies in preparing his allocation formula. <em>CSX, supra, </em>22 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">In arriving at the numerator of the formula, the Director construed \u201cthe number of miles of all track over which the railroad or system operates in this State,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54.-29A-14, to mean the miles of track each railroad is entitled to operate in New Jersey. That calculation includes the miles of track the railroad owns or leases, as well as the miles of track that, pursuant to the operating agreements, it has the right to use. The railroads, on the other hand, argue that \u201cthe number of miles of all track ... operate[d] in this State\u201d refers only to those miles of track they actually use in this State, regardless of their right to use additional track. More significantly, they claim that other measures of their operations in New Jersey, rather than track-miles, provide a more accurate reflection of income they actually earned in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">The following tables summarize the calculations by the Director and each plaintiff for the respective tax years. They show the differences in percentage apportionment and tax assessed depending upon which formula is used. The Director used track-miles, and the railroads used ton-miles, which, as we will explain, is a measure of income a railroad typically uses to measure its operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>DIRECTOR\u2019S APPORTIONMENT AND TAX</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">NORFOLK SOUTHERN CSX</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Percentage Apportionment Tax Assessed Percentage Apportionment Tax Assessed</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">2000 3.76% $1,655,666.00 2.44% $ 883,230.10</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">2001 N/A N/A 2.46% $ 864,607.53</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">2002 3.78% $3,173,700.18 2.46% $1,120,745.21</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">2003 3.78% $3,444,889.75 2.49% $1,316,301.58</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">NORFOLK SOUTHERN APPORTIONMENT AND TAX</p>\n<p id=\"b272-13\">Percentage Apportionment</p>\n<p id=\"b272-14\">Tax Year Ton-Miles Tax Assessed</p>\n<p id=\"b272-15\">2000 0.517% $227,704</p>\n<p id=\"b272-16\">2002 0.469% $394,429.90</p>\n<p id=\"b272-17\">2003 0.449% $409,169.88</p>\n<p id=\"b272-18\">In addition to ton-miles, CSX also used track-miles as did the Director; but, CSX used the miles of New Jersey track over which it actually operated, rather than the miles of track over which it had the right to operate, as the numerator in the fraction.</p>\n<p id=\"APi\">CSX APPORTIONMENT AND TAX</p>\n<p id=\"b272-19\">Tax Year Percentage Apportionment Track Used Tax Assessed Percentage Apportionment Ton-M\u00fces Tax Assessed</p>\n<p id=\"b272-22\">2000 _0,2994% $108,294_0.3256% $117,772.47</p>\n<p id=\"b272-23\">2001 _0,2320% $ 83,574_0.5534% $199,355.82</p>\n<p id=\"b272-24\">2002 0.2322% $105,988.68 0.5622% $256,589.07</p>\n<p id=\"b272-25\">2003 _0,2563% $135,451.93 0.5303% $280,171.19</p>\n<p id=\"b272-26\">As each table shows, the railroads\u2019 calculations resulted in a substantially lower assessed tax than did the Director\u2019s calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-27\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b272-28\">The trial judge characterized plaintiffs\u2019 claims as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>The essence of taxpayers\u2019 claims is twofold: (1) the statutorily-prescribed RFT allocation formula should be interpreted to require the allocation to be calculated on a proportion of shared use or by use of a revenue ton-mile, and that (2) New Jersey\u2019s track mileage allocation formula, as applied to the taxpayers, violates the Commerce Clause, Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3, and Due Process Clauses of the Federal Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\"><em>[CSX, supra, </em>22 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 403 (footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In sustaining the Director\u2019s assessments, the judge ruled that plaintiffs provided insufficient information with respect to their earnings arising out of their New Jersey operations to prove that the Director\u2019s track-mileage formula unfairly taxed their New Jersey operations. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The focus of plaintiffs\u2019 challenge in the trial court was the constitutionality of the Director\u2019s single-factor RFT formula using track miles. <em>Id. </em>at 412. Addressing this issue, and finding that the Director\u2019s formula was constitutional on its face, the judge observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a single factor formula is constitutional on its face. <em>See, e.g., Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, </em>437 <em>U.S. </em>267, 273, 98 <em>S.Ct. 2340, </em>2344, 57 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>197, 204-05 (1978). The Supreme Court stated that \u201cftjhe legislative and constitutional provision of the state, that taxation of property shall be equal and uniform and in proportion to its value, is not violated by exacting a contribution according to their gross income, in proportion to the number of miles of railroad operated in the state____\u201d <em>Charlotte, C. &amp; A.R. Co. v. Gibbes, </em>142 <em>U.S. </em>386, 394,12 <em>S.Ct. </em>255, 257, 35 <em>L.Ed. </em>1051,1055 (1892)....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-11\">Therefore, a state can utilize a single factor apportionment method as it \u201cdoes not purport to identify the precise geographical source of a corporation\u2019s profits; rather, it is employed as a rough approximation of a corporation\u2019s income that is reasonably related to the activities conducted within the taxing State.\u201d <em>Moorman Mfg. Co., supra, </em>437 <em>U.S. </em>at 273, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2344, 57 L.Ed.2d at 204.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-12\"><em>[Id. </em>at 412-13.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">The judge also concluded that plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their as-applied argument to set aside the Director\u2019s formula. <em>Id. </em>at 418. The judge stated that, based on the record, plaintiffs could not point to any \u201cclear and cogent evidence\u201d that demonstrated that the Director grossly over-taxed the taxpayers\u2019 New Jersey income. <em>Id. </em>at 418. He concluded that plaintiffs\u2019 ton-miles factor and the other apportionment methods at best showed that other methods could be utilized to measure net income relating to New Jersey activities, but that plaintiffs failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>to demonstrate that the Director\u2019s formula was itself defective. <em>Id. </em>at 418-19. The judge concluded that plaintiffs \u201cprovided no evidence as to earnings arising from New Jersey operations with respect to the method of charging customers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The trial judge also rejected CSX\u2019s claim that the ten percent RFT rate violates the 4-R Act. He stated that the primary purpose of the 4-R Act is \u201c \u2018to insure that railroads are not forced to carry a heavier tax burden than other commercial and industrial property,\u2019 \u201d and CSX\u2019s proofs on that issue did not establish that the corporate business tax would impose less of a burden on CSX than did the RFT. <em>Id. </em>at 420-21 (quoting <em>Chrysler Rail Transp. Corp. v. Holt, </em>845 <em>F.Supp. </em>463, 468 (W.D.Mich.1994)). He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">The Sixth Circuit, in <em>Chrysler Rail Transportation Corp., </em>cited <em>Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Co., supra, </em>390 <em>U.S. </em>317, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>995, 19 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1201, for the proposition that \u201c[t]he mileage formula taxing of railroads, which the State has chosen to utilize, is an alternative apportionment system ...\u201d and hence, nondiscriminatory. <em>Chrysler Rail Transp. Corp, supra, </em>845 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 466. This court adopts the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">... Taxes were not computed in the same manner as those computed under a corporate business tax scheme. The computations were specifically designed for the railroad industry and to that effect, do not capture income in the same manner. As an alternative apportionment scheme need not impose the exact same tax, <em>see Chrysler Rail Transp. Corp., supra, </em>the fact that New Jersey imposes a 10% tax rate on railroads while imposing a 9% tax on other corporate franchises does not violate the 4-R Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">\n<em>[.Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Accordingly, the trial court affirmed the Director\u2019s assessments for each tax year. <em>Id. </em>at 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">The RFT is levied based on income derived in the preceding year. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:29A-13.

According to affidavits submitted by plaintiffs\u2019 officers, ton-miles are the unit of measurement plaintiffs use to report their revenue to both the federal and state governments. The affidavits explain in some detail how ton-miles are calculated and why they are used to reflect the railroads\u2019 operating income. The affidavits also point out how the use of ton-miles, as opposed to track-miles, demonstrates a significant disparity between the revenue attributable to New Jersey operations under the Director\u2019s formula and the revenue attributable to New Jersey operations under the railroads\u2019 ton-miles formula. Each plaintiffs New Jersey operating income as a percentage of its worldwide operations, as calculated by using ton-miles as the standard, is summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>PERCENTAGES OF NORFOLK SOUTHERN\u2019S NEW JERSEY OPERATIONS COMPARED TO NORFOLK SOUTHERN\u2019S TOTAL OPERATIONS 2000 2002 2003</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Ton-Miles 0.28% 0.47% 0.45%</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">PERCENTAGES OF CSX\u2019S NEW JERSEY OPERATIONS COMPARED TO CSX\u2019S TOTAL OPERATIONS 2000 2001 2002 2003</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Ton-MilesO.3256% 0.5534% 0.5622% 0.5303%~</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The essence of plaintiffs\u2019 argument is that given this and other alternate methodologies for computing revenue derived from New Jersey operations, the track-mileage allocation formula applied by the Director results in such a grossly distorted sum of income attributed to the railroads\u2019 New Jersey operations that application of the Director\u2019s allocation formula violates the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">The RFT is a franchise tax, which differs from a property tax, and is similar to taxes that are often called \u201cbusiness privilege taxes\u201d; it is a \u201ctype of excise tax, namely a form of taxation not laid directly upon persons or property.\u201d <em>Werner Mach.

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Constitution does not \u201cinvalidate] an apportionment formula whenever it <em>may </em>result in taxation of some income that did not have its source in the taxing State.\u201d [463 <em>U.S. </em>at 169-70,103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2942, 77 L.Ed.2d at 556 (quoting <em>Moorman, supra, </em>437 <em>U.S. </em>at 272, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2344, 57 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 204.)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">An apportionment formula will be stricken \u201cif the taxpayer can prove by clear and cogent evidence\u201d that the income attributed to the state is in fact out of all appropriate proportion to the business transacted in that state, or has led to a grossly distorted result. <em>Id. </em>at 170, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2942, 77 L.Ed.2d at 556 (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Y</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Against this legal framework, the Director\u2019s formula, on its face, survives plaintiffs\u2019 challenge.

This Court long ago upheld the constitutionality of the unitary business/formula apportionment method, although subject to certain constraints.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 165,103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2940, 77 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 553.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">\u201cThe method has now gained wide acceptance____\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>A single factor formula, one that, as the name implies, takes into account only one factor, for instance, track miles, such as here, <em>see CSX, supra, </em>22 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 412, has been held to be presumptively valid, and facially constitutional by the United States Supreme Court. <em>See Moorman, supra, </em>437 <em>U.S. </em>at 273, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2344, 57 L.Ed.2d at 205. The income apportionment method does not have to be exact. Dividing revenues and costs between in-state and out-of-state operations can never be made \u201cwith more than approximate correctness.\u201d <em>Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co. v. N.C. ex rel Maxwell, </em>297 <em>U.S. </em>682, 684, 56 <em>S.Ct. </em>625, 627, 80 <em>L.Ed. </em>977, 980 (1936). A mileage-based methodology has been found to be facially valid, even though at times a tax based upon mileage may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>not directly \u201cbear to a property tax or even to one upon the value of a franchise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 685, 56 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 627, 80 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 980.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Here too, the Director\u2019s formula is valid on its face. While it may in fact be less accurate than other formulas, exact accuracy is not required. A formula based on track-miles, both within and without this State, provides a fair method to calculate the income earned by a railroad that operates in New Jersey and elsewhere. Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the formula as written is not \u201capproximately correct.\u201d Consequently, because the formula is valid on its face, the question becomes whether, as applied, it survives an analysis under the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The due process clause of the federal constitution \u201cimposes two requirements for such state taxation: a \u2018minimal connection\u2019 or \u2018nexus\u2019 between the interstate activities and the taxing State, and \u2018a rational relationship between the income attributed to the State and the intrastate values of the enterprise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Exxon Corp., supra, </em>447 <em>U.S. </em>at 219-20, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2118, 65 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 79 (quoting <em>Mobil Oil Corp. v.

It is the second factor that is at play here\u2014whether a rational relationship exists between the incomes the Director has attributed to plaintiffs\u2019 New Jersey operations and plaintiffs\u2019 incomes worldwide. In attacking the formula as applied, plaintiffs claim the Director\u2019s method does not accurately reflect their New Jersey income-generating activities. That, they say, is contrary to the requirement that income attributable to the State for tax purposes must be rationally related to values connected with the taxing state. <em>See Moorman, supra, </em>437 <em>U.S. </em>at 273, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2344, 57 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 204. This argument implicates the external consistency requirement referred to in the case law, that the factors used for the apportionment formula reflect \u201ca reasonable sense of how income is generated\u201d within the State. <em>Container Corp., supra, </em>463 <em>U.S. </em>at 169,103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2942, 77 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>No doubt, courts have recognized the difficulty in effectuating an exact apportionment.

The Director accepted the figures plaintiffs submitted to the governmental agencies as correct. The State has not challenged those statistics either. Those statistics included plaintiffs\u2019 use of ton-miles as a measure of their income attributable to their New Jersey operations. Though the trial judge correctly concluded that the Director was not required to use ton-miles as the basis to calculate plaintiffs\u2019 New Jersey derived income because the mileage-based formula was valid on its face, plaintiffs\u2019 earnings based on ton-miles are not irrelevant. They are evidence that plaintiffs\u2019 incomes attributable to their New Jersey operations are substantially lower than the incomes the Director attributed to plaintiffs\u2019 New Jersey operations through the use of his track-miles formula. For example, for the tax years in question, using ton-miles as a gauge, the average percentage of Norfolk Southern\u2019s income attributable to its New Jersey operations is approximately .5 percent, while using the Director\u2019s track-miles based formula, the average percentage of income attributable to New Jersey is approximately 3.7 percent. That means, for instance, that for the tax year 2000, the Director\u2019s formula resulted in a tax of roughly $1,600,000, compared to $227,700 in taxes using Norfolk Southern\u2019s computations. CSX\u2019s calculations show generally similar results.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The revenues based on the ton-miles formula are therefore prima facie evidence of a gross discrepancy between the Director\u2019s calculations and the railroads\u2019 calculations of the amount of business the railroads transacted in this State. In other words, even though the Director\u2019s track-mile based formula is constitutional on its face, by coming forward with the ton-mile based formula, the railroads provided \u201cstrong evidence tending to prove that the mileage formula will yield a grossly distorted result\u201d in this particular case. <em>Norfolk, supra, </em>390 <em>U.S. </em>at 329, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1003, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>19 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d at 1210. Plaintiffs have demonstrated that summary-judgment in favor of the Director was not warranted because, under the circumstances, the Director\u2019s use of track-miles may have resulted in an apportionment \u201cwhich, albeit fair on its face, operates so as to reach profits which are in no just sense attributable to transactions within [this] jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Hans Rees\u2019 Sons, supra, </em>283 <em>U.S. </em>at 134, 51 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 389, 75 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 906; <em>see also Tyler Pipe Indus. v.

Here, the affidavits of plaintiffs\u2019 officers detailing the bases for plaintiffs\u2019 calculations, as well as the unchallenged statistical evidence plaintiffs presented concerning their income both in New Jersey and elsewhere for the challenged tax years, raise genuine factual disputes as to the income attributable to plaintiffs\u2019 New Jersey railroad operations. Plaintiffs have made a sufficient showing to require a hearing to determine if the Director\u2019s methodology grossly distorts their earnings attributable to their New Jersey operations. Accordingly, we reverse the Tax Court decision affirming the tax assessments for the challenged tax years, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">That takes us to the final issue on appeal, CSX\u2019s challenge to the 4 R Act. It claims the ten percent annual RFT rate imposed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:29A-13 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>18:23-4.1 discriminates against railroads in violation of 49 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 11501 because the ten percent tax rate exceeds the nine percent corporate business tax rate imposed on other corporations in this State. We agree with the Tax Court that this allegation is without merit and affirm substantially for the reasons expressed by the Tax Court judge in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>his written opinion. <em>CSX, supra, </em>22 <em>N.J. Tax </em>at 420-21. Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments on this issue are without sufficient merit to warrant additional discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11\u2014 3(e)(1)(A), (E). We add only the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">We agree with the Tax Court that states need not exact the same percentage of tax on railroads as they do on other corporations; states merely need to ensure that \u201cthe tax they do impose on railroads is not discriminatory.\u201d <em>CSX, supra, </em>22 <em>N.J. Tax </em>at 420. We also agree that the proofs CSX has submitted on this issue are not sufficient to survive a summary judgment motion. CSX has not made a prima facie showing that New Jersey\u2019s ten percent tax rate on railroads results in a discriminatory tax on railroad operations in New Jersey. The computations for each tax are different and CSX simply has not demonstrated that the 4-R tax has a discriminatory impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
