Courts are authorized to order the involuntary civil commitment of an individual under the SVPA when the State has proven \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that the person needs continued involuntary commitment as a sexually violent predator.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.32(a). The Supreme Court has explained the standard for involuntary commitment under the SVPA as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">To be committed under the SVPA an individual must be proven to be a threat to the health and safety of others because of the likelihood of his or her engaging in sexually violent acts____[T]he State must prove that threat by demonstrating that the individual has serious difficulty in controlling sexually harmful behavior such that it is highly likely that he or she will not control his or her sexually violent behavior and will reoffend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-9\">Those findings ... require an assessment of the reasonably foreseeable future. No more specific finding concerning precisely when an individual will recidivate need be made by the trial court. Commitment is based on the individual\u2019s danger to self and others because of his or her <em>present </em>serious difficulty with control over dangerous sexual behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-10\"><em>[In re Commitment of W.Z., </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>109,132-33, 801 A.2d 205 (2002).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-11\">Commitment under the SVPA requires clear and convincing proof \u201cof past sexually violent behavior, a current mental condition, and a demonstrated inability to adequately control one\u2019s sexually harmful conduct.\u201d <em>State v. Bellamy, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>127, 136, 835 A.2d 1231 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-12\">The scope of appellate review of a trial court\u2019s decision in a commitment proceeding has been described as \u201cextremely narrow, with the utmost deference accorded the [trial] judge\u2019s determination as to the appropriate accommodation of the competing interests of individual liberty and societal safety in the particular case.\u201d <em>State v. Fields, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>282, 311, 390 A.2d 574 (1978). The trial court\u2019s determination may be modified \u201conly where the record reveals a clear abuse of discretion\u201d or a clear lack of evidence to support it.\u201d <em>In re Civil Commitment of V.A., </em>357 <em>N.J.Super. </em>55, 63, 813 A.2d 1252 (App.Div.) (quoting <em>In re Commitment of J.P., </em>339 <em>N.J.Super </em>443, 459, 772 A.2d 54 (App.Div.2001)), <em>certif. denied, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>490, 828 A.2d 917 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-13\">On appeal, J.P. presents two arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\">THE STATE FAILED TO PROVE BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE AT THE REVIEW HEARING THAT J.[]P. WAS SUBJECT TO COMMITMENT AS A SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATOR.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-8\">THE COURT ERRED IN RELYING ON HEARSAY CONTAINED IN THE TESTIMONY OF THE EXPERT WITNESSES AND THEIR REPORTS IN REACHING ITS DECISION.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-11\">Based on our review of the record and the applicable law, we conclude that J.P.\u2019s second argument is without sufficient merit to warrant extended discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11\u2014 3(e)(1)(E). <em>See In re Commitment of E.S.T., </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>562, 576, 854 A.2d 936 (App.Div.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-12\">The first point raised in which J.P. contends he cannot be classified as a SVP because he has never been convicted of a \u201csexual offense\u201d as defined in the SVPA, requires that we set forth the relevant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-13\">J.P., now age thirty-five, was convicted of his first criminal offense in 1990, after being charged with possession of cocaine. On October 9, 1998, J.P. was charged with aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault, endangering the welfare of a child, and child abuse in connection with the alleged sexual molestation of a twelve-year old, whom he was babysitting. On July 17, 2001, J.P. pled guilty to endangering the welfare of a child. He was sentenced to three years probation and restrained from unsupervised contact with unrelated females under age sixteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-14\">On October 8, 1999, two separate incidents were reported by child congregants of J.P.\u2019s church, alleging J.P. touched them at services. The first child, age twelve, stated J.P. touched her legs, Mssed her mouth, and touched her vagina. The second child, age ten, stated J.P. touched her thigh and attempted to touch her vagina but she stopped him, and then, after the service ended, he touched her breasts. After this latter incident, J.P. was charged with sexual assault, endangering the welfare of a child, and child abuse. He pled guilty to the endangering charge and was sentenced to three years probation, concurrent with his prior sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>tence, and restrained from unsupervised contact with unrelated females under age sixteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">A ten year-old reported that, on January 6, 2000, J.P. touched her buttocks, vagina and breasts, over her clothing while at church, for which he was charged with sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child. These charges were dismissed as part of the prior plea agreement encompassing the 1998 and 1999 offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">J.P. was charged with the predicate offenses, after three separate child victims reported assaults on February 13, 2002. J.P. had accompanied his daughter G.S., age eight, on a class trip. M.H.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> reported J.P. rubbed her vagina, buttocks, and breast area, over her clothing. He also placed her on his lap, unzipped her pants and touched her vaginal area. M.H. stated she saw J.P. unzip G.S.\u2019s pants and put his hand down her pants, while G.S. sat on his lap. G.S. acknowledged that her father touched her many times beginning in 1996, when she was age three, and on one occasion, she awoke as J.P. was inserting a brush into her vaginal area. The third child, S.W., age ten, reported J.P. looked up her dress as he tied her shoe and rubbed her thighs. The indictment charged J.P. with three counts each of sexual assault, endangering the welfare of a child, and child abuse, along with one count of aggravated sexual assault. J.P. was charged separately with a violation of probation. In February 2003, J.P. pled guilty to three counts of third-degree endangering the welfare of a child and was sentenced to a custodial term of five years, to be served at the Adult Diagnostic Treatment Center (ADTC). Probation was revoked and a concurrent sentence of four years was also imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">The State presented two expert witnesses during the initial commitment hearing held on November 29, 2005, Drs. Barone and Zeiguer. Defendant presented his expert, Dr. Siegel. Dr. Siegel, initially concluded, after conducting psychometric testing and ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>taining clinical impressions, that J.P. was not highly likely to reoffend and Dr. Siegel did not recommend J.P.\u2019s referral to the STU. Instead, he recommended that upon release, J.P. be \u201cclosely monitored\u201d because \u201c[he] wouldn\u2019t be surprised if [J.P.] did [reoffend], but [he] couldn\u2019t say that it was highly likely.\u201d Thereafter, Dr. Siegel was advised by a colleague that he incorrectly scored J.P.\u2019s test results. Once correcting the test results, Dr. Siegel concluded J.P. should be referred to the STU.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">In his report, Dr. Siegel recorded J.P.\u2019s comments which included that: he had abused his daughter, he knew he had an attraction to pre-pubescent girls, and he recognized he should not have been on the class trip because of the terms of his probation. Dr. Siegel diagnosed J.P. as suffering from \u201cpedophilia, sexually attracted to females, non-exclusive\u201d and further concluded that J.P. \u201chas impulses in that direction and they\u2019re likely to be ongoing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">The State\u2019s first expert, Dr. Zeiguer, interviewed J.P. for almost two hours, during which time J.P. discussed his past offenses. J.P. told Dr. Zeiguer he engaged in oral sex with his daughter, beginning at age three, and progressed to rubbing his genitals against hers. J.P. did not admit \u201csexual activity\u201d took place during the 1998 event, and, when discussing the other offenses, admitted touching young girls, but not for \u201csexual gratification,\u201d which J.P. later defined as \u201cintercourse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Dr. Zeiguer too, concluded J.P. suffers from \u201cpedophilia, nonexclusive\u201d and a \u201cpersonality disorder, extremely severe, with antisocial features.\u201d He opined that J.P. would not be deterred by being detected or by probation restrictions because he reoffended while on probation, and he was deceitful and manipulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">Dr. Barone was the State\u2019s second expert witness. She stated that during her ninety minute clinical interview, J.P. admitted \u201che was sexually aroused by prepubescent girls,\u201d and he had been struggling with this arousal since age thirteen. J.P. acknowledged the offenses in 1999, 2000, and 2002, as well as the sexual molestation of his daughter while she was between ages six and nine.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Dr. Barone concluded J.P. suffers from \u201cpedophilia, sexually attracted to females, nonexclusive\u201d; \u201cpersonality disorder NOS [not otherwise specified], with antisocial traits\u201d; and that he had \u201cdifficulty controlling aggressive and sexual impulses.\u201d She concluded J.P. was highly likely to reoffend.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">All experts agreed that J.P. received no meaningful treatment while confined to the ADTC due to disruptions in his placement because J.P. was involved in several institutional infractions, some of which involved written and verbal threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Prior to canvassing the expert testimony and documentary evidence, the trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">The statute requires a person to commit a sexually violent offense, which is defined in the statute. In order to be subject to the statute, there\u2019s no dispute in this particular ease that [J.P.] had committed such an offense and does come within the jurisdiction of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">The trial judge further concluded J.P. \u201csuffers from a mental [abnormality] in the form of pedophilia, ... cocaine dependence and abuse,\u201d and \u201cfrom a severe personality disorder ... NOS with antisocial traits.\u201d These conditions</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">predispose [J.P.l to engage in acts of sexual violence, and that if he were to be released within a relatively short time, certainly well within [the] reasonably foreseeable future, he would be highly likely to engage in this kind of conduct again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-10\">The nature of what he does can seem somewhat minor in some cases, very serious in others, but the potential for very serious conduct, given the opportunity is there, as shown by his conduct with his daughter ... and under the balancing test, given the nature of what he does and what he is shown capable of doing ... balanced against a very high propensity, ... I have no hesitancy in coming to the conclusion that he\u2019s dangerous, that he\u2019s a substantial high risk, and that he should be committed, and I will in fact commit him and set a review date of one year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">J.P. argues that the \u201ccharges of endangering the welfare of a child do not fall within the definition of a sexually violent predator.\u201d He contends that \u201cthe court admitted that [J.P.\u2019s] charges were not of a sexual nature\u201d and thus, the evidence could not support civil commitment. Our inquiry must determine whether the offenses supporting J.P.\u2019s convictions comport with the statutory definition of \u201csexually violent offense.\u201d We have located no precedential guidance on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>When interpreting a statute the Legislature\u2019s intent is the paramount goal. Generally, the best indicator of that intent is the statutory language. <em>DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 492, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005). \u2018We ascribe to the statutory words their ordinary meaning and significance, and read them in context with related provisions so as to give sense to the legislation as a whole.\u201d <em>American Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. N.J. Div. of Taxation, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>65, 79, 912 A.2d 126 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Our analysis begins with the examination of the plain language of the statute. <em>Miah v. Ahmed, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>511, 520, 846 A.2d 1244 (2004). The SVPA\u2019s definitional provisions enumerate offenses encompassed within the meaning of \u201csexually violent offense,\u201d which include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">(a) aggravated sexual assault; sexual assault; aggravated criminal sexual contact; kidnapping pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph (2) of subsection c. of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:13-1; criminal sexual contact; felony murder pursuant to paragraph (3) of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:ll-3 if the underlying crime is sexual assault; an attempt to commit any of these enumerated offenses; or a criminal offense with substantially the same elements as any offense enumerated above, entered or imposed under the laws of the United States, this State or another state; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-8\">(b) any offense for which the court makes a specific finding on the record that, based on the circumstances of the case, the person\u2019s offense should be considered a sexually violent offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-9\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.26.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">The open-ended definition in subsection (b) must be interpreted in the light of the scope of the associated specific definitions in subparagraph (a). Following the ancient maxim of statutory construction, <em>nosdtur a sociis, </em>the meaning of words may be indicated and controlled by those with which they are associated. <em>See Germann v. Matriss, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>193, 220-21, 260 A.2d 825 (1970). When read together, the rational construction of these two paragraphs shows that the Legislature considered it appropriate to expand \u201csexually violent offense\u201d to also include conduct which demonstrates the elements of the enumerated sexually violent offenses delineated in subsection (a), even though the conviction may be for an offense other than those specifically listed. The specific findings requirement in subsection (b) assures that not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>just any conduct suffices; the demonstrated conduct must be in the nature of the type of sexual offenses enumerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">In his decision, the trial judge only entered a conclusion on this issue, omitting to \u201cmake[] a specific finding on the record that, based on the circumstances of the case, [J.P.\u2019s] offense should be considered a sexually violent offense.\u201d Trial judges must understand that the requirement to articulate specific findings under <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.26(b) is essential to meaningful review of the record. <em>See e.g., Curtis v. Finneran, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>563, 569-70, 417 A.2d 15 (1980) (quoting <em>Kenwood Assocs. v. Bd. of Adj. of Englewood, </em>141 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 4, 357 A.2d 55 (App.Div.1976)); <em>Schwarz v. Schwarz, 328 N.J.Super. </em>275, 282, 745 A.2d 592 (App.Div.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Nevertheless, the record in this matter, when reviewed in its entirety, contains substantial credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that J.P.\u2019s conduct falls within the definition of \u201csexually violent offense.\u201d During the expert evaluations by Drs. Siegel, Zeiguer and Barone, J.P. admitted that he touched the vagina, breasts and/or buttocks of female children. He additionally admitted that, over a period of several years, he committed eunnilingus on his daughter, required her to perform fellatio on him, and also rubbed his genitalia against hers; all of which were designed to achieve his sexual gratification. This conduct falls squarely within the definition of \u201csexual contact,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-1d, and demonstrates the elements of the crime of sexual assault, stated as: \u201can act of sexual contact with a victim who is less than 13 years old and the actor is at least four years older than the victim.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2b. Sexual assault is one of the offenses specifically listed in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.26(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">J.P.\u2019s victims were pre-pubescent girls over whom J.P. exercised control. Dr. Barone articulated that J.P. engaged in \u201cgrooming\u201d to manipulate each child, \u201cutilizing] his roles [as an] authority figure to gain access to child victims,\u201d then \u201cacting out his deviant sexual impulses.\u201d We cannot know why these very serious offenses were resolved by pleas to the crime of endanger<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>ing. In any event, sufficient substantial evidence supports that J.P.\u2019s offenses are sexually violent offenses, as defined by the SVPA, even though the guilty pleas entered were for the offense of endangering the welfare of a child. Although the trial judge did not recite specific findings on the record for this conclusion, the factual basis supporting such a determination is readily found within his oral decision issued December 1, 2005 and we do not hesitate to exercise our original jurisdiction to make the finding. <em>See R. </em>2:10-5. With this addition, the findings of the trial court are based upon substantial credible evidence and are entitled to considerable deference on appeal. <em>See Fields, supra, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>at 311, 390 A.2d 574; V.A, <em>supra, </em>357 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 63, 813 A.2d 1252 (quoting <em>J.P., supra, </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 459, 772 A.2d 54).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The State additionally has proven that J.P. presently suffers from a \u201cmental abnormality or personality disorder,\u201d namely, pedophilia, and a severe personality disorder, NOS, with antisocial traits. This condition, which to date has been virtually untreated, makes J.P. \u201clikely to engage in acts of sexual violence.\u201d Further, the State has established that J.P. has \u201cserious difficulty with control over dangerous sexual behavior.\u201d <em>See W.Z., supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 132-33, 801 A.2d 205. Finally, the record establishes, by clear and convincing evidence, that J.P. currently presents a high likelihood of reoffending, <em>see In re Commitment of P.Z.H., </em>377 <em>N.J.Super. </em>458, 463, 873 A.2d 595 (App.Div.2005), necessitating civil commitment to the STU for treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b43-9\"> The State's Petition for Civil Commitment and its brief mistakenly recite the child's initials as</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
