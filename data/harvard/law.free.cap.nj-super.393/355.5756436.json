The critical issues before us are (1) whether defendants owed a duty to the individual beneficiaries to inform them of the personal tax implications which flowed from defendants\u2019 advice, and (2) whether the defendants breached a duty to the executrix to make the scope of their representation clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">The motion judge granted summary judgment to defendants, holding that \u201c[plaintiffs were third party non-clients of [defendants [, and] [defendants were retained to be counsel for the Estate and not the individual beneficiaries.\u201d The judge further concluded that defendants owed a duty to the Estate alone, as the beneficiaries\u2019 individual interests may have conflicted with the interests of the Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">Plaintiffs argue that the defendants owed them a duty as individuals and that the terms of the retainer agreement included representation of the individual beneficiary-plaintiffs. We reverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>the judgment insofar as plaintiff Clara Heffernan, the executrix, is concerned. We affirm as to the other beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Patricia Albanese (\u201cdecedent\u201d) died on August 5, 2000. She was survived by three daughters, plaintiffs Clara Heffernan (\u201cClara\u201d), Anne Albanese, and Judy Albanese, all of whom were beneficiaries under the will. Clara, decedent\u2019s executrix, retained defendant John R. Lolio, an attorney at law of the State of New Jersey of the law firm of defendant Sherman, Silverstein, Kohl, Rose &amp; Podolsky, P.A. who had served as decedent\u2019s attorney and had prepared her Last Will and Testament, with respect to the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Plaintiffs assert that defendants were retained by Clara to represent the Estate and each of the plaintiffs as individuals. They also contend that Clara similarly retained the services of defendant, Michael DeLorey (\u201cDeLorey\u201d) of defendant Prism Financial Group, Inc., to do financial planning on behalf of the individual plaintiffs as well as the Estate. They further claim that defendants and DeLorey \u201cspoke at least a dozen times during the administration of the Estate\u201d and \u201cwere working together ... to figure out the best way to pay the Federal Estate Taxes without exposing [plaintiffs] to any personal income tax liability.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">Defendants assert that they \u201cwere retained by [Clara] <em>solely </em>in her capacity as Executrix of Patricia Albanese\u2019s estate.\u201d To support this contention, they emphasize that the opening of the agreement reads that Clara, as executrix, retained defendants \u201cas attorneys to represent the Estate[,]\u201d and they note that the agreement <em>\u201cdoes not </em>mention beneficiaries or that the scope of the ... retention includes providing services/personal tax advice to the beneficiaries.\u201d Defendants further assert that they \u201cdid not take any action, nor act in any manner, that could cause [plaintiffs], in their individual capacities, to believe that the [defendants] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>represented their personal interests or were acting for them individually.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The retainer or \u201cfee agreement\u201d with defendants provides that \u201cCLARA HEFFERNAN, Executrix of the Estate of PATRICIA A. ALBANESE, does hereby retain and employ the Law Firm of SHERMAN, SILVERSTEIN, KOHL, ROSE AND PODOLSKY, P.A. as attorneys to represent the Estate.\u201d The agreement further provides that, in addition to handling matters before the Surrogate\u2019s Office and Probate Courts, defendants would</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\"><em>advise us </em>and cause all necessary and proper steps to be taken <em>for the purpose of fixing and paying any and all Federal and State estate taxes and other transfer taxes, </em>the collection of all assets ..., the payment of all debts ..., the distributions of the assets that may then remain ..., the accounting for the acts of the Executrix as the representative of such Estate, and in general the doing of all acts and things necessary for the full and complete settlement of the Estate of the decedent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">The Agreement also states that defendants \u201cshall\u201d be responsible for \u201c[p]ost-mortem planning, including, but not limited to, calculating tax needs[,]\u201d and for \u201ccollaboration with the Executrix to obtain the most beneficial tax results.\u201d The agreement was signed by defendant Lolio for the firm and by Clara Heffernan, \u201cIndividually and as Executrix of the Estate of Patricia A. Albanese.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">The Estate was sizable. It included real estate, cash, stocks and bonds, life insurance and other assets including an IRA. Each of the sisters was to receive similar, but not identical, shares of the Estate valued at over $1,000,000 each, and Clara\u2019s children were to receive $10,000 each. Decedent\u2019s death also triggered the distribution of a \u201ccredit shelter trust\u201d that was created under her late husband\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">The federal estate tax owed by the Estate totaled over $900,000. In order to pay the estate tax, Clara, allegedly upon the advice of Lolio and DeLorey, withdrew funds from the IRA and thereafter made equal distributions to plaintiffs in April 2001. This resulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>in a personal income tax burden on the individual plaintiffs of approximately $298,000 each.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">A factual dispute exists as to the advice plaintiffs received prior to making the distributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">First, plaintiffs contend that they were not apprised of other options for paying the Estate taxes aside from using the Estate\u2019s IRA, although they now assert that alternatives existed. In their brief, plaintiffs state, \u201c[defendant [l]awyers faxed a letter and called the Estate\u2019s financial planner, [DeLorey], to advise that the Estate taxes were going to be paid by withdrawing funds from the Estate\u2019s IRA\u201d According to DeLorey, he was \u201ccompletely surprised\u201d by this, explaining that \u201c[i]t\u2019s going to cause, you know, estate taxes.\u201d In response, Lolio reportedly told him, \u201cthat\u2019s the only assets they have.\u201d Further, DeLorey testified that he did not mention the tax consequences of using the IRA to pay the estate taxes to any of the plaintiffs, \u201c[b]ecause [Lolio] told me these were the only assets available to pay the taxes from.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Plaintiffs further assert that, despite Lolio\u2019s testimony to the contrary, he never outlined options by which Clara could pay the estate taxes. At her deposition, Clara testified that Lolio told her that the bulk of the Estate\u2019s assets were in the IRA, no other options for paying the taxes were shared with her, and the decision to use the IRA funds to pay the estate taxes was made because she \u201cdidn\u2019t feel like there were really any other options at the time.\u201d However, earlier in her deposition, Clara also stated that Lolio \u201csaid there are various places to take the funds from,\u201d but was unable to remember anything more specific about that conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Defendants contend that Lolio advised Clara of other options for paying the taxes aside from using funds from the IRA, but none of these conversations were memorialized in writing. Lolio testified that, at the time a distribution was made from the trust created by plaintiffs\u2019 father, he told Clara over the telephone \u201cthat money could be used to pay the estate taxes.\u201d He stated that Clara \u201cdidn\u2019t comment one way or the other\u201d regarding this option, although she was aware at that time that the estate tax on decedent\u2019s estate \u201cwould be [roughly] about a million dollars.\u201d Lolio also testified that he discussed three options with Clara on three separate occasions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">[o]ne was to borrow money against the shore property to pay the tax____That wasn\u2019t a viable option. They could just about make the mortgage, based on the current mortgage they had. That was her comment. The other was to sell the shore property, which they did not want to do. Then basically the other option was to take some of the money out of the IRA. Because there wasn\u2019t other assets under the decedent\u2019s name, probate assets, to pay the tax.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Lolio further testified that he did not know if DeLorey advised Clara to pay the estate tax with funds from the IRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Second, plaintiffs assert that defendants \u201cfailed to advise [them] of [their] personal income tax liability\u201d that would result from withdrawing funds from the IRA, and they only became aware of the liability in 2002 while filing their individual 2001 tax returns. Defendants contend that this advice was given. Lolio testified that he \u201ctold [Clara] whatever money she takes out of the IRA is going to have personal income tax consequencesf,]\u201d although he did not elaborate as to what the consequences would be nor suggested that she speak to an accountant to obtain specific figures. During his deposition, Lolio also acknowledged that he \u201cnever spoke\u201d to Clara about the tax consequences of an IRA withdrawal on her sisters, and he did not make a written record of his warning to Clara about the tax consequences of invading the IRA. He added that he was \u201csure that [DeLorey\u2019s] office would have advised them accordingly____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">Defendants also contend that personal income tax advice was not part of their representation of the Estate, and they assert that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Clara \u201cnever discussed or consulted [Lolio] for personal income tax advice.\u201d To support this contention, they cite Clara\u2019s deposition testimony that she did not recall ever seeking or receiving personal income tax advice from Lolio. They also assert that Clara was aware of the tax consequences of withdrawing funds from an IRA, regardless of the advice she was given by them, because of \u201cher job responsibilities as administrator of the 401-K profit sharing plan at her place of business.\u201d However, Clara testified that, prior to the events of this case, she knew that \u201cthere\u2019s a tax consequence\u201d when IRA funds are withdrawn, but she did not know what that consequence was, and no employees had yet retired from her company. Further, defendants state that, since the individual plaintiffs signed IRA Asset Movement Authorizations executed in connection with their inheritance in April 2001, they were aware of the tax consequences of invading the IRAs. Defendants base this assertion on language in the Asset Movement Authorization form, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">I hereby certify that I understand the conversion or rollover rules and conditions as they pertain to this retirement account____ Due to the important tax consequences of converting or rolling over funds or property, I have been advised to consult with a tax professional____I assume full responsibility for these transactions and will not hold the Custodian liable for any adverse consequences that may result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">Additionally, Lolio testified that, in April 2001, he \u201cbelieve[s]\u201d a paralegal in his office spoke to DeLorey\u2019s assistant and \u201cbasically advised [DeLorey\u2019s assistant] to make sure [plaintiffs] were aware of the tax consequences of using the IRA money to pay the tax.\u201d However, the only advice received by the three sisters from DeLorey was at a September 6, 2000 meeting at which DeLorey advised plaintiffs of the nature of his financial services and apprised them of what he did for their mother. DeLorey testified that, at that meeting, he told them of the possibility of personal tax consequences as a result of invading the IRA, but did not specify any detail. DeLorey further testified that he set up beneficiary IRAs for all three plaintiffs, but did not discuss how the estate taxes on decedent\u2019s estate would be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">As the case was settled by plaintiffs with DeLorey and his firm, we review only the summary judgment granted to defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Summary judgment must be granted \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact challenged and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment or order as a matter of law.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:46-2(c). Further, \u201c[a]n issue of fact is genuine only if, considering the burden of persuasion at trial, the evidence submitted by the parties on the motion, together with all legitimate inferences therefrom favoring the non-moving party, would require submission of the issue to the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>To make this determination, the judge must \u201cengage in the same type of evaluation, analysis, or sifting of evidential materials as required [in deciding motions for directed verdicts under] <em>Rule </em>4:37-2(b) in light of the burden of persuasion that applies if the matter goes to trial.\u201d <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The same standards apply to appellate review of summary judgment orders. <em>Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Boylan, </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>162,167, 704 A.2d 597 (App.Div), <em>certif. denied, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>608, 713 A.2d 499 (1998). However, when the trial court\u2019s decision turns on a question of law, the \u201ctrial court\u2019s interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts are not entitled to any special deference.\u201d <em>Manalapan Realty v. Manalapan Twp. Comm., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995). Here, as demonstrated above, contested facts certainly exist concerning the advice given to Clara by Lolio. However, that factual dispute is \u201cmaterial\u201d only if defendants owed a duty to Clara or to the plaintiffs as to their individual tax liability. Accordingly, we must decide whether there is a genuine dispute of material facts concerning that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>\u201c[T'jhe requisite elements of a cause of action for legal malpractice are: \u2018(1) the existence of an attorney-client relationship creating a duty of care upon the attorney; (2) the breach of that duty; and (3) proximate causation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Estate of Fitzgerald v. Linnus, </em>336 <em>N.J.Super. </em>458, 467, 765 A.2d 251 (App.Div.2001) (quoting <em>Conklin v. Hannoch Weisman, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>395, 416, 678 A.2d 1060 (1996)). In this case, we focus on whether the defendants owed plaintiffs a duty of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The motion judge relied on <em>Barner v. Sheldon, </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>258, 678 A.2d 767 (Law Div.1995), <em>aff'd, </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>157, 678 A.2d 717 (App.Div.1996), and <em>Estate of Fitzgerald, supra, </em>in granting summary judgment to defendants based on the lack of duty. According to the judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-7\">[t]he Defendants did not owe a duty to the Plaintiffs in their individual capacity as beneficiaries. The Defendants were retained by the Estate and to require them to have performed an individual tax assessment for each plaintiff would have been outside of the scope of the retainer agreement. Furthermore, the Plaintiffs individual tax situation could very well have been adversarial to the interests of the Estate. What could have been beneficial to the Plaintiffs tax situation could have been detrimental towards the Estate[\u2019]s tax situation as a whole. Therefore, in applying the holding in <em>Barrier, </em>Defendants did not owe a duty to Plaintiffs!,J because their interests as beneficiaries trying to maximize their tax situation may be adversarial to the interests of the Estate. Furthermore, the Plaintiffs any time could have retained their own attorney or financial consultant to advise them of their own individual tax situation. The fact that they chose not to do so should not mean that they can now hold Defendants liable for their current tax situation. Also, the Plaintiffs were presented with an IRA Asset Movement Authorization by the Defendants and were each aware of the tax eon sequences arising from executing the authorization. If the Plaintiffs had any concerns stemming from the execution of this document they were free to retain their own tax professional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">The judge also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">In applying the fairness and policy standard enunciated in <em>Fitzgerald, </em>there still is no basis for finding that the Defendants owed Plaintiffs a duty in this case. In fact, policy and fairness would suggest that we hold that the Defendants not have a duty towards the Plaintiff. A contrary holding would subject attorneys in the Defendants!\u2019] position to a potentially infinite number of lawsuits from beneficiaries of an estate. One could easily imagine a situation where an estate has many beneficiaries, whose interests may be adverse. Surely, it cannot be said that the estate\u2019s attorney would owe each a duty and be subject to liability for any potential violation of that duty. Also, this would put defendants in the precarious situation of having to anticipate potential lawsuits from beneficiaries, taking their focus away from acting in the best interests of the Estate. For as the court stated in <em>Barrier, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>that such an open ended responsibility on the part of an attorney \u201cmight well paralyze the administration of an estate.\u201d <em>Barrier, supra, </em>at 267, 678 A.2d 767[ Qquoting <em>[In re] the Estate of Jerry M.

It is also clear that if a beneficiary\u2019s interest is adversarial to the interest of the estate and contrary to the will of the testator, then no such duty shall be imposed upon the attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">[Id at 266, 678 A.2d 767.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Judge Menza further concluded that defendant acted appropriately because he followed the testator\u2019s wishes, and the tax consequences were irrelevant because of his desire to keep most of his estate out of his wife\u2019s hands. <em>Id. </em>at 266-67, 678 A.2d 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">In concluding \u201cthat the defendant had no duty to the plaintiff beneficiaries to advise them to disclaim!,]\u201d Judge Menza also quoted our prior unreported opinion in the same litigation in which we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">we know of no authority for the broad proposition urged by appellants that an executrix must apprise beneficiaries of the tax consequences of a gift. Such an open-ended responsibility might well paralyze the administration of an estate. [Id at 266-67, 678 A.2d 767 (quoting <em>In re the Estate of Jerry M. Barner, </em>No. A-3100-90T5 (App.Div.1992)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">In affirming the grant of summary judgment in <em>Barner, </em>we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-11\">defendant had no duty to inform the beneficiaries of the tax consequences of their failure to disclaim under these circumstances. The testator\u2019s intent, conceded by plaintiffs, was to minimize benefits to [his] wife by his will. Had plaintiffs, the testator\u2019s children, disclaimed, the testator\u2019s wife would have [benefited]. This would have been contrary to the testator\u2019s intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-12\"><em>[Id. </em>at 158, 678 A.2d 767.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-13\">In <em>Estate of Fitzgerald, supra, </em>we declined to extend an attorney\u2019s duty to the executrix of an estate to the executrix individually or as a beneficiary of the estate and also refused to extend the duty to non-beneficiary children of the executrix. We held that fairness does not \u201cimpose a duty on an attorney representing an estate! ] the obligation to advise on matters of post-mortem estate planning.\u201d <em>Estate of Fitzgerald, supra, </em>336 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 471, 765 A.2d 251. In that case, the decedent\u2019s wife and children asserted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>that the attorney owed them a duty as individuals. <em>Id. </em>at 461, 765 A.2d 251. Plaintiffs\u2019 primary argument was \u201cthat defendant negligently failed to advise [decedent\u2019s wife, the beneficiary and executrix of his will,] Joan that she could disclaim a portion of her husband\u2019s life insurance proceeds in favor of the children[,] which would have resulted in a substantial estate tax savings upon Joan\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The decedent, \u201ca C.P.A____who held both J.D. and M.B.A. degrees, died suddenly\u201d and \u201cleft his entire probate estate to Joan and named her as executrix.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461-62, 765 A.2d 251. Based substantially on the value of the life insurance that passed outside of the will, Joan inherited over two million dollars. <em>Id. </em>at 462, 765 A.2d 251. Decedent\u2019s will was prepared by defendant eight years before defendant\u2019s death. <em>Ibid. </em>The will was drafted \u201cin accordance with decedent\u2019s instructions, including that defendant \u2018not engage[ ] in any estate planning\u2019 at that time, as decedent would prepare an estate plan and advise defendant whether the wills were suitable.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Decedent never created an estate plan, but did execute the will \u201capproximately fourteen months prior to [his] death.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\"><em>On </em>March 7, 1996, the day after decedent\u2019s death, Joan \u201cretained defendant to aid her in administering decedent\u2019s estate.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In discussing the estate with defendant, \u201cJoan expressed concern ... about whether the benefits of the [life insurance] policies would be paid under the circumstances of decedent\u2019s death[ ] and instructed defendant to collect the proceeds.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Defendant \u201ccorresponded with decedent\u2019s life insurance companies, obtained proceeds for Joan by mid-April, and, according to Joan, \u2018advised that [she] could simply deposit those checks and utilize them as [she] saw fit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 463, 765 A.2d 251. According to Joan, after she cashed the checks, a friend who was also an estate planning attorney advised her that she \u201ccould have disclaimed some of the insurance proceeds and have those proceeds go to [her] children, so that [the funds] would never become part of [her] estate.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Joan thereafter retained the friend who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>took over administration of the estate and advised her to sue defendant. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">At trial,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">[t]he parties agreeid] that they never discussed Joan\u2019s estate, the impact of decedent\u2019s insurance policy proceeds on Joan\u2019s future estate taxes, or the possibility of disclaiming a portion of those proceeds prior to Joan\u2019s receipt and deposit of the funds on or about April 15 and 22, 1996. They also agree[d] that Joan stated, and that defendant understood, that Joan was obtaining separate financial and tax planning advice, and that defendant had no knowledge of the identity of Joan\u2019s advisor until late April or early May____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 464, 765 A.2d 251.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">The understanding that Joan was \u201cobtaining financial advice and estate planning advice and that [defendant was] to continue to process [decedent\u2019s] estate without regard to the impact on [Joan\u2019s] estatef,]\u201d was confirmed to Joan in a May 8, 1996 letter from defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 465, 765 A.2d 251. Additionally, defendant defended his actions by stating that he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akz\">believe[d] [he] was retained to carry out the wishes of the testator ... [who] ... as an attorney and as a [C.P.A.] was fully knowledgeable ... about the estate planning and what it would take to create an estate plan that would potentially avoid or eliminate or lessen the impact of estate taxes on ... his wife\u2019s estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-10\">[Decedent] made it very clear that he wanted an outright distribution will, and that was what was prepared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-11\">[Id at 464, 765 A.2d 251.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">Moreover, because Joan was concerned about collection of the life insurance policies and continuation of her lifestyle and income flow as decedent\u2019s salary \u201cwas gone,\u201d defendant testified that Joan \u201cwanted [him] to process and probate [decedent\u2019s] will as quickly as possible so that she would receive the money from [his] estate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 463, 765 A.2d 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">In these circumstances, we affirmed summary judgment for defendant. As stated by Judge Philip Carchman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-14\">The absence of an attorney-client or fiduciary relationship does not necessarily bar a legal malpractice claim by a non-client where an independent duty is owed. Whether that duty exists is a question of law to be determined by the court, and ultimately turns on considerations of fairness and policy. \u201cThe inquiry involves a weighing of the relationship of the parties, the nature of the risk, and the public interest in the proposed solution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number><em>[Id. </em>at 468, 765 A.2d 251 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Judge Carchman further elaborated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">[o]n these facts, as viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, the judge properly determined there was no evidence that Joan had engaged defendant for her own estate planning purposes____[W]e conclude that Joan\u2019s claim fails because defendant owed Joan no duty with regard to her own estate planning, as he was retained by Joan solely in her capacity as executrix of decedent\u2019s estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-10\">The role of an attorney can be circumscribed by the terms of his or her engagement by the client. Here the engagement was narrowly conceived by both parties and defendant\u2019s role was clearly delineated. Certainly, defendant could have given advice as to the potential savings when Joan dies by disclaiming $600,000, but there was no duty to do so. The suggestion that an attorney retained to represent an estate has an affirmative obligation to engage an executrix-wife in post-mortem estate planning fails to recognize the realities of the retention and that of a limited attorney-client relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-11\"><em>[Id. </em>at 470-71, 765 A.2d 251.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">We also found no \u201cunfairness\u201d in the circumstances, and determined</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-13\">that defendant\u2019s duties to Joan both as elientexeeutrix and sole beneficiary of decedent\u2019s probate and non-probate assets were fully met. Defendant\u2019s administration of the estate comported not only with decedent\u2019s \u201cwill and wisdom\u201d to leave his entire estate, including the insurance policy proceeds, to his surviving wife rather than to his children, but also with Joan\u2019s express instructions and her duties as client-executrix to settle and distribute the estate in accordance with the terms of decedent\u2019s will and applicable law, \u201c \u2018as expeditiously and efficiently\u2019 \u201d as was consistent with the best interests of decedent\u2019s estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-14\"><em>[Id. </em>at 472, 765 A.2d 251 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-15\">We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-16\"><em>Barrier </em>supports the view that defendant owed no duty to plaintiffs and that the motion judge properly dismissed their claims. We recognize that the realities of the practice of law may cause one attorney to offer post-mortem estate planning advice to a widow seeking estate representation, while another attorney may view his or her role as circumscribed within the limits of the retainer. Although determining whether a duty exists is necessarily fact-dependent, generally, neither attorney would be acting improperly or violating any duty to the client under these circumstances. Defendant\u2019s choice of the latter course here does not form the basis of a cause of action,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-17\">[Id. at 472-73, 765 A.2d 251 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-18\">Based on this precedent, we reverse the grant of summary judgment as to Clara, and affirm the judgment based on the judge\u2019s conclusion as to her sisters.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>A-</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Defendants\u2019 relationship to Clara is unclear. The retainer agreement created a relationship between defendants, on the one hand, and Clara \u201cindividually and as executrix,\u201d on the other.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It required defendants</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">to advise <em>m </em>and cause all necessary and proper steps to be taken <em>for the purposes of fixing and paying any and all Federal and State estate taxes and other transfer taxes, ... </em>the distribution of the assets that may then remain of the said decedent among those entitled thereto, the accounting for the- acts of the Executrix as the representative of such Estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">The retainer also obligated defendants to 'advise and counsel as to \u201c[p]ost-mortem planning, including, but not limited to, calculating tax needs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">As our Supreme Court recently articulated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-10\">[w]hen a contract term is ambiguous, that rule of contract interpretation requires a court to adopt the meaning tfiat is most favorable to the non-drafting party. The doctrine may be utilized after a court has examined the terms of the contract, in light of the common usage and custom, and considered the circumstances surrounding its execution. If, at that time, the court is unable to determine the meaning of the term, contra proferentem may be employed as a doctrine of last resort. The rationale behind that method of interpretation is that \u201c[w]here one party chooses the term of a contract, he is likely to provide more carefully for the protection of his own interests than for those of the other party.' He is also more likely than the other party to have reason to know of uncertainties of meaning.\u201d Importantly, contra proferentem is only available in situations where, the parties have unequal bargaining power. If both parties are equally \u201cworldly-wise\u201d and sophisticated, contra proferentem is inappropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-11\"><em>[Pacifico v.
