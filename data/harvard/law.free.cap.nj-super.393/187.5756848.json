The fire began in Swift Electric\u2019s building. Plaintiffs assert that Swift had a nondelegable duty under New Jersey\u2019s Uniform Fire Code (Code), to apply for a permit and conduct annual inspections in connection with the installation of their fire alarm system, and that the failure to do so breached that duty, causing a delay in the system\u2019s activation, which allowed the fire to spread to and destroy plaintiffs\u2019 property. We examine the question of whether the duties imposed on property owners by the Code are nondelegable.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">Elizabeth Baboghlian and her late husband, Vartkes, owned and operated Artistic Furniture (Artistic), a business engaged in the sale of \u201chigh-end furniture and accessories.\u201d Artistic occupied a three-story commercial building located at 4401-03 Bergenline Avenue in Union City. Artistic\u2019s showroom was on the first floor and inventory was kept in the basement and on the first, second, and third floors of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">The Baboghlians, their sons, and Elizabeth\u2019s mother resided in an adjoining two-story residential building, which contained several apartments and the business\u2019s workshop. The two buildings had separate entrances but were connected internally. The properties were equipped with fire extinguishers and smoke detectors, but not a fire alarm system.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">Defendants August Sadora and August Sadora, Jr. owned and operated defendant Swift Electrical Supply Co., Inc. (Swift), which was located in a two-story building adjacent to plaintiffs\u2019 property, at 4405-09 Bergenline Avenue. When Swift renovated its proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>ty to create a light fixture showroom in 1987, it hired JMG Electrical Contractors, Inc. (JMG) to install a fire alarm system. JMG installed a system manufactured by Electro Signal Labs, Inc. (ESL), with the assistance of an ESL representative. The system consisted of smoke detectors placed throughout the two floors and heat detectors placed in a \u201cpeak\u201d or attic area, as well as a fire alarm panel with a telephone line connected to a central station. JMG serviced the system when requested, including checking and cleaning the smoke detectors on January 19, 1990, replacing a water-damaged smoke detector on November 20,1990, and servicing the fire alarm system on March 19, 1993. JMG never tested any of the heat detectors, and was never requested to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">On August 22, 1995, plaintiffs\u2019 store was closed. At approximately 4:50 p.m., Elizabeth and Vartkes returned home. At about 5:15 p.m., Elizabeth heard a sound \u201clike a clock ticking.\u201d She looked out a window and saw a faintly flashing light. When Elizabeth looked out of her bedroom window, she saw \u201cwhite billowing smoke,\u201d and then observed black smoke from the kitchen window. At 5:25 p.m., Elizabeth called her son and telephoned the Union City Fire Department. Elizabeth\u2019s son had briefly left his apartment with a friend around 5:00 p.m., and at that time, had smelled smoke but did not hear a fire alarm. The Baboghlians evacuated their building at 5:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Sadora, Jr. testified he was working at his desk after his father and the employees had finished work at 5:00 p.m. He noticed smoke in the lunchroom and called the operator to report a fire in Swift\u2019s building. Sadora, Jr. heard the building\u2019s fire alarm sound around 5:30 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Firemen arrived at approximately 6:00 p.m. According to police reports, the fire officials viewed a \u201cheavy fire condition\u201d upon arriving at Swift\u2019s building. One fire captain wrote that he saw \u201clow level smoke near the floor in the [Swift] supply sales area\u201d and when he climbed the stairs to the second floor, he \u201cobserved fire at the ceiling level, to the right of the stairs.\u201d The fire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>quickly spread to plaintiffs\u2019 property and finally, was brought under control by 11:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The next morning the buildings were inspected by Nicholas C. Recanati, who was the Union City building inspector, the police and fire department inspectors, and at least three private investigators who were allowed to view the property to reconstruct the circumstances of the fire and evaluate the damage. The investigation failed to reveal the fire\u2019s exact onset, cause, or point of origin; however, the various examiners concluded that the fire was not intentionally set and that it originated, generally, in the area between the second-floor ceiling and the roof-line near the rear of Swift\u2019s building.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">After consulting with the municipal engineer and other building officials, Recanati declared plaintiffs\u2019 property unsafe and an imminent hazard. Recanati issued a written notification ordering plaintiffs to obtain the necessary permits, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52.-27D-132 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:23-2.32, to demolish their buildings by August 24,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">On the morning of August 24, plaintiffs and their movers were permitted to enter the first floor of the three-story braiding to remove inventory. Elizabeth\u2019s sons and a videographer videotaped some of the damage on the second and third floors before police ordered them to leave. By evening, plaintiffs salvaged approximately ten to fifteen percent of their business inventory from the showroom but had lost all of their personal property. Plaintiffs\u2019 buildings were demolished that evening, and the business never recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, filed August 20, 2001, alleged that plaintiffs sustained damages as a \u201cdirect and proximate result of defendants\u2019 negligence in permitting a hazardous condition to exist, and in failing to provide for sufficient fire-fighting equipment, devices, and other measures to prevent the spread of the fire\u201d that occurred on August 22,1995. Defendants added JMG and ESL as third-party defendants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>During the fourteen-day jury trial, the legal relationship between Swift and JMG became an important issue. Plaintiffs urged the application of a principal/agent relationship and/or that the obligation to comply with the provisions of the Code was not delegable to its hired contractor, JMG. Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of the case was that any negligence of JMG must be deemed the negligence of Swift. The trial court declined to adopt plaintiffs\u2019 proposed jury instructions on agency and that compliance with the Code was nondelegable. The jury charge given by the trial court included the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">Liability for injury to others through the escape of fire from premises under a person\u2019s control must be predicated upon negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">Your analysis then is to focus on whether the owner was negligent in the installation, maintenance!,] or inspection of its fire alarm system so that the reasonably foreseeable result was the spread of the fire to [the] adjacent property[,] which was therefore a proximate cause of the destruction of the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">The plaintiffs contend that the defendant, [Swift], violated the [U]niform [F]ire [C]ode, in particular that [Swift] did not obtain a permit from the local construction official before installing a fire alarm system. And in addition, [Swift] did not arrange for either the initial inspection upon the installation of the system or the annual inspections every year thereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\">If you find that the defendant, [Swift], did not comply with the [UJniform [F]ire [C]ode, you may consider that as evidence of negligence. As the trier of the facts, you will have to determine the weight to be given to that evidence as with all the evidence in this case and it is for you ultimately to determine whether the[U]niform [F]ire [C]ode violations constitute negligence as I am defining it for you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-9\">[T]he plaintiffs have brought this action against the defendant, Swift Electric. [Swift] ... denies any negligence on its part but has brought a third-party complaint against JMG in which it contends that should you find that Swift Electric is liable to plaintiff for damages, JMG should likewise be liable to Swift Electric.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">During deliberations, the jury submitted two questions seeking clarification. The first query was: \u201cDoes an inspection by JMG constitute an \u2018official\u2019 inspection or does an \u2018official\u2019 inspection need to be conducted by a Union City official?\u201d The second inquiry asked: \u201cDoes Swift have to be negligent in order for JMG to be negligent?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">The trial judge responded to the jury\u2019s first question by stating that there was no testimony directed to that issue. Then the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>court reminded the jurors to review the testimony of the Union City fire sub-code official and plaintiffs\u2019 expert, and to rely on their recollections of the evidence. In response to the second question, the trial judge instructed: \u201c[I]n order to hold JMG negligent, Swift Electric must be found to be negligent, at least in partf,] so there has to be a finding of negligence as to Swift, at least partially before you get to JMG.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">On May 18, 2005, the jury returned its verdict finding Swift negligent, but unanimously concluding that Swift\u2019s negligence was not a proximate cause of plaintiffs\u2019 damages. Although the jury, in keeping with the court\u2019s instruction after not having found Swift liable, did not render a formal verdict as to JMG, it nevertheless indicated on its verdict form that it found JMG negligent, but that JMG\u2019s negligence was not a proximate cause of plaintiffs\u2019 damages. Judgment was entered dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, with prejudice. Plaintiffs\u2019 motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, for a new trial were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">On appeal, plaintiffs raise the following arguments for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">DEFENDANTS OWED PLAINTIFFS A NONDELEGABLE DUTY TO COMPLY WITH THE NEW JERSEY UNIFORM FIRE CODE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-10\">THE TRIAL COURT FAILED TO INSTRUCT THE JURY ON MATERIAL ISSUES OF LAW, INCLUDING WHEN THE JURY REQUESTED GUIDANCE ON THOSE ISSUES.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-11\">\n<em>POINT III</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-12\">THE TRIAL COURT IMPROPERLY DISMISSED THE COMPLAINT AS TO AUGUST SODORA, SR.; HE PLAINLY CONSTITUTES AN \u201cOWNER\u201d UNDER THE NEW JERSEY UNIFORM FIRE CODE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-13\">\n<em>POINT IV</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-14\">THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT ALLOWED DEFENDANTS\u2019 LIABILITY EXPERT TO PRESENT TESTIMONY AND EXHIBITS FAR, FAR BEYOND THE SCOPE OF HIS NEVER AMENDED OR SUPPLEMENTAL EXPERT REPORT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The Legislature adopted the Uniform Fire Safety Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-192 to -213 (UFSA), to ensure that \u201c[a]ll areas of the State are protected by a uniform, minimum, fire safety code which will protect the lives and property of the State\u2019s citizens.\u201d <em>N.J.SA </em>52:27D-195a. The UFSA delegated to the Commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs (DCA) \u201call the powers necessary or convenient to effectuate the purposes of this act[,]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52.-27D-197, including the power to promulgate \u201cregulations to insure the maintenance and operation of buildings and equipment in such a manner as will provide a reasonable degree of safety from fire and explosion.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-198a. The UFSA directed that the regulations \u201cshall include a uniform fire safety code primarily hased on the standards established by [uniform national fire codes].\u201d <em>Ibid.; Venuti v. Cape May County Constr. Bd. of Appeals, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>546, 550, 555 A.2d 1175 (App.Div.1989). The DCA subsequently promulgated the Code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which applied to new and existing buildings. <em>N.J.AC. </em>5:18-1.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The Code was designed \u201cfor the safeguarding to a reasonable degree of life and property ... from conditions hazardous to life or property in the use or occupancy of buildings or premises.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:18-1.3(a). The Code requires buildings identified as \u201clife hazard uses\u201d to install fire alarm systems and to be subject to inspections. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:18-2.5. Other buildings that voluntarily installed any fire alarm system were required by the Code to obtain a construction permit issued by the construction official prior to installation of the system. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:18-3.4(a)2.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Code does not direct the type or nature of the fire protection system to be installed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The Code required annual inspections of all buildings that installed fire safety systems, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:18-3.4(a)6, and mandated that all tests of any fire alarm system \u201cshall be conducted by and at the expense and risk of the owner or a representative of the owner.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:18-3.4(a)(3). The Code explicitly recognizes that the owner is responsible for the \u201csafe and proper maintenance of the premises at all times.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:18-2.2(a). The Code at <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:18-2.2(d) states: \u201cA person shall be deemed to have violated or caused to have violated a provision of this Code if an officer, agent or employee under his control and with his knowledge has violated or caused to have violated any of the provisions of this Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Both the UFSA and the Code define \u201cowner\u201d as \u201ca person who owns, purports to own, manages, rents, leases or exercises control over a building, structure or premises.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-196(i); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:18-1.5. It is indisputable that Swift owned the building where the fire originated, making Swift responsible under the Code for the building\u2019s safety and maintenance. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:18-2.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Plaintiffs first argue that the trial court erred in denying the use of proposed jury instructions defining the agency relationship between Swift and JMG. Plaintiff contends that Swift was responsible for the acts of its agent, JMG, which failed to comply with the mandatory permit and initial inspection provisions of the Code when the fire alarm system was installed, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:18-3.4(a)2, and the inspection requirements during the eight subsequent years when annual inspections or testing were required pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:18-3.4(a)6.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">We disagree with this contention. The Code expressly limits an owner\u2019s liability for an agent who commits a Code violation. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:18-2.2(d). The agent specifically must be under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>control of and act with the knowledge of the owner for liability to attach to the owner. <em>Ibid. </em>In this matter, no evidence was presented showing that Swift controlled the work of JMG or that Swift had knowledge of JMG\u2019s violations of the Code. The absence of a \u201cmaster-servant\u201d relationship between Swift and JMG defeats the applicability of the law of agency. <em>Ibid.; see also JMB Enters, v. Atl. Employers Ins. Co., </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>610, 617, 550 A.2d 764 (App.Div.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Plaintiffs next challenge Swift\u2019s assertion that it had no liability stemming from the negligent installation of the fire safety system by JMG and stemming from JMG\u2019s other allegedly negligent acts of failing to obtain a permit and initial inspection and to conduct subsequent inspections. <em>See Puckrein v. ATI Transport, Inc., </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>563, 574, 897 A.2d 1034 (2006). Plaintiffs argue that, in this regard, the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that the obligations imposed on owners by the Code are nondelegable was error. Plaintiffs state, \u201c[a]s owners of the property, defendants owed plaintiffs a non[ jdelegable duty to comply with the mandatory provisions of the [Code].\u201d Thus, any negligence by JMG must be attributable to Swift.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">While the general rule of law limits a contractee\u2019s liability when engaging an independent contractor, <em>see Mavrikidis v. Petullo, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>117, 133, 707 A.2d 977 (1998); <em>Majestic Realty </em>Assocs., <em>Inc. v. Toti Contracting Co., </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>425, 431, 153 A.2d 321 (1959), the Supreme Court has enunciated exceptions to the general rule\u2019s application. \u201cThere are three such exceptions, as delineated by the <em>Majestic </em>Court: <em>\u2018(a) </em>where the landowner [or principal] retains control of the manner and means of the doing of the work which is the subject of the contract; (b) where he engages an incompetent contractor; or (c) where ... the activity contracted for constitutes a nuisance per se.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mavrikidis, supra, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>at 133, 707 A.2d 977 (quoting <em>Majestic, supra, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>at 431, 153 A.2d 321). These exception have no applicability to this matter generally, or to the imposition of an owner\u2019s duties enunciated in the Code, specifically.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>However we have recognized another exception that arises \u201c[i]n cases involving a significant risk of grave harm, ... the duty owed to the public may be too important to allow its delegation to an independent contractor, and therefore the legislature or the court may impose a nondelegable duty on the principal.\u201d <em>Great Northern Ins. Co. v. Leontarakis, </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>583, 591, 904 A.2d 846 (App.Div.2006). The applicability of that exception to the various acts of alleged negligence attributed to Swift requires further analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In <em>Leontarakis, </em>the defendant employed an independent contractor for the excavation of the foundation to build his home on a lot adjacent to the plaintiff\u2019s property. <em>Id. </em>at 588, 904 A.2d 846. As a result of the contractor\u2019s performance, the plaintiffs structure was damaged as it suffered the loss of lateral support. <em>Id. </em>at 589, 904 A.2d 846. We explained, \u201c[t]he primary reason for imposing a nondelegable duty on the principal [for negligent acts of the independent contractor] is that the duty is of extraordinary importance to the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 592, 904 A.2d 846; <em>see also Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 424 (1965) (one bearing duty to provide specified safeguards for the safety of others imposed by statute or administrative regulation is liable for harm caused by contractor\u2019s failure to provide such safeguards); <em>Majestic, supra, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>at 439,153 A.2d 321 (duty may be nondelegable where its \u201csocial value to the community is so significant that the law cannot allow it to be transferred to another\u201d); <em>Marek v. Prof'l Health Servs., Inc., </em>179 <em>N.J.Super. </em>433, 440-41, 432 A.2d 538 (1981) (duty\u2019s importance to the community determines whether it may be delegated), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>232, 460 A.2d 645 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">We cannot agree with the sweeping assertion by plaintiffs, which suggests Swift retains liability for all negligent acts of JMG merely because JMG installed a fire safety system, triggering the application of the Code. The Code\u2019s requirements imposed on an owner who voluntarily installs a fire safety system include obtaining the initial permit, submittal of the system\u2019s plans to the fire sub-code official, arranging an initial system inspection after in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>stallation, and scheduling annual system inspections thereafter. See <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:18-3.4(a). As noted above, the Code does not mandate the type and nature of the fire safety equipment installed in a non-life hazard building. Therefore, the decision to place smoke detectors in certain portions of Swift\u2019s building and heat detectors in others was not governed by Code requisites. Even plaintiffs\u2019 expert conceded that it was reasonable for a property owner, such as Swift, to rely upon a fire safety system\u2019s installer, such as JMG, to properly design the system using appropriate equipment. Plaintiffs\u2019 suggestion that Swift was liable because improper equipment was installed has no relationship to the assertion that Swift\u2019s duties under the Code were breached.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">If the Code imposes a nondelegable duty on an owner who engages another to install a fire safety system, it is only those defined duties in the Code that cannot be abandoned. We are persuaded by the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the specific duties imposed on a property owner under the Code are nondelegable because they direct action in an area designed to promote and protect public safety. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-195(a). The Legislature recognized \u201cthe need for strict fire safety codes as minimum standards for the maintenance and upgrading of existing properties\u201d to protect all areas of the State \u201cby a uniform, minimum fire safety code which will protect the lives and property of the State\u2019s citizens.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-194g and -195a. The Code also identifies that the need for prescribing fire safety and prevention regulations is a \u201cnationally recognized good practice.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:18-1.3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Without question, fire poses a \u201csignificant risk of grave harm\u201d not only to the engulfed premises, but also to people and properties within the vicinity of the blaze. Enforcement of fire safety and prevention of the hazards of fire are significant to the community good.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The statute, UFSA, and its implementing regulations, the Code, place the responsibilities defined in them directly on property owners implementing fire safety procedures. Obtaining a permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>alerts the municipal official of the installation of the fire safety system. Release of the plans and the fire subcode official\u2019s initial inspection after installation assures that the system, which will now be relied on to alert owners and the public of the presence of fire, is in full operational order. Annual inspections ensure that the equipment continues to operate as expected, providing notice of a fire hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Although it may be reasonable for Swift to have relied on JMG for proper installation of its fire safety system, Swift cannot be seen to have deputed its accountability for performing an owner\u2019s affirmative responsibilities to obtain a permit for and inspection of a fire safety system that it voluntarily installed. We conclude that the duty to comply with the Code provisions outlined is of such extraordinary importance to the public safety that it is nondelegable.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Jury verdicts should be set aside in favor of new trials only with reluctance and then, only in cases showing clear injustice. <em>See Goss v. American Cyanamid, Co., </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>227, 239, 650 A.2d 1001 (App.Div.1994). The trial court instructed the jury to consider whether Swift was negligent when installing, maintaining, and inspecting its fire alarm system. Also the trial judge instructed that Swift\u2019s violation of the Code may be considered negligence. These instructions fell short of folly presenting the applicable law, <em>see Navarro v. George Koch &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>558, 580, 512 A.2d 507 (App.Div.1986); <em>Kaplan v. Haines, </em>96 <em>N.J.Super. </em>242, 251, 232 A.2d 840 (App.Div.1967), <em>aff'd o.b. </em>51 <em>N.J. </em>404, 241 A.2d 235 (1968), because the trial court, did not instruct the jury that Swift had a nondelegable duty under the Code to maintain safe premises. Once its fire safety system was installed, Swift was required to be sure that the system was inspected by the sub-code official, that it remained operational and was inspected each year, and, further, that Swift could not be relieved of these responsibilities by relying on an independent contractor, such as JMG. A properly instructed jury could find that failure to obtain the necessary permits and initial inspection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>of the fire safety system by the municipal fire sub-code official could be evidence of Swift\u2019s breach of its nondelegable duty to assure its system was properly operating.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Defendants maintain that because the jury found both Swift and JMG negligent, but determined that the negligence of neither was the proximate cause of plaintiffs\u2019 damages, any misstatement of the nature of Swift\u2019s duty was harmless error. Unfortunately, it is not clear, given the nature of the jury\u2019s second posed question, whether a full and accurate recitation of the law would have rendered a different result. The jury charge was erroneous, and we conclude that this error was \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and direct a new trial be held.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">We briefly address the other issues presented in the remaining arguments on appeal. No misapplication of discretion occurred in the trial judge\u2019s decision to decline plaintiffs\u2019 request, after the jury had been charged, to take judicial notice that the Code defines \u201cfire official\u201d at <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:18-1.5. Earlier, during a <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104(a) hearing, plaintiffs had objected to Swift\u2019s suggestion that the trial court take judicial notice of the Code, suggesting the prerequisites of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>201 were not fulfilled. Plaintiffs may not now claim error in the exercise of discretion to decline to take judicial notice. <em>See Fox v. Twp. of Parsippany-Troy Hills, </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>82, 89, 488 A.2d 557 (App.Div.) (holding the plaintiffs could not claim on appeal that a jury instruction, which they specifically had requested, constituted prejudicial error), <em>certif. denied, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>287, 501 A.2d 949 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The use of the standard jury charge for proximate cause was not error; however, on retrial the trial court is free to modify the charge as necessary. We find no error, based on this record, in the determination to dismiss Sadora, Sr., a party defendant, or to allow the expert testimony. We note, however, that these issues may be specific to the concluded trial in respect of which we have set aside the judgment, and may not again arise on retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>In view of the foregoing, we set aside the jury\u2019s verdict, reverse the trial court\u2019s order, and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b222-9\"> On February 4, 2005, the court entered summary judgment in favor of ESL.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b225-8\"> The regulations were recodified as <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:70, effective July 1, 1998, <em>see </em>30 <em>N.J.R. </em>2644(a) (July 20, 1998).
