Kennedy, a former member of the Board of Education of the City of Sea Isle (Sea Isle BOE), appeals from the final decision of the State Board of Education (State Board) entered on January 6, 2006, affirming the decision of the Commissioner of Education (Commissioner), which removed appellant from his seat as a member of the Sea Isle BOE. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Appellant\u2019s son, M.K., has been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder and receives special education in the Sea Isle City School District through an Individualized Special Education Program (IEP). Appellant was first elected to the Sea Isle BOE in 2001. On June 29, 2003, appellant resigned. After his resignation, appellant and his wife filed a due process complaint with the Department of Education (Department) against the Sea Isle BOE on behalf of M.K., disputing their son\u2019s special education services, pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1400 to 1482. The action was settled on April 27,2004, pursuant to a stipulation by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">During the settlement process, appellant won a second term on the Sea Isle BOE, and on April 28, 2004, he assumed the position of its president. However, on March 1, 2005, appellant, on behalf of M.K., filed applications with the Department for emergent relief and for enforcement of the 2004 stipulation of settlement against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>the Sea Isle BOE. Appellant claimed that M.K. \u201chas been abused and continues to be abused in his current placement and ... this abuse is the direct result of a lack of support that [M.K.] and his teacher\u2019s aide should be receiving from district personnel and behavioral consultants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">On March 5, 2005, the Sea Isle BOE filed a petition with the Commissioner, seeking a declaratory ruling that appellant was disqualified from holding a position on the local board because the two applications, although filed on behalf of appellant\u2019s son, created an impermissible conflict of interest under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-2. After appellant filed his answer, the matter was referred to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) as a contested proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">On May 16, 2005, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) recommended that the Sea Isle BOE\u2019s petition be dismissed, determining that the local board had failed to demonstrate an incompatible interest on the part of appellant. The ALJ concluded that <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:12-24j created an exception to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-2. In making his decision, the ALJ relied on an October 12, 2004, School Ethics Commission (SEC) advisory opinion in a different matter, which had determined that a parent did not have a substantial conflict of interest in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-24a<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or -24g<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by serving as a member of a local board of education while pursuing an appeal of a Section 504<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> determination. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>SEC did advise, however, that the board member in that case \u201cmust abstain from all board discussions and decisions involving the [section] <em>504 </em>determination pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-24e.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">On June 80, 2005, the Commissioner rejected the ALJ\u2019s initial decision, determining that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-2 controlled, and that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-24j does not serve as an exception to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-2. The Commissioner found that \u201c[h]aving elected to pursue two legal claims against the district alleging violation of the educational rights of his child, there can be no question that [appellant] has an interest of the most direct and personal nature in a claim against the Board____\u201d The Commissioner directed that appellant be removed from his seat on the Sea Isle BOE and directed the Cape May County Superintendent of Schools to fill the vacancy in the April 2006 election. In doing so, the Commissioner determined that the School Ethics Act is intended to guide the conduct of qualified board members, whereas <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-2 provides the standard for determining whether an individual is qualified to be a board member. Lastly, the Commissioner determined that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-2 falls within his jurisdiction and that he is not bound by the SEC\u2019s interpretation of the School Ethics Act. The State Board affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision on January 6,2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">On appeal, appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">\n<em>POINT I.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION DECISION UPHOLDING MR.

KENNEDY, TO PARTICIPATE IN PROCEEDINGS, SUCH AS THE DUE PROCESS IMPARTIAL HEARING, ON BEHALF OF HIS OR HER DISABLED SON.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The judicial role in reviewing decisions of administrative agencies is limited. \u201cOur function is to determine whether the administrative action was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Burris v. Police Dep\u2019t, Township of W. Orange, </em>338 <em>N.J.Super. </em>493, 496, 769 A.2d 1112 (App.Div.2001) (citing <em>Henry v. Rahway State Prison, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>571, 580, 410 A.2d 686 (1980)). \u201cAbsent arbitrary, unreasonable or capricious action, the agency\u2019s determination must be affirmed.\u201d <em>Wnuck v.

Brown-Forman Corp., </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>170,175, 729 A.2d 1 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">Additionally, \u201c[i]t is settled that \u2018[a]n administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of statutes and regulations within its implementing and enforcing responsibility is ordinarily entitled to our deference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>In re Appeal by Progressive Cas. Ins.

Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>313, 327, 478 A.2d 742 (1984). Although this court must give deference to an administrative agency charged with the interpretation of the law, this court is not bound by an agency\u2019s legal opinions. <em>Levine v. State, Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>338 <em>N.J.Super. </em>28, 32, 768 A.2d 192 (App.Div.2001) (citing <em>G.S. v. Dept. of Human Servs., Div. of Youth and Family Servs., </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>161,170, 723 A.2d 612 (1999)); see <em>also, Mayflower Secs. v. Bureau of Secs., </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>85, 93, 312 A.2d 497 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Appellant argues that the School Ethics Act, specifically <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-24j, creates an exception to the prohibition on conflicts of interest in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-2. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A12-2 prohibits a school board member from serving when he or she has a conflict of interest: \u201cNo member of any board of education shall be interested directly or indirectly in any contract with or claim against the board----\u201d Whether a board member has such a conflict \u201cmust be examined on a case-by-case basis ... as to whether the circumstances in the matter demonstrate that the board member would benefit in a substantial and material way from said claim.\u201d <em>Bd. of Educ. of Tp. of Holmdel v. O\u2019Connel, </em>1990 <em>S.L.D. </em>674, 680. A public official\u2019s interest need not be pecuniary in nature for the prohibition to apply. <em>Aldom v. Borough of Roseland, </em>42 <em>N.J.Super. </em>495, 502, 127 A.2d 190 (App.Div.1956). \u201cIt may be indirect; it is such an interest as is covered by the moral rule: no man can serve two masters whose interests conflict.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">The question becomes \u201cwhether the officer, by reason of a personal interest in the matter, is placed in a situation of temptation to serve his own purposes to the prejudice of those for whom the law authorizes him to act as a public official.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201c[T]he pivotal issue is whether the board member\u2019s claim is intended to vindicate the public\u2019s interest or instead will accrue to the board member\u2019s personal benefit.\u201d <em>Bd. of Educ. of Tp. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number><em>Jackson, Ocean County v. Acevedo, </em>92 <em>N.J.A.R.2d </em>(EDU) 163, *16, <em>adopted in part, modified in part, </em>Commissioner\u2019s decision (February 6,1992). If a board member\u2019s claim is made in the interests of the public, then \u201cthe board member is not subject to disqualification, but he or she may be required to abstain from any discussions or votes regarding the litigation.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The School Ethics Act contains a similar provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">No school official or business organization in which he has an interest shall represent any person or party other than the school board or the school district in connection with any cause, proceeding, application or other matter pending before the school district in which he serves or in any proceeding involving the school district in which he serves or, for officers or employees of the New Jersey School Board Association, any school district.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>18A:12-24g.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">However, subsection -24j of the same statute provides an exception to subsection -24g\u2019s prohibitions: \u201cNothing shall prohibit any school official, or members of his immediate family, from representing himself, or themselves, in negotiations or proceedings concerning his, or their, own interests.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-24j.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">Article 1 of Chapter 12 to Title 18A of the Revised Statutes is entitled \u201cQualifications\u201d and sets forth the necessary criteria that an individual must possess to serve on a local board of education. <em>Visotcky v. City Council of Garfield, </em>113 <em>N. J.Super. </em>263, 266, 273 A.2d 597 (App.Div.1971). One criterion is that any prospective candidate for the position must be free of conflicts of interest with the local board. <em>Id. </em>at 266-67, 273 A.2d 597; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-2. Claims regarding an individual\u2019s qualifications to serve on a local board fall under the Commissioner\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:6-9. However, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-24j falls under Article 6 of Title 18A, entitled \u201cStandards of Ethical Conduct.\u201d It is under this Article that the Legislature created the School Ethics Act. The Act falls under the purview of the School Ethics Commission (SEC). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-27. The SEC determines whether the conduct by a sitting board member, or other school official, constitutes a violation of the Act, and if it does, it recommends an appropriate sanction to the Commissioner. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-29c. Accordingly, we conclude that <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:12-2 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-24j govern different situations. <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:12-2 outlines several of the requirements necessary for an individual to qualify as a board member, whereas <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-24 governs the actions of a qualified board member during his or her term on the board. Stated differently, an individual must qualify as a board member under <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A.T2-2 before his or her actions as a board member are regulated by the School Ethics Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">In appellant\u2019s March 1, 2005, application for emergent relief, he claimed that his son \u201chas been abused and continues to be abused in his current placement and that this abuse is the direct result of a lack of support ... from district personnel and behavioral consultants.\u201d Appellant contends that in pursuing the claims on behalf of his son \u201cthat there are no facts that would mandate [his] automatic disqualification as a member of the Board[,] provided that [he] undertakes to abstain from discussions and deliberations regarding [M.K.] and the claims and issues that have been asserted on his behalf.\u201d The Commissioner rejected this argument, determining that appellant\u2019s recusal from all proceedings regarding his son\u2019s claims was not enough to cure the conflict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">Rather ... <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:12-2 is a disqualifying statute, identifying situations that are inherently incompatible with membership on a board of education____At a minimum, [appellant] would routinely be\u2014or equally important, have the opportunity to <em>be\u2014privy </em>to matters involving staffing, programming, and personnel issues that directly or indirectly relate to issues implicated in his claim against the Board, raising both the temptation to act in his own interest and the appearance that he may have done so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">We are satisfied that the Department\u2019s decision removing appellant from his seat on the board was reasonable, given the severity of the claims presented and the potential for future conflicts in appellant\u2019s decision-making as a board member. Additionally, appellant has since filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey under the IDEA \u201cfor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>declaratory, enforcement, compensatory, reimbursement and mandatory injunctive relief\u2019 against the board. In that action, appellant is claiming compensatory damages and reimbursement of expenses, which under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-2, creates a material and substantial benefit to his family; therefore, his claims against the board constitute an impermissible conflict of interest, and his removal from his seat was both appropriate and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Lastly, contrary to appellant\u2019s suggestion, nothing within the Commissioner\u2019s decision suggests that parents, who are also board members, must waive their rights to pursue an IDEA claim against the board upon which they sit. Rather, as the Commissioner stated, they must make a choice: a \u201cparent\u2014like anyone else whose board service requires them to relinquish a claim or contract they would otherwise have the right to pursue\u2014may not simultaneously sit as a board member while maintaining an action against [the board].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Next, we address appellant\u2019s argument that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-24j overrules <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-2, <em>sub silentio, </em>because the two statutes stand for conflicting positions, with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-2 having been enacted earlier in time. Determining that \u201c[t]here is a strong presumption in the law against implied repealers,\u201d <em>Brewer v. Porch, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>167, 173, 249 A.2d 388 (1969), we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">When the School Ethics Act was enacted in 1991, it did not expressly repeal <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-2. Additionally, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-24 has been amended twice since 1991, and in neither the 1995 nor the 1999 amendment did the legislature state that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-24j repealed <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:12-2. Accordingly, any repeal of <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:12-2 would have to be implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">In interpreting two seemingly conflicting statutes, \u201c[e]very reasonable construction should be applied to avoid a finding of implied repealer.\u201d <em>Tp. of Mahwah v. Bergen County Bd. of Taxation, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>268, 281, 486 A.2d 818 (1985). \u201cA repeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>by implication requires clear and compelling evidence of the legislative intent, and such intent must be free from reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280, 486 A.2d 818. \u201cOnly when a later expression of legislative will is clearly in conflict with an earlier statute on the same subject will courts find a legislative intent to supersede earlier law.\u201d <em>Division of Motor Vehicles v. Kleinert, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>363, 369, 486 A.2d 1324 (App.Div.1985). When two statutes can reasonably exist together, \u201ceach in its own particular sphere of action,\u201d it cannot be said that the design of the later statute was to repeal the earlier one. <em>Swede v. City of Clifton, </em>22 <em>N.J. </em>303, 317, 125 A.2d 865 (1956). We are satisfied that under these principles, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-2 was not repealed <em>sub silentio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-2 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-24 involve separate spheres of a board member\u2019s term of office. As stated previously, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-2, determines whether an individual is qualified to sit as a member of a board of education. In contrast, the School Ethics Act governs a board member\u2019s actions after assuming the position. <em>Marinnie, supra, </em>at p. 4. Because the statutes govern separate events in a board member\u2019s term, it cannot be said that the legislature intended to repeal <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-2 when it enacted <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-24j.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">We have carefully reviewed the record in light of the arguments presented by appellant and determine that they are unpersuasive. We affirm for the reasons expressed in the Commissioner\u2019s decision of June 30, 2005. The Commissioner\u2019s construction of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-2, as affirmed by the State Board, was not \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Metromedia, Inc., supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 327, 478 A.2d 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b128-9\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-24j provides: \u201cNothing shall prohibit any school official, or members of his immediate family, from representing himself, or themselves, in negotiations or proceedings concerning his, or their, own interest.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b128-10\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-2 provides in pertinent part: \"No member of a board of education shall be interested directly or indirectly in any contract with or claim against the board____\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b129-7\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:12-24a provides: \"No school official or member of his immediate family shall have an interest in a business organization or engage in any business, transaction, or professional activity, which is in substantial conflict with the proper discharge of his duties in the public interest.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b129-8\"><em>.
