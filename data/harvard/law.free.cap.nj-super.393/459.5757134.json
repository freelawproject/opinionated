We affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the defamation claims but reverse the dismissal of all other claims and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">The four plaintiffs were long-term employees of Laboratorios Essex S.A. (Essex), the Argentinean subsidiary of defendant Schering-Plough Corporation (Schering-Plough). Plaintiffs allege that they were abruptly terminated from Essex after disclosing \u201cwidespread unethical and illegal marketing and sales practices.\u201d The individual defendants, Alfred M. Blanco, Jorge P. Forton, Thomas C. Lauda and Dalton E. Smart, III, are officers of Schering-Plough and defendant Burton D. Hunter is the Senior Legal Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">Plaintiffs alleged that Schering-Plough engaged in \u201cthe pervasive and routine bribing of doctors and public officials\u201d in order \u201cto maximize sales of its anti-infective and anti-cancer products\u201d in Argentina. They allege further that defendants violated the Conscientious Employee Protection Act (CEPA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-1 to - 14, in terminating them because of their disclosures. Although all of the plaintiffs executed settlement agreements (agreements) with releases after their terminations in 2002 and 2003, they claim that they were coerced into entering the agreements because defendants threatened to have them blacklisted from other employment in the industry. Plaintiffs maintain that even though they signed the agreements, defendants defamed them to prospective employers, preventing them from obtaining new employment in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Plaintiff Carlos Alberto Aguerre worked for Schering-Plough for twenty-five years until his termination on October 30, 2002. He was never subject to any disciplinary action or negative employment evaluations. Nevertheless, shortly after objecting to \u201cillegal Schering-Plough marketing practices in a company meeting\u201d he was terminated from his employment. Aguerre also objected to the alleged illegal practices through the Schering-Plough hotline at its headquarters in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">In January 2003, defendants Forton and Smart traveled from New Jersey to Buenos Aires to meet with Aguerre about his allegations of illegal practices. Aguerre voluntarily provided For-ton and Smart with documents demonstrating the illegal conduct. After he received promises of \u201cimmunity\u201d and no reprisals, Aguerre advised Forton and Smart that Archimbal and Caamafio also had information about the illegal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">On February 6, 2003, Aguerre was terminated with a conciliation agreement<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in which he alleged that he received substantially less money than he was entitled to under Argentinean law. Aguerre was represented by counsel of his own choosing in the proceeding before a Labor Conciliator. On February 12,2003, the agreement was confirmed by the Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social Security and reduced to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Plaintiff Hector Hugo Caamafio worked for Essex for twenty-six years. Prior to his termination, he supervised the Marketing, Sales and Medical Departments. He was never subject to any disciplinary measures or adverse employment reviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">On February 6 and 7, 2003, Caamafio claims that Hunter interrogated him about the illegal practices and encouraged him to speak freely, after which Hunter castigated him, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">His next precise words were \u201cA UD SE LO COGIERON!\u201d (YOU HAVE BEEN FUCKED). He said \u201cYou were instructed to proceed in a manner so that these things did not become public and you obviously failed. Everything you have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>just told me, could be told to anybody. [Schering-Plough] cannot take the chance of being related to these kinds of practices. You should have played by the book and kept your mouth shut. Had this not become public, and if you did not come forward to corroborate these accusations, you would probably still have a job in the company. Unfortunately, you are going to have to start looking for another job and I recommend that it be outside the pharmaceutical industry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">On February 20, 2003, \u201cCaama\u00f1o was summoned to a conference room ... where he encountered [Daniel Rutilio] Zuccherino, Sehering-Plough\u2019s General Counsel in Argentina; outside counsel for Schering-Plough; Mr. Del Vigo, Schering-Plough\u2019s Human Resources Officer, and a court reporter.\u201d Caama\u00f1o was then informed that he was being terminated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-7\">Mr. Del Vigo said because of my intentions to denounce the Company\u2019s corrupt practices, I was not considered loyal to the company. He said that Schering-Plough would not hesitate to do the same to any other employee who spoke out against corrupt company practices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-8\">Mr. Del Vigo explained that my termination could take two directions. If I decided to sign the mutual termination agreement, which was shown to me that moment, I would receive a cheek for severance pay plus an additional 30% once the executed agreement was formally approved by the labor court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">If I refused to sign the agreement, Mr. Del Vigo promised that Sehering[-]Plough would make sure that I would never again work for a pharmaceutical <em>company for </em>the rest <em>of my </em>life. He said there was no point for me to even try-taking legal action against Schering-Plough because I would have to pay large legal fees and would probably lose anyway. I replied that I still wanted to consult an attorney to make sure that it was in my best interest to sign the agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-10\">Mr. Zuccherino then said that this was the only offer I would get and I had to decide whether or not to accept their \u201cgenerous offer\u201d then and there. Mr. Del Vigo told me to think of my family, of the possibility of unemployment and the length of a trial that could extend over a period of 4 years. He then gave me a pen and told me to sign before it was too late.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-11\">I though [sic] I had no real choice so I signed the agreement. <em>Mr. Del Vigo then told me that Mr. Jorge Rovillard, Esq.\u2014the person in the conference room I didn't know\u2014would represent me in the labor court.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-12\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-13\">On March 24, 2003, Caama\u00f1o appeared before the National labor Court, represented by Rovillard, where the settlement agreement was memorialized in a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-14\">Hugo Archimbal worked for the Schering-Plough subsidiary for twenty-three years and was the Coordinator of Oncology Products before his termination. He was never subject to any disciplinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>action or negative performance evaluations prior to his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Arehimbal\u2019s experience was similar to Caamafio\u2019s in that he first met with Hunter and was then called into a meeting at which Rovillard, the Schering-Plough attorney, was appointed to represent him. He was given a severance check with instructions to accept it in order to avoid delays. During the meeting, Archimbal was told</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">that Schering-Plough had decided to terminate my labor contract. While telling me this upsetting news he thrust papers in front of my face\u2014which I later found out were my so-called termination agreement and severance check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">I was so shocked I could barely get out my question: \u201cWhy are you doing this to me?\u201d Mr. Del Vigo replied that I was being terminated because I had interfered with Schering-Plough\u2019s business by denouncing the company\u2019s marketing practices as corrupt. [He also told me] that \u201cthere was no room for that kind of behavior in Schering-Plough,\u201d and that any employee who contradicted the company\u2019s marketing policies and practices, for any reason, was a disloyal troublemaker and would suffer the consequences. Mr. Del Vigo said that I was a troublemaker and Schering-Plough wanted to \u201cmake an example\u201d of me and other troublemakers as a warning to other employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">Mr. Del Vigo told me that I had a choice: I could sign a \u201cmutual termination agreement,\u201d which he then handed to me, in which case I would receive the prepared severance check and a promised additional 15% after the agreement had been approved by the labor court. Mr. [D]el Vigo said that if I didn\u2019t sign the agreement, I would still be fired from my job and Schering-Plough would do everything in its power to avoid paying me any severance at all, and would provide negative job references to make sure I would never get another job in the pharmaceutical industry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-9\">I responded that I didn\u2019t understand the agreement and I wanted to consult with an attorney and think it over. Mr. Zuccherino then said that this \u201cgenerous\u201d offer was valid only if I signed it that moment, since the company wanted to resolve the problem as soon as possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-10\">Mr. Del Vigo said I should think of my family, of the possibility of unemployment and the length of a trial that could extend over a period of 4 years, or even longer if Schering[-]Plough appealed, which it would certainly do. He then handed me a pen and told me to sign before it was too late____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-11\">I was also told that Mr. Jorge Rovillard, Esq., whom I had never before met, was to be \u201cmy attorney\u201d before the relevant labor court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-12\">I gave in to the pressure and-signed the agreement. I didn\u2019t think I really had any other choice but to do so. In truth, I never really agreed to terminate my job at Schering-Plough. I was fired and forced to sign an agreement that falsely described my termination as by mutual agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>On March 11, 2003, Archimbal appeared before the National Labor Court with Rovillard as his counsel. Judgment was entered memorializing the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Maria Cristina Fernandez worked for Essex for ten years. She was Vice-President and Co-Chair of the Board of Directors of the subsidiary \u201cmanag[ing] the Sales, Finance and Customer Service Departments, supervised twenty-one people, including the Medical Director, the Manager of Sales, fourteen Sales Coordinators and several Medical Assistants.\u201d Fernandez reported directly to the president of the subsidiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Fernandez alleges that she was terminated because she denounced \u201cthe illegal marketing and sales practices\u201d of the subsidiary and \u201crefused to go along with such practices.\u201d After her termination, Fernandez, represented by her own attorney, entered a settlement agreement pursuant to which \u201cshe received the amount of money mandated by Argentine law.\u201d The agreement was confirmed by the Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social Security on October 11,2002 and reduced to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">On September 18, 2003, plaintiffs filed their initial complaint. Three amended complaints were subsequently filed. Before any discovery, defendants moved for summary judgment in lieu of answering the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">The trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion on the grounds that (1) the Foreign Country Money-Judgments Recognition Act (FCMJRA or the Act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:49A-16 to -24, precluded plaintiffs from bringing an action in the United States because each of their agreements were reduced to judgment in Argentina;</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">(2) \u201cthe judgments entered in Argentina were final and conclusive;\u201d and (3) the judgments \u201cwill be or would be enforceable under New Jersey law under ... the Foreign Country Money[-]Judgment[s] Recognition Act unless they fall ... within one of the exceptions.\u201d The court found that the judgments did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>fall within any of the exceptions, articulated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:49A-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Plaintiffs argued that their complaint falls within the public policy exception in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:49A-20b(3). The trial court found that, although New Jersey\u2019s public policy supports CEPA claims brought by mistreated whistleblowers, the issue is not relevant here because the pertinent question is whether the Argentine judgments are enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">With respect to the defamation claims, the trial court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">[t]here\u2019s [sic] no allegations that defamatory statements were published in New Jersey or that the plaintiffs worked here or were attempting to get work here. This is a claim that really arises out of the impact of the conduct in Argentina. The defense argues that as a result of the circumstances that New Jersey ... is an inconvenient forum and the case should be dismissed for that reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">In their motion for reconsideration, plaintiffs argued that they \u201cdid not receive substantial consideration for waiving their rights against the defendant and[,] on [that] basis ... Argentine res judicata law would not bar these claims.\u201d The court did not consider that ground an appropriate basis for reconsideration and denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-13\">Plaintiffs appealed and argue here that the trial court erred in (1) recognizing the Argentine judgments and agreements under the FCMJRA; and (2) dismissing the defamation claims on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-14\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b498-15\">The FCMJRA provides parties who have previously litigated an issue with a tool for enforcing money judgments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Act provides that a foreign country\u2019s money judgment entitled to recognition will be enforceable in the same manner as the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>ment of a sister state entitled to full faith and credit. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:49A-19. There are a number of statutory exceptions to the enforceability of a foreign country\u2019s money judgment. The Act is inapplicable if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">[a.] (1) the judgment was rendered under a system which does not provide impartial tribunals or procedures compatible with the requirements of due process of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">(2) the foreign country court did not have personal jurisdiction over the judgment debtor; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">(3) the foreign country court did not have jurisdiction over the subject matter, b. A foreign country money-judgment need not be recognized if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">(1) the judgment debtor in the proceedings in the foreign country court did not receive notice of the proceedings in sufficient time to enable the judgment debtor to defend;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-10\">(2) the judgment was obtained by fraud;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-11\">(3) the cause of action on which the foreign judgment is based is contrary to the public policy of this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-12\">(4) the judgment conflicts with a prior final and conclusive judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-13\">(5) the proceedings in the foreign country court were contrary to an agreement between the parties under which the dispute in question was to be settled, other than by proceedings in that court; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-14\">(6) in the case of jurisdiction based only on personal service, the foreign country court was a seriously inconvenient forum for the trial of the action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-15\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:49A-20.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-16\">The focus of our review is b(3), commonly called the public policy exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-17\">As a threshold issue, we consider whether the FCMJRA, which is usually employed to enforce judgments, may be raised as an affirmative defense to preclude litigation of issues underlying the judgment. The Assembly Judiciary Committee report notes that the 1997 amendments changed the term \u201cdefendant\u201d to \u201cjudgment debtor\u201d in order \u201cto be more comprehensive since there may be circumstances where the defendant in a matter is the successful judgment creditor.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:49A-16, <em>L. </em>1997, c. 96. Implicit in this amendment is the notion that a successful judgment creditor can assert the Act as an affirmative defense. We conclude that the FCMJRA may, therefore, be pled as an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>In <em>Sw. Livestock &amp; Trucking Co. v. Ramon, </em>169 <em>F.3d </em>317, 319 (5th Cir.1999), the defendant obtained a judgment against the plaintiffs in Mexico for the amount owed on a promissory note. While the suit in Mexico was being litigated, the plaintiffs filed suit in the United States District Court, \u201calleging that the loan arrangement violated Texas usury laws.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>After the Mexican court entered its judgment in favor of the defendant, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment in the Federal District Court. <em>Ibid. </em>The defendant also moved for summary judgment, claiming that \u201cthe Mexican judgment barred [the plaintiffs\u2019] suit\u201d under the Texas Uniform Foreign Country Money-Judgment Recognition Act. <em>Ibid. </em>The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs on the ground that the promissory note violated Texas public policy against usury. <em>Ibid. </em>The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, however, finding that the defendant was entitled to recognition of the Mexican judgment. Id. at 322. The court specifically noted that different considerations apply when a party uses the Act as an affirmative defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">The company is in a position different from that of a plaintiff who seeks to enforce a cause of action conferred by the laws of another state. The right which it claims should be given effect is set up by way of defense to an asserted liability; and to a defense different considerations apply. A state may, on occasion, decline to enforce a foreign cause of action. In so doing, it merely denies a remedy leaving unimpaired the plaintiff\u2019s substantive right, so that he is free to enforce it elsewhere. But to refuse to give effect to a substantive defense under the applicable laws of another state, as under the circumstances here presented, subjects the defendant to irremediable liability. This may not be done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\"><em>[Ibid, (quoting Bradford Elec. Light Co. v. Clapper, </em>286 <em>U.S. </em>145,160, 52 <em>S.Ct. </em>571, 576, 76 <em>L.Ed. </em>1026 (1932) (finding that recognition of an agreement to abide by the terms of a sister state\u2019s act was required and permissible as an affirmative defense)). <em>But see Van Kooten Holding B.V. </em>u <em>Dumarco Corp., </em>1988 <em>WL </em>6677, *2, 1988 <em>U.S. Dist. </em>LEXIS 613, *6 (N. D.Ill. January 22, 1988) (noting that counterclaims that could have been brought in the original action cannot be raised in a subsequent action to block the enforceability of the original judgment).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Thus, the Fifth Circuit court concluded that the Mexican judgment was entitled to recognition despite the fact that the underlying cause of action violated Texas public policy. <em>Sw. Livestock, supra, </em>169 <em>F.3d </em>at 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision is not binding on us and is not persuasive on the issue of whether these foreign judgments violate New Jersey\u2019s public policy regarding whistleblowers. Plaintiffs argue that the judgments should not be recognized because they are based on retaliation against them in violation of CEPA. The trial court found that the underlying action was \u201ca settlement of an employer/employee claim upon termination of that relationship,\u201d and that the public policy favoring negotiated settlements outweighed the policy underlying CEPA. The trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOQ\">Public policy in New Jersey favors negotiated settlement of disputes. It\u2019s permissible under New Jersey law for an employee and an employer upon termination of their relationship to reach a settlement, for the employee to relinquish claims against the employer in exchange for money. As a result, these judgments do not violate New Jersey public policy. Accordingly, this Court finds that the judgments in question are entitled to full faith and credit in New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">We disagree. While New Jersey does, indeed, favor negotiated settlements, <em>Puder v. Buechel, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>428, 437-39, 874 A.2d 534 (2005), CEPA is the Legislature\u2019s expression of a strong public policy in that \u201c[i]ts purpose is to protect and encourage employees to report illegal or unethical workplace activities and to discourage public and private sector employees from engaging in such conduct.\u201d <em>Abbamont v. Piscataway Twp. Bd. of Educ., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>405, 431, 650 A.2d 958 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The CEPA is remedial legislation and \u201cshould be construed liberally to effectuate its important social goal.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, the statute is a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">\u201creaffirmation of [New Jersey\u2019s] repugnance to an employer\u2019s retaliation against an employee who has done nothing more than assert statutory rights and protections and a recognition by the Legislature of a preexisting common-law tort cause of action for such retaliatory discharge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>LePore v. Nat\u2019l Tool &amp; Mfg. Co., </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>226, 228, 557 A.2d 1371 (1989)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">In our view, the strong public policy underlying CEPA substantially outweighs the policy favoring settlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">To establish a prima facie claim under CEPA, a plaintiff must show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>(1) a reasonable belief that the employer\u2019s conduct was violating either a law, rule, regulation or public policy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\">(2) he or she performed a \u201cwhistle blowing\u201d activity as described in <em>N.J.S.A, </em>34:19-3(a) or (c);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">(3) an adverse employment action was taken against him or her; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">(4) a causal connection existed between his whistle-blowing activity and the adverse employment action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\"><em>[Klein v. Univ. of Med. &amp; Dentistry, </em>377 <em>N.J.Super. </em>28, 38, 871 A.2d 681 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>39, 878 A.2d 856 (2005) (citing <em>Bowles v.

McDevitt, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>451, 462, 828 A.2d 893 (2003).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Here, plaintiffs have alleged that defendants retaliated against them for their disclosures of Schering-Plough\u2019s illegal practices in Argentina and that the settlement agreements were coerced. Plaintiffs have pled the elements of a CEPA claim. As such, they fall within the public policy exception to the FCMJRA. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:49A-20b(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">Plaintiffs argue that the settlement agreements should be set aside because they were coerced. A settlement should always be entered into voluntarily. <em>Peskin v.

A settlement achieved through coercion must be set aside. <em>Jennings v. Reed, </em>381 <em>N.J.Super. </em>217, 227, 885 A.2d 482 (2005) (quoting <em>Pascarella v.

Kushner, </em>365 <em>N.J.Super. </em>304, 312-13, 839 A.2d 90 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>354, 851 A.2d 648 (2004) (holding that plaintiff was not coerced into entering a settlement agreement in an employment/partnership relationship, where plaintiffs terms were incorporated into the agreement and it provided a twenty day attorney review period).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">Each of the agreements contains different release language. Aguerre, who was represented by counsel of his own choice, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>released only Essex. Fernandez, who was also represented by counsel of her choice, released Essex \u201cor any company of the Schering-Plough S.A. Group,\u201d referring to the South American subsidiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Archimbal and Caama\u00f1o were both represented by Sehering-Plough\u2019s counsel. The language in their releases included Essex and all Schering-Plough entities. Thus, the all-inclusive release language lends weight to plaintiffs\u2019 claims that Archimbal and Caama\u00f1o, who were represented by Schering-Plough\u2019s counsel, were coerced to enter agreements containing the more comprehensive releases. Aguerre and Fernandez, who were represented by counsel of their choice, did not release Schering-Plough but claim that they were coerced to enter the agreements. If the agreements are set aside, however, <em>the </em>release language is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Having met the public policy exception to the FCMJRA, plaintiffs are entitled to pursue their claims that the agreements were coerced and to proceed with discovery on this issue, as well as their substantive CEPA claims. If plaintiffs are successful in having the agreements set aside, they may pursue their substantive CEPA claims against defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">The trial court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 defamation claims on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens. </em>In their complaint, each of the plaintiffs alleged that defamatory statements made by Schering-Plough damaged their reputations, preventing them from finding work in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">In dismissing the defamation claims, the trial court found that [t]he defamation conduct took place in Argentina. Argentina is where the plaintiffs sought employment, where the ... defamatory statements, if they were made, had an effect. There\u2019s no allegation [J that defamatory statements were published in New Jersey or that the plaintiffs worked here or were attempting to get work here. This is a claim that really arises out of the impact of conduct in Argentina. The defense argues that as a result of the circumstances that New Jersey is ... an inconvenient forum ... and the ease should be dismissed for that reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>The court noted further that \u201cmost if not all of the witnesses would be in Argentina\u201d and a New Jersey court would have no power to compel Argentine witnesses to appear in New Jersey. Moreover, the significant expense of transporting people from Argentina to New Jersey, the time and expense of having all documents translated from Spanish to English and providing interpreters for the witnesses weigh in favor of the defamation claims being tried in Argentina where the conduct and the impact of the conduct occurred. On this issue we agree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u201cThe doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens, </em>an equitable principle, is firmly embedded in the law of this State. Although phrased in a variety of ways, the essence of the doctrine is that a court may decline jurisdiction whenever the ends of justice indicate a trial in the forum selected by the plaintiff would be inappropriate.\u201d <em>D\u2019Agostino v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, Inc., </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>250, 258-59, 542 A.2d 44 (1988), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>516, 628 A.2d 305 (1993) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">There are public and private interest factors to be considered in making a choice between forums. The private interest factors include practical matters, such as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">(1) the relative ease of access to sources of proof, (2) the availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling witnesses and the cost of obtaining the attendance of willing witnesses, (3) whether a view of the premises is appropriate to the action and (4) all other practical problems that make trial of the ease \u201ceasy, expeditious and inexpensive,\u201d including the enforceability of the ultimate judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaG\"><em>[Id. </em>at 263, 542 A.2d 44 (quoting <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v.

They see no impediment in having witnesses travel to New Jersey or in having all of the documents translated or interpreters provided in New Jersey. Commenting on the public interest factors, plaintiffs note that \u201cSchering-Plough is one of the largest employers in one of the most important industries in New Jersey,\u201d and that \u201cSchering-Plough has, in recent years, been the subject of public scrutiny at home and abroad for a variety of illegal activities that have resulted in, among other things, the imposition of hundreds of millions of dollars in fines and ouster of the president of the company.\u201d Plaintiffs maintain that defendants\u2019 defamatory conduct was in retaliation for plaintiffs having \u201cblown the whistle\u201d on \u201ccorrupt acts committed by or with the complicity and approval of the defendants from their Kenilworth!,] New Jersey, headquarters.\u201d Consequently, plaintiffs maintain that the defamation claims should be litigated in New Jersey. Defendants argue that \u201cthere is absolutely no New Jersey nexus to or interest in a localized defamation dispute having all of its roots in Argentina.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">In weighing the public and private interest factors, we see no valid reason for retaining jurisdiction over the defamation claims. The alleged defamatory conduct and the consequences thereof occurred in Argentina. The witnesses, the documents and the cause of action are all particular to Argentina and we have no power to compel Argentine witnesses to appear in New Jersey. We, therefore, affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment dismissing the defamation claims on the ground of <em>forum, non conveniens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">To summarize our decision, we find that plaintiffs\u2019 CEPA claims, which underlie the Argentinean settlements and judgments, raise significant public policy issues in the context of corporate retaliation against whistleblowers employed by a foreign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>corporation with its roots in New Jersey. These issues warrant litigation of plaintiffs\u2019 claims in New Jersey under the public policy exception to the FCMJRA. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:49A-20b(3). Plaintiffs may proceed with discovery on the questions of (1) whether the settlement agreements were coerced; and (2) whether defendants violated the anti-retaliation provisions of CEPA. The trial court\u2019s dismissal of the defamation claims on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens, </em>however, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Affirmed in part; reversed and remanded in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-11\"> The conciliation agreements are settlement agreements that were reduced to judgments in Argentina.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b498-16\"> A \"foreign country money-judgment means any judgment of a foreign state granting or denying recovery of a sum of money, other than a judgment for taxes, a fine or other penalty, or a judgment for support in matrimonial or family matters.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:49A-17.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
