According to her trial testimony, on November 21, 2001, at 11:30 p.m., Clayton was in her apartment located at the rear of 63 West Broadway in Salem, New Jersey. The lights were on in the living room and in her bedroom, and television sets were on in her brother\u2019s and son\u2019s rooms. Her son, who was age four or five at the time, \u201cbusted\u201d into Clayton\u2019s bedroom, \u201c[k]ind of scared but calm,\u201d and reported something that made her first go check on her paralyzed brother, and then go to her son\u2019s room to look out the window. Clayton testified that she then \u201cwent back to my room to cut the circuit breaker off\u2019 after seeing \u201ca couple people out the window ... on the side of the house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Clayton called the police \u201cand said somebody\u2019s trying to break in.\u201d She saw \u201cfour or five\u201d people and when she \u201clift[ed] the window up they started walking off so I went to my back door and that\u2019s when the police came, and they started running, and they jumped over the fence into Westside Court.\u201d At trial she testified that before the police arrived, one of the people \u201casked could he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>come in,\u201d and another responded \u201c[s]he know me, come on\u201d as if to urge the original speaker to leave. She was not able to identify any of these individuals by sight, but testified the second voice she heard outside (urging the others to \u201ccome on\u201d) was Burden\u2019s, a fact she had not immediately reported to the police. According to Clayton, she knew Burden as \u201cG-Money,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c[f]rom when he used to come to my house on [63 West] Broadway.\u201d She testified that he was welcome in her home, came there \u201ca lot\u201d and that she knew him both by sight and voice.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Clayton admitted that she did not tell the police that she recognized Burden\u2019s voice until two years after the incident, around the time she was indicted on drug charges. She insisted, however, that she was not promised any favorable treatment in return for identifying Burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">According to both Clayton and police witnesses, immediately after the incident an inspection of Clayton\u2019s apartment windows revealed that a \u201cscreen was off\u2019 one of the windows, a condition which she testified had not previously existed in the four years she had lived there. In fact she testified that she had looked out her son\u2019s window earlier that night, and the screen was in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Officer Delapaz testified that he \u201cwas dispatched for a prowler complaint\u201d to Clayton\u2019s address, and was \u201cthe first one on the scene.\u201d He \u201ccircled the perimeter around to the house,\u201d encountered Clayton at the back of the building and was talking to her when he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">heard some noise coming from the west side of the house where there was a chain link fence. I looked over to the left side of the house past the chain link fence and I saw three subjects in dark clothing running south on, past the house towards the chain link fence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">As soon as I saw what was going on ... I just got on the radio, let the other officers know ... [tjhere were three subjects running towards the fence which is connected to the West Side Court property, jumped the fence and where they were running.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Upon receiving the report of an attempted burglary or prowler at 63 West Broadway, and Patrolman Delapaz\u2019s update \u201cthat the suspects had jumped the fence and ran into Westside Court,\u201d Patrolman Robinson went directly to Westside Court. While there he observed \u201ctwo black males running towards me ... and then they changed direction.\u201d The men were running from the direction of \u201ca set of dumpsters ... approximately ten to fifteen feet\u201d from the fence behind Clayton\u2019s residence. Robinson \u201cordered them to stop, and they continued to run so [he] pursued them on foot,\u201d while other officers were also \u201cengaged in the pursuit.\u201d Four suspects were caught, arrested and handcuffed, then brought to police headquarters.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Robinson was then \u201cre-dispatched to the scene\u201d and retraced the suspects\u2019 steps to a dumpster in which he \u201cfound a Mack 11 automatic weapon and a loaded magazine.\u201d Because the gun and ammo clip were dry when found at the scene, whereas the dumpster and its other contents were wet with condensation, Detective Schaffer testified that \u201cthat weapon [had] recently been placed in that container because there was no condensation nor rust.\u201d The weapon and ammunition went through forensic examinations for fingerprints, but \u201c[n]o readable latent prints were found.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Detective Schaffer interviewed the four individuals taken into custody that night, after all were read their Miranda<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> rights. He testified that \u201c[t]hree individuals didn\u2019t wish to make any taped statements or any comments\u201d but one individual, who identified himself as Jermaine Jefferson, did give a handwritten, signed statement in Schaffer\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Approximately two years after his arrest, while awaiting trial, defendant attempted to engage in witness tampering during a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>telephone call he made from the Salem County jail. Burden called a friend, Marcus \u201cSmooth\u201d Thompkins, and induced Thompkins to call Clayton on another phone. Then, with Thompkins on the phone to Clayton, Burden coached Thompkins to make Clayton an offer of money to refrain from testifying. His attempt was discovered because the jail recorded all such outgoing calls, on notice to the inmates. According to Clayton, on September 7, 2003, while hospitalized for kidney problems, she received a telephone call in her hospital room from an unknown person, who offered her $200 if she would not testify against Burden. When a tape of the call recorded at the jail was played for her, she recognized Burden\u2019s voice coaching the person who called her. The tape was played for the jury at the conclusion of Clayton\u2019s direct testimony, after both parties stipulated to the recording\u2019s authenticity. In his trial testimony, Burden admitted that he offered Clayton money not to testify against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The prosecution also presented testimony from the one co-defendant who had cooperated with the State. This witness had, at all times from his arrest to his direct testimony at trial, identified himself as Jermaine Jefferson. Jefferson testified that he \u201cgot locked up\u201d on November 21, 2001, for \u201c[attempting to take some money.\u201d The attempt was the result of an agreement between Jefferson, Burden, whom he knew only as \u201cG-Money,\u201d and two other men, to commit a home invasion in Salem. He recalled that the four men stopped in Vineland, New Jersey on their way to Salem \u201cto get the gun,\u201d an idea he claimed was Burden\u2019s. He stated that Burden got the gun and showed it to him, and that he was \u201caware that there was going to be a gun involved in this attempted break-in ... [to m]ake the job easy____ Usually when people see a gun, they tend to give up the money.\u201d Jefferson said he \u201cexpect[ed] to find people in the house\u201d they were to rob, and described the gun to be used as \u201ca little MAC, little MAC 11 machine gun.\u201d He identified the gun and ammunition entered into evidence by the prosecution as that which Burden possessed the night of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Jefferson recalled that when the car carrying the group stopped in Salem, \u201cwe had to use the bathroom. So we ... did that and [the] lady had came to the window, mentioned something. Somebody got into, words was exchanged and pretty much what happened.\u201d He claimed he did not remember who exchanged words with Clayton and that Burden had the gun \u201con his person\u201d during the incident. He recalled that after going to the bathroom \u201cby the side of the house\u201d the group was attempting \u201c[t]o go in\u201d the house through a door, but when asked if they were \u201csuccessful in your attempt to gain access to that house,\u201d he responded, \u201cNo, we never attempted to go in ... [because c]ops came from everywhere.\u201d Jefferson recalled that when the police arrived \u201cwe all ran our separate ways ... we just, we all split up.\u201d He admitted to climbing the fence bordering Clayton\u2019s property. He stated he did not see what Burden did with the gun after the police arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">At trial, Burden testified that on the night of the incident, he came to Salem from Philadelphia with \u201cJermaine Jefferson, Wayne Jefferson, Billy Dee Jones, and Clarence Cantie\u201d in Can-tie\u2019s vehicle \u201cto see some girls.\u201d He testified that though he knew residents of 63 West Broadway, that was not the group\u2019s intended destination, but rather they stopped there \u201cto urinate\u201d after their long ride from Philadelphia. He testified that he did not know Clayton but he did know the brother who lived with her, from when they played basketball together.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Burden testified that while his group was urinating outside the building, \u201csomebody came to the window and it was Tameka Clayton and she said ... what are you all doing out there[.]\u201d He claimed that \u201cwe wasn\u2019t even on their property ... but you could see a window [of Clayton\u2019s apartment] from there.\u201d He denied saying \u201cshe know me\u201d while outside the building, but recalled her saying \u201cI\u2019m calling the police\u201d when one of his companions responded to her. Because he \u201chad a warrant for a traffic ticket ... I just ran\u201d when he heard the patrol ear arrive. He admitted on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>cross-examination to jumping over the fence behind Clayton\u2019s building, but denied seeing any dumpsters on the other side of that fence. He insisted he was walking not running when he encountered the police on Westside Court, and explained to the police he had just come from urinating. The police responded by placing him under arrest and taking him to the station.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Burden insisted that \u201c[n]o one [in his group] tried to enter [Clayton\u2019s] home.\u201d He also denied touching the screen on her window and explained, \u201cYou can\u2019t touch the window____No way you can touch the window. You need a ladder to even touch that window.\u201d He also denied having a gun with him, or seeing anyone else with \u201ca gun that night.\u201d Specifically, he denied ever seeing the gun and ammunition placed in evidence by the prosecution before being \u201cat the police station,\u201d and on cross-examination denied getting the gun that night \u201cfrom Vineland\u201d or even going to Vineland at all. Finally, he denied that he \u201cand any of the people there ever had any decision to commit a robbery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Burden admitted to two prior convictions, a third-degree offense in 1994 and a second-degree offense in 1996, and the sentences he received, but claimed he had \u201cput all that behind me.\u201d He insisted that he \u201cnever committed a crime that night, never\u2014me and her brother is friends. I never\u2014why would I commit a crime? I never tried to commit a crime.\u201d He did however admit having Marcus \u201cSmooth\u201d Thompkins call Clayton in 2003 to address her claim that she had recognized Burden\u2019s voice on the night of the incident. He admitted that the tape-recording of this call, played in court, included his voice and he attempted to explain why he contacted Clayton:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-10\">In 2003 she come up with this statement saying that she heard my voice ... I had not been involved with this crime. <em>So I\u2019m like I keep steady coming to court from the street, taking off work, coming in here, </em>and they offer me all this time about this crime, and I never committed a crime, <em>and ... it was getting worser and worser every time I came in here. </em>So, my thing was, well, if I could resolve it, you know, through her and give her, you know a couple hundred dollars and just be done with it ... [I]f she never made up a new testimony I would have never offered her any money, but when she made up her new testimony I seen that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>damaging to me. She was trying to jam me up, and that\u2019s when I came up with offering her a couple hundred dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">I didn\u2019t think it was illegal at all, because if I thought it was illegal I would have never said I\u2019m going to get you to sign something for my lawyer____I wanted her to sign something so I could have it present for my lawyer just in case she changed her mind about any testimony that she\u2019s supposed to give. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Burden admitted upon questioning that when ThompMns made the call to Clayton, Burden was \u201c[i]n Salem County Jail\u201d but he denied that he ever \u201csaid I was at work when I made the call.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">On this appeal, Burden raises the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-11\">POINT I: DEFENDANT WAS DENIED HIS RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS AND FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS UNDER THE NEW JERSEY CONSTITUTION AND HIS FEDERAL AND STATE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO CONFRONT THE WITNESSES AGAINST HIM BY THE STATE\u2019S FAILURE TO DISCLOSE THE TRUE IDENTITY AND CRIMINAL HISTORY OF WAYNE \u201cWIZ\u201d JEFFERSON.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-12\">POINT II: DEFENDANT WAS DEPRIVED OF HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO EFFECTIVE CROSS-EXAMINATION AND TO PRESENT A COMPLETE DEFENSE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-13\">POINT III: THE JURY INSTRUCTIONS WERE DEFICIENT IN MULTIPLE RESPECTS. (Not Raised Below).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-14\">POINT IV: THE PROSECUTOR DEPRIVED DEFENDANT OF A FAIR TRIAL BY ASKING HIM QUESTIONS ON CROSS-EXAMINATION WHICH ELICITED THAT HE WAS INCARCERATED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-15\">POINT V: IMPROPER TESTIMONY COMMENTING UPON DEFENDANT\u2019S EXERCISE OF HIS RIGHT AGAINST SELF-INCRIMINATION WAS ADMITTED IN VIOLATION OF DEFENDANT\u2019S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. (Not Raised Below).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-16\">POINT VI: DEFENDANT WAS DEPRIVED OF HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT [TO] A SPEEDY TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-17\">POINT VII: CUMULATIVE ERROR IN THIS MATTER REQUIRES THE REVERSAL OF DEFENDANT\u2019S CONVICTIONS AND A NEW TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-18\">POINT VIII: DEFENDANT\u2019S SENTENCE IS MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnO\">POINT IX: DEFENDANT\u2019S 20 YEAR SENTENCE, WHICH EXCEEDED THE THEN-EFFECTIVE PRESUMPTIVE EXTENDED TERM FOR DE-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>PENDANT\u2019S SECOND DEGREE CONVICTION FOR CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT ROBBERY BY FIVE YEARS, WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">[The court\u2019s discussion of Points I, II and IV through IX has been omitted at the court\u2019s direction]</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">We next address defendant\u2019s claim that the jury should have been given a charge concerning consideration of other bad acts, under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b), and <em>State v. Cofield, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>328, 341\u201442, 605 A.2d 230 (1992), to assist them in properly weighing evidence of defendant\u2019s attempted witness tampering. We recognize that the evidence of Burden\u2019s attempt to bribe Clayton not to testify against him, and his later conversation with Jefferson in a courthouse hallway,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> might be viewed as part of the res gestae. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) \u201cprohibits the introduction of evidence of past acts of misconduct as a basis for an inference that defendant committed the acts for which he or she is then standing trial.\u201d <em>State v. Martini, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>176, 240, 619 A.2d 1208 (1993), <em>overruled in part on other grounds, State v. Fortin, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>540, 647, 843 A.2d 974 (2004). In other words the jury may not infer that defendant has a general propensity to commit crimes because he committed other bad acts. On the other hand, where the alleged bad act is part of the full picture of the crime charged it has sometimes been considered res gestae evidence to which <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) is not applicable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">\u201cOther crimes\u201d evidence which relates directly to the crimes for which the defendant is on trial is admissible if it \u201cserves to paint a complete picture of the relevant criminal transaction,\u201d \u201c \u2018furnishes part of the context of the crime/ \u201d or \u201c \u2018is necessary to a full presentation of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Martini, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>176, 242, 619 A.2d 1208 (1993) (quoting <em>United States v. Masters, </em>622 <em>F.2d </em>83, 86 (4th Cir.1980)). In <em>Martini, </em>the Court found it \u201cridiculous\u201d to conclude that the State should be prevented from showing that the defendant had driven the victim\u2019s stolen car to the diner to pick up his ransom and had threatened her simply because he was not charged with those crimes. <em>Ibid. </em>This type of evidence may be considered within the <em>res gestae </em>of the charged crimes. <em>State v. Cherry, </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>503, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>522, 674 A.2d 589 (App.Div.1995). No limiting instruction is necessary when the \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence was related to the <em>res gestae. Martini, supra, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>at 242, 619 A.2d 1208.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\"><em>[State v. Torres, </em>313 <em>N.J.Super. </em>129, 160-61, 713 A.2d 1 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>425, 719 A.2d 1023 (1998).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">In this ease, although the witness tampering occurred two years after the crime, it might be argued that the undisputed evidence of Burden\u2019s attempt to bribe Clayton into refusing to testify was directly related to the original crime which he was charged, since it was an attempt to conceal that crime. <em>See Cherry, supra, </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 522, 674 A.2d 589; <em>State v. Pierro, </em>355 <em>N.J.Super. </em>109, 117-18, 809 A.2d 804 (App.Div.2002), <em>certif. denied, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>434, 815 A.2d 479 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">We conclude, however, that the res gestae arguments are foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>State v. Williams, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>114, 919 A.2d 90 (2007). In <em>Williams, </em>the defendant shot a driver hired to transport defendant and his guests to defendant\u2019s house. Immediately after the shooting, defendant attempted to cover it up by asking witnesses to lie about what happened and by tampering with evidence to make it appear that the shooting was a suicide. At his first trial the post-shooting conduct was admitted \u201cwith a limiting instruction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 121, 919 A.2d 90. Defendant was convicted of all charges relating to his post-shooting conduct, including hindering apprehension, tampering with evidence and witness tampering. <em>Id. </em>at 117, 919 A.2d 90. He was acquitted of aggravated manslaughter and aggravated assault, but the jury deadlocked on the reckless manslaughter charge. <em>Id. </em>at 117-18, 919 A.2d 90. Prior to a re-trial on the reckless manslaughter charge only, the trial court ruled that the State could not introduce evidence of Williams\u2019 post-shooting conduct to prove consciousness of guilt. <em>Id. </em>at 117-18, 919 A.2d 90. We affirmed on leave granted; the Supreme Court granted leave to appeal on the admissibility of the post-shooting conduct, and reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 118, 919 A.2d 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Significantly, the Court\u2019s opinion states that \u201c[t]he admissibility of that other-crimes evidence is governed by <em>Evidence Rule </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>404(b), as the trial court and the Appellate Division correctly understood.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 121-22, 919 A.2d 90. Analyzing the evidence under the test set forth in <em>Cofield, supra, </em>the Court concluded that the evidence was admissible under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b), because it was relevant as \u201cclassic consciousness of guilt evidence.\u201d <em>Williams, supra, </em>at 129, 919 A.2d 90. The Court also concluded that the second <em>Cofield </em>prong, \u201crequiring that the \u2018other acts\u2019 be similar in kind and reasonably close in time,\u201d was not applicable to consciousness of guilt evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 131, 919 A.2d 90. And since defendant had been convicted there was no issue as to the clear and convincing proof of the other crime. <em>Ibid. </em>Further, in weighing the possible prejudicial effect as opposed to the probative value of the evidence, the Court recognized that \u201c[tjhere is no risk that a jury hearing this other-crimes evidence will confuse it as exhibiting defendant\u2019s predisposition to commit a certain type of like crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133 n. 9, 919 A.2d 90. Therefore the Court concluded that the evidence should be admissible. <em>Id. </em>at 133-34, 919 A.2d 90. However, the trial court must give a limiting instruction to the jury, directing that \u201cthe evidence may be used only to assess defendant\u2019s mental state\u201d and that the jury \u201cshould not draw any inference of consciousness of guilt by defendant from his post-crime conduct unless it believes that defendant acted to cover up a crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133-34, 919 A.2d 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The Court\u2019s opinion does not indicate whether the State argued that the post-shooting conduct might be considered part of the res gestae and thus not subject to the requirement of a limiting instruction under <em>Cofield. </em>However, our unreported opinion indicates that the State raised precisely that argument and we rejected it. <em>State v. Williams, </em>No. A-2724-04; A-3939-04; A-2725-04; A-2726-04; A-2727-04, 2005 <em>WL </em>3968822at *5 (App.Div. Apr. 21, 2006). We are bound by the Court\u2019s clear and unequivocal statement that the post-shooting cover-up evidence must be analyzed under <em>Evidence Rule </em>404(b) and that a limiting instruction is required. <em>Williams, supra, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>at 129, 133-34, 919 A.2d 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Our <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) analysis of Burden\u2019s admitted attempt to bribe Clayton into silence mirrors that of the Court in <em>Williams. </em>The evidence is highly relevant to Burden\u2019s consciousness of guilt. His telephone call was tape-recorded by the jail, and he admitted to it at trial. As in <em>Williams, </em>this is not evidence of a crime similar to the one Burden was charged with, thus greatly attenuating the risk that the jury would conclude that it was evidence of Burden\u2019s predisposition to commit the type of crime with which he was charged. We conclude that \u201c[t]he evidence\u2019s use for state of mind purposes is permitted under <em>Rule </em>404(b) and any prejudicial concern about predisposition is outweighed by probative value of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133, 919 A.2d 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Moreover, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s failure to sua sponte give the jury a limiting instruction under <em>Cofield </em>was not plain error under the facts of this case. As <em>Williams </em>recognized, the \u201coverarching concern\u201d of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) is with predisposition evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 132, 919 A.2d 90. Unlike evidence of the commission of crimes similar to those with which defendant is charged, evidence of witness-tampering is unlikely to lead a jury to conclude that a defendant is predisposed to commit the type of crime with which he is accused. The jury was not likely to conclude that Burden was predisposed to commit home invasions because he tried to convince Clayton not to testify against him in this case. Moreover, the prosecutor did not suggest to the jury, in summation or otherwise, that they should use the evidence to draw such an improper conclusion. Finally, in the charge, the trial judge gave the jury a very strong general admonition against the misuse of other crimes evidence. All of this leads us to conclude that in this case, the absence of a more specific charge tailored to the witness-tampering evidence was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">In summary, we find no grounds upon which to reverse defendant\u2019s conviction. The ease against defendant was reasonably strong based on the testimony of Clayton and Jefferson, and the discovery by the police of the assault handgun in circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>supporting a strong inference that it was discarded by the men gathered in Clayton\u2019s yard. Defendant did not dispute that he and his co-defendants were present near Clayton\u2019s house. The principal issue in dispute was whether they were there to commit an armed home invasion or merely to relieve themselves in the yard. Defendant did incalculable damage to his own defense by attempting to bribe Clayton into silence and by offering trial testimony that was fraught with contradictions and which, even on a cold record, lacked the ring of truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">[After affirming defendant\u2019s conviction the court remanded for reconsideration of the extended term sentence pursuant to <em>State v.
