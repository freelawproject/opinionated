The answer requires an analysis of a defendant\u2019s right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment and whether the statement fits within one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule of preclusion, or is admissible by other law. Because, unlike <em>Fed.R.Evid. </em>804(b)(6), our Rules of Evidence do not contain a forfeiture-by-wrongdoing exception to the hearsay rule permitting admission of such a statement, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">These two appeals, calendared back-to-back,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> arise from an indictment returned by a Mercer County Grand Jury on March 22, 2002. Following a jury trial, both defendants were found guilty of aggravated manslaughter (lesser-included offense of first-degree murder) (Count One); first-degree armed robbery, <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>2C:15-1 and 2C:2-6 (Count Two), and felony murder, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3a(3) and 2C:2-6 (Count Three). Defendant Dean was also found guilty of second-degree possession of a weapon (handgun) for an unlawful purpose, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4a and 2C:2-6 (Count Four), and third-degree unlawful possession of a handgun without a permit, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5b and 2C:2-6 (Count Six). Byrd was also found guilty of second-degree possession of a weapon (shotgun) for an unlawful purpose, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4a and 2C:2-6 (Count Five) and third-degree unlawful possession of a loaded shotgun, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5c(2) and 2C:2-6 (Count Seven).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">On October 29, 2004, both defendants were sentenced. As to Byrd, Counts One and Two were merged with Count Three, and Count Seven was merged with Count Five. On Count Three, defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment with thirty years of parole ineligibility, and on Count Five, he was sentenced to a concurrent ten-year term with five years of parole ineligibility. As to Dean, Counts One and Two were merged with Count Three, and Count Six was merged with Count Four. Like Byrd, Dean was sentenced to life imprisonment on Count Three with thirty years of parole ineligibility and a concurrent ten-year term, with five years of parole ineligibility, on Count Four. All appropriate fees and penalties were also imposed. Defendants appeal, and the State cross-appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">On appeal, defendants present numerous arguments for our consideration. Among them, defendants argue that the trial judge erred in admitting the inculpatory statement of Kenneth Bush, a non-testifying State witness, depriving them of the right of confrontation and in violation of the Rules of Evidence. Because we agree that the judge erred in admitting the inculpatory statement, we reverse all convictions; remand for a new trial; and do not address the remaining issues raised by either defendants or the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">The facts pertaining to the admission of the hearsay statement are as follows. At approximately 9:20 p.m. on August 26, 2001, Clinton Fudge; his Mend Charlie Blackshear; his roommate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Charles \u201cMinnesota\u201d Simmons, a known drug dealer; and Simmons\u2019 girlfriend, Catherine Cruser, were in Simmons\u2019 and Fudge\u2019s apartment in Trenton. Simmons and Cruser were in the back of the apartment, while Fudge and Blackshear were in the front of the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">After hearing a knock at the door, Fudge glanced out the peephole and saw a man with his head down. He then heard a voice say, \u201cMini, Mini, Mini,\u201d and concluding that the visitor was there for Simmons, opened the door. Two men in their mid-twenties immediately pushed their way into the apartment. The taller of the two was armed with a gun, which Fudge believed was a shotgun, and ordered Fudge to get down on the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">As the shorter perpetrator began looking for other persons in the apartment, Simmons burst out from the rear of the apartment and backed the taller man into a corner. Fudge got up and assisted Simmons as he struggled with the armed intruder, causing the gun to go off three times without hitting anyone. The weapon discharged one final time and hit Simmons, who staggered down an interior hallway and fell face down.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Officer Joseph Mondello of the Trenton Police Department was the first to arrive at the scene. Fudge met him in the hallway and advised the officer that Simmons had been shot. Upon entering the apartment, Mondello observed that it was in total disarray, with blood on the walls. Simmons, who was dead, was lying face down on the floor in an internal hallway of the apartment. Mondello retrieved two nine-millimeter shell casings from the interior hallway and another two from an adjacent room.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">On August 27, 2001, Trenton Police Detectives Anthony Manzo and John Zappley proceeded to the Sleepy Hollow Motel and spoke to Stephen Robinson and Melissa Fink. These individuals suggested that the officers speak with Kenneth McNeil. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>McNeil was brought to police headquarters for questioning regarding some unrelated robberies, he was interviewed by Zappley.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">McNeil told Zappley that, a week prior to Simmons\u2019s death, he, along with defendant Dean and Kenneth Bush, had robbed Simmons. The three had driven to Simmons\u2019 apartment in McNeil\u2019s van where he and Bush got out, leaving Dean inside. McNeil lured Simmons out of his apartment and into the hallway. Bush then joined the pair and displayed a sawed-off shotgun he had received from Dean. McNeil told Simmons that he wanted money and crack cocaine. After Simmons gave them the items, McNeil and Bush left to smoke the crack with Dean.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">McNeil further related that he, Bush and Dean attempted to rob Simmons again a day or two later. The plan was for McNeil to get Simmons to open his door so that the other two could barge in and rob Simmons. Dean was again armed with the sawed-off shotgun. Simmons, however, failed to answer the door, and the three left.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">According to McNeil, on August 26, he and Bush were at the Sleepy Hollow Motel getting high with drugs he had received in exchange for loaning his van to a known drug dealer. The drug dealer returned to the motel at 8:00 p.m. with Dean. McNeil recalled that Dean was acting crazy and aggressive, shouting, \u201cI don\u2019t care who gets in my way,\u201d and \u201cif I have to, I\u2019ll take somebody down.\u201d The four then took the van to drop the drug dealer off and took Dean to pick up a handgun. After Dean returned to the van, he demanded that McNeil loan him the van. When McNeil declined, Dean showed him the butt of a handgun that was stuck in his pants and stated that if McNeil stood in his way, he would kill him. At this point, Bush intervened, and they dropped Dean off without incident. McNeil and Bush then returned to the Sleepy Hollow Motel.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">On August 29, 2001, an anonymous caller advised Manzo that \u201cHassan\u201d and \u201cAlim\u201d were possibly involved in Simmons\u2019 homicide. At 6:80 a.m. on September 4, 2001, Manzo arrested Kenneth Bush, a/k/a \u201cAlim Sprull,\u201d at his Trenton residence on unrelated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>charges. At the police station, Manzo advised Bush that they wanted to talk to him about Simmons\u2019 homicide and obtained his signature on a Miranda;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">In his transcribed, written statement, Bush related that he had spent most of August 26 smoking crack with McNeil at the Sleepy Hollow Hotel, while another drug dealer borrowed McNeil\u2019s van. At approximately 8:00 p.m., the drug dealer returned with his brother and Dean. Dean pulled up his shirt and showed Bush and McNeil that he had a nine-millimeter handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Bush and McNeil subsequently drove the drug dealer, the drug dealer\u2019s brother, and Dean back to their respective residences, after which they returned to the motel to smoke more crack. When the crack was gone, Bush borrowed McNeil\u2019s van to go to Trenton to buy some more. Once in Trenton, he ran into Hassan Wilson, who asked if he could use the van in return for some crack. Bush agreed and let Wilson drive the van while he moved to the back of the van to smoke the crack. Wilson picked up Byrd and Dean and drove to Church Street where the two defendants got out. After about five or ten minutes, Byrd and Dean came running back to the van. Byrd was in obvious pain and said, \u201c[t]he stupid motherfucker shot me.\u201d Bush glanced over at Dean and saw that he had the gun from the motel in his hand, with the slide open, \u201cas if he had shot all the bullets in it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Bush recalled that when Byrd again accused Dean of shooting him, Dean replied, \u201csomebody came out with a gun and they were shooting too.\u201d Dean also stated, \u201cman, I put it in him. I let off on him.\u201d Byrd replied, \u201cman, you were just busting off. You were shooting real crazy.\u201d When Byrd stated that he had not seen anyone else with a gun when wrestling with \u201cMinnesota,\u201d Dean insisted that \u201csomebody had a shotgun in there, you got hit with a pellet.\u201d Wilson drove to Dean\u2019s cousin\u2019s house on West State Street, where his cousin helped clean Byrd\u2019s leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>While Bush was standing in the kitchen watching the proceedings, he noticed a sawed-off shotgun sitting on the counter next to the refrigerator. Byrd kept insisting that Dean had shot him. Finally, Dean grabbed Byrd\u2019s shotgun to see if he had shot himself, but the gun was fully loaded. After Byrd\u2019s leg was bandaged, the four returned to the van and drove to Dean\u2019s house. Bush stated that Wilson asked Dean for his gun, but that Dean refused to give it to him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After giving his statement, Bush identified photographs of both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Defendants contend that the lower court committed reversible error in admitting Bush\u2019s out of court statement. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Early in the trial, the prosecutor advised the court that it did not appear that Bush was going to testify. The prosecutor explained that Bush had become unnerved after being transported to court the prior week in a van with Byrd. On July 7, 2004, the prosecutor related that Bush was in the courthouse but had again expressed his unwillingness to testify. The prosecutor proposed holding a hearing outside the presence of the jury on the matter, and the court agreed. Thereafter, Bush refused to take the stand, refused to be sworn, and stated that he was not going to testify without offering any reasons why.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Following a recess, the prosecutor advised the court that Bush still refused to testify and asked that he be held in contempt. At the ensuing contempt hearing, Bush explained his reasons for not testifying as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Well, there was some things that was made known to [Detective] LaBelle and [the prosecutor], 1 don\u2019t know if they made it known to you, situations that I have been put in and be continuing to be put in these situations would bring harm to myself and maybe my family as well. So, I mean, you know from day one, I was put in position where I was incarcerated with both these individuals. Then down the road I was placed again in another position with another one of these individuals. So, I mean, there is some other issues that go on. So, I mean, I can\u2019t keep putting myself in jeopardy as well as to, I mean, I understand things have to be taken care of, but, you know, I\u2019m still alive. I have to have worry about that, you know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">At sidebar, the judge observed that Bush\u2019s explanation for his conduct comported with the prosecutor\u2019s previous disclosures and reflected reasonable concerns. The judge stated that he did not know what else could be done to secure Bush\u2019s testimony, aside from providing him with protective treatment, because Bush\u2019s existing incarceration rendered the court\u2019s contempt powers meaningless. The prosecutor advised the court that he had offered to have Bush moved to a different jail, but Bush had declined. The judge instructed the prosecutor to attempt to speak with Bush once again.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">The next day, the judge confirmed that there would be \u201cno practical effect of legitimate purpose\u201d in holding Bush in contempt. The prosecutor, relying upon <em>N.J.R.E. </em>804(a), requested the court hold a hearing in order to determine the precise nature of the threats against Bush and to decide whether Bush was \u201cunavailable\u201d as a result of those threats. Although the judge refused, he expressed a willingness to reconsider if the prosecutor was able to support his request with legal authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">Several days later, the prosecutor informed the judge that Bush wanted to speak with him regarding the manner in which he had been threatened and his reasons for not testifying. The prosecutor stated that Bush wanted to discuss a threatening letter Dean had sent to him, the threats he had received from both Dean and Byrd when they were on the same tier at the workhouse, and the threats Byrd had made during the van trip from Southwoods prison. The prosecutor, relying upon <em>State v. Sheppard, </em>197 <em>N. J.Super. </em>411, 484 A.2d 1330 (Law Div.1984), asserted that, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>hearing Bush\u2019s testimony, if the judge determined that the threats were valid, the judge could admit Bush\u2019s statement without requiring him to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">In response, counsel for Byrd requested that he be given an opportunity to question Bush. The judge denied the request, proposing to pursue the matter himself, <em>in camera. </em>Both defense counsels objected to the judge interviewing Bush off the record and outside the presence of counsel. Because the judge believed he would obtain a more \u201clegitimate\u201d reaction from Bush if the interview were conducted privately, he decided to interview Bush ex parte <em>in camera </em>that afternoon with only his law clerk, three sheriffs officers, and the court reporter in attendance. A transcript was made available to counsel the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">During the <em>in camera </em>interview, Bush acknowledged that his original statement to police was truthful. He then described several encounters he had had with defendants since giving that statement. Specifically, Bush related that in late 2001, he was incarcerated in the county jail and was briefly housed on the same tier as Byrd. He had a \u201ctense\u201d encounter with Byrd, during which time Byrd suggested that Bush could get bailed out if he changed his testimony. Bush claimed that he was fearful as a result of this meeting. A few weeks later, Dean was also housed in the same tier as Bush. On one occasion, Dean indirectly suggested that if \u201csomeone\u201d were to testify against him, \u201csomething\u201d might happen. Bush claimed that he lived on the same tier with Dean for approximately one year, and that Dean pressured him on a daily basis. Dean made it clear that he was not happy with Bush\u2019s proposed testimony and that he would not take kindly to Bush testifying against him. Bush claimed that he ultimately prepared his first affidavit disclaiming his statement because he could not deal with having to live with Dean under those circumstances and he needed to protect himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">In December 2002, Byrd\u2019s brother, who was also incarcerated with Bush, showed Bush a letter from Byrd, wherein Byrd stated that Bush \u201ccould be got at.\u201d Bush understood this to mean that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>he was at risk of physical harm if he maintained his position against Byrd. Thereafter, in July 2003, Bush received a letter from Dean. According to Bush, this letter said that anyone who testified against Dean could \u201cbe dealt with.\u201d Bush subsequently encountered Byrd in a police van while being transported to court. Although the atmosphere in the van was tense, Byrd did not say anything to him. Bush also saw Dean shortly thereafter when he was placed in a cell opposite Bush\u2019s. Dean asked him what he was going to do about the case, but Bush did not reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Bush acknowledged that he had been angry with Manzo and Zappley for leaving him in close proximity to Dean and Byrd. He claimed that the two detectives had promised to transfer him to a safer location. Bush wondered whether these repeated encounters with defendants had been deliberately arranged. He maintained that he was unwilling to testify out of fear for his own safety and the safety of his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The day after the judge\u2019s <em>in camera </em>interview with Bush, the prosecutor produced the letter from Dean. The court and counsel then engaged in an extended argument regarding the propriety of the court\u2019s actions. The prosecutor argued that, by threatening Bush, defendants had waived their right to confront him. Counsel for Byrd argued that the <em>in camera </em>procedure violated his client\u2019s right of due process, noting that, not only had there been no cross-examination, but the court also had asked leading questions. Although the judge agreed that the procedure was novel, with little case law to provide support, he was of the opinion that \u201cno examination or cross-examination was possible given the attitude of the witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The judge stated that he was clearly convinced of the legitimacy of Bush\u2019s expressed concerns about testifying. He confirmed his ruling the next day and announced that he intended to admit Bush\u2019s statement following a reliability hearing. Thereafter, at the conclusion of the hearing, during which Manzo testified that Bush was not under the influence of either drugs or alcohol at the time he gave his statement, and that the statement was otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>freely given and signed, the judge permitted Detective Manzo to read Bush\u2019s statement to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Defendants argue that the trial judge erred in admitting the inculpatory statement of Bush who did not testify at trial. Defendants contend that they were deprived of their Sixth Amendment right to confront and cross-examine the accusing witness. <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>36, 53-54, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>1354, 1365-66, 158 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>177, 194 (2004); <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 <em>U.S. </em>284, 294-95, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>1038, 1046, 35 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>297, 308 (1973). In addition, defendants also assert that there is no exception to the hearsay rule, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>801 to 808, authorizing the admission of the statement. The State counters that the trial judge properly admitted Bush\u2019s statement to the police as substantive evidence, prohibiting defendants from profiting from their criminal behavior. The State contends that defendants had forfeited their Sixth Amendment right to confront Bush when they procured Bush\u2019s silence by threatening him with bodily harm. The State asserts that because defendants forfeited their right to confront Bush that, <em>a fortiori, </em>they also waived their hearsay objection to the introduction of the statement. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Generally, when the State moves to introduce an inculpatory, ouUof-court statement of a non-testifying witness, the court must be satisfied that the statement does not violate the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment, <em>Crawford, supra, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>at 53-54,124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1365-66,158 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 194, and that the statement fits within one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule of preclusion, or is admissible by other law. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>802.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">A defendant\u2019s right to confront witnesses against him or her is guaranteed by both the Federal and New Jersey Constitutions. <em>State v. Budis, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>519, 530, 593 A.2d 784 (1991) (citing <em>U.S. Const. </em>amend. VI; <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. 1, \u00b610). This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>right of confrontation affords a defendant the opportunity to question the State\u2019s witnesses, protects against improper restrictions on the questions asked during cross-examination, and affords the accused the right to elicit favorable testimony on cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 530-31, 593 A.2d 784. In furtherance of the right of confrontation, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Crawford, supra, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>at 53-54, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1365, 158 L.Ed.2d at 194, held that the Sixth Amendment proscribes \u201cadmission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d As to what falls within the category of testimonial evidence, the Supreme Court recently stated that such statements \u201care testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S.-,-, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>2266, 2273-74,165 L.Ed.2d 224, 237 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Here, Bush\u2019s statement provided to the police during an interrogation constitutes testimonial evidence. <em>Ibid. </em>In most instances, that would end the discussion with the court prohibiting the introduction of Bush\u2019s statement. However, a defendant may forfeit his or her right to confrontation by \u201cprocuring or coercing silence from witnesses and victims.\u201d <em>Davis, supra, </em>547 <em>U.S. </em>at -, 126 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2280,165 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 244:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">While defendants have no duty to assist the State in proving their guilt, they <em>do </em>have the duty to refrain from acting in ways that destroy the integrity of the criminal-trial system. We reiterate what we said in <em>Crawford,: </em>that \u201cthe rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing ... extinguishes confrontation claims on essentially equitable grounds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-9\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Crawford, supra, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>at 62, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1371, 158 L.Ed.2d at 199).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">\u201cThat is, the one who obtains the absence of a witness by wrongdoing forfeits the constitutional right to confrontation.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The exception is commonly referred to as the \u201cRule of Forfeiture by Wrongdoing.\u201d <em>Crawford, supra, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>at 62,124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1371,158 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>The State argues that the defendants forfeited their Sixth Amendment right of confrontation by threatening Bush with physical harm should he testify against them. Defendants challenge that proposition, contending the ex parte interview of Bush <em>in camera, </em>again deprived them of their Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. We agree. <em>State v. Budis, supra, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>at 530, 593 A.2d 784. The ex parte procedure employed here was at variance with the full evidentiary hearings conducted outside the presence of the jury in forfeiture-by-wrongdoing cases. <em>See United States v. Cherry, </em>217 F.3d 811, 815 (10th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. White, </em>116 F.3d 903, 911-14 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 <em>U.S. </em>960, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>390, 139 L.Ed.2d 305 (1997); <em>United States v. Batano, </em>618 <em>F.2d </em>624, 629 (10th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>840,101 <em>S.Ct. </em>118, 66 L.Ed.2d 47 (1980). However, we do not rest our decision in this matter on that determination alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">In addition to determining whether the introduction of an out-of-court testimonial statement by a non-testifying witness violates a defendant\u2019s right to confrontation, the court must also be satisfied that introduction of the statement is authorized pursuant to an exception to the hearsay rule or by other law. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>802. We conclude that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\"><em>N.J.R.E. </em>804 governs hearsay exceptions where the declarant is unavailable to testify. \u201cUnavailable\u201d is defined in the rule as: \u201cExcept when the declarant\u2019s unavailability has been procured or wrongfully <em>caused by the proponent of declarant\u2019s statement </em>for the purpose of preventing declarant from attending or testifying, a declarant is \u2018unavailable\u2019 as a witness if declarant: ...

Because the State, the proponent of Bush\u2019s out-of-court statement, was not the party who wrongfully caused Bush not to testify, Bush was \u201cunavailable\u201d to testify as contem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>plated by the rule. However, the rule, contrary to the Federal Rules of Evidence, does not contain an exception to the hearsay rule, permitting admission of the statement. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>804(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">In 1997, the Federal Rules of Evidence were amended to include <em>Fed.R.Evid. </em>804(b)(6), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">(b) Hearsay exceptions. The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness: ... (6) Forfeiture by wrongdoing. A statement offered against a party that has engaged or acquiesced in wrongdoing that was intended to, and did, procure the unavailability of the declarant as a witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">As explained in the Advisory Committee Notes to the 1997 amendments, this new hearsay exception was \u201cadded to provide that a party forfeits the right to object on hearsay grounds to the admission of a declarant\u2019s prior statement when the party\u2019s deliberate wrongdoing or acquiescence therein procures the unavailability of the declarant as a witness.\u201d <em>Fed.R.Evid. </em>804(b)(6) advisory committee\u2019s note (1997). The Advisory Committee observed that <em>Rule </em>804(b)(6) \u201crecognizes the need for a prophylactic rule to deal with abhorrent behavior which strikes at the heart of the system of justice itself.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Since the adoption of <em>Fed.R.Evid. </em>804(b)(6), the highest courts in a number of states, without a comparable codified hearsay exception, have adopted the forfeiture doctrine through judicial decision. <em>See, e.g., Devonshire v. United States, </em>691 A.2d 165, 168-69 (D.C.), <em>cert. denied, </em>520 <em>U.S. </em>1247, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>1859, 137 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1997); <em>State v. Hallum, </em>606 N.W.2d 351, 354-56 (Iowa 2000); <em>Commonwealth v. Edwards, </em>444 <em>Mass. </em>526, 830 N.E.2d 158, 165-68 (2005). Several state intermediate appellate courts have also adopted the doctrine. <em>See, e.g., People v. Moore, </em>117 P.3d 1, 5 (Colo.Ct.App.2004); <em>State v. Henry, </em>76 <em>Conn.App. 515, 820 </em>A.2d 1076, 1089-90, <em>appeal denied, </em>264 <em>Conn. </em>908, 826 A.2d 178 (Conn.2003); <em>People v. Melchor, </em>362 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>335, 299 <em>Ill.Dec. 8, </em>841 N.E.2d 420, 429 (2005), <em>appeal granted, </em>218 <em>Ill.2d </em>551, 303 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>6, 850 <em>N.E.2d </em>811 (2006). Notably, in <em>State v. Henry, supra, </em>820 A.2d at 1090, the court drew support for its action from a \u201csavings clause\u201d incorporated into the Connecticut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>evidence code that allowed for the recognition of other evidentiary rules consistent with the code provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Although <em>N.J.R.E. </em>102 provides that \u201c[t]he adoption of these rules shall not bar the growth and development of the law of evidence to the end that the truth may be ascertained and proceedings justly determined,\u201d we are satisfied that given the significant and far-reaching implications of this proposed hearsay exception, such a change in the Rules of Evidence should be accomplished by our Supreme Court in accordance with the procedure prescribed in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-38 and -39, rather than by judicial opinion. See <em>State v. Guenther, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>129, 160, 854 A.2d 308 (2004) (where significant changes to the Rules of Evidence are proposed, they should be adopted in accordance with the procedure proscribed by statute). <em>See also State v. D.R. </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>348, 375-76, 537 A.2d 667 (1988) (refusing to adopt by judicial decision a rule providing for the admissible out-of-court statements by juvenile victims of sexual abuse). Accordingly, because <em>N.J.R.E. </em>804(b) does not permit the State to introduce an inculpatory statement from a witness who refuses to testify because of threats to his or her safety made by the defendant, the trial court should not have permitted Detective Manzo to testify as to Bush\u2019s out-of-court statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The State argues that we should judicially adopt the hearsay exception codified in <em>Fed.R.Evid. </em>804(b)(6) because the introduction of Bush\u2019s statement \u201cabide[s] by the long-established common law rule that a defendant who procures a witness\u2019s silence through threats, intimidation or coercion forfeits the protections provided by the confrontation clause and the hearsay rule,\u201d citing <em>White, supra, </em>116 <em>F.M </em>at 912; <em>United States v. Houlihan, </em>92 <em>F.3d </em>1271, 1282 (1st Cir.1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 <em>US. </em>1118, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>963, 136 L.Ed.2d 849 (1997); <em>United States v. Aguiar, </em>975 <em>F.2d </em>45, 47 (2d Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Mastrangelo, </em>693 <em>F.2d </em>269, 272 (2d Cir.1982). Again, because of the far-reaching nature of the principle proposed, we reject the invitation in favor of the statutory mechanism for the adoption of additional rules of evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-33 to -39; <em>State v.
