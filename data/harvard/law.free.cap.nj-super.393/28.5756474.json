In response to his petition for a trial de novo, the Law Division again found him guilty of DWI, and imposed the minimum sentence applicable to first-time offenders.

Notwithstanding the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>36, 68-69, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>1354, 1374, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, 203 (2004), we hold that a breathalyzer machine certificate of operability offered by the State to meet its burden of proof under <em>State v. Garthe, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>1, 678 A.2d 153 (1996), remains admissible as a business record under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">We summarize the following facts from the evidence presented at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">At or near midnight on September 10, 2004, Corporal Edward M. Gorski of the Wildwood Crest Police Department observed two men on motorcycles stopped at an intersection. Defendant was one of those men. At one point, defendant spun the motorcycle\u2019s back wheels, \u201ccreat[ing] a white cloud of smoke.\u201d When the traffic light turned green, defendant and his fellow rider accelerated from the scene, passing the stationary Gorski \u201cat a high rate of speed,\u201d exceeding, in Gorski\u2019s judgment, the applicable twenty-five miles per hour limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Gorski activated the overhead lights and sirens on his marked police car, and headed toward defendant to \u201cinitiate a motor vehicle stop.\u201d Gorski eventually pulled into a driveway where he saw defendant again burning the back wheels of his motorcycle causing it to turn in a 360-degree motion. Gorski radioed for backup, walked to where defendant was now standing with his motorcycle, and requested that defendant produce his driving credentials.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">As he complied, defendant asked Gorski to show leniency, stating, \u201cI live right here, you can cut me a break.\u201d At this point, Gorski noted a strong odor of alcohol on defendant\u2019s breath, and his speech was slurred. Defendant was also unsteady on his feet, almost falling as he got off the motorcycle. Gorski then requested that he perform certain physical tests intended to assess his level of sobriety. Defendant was unable to complete the test that required him to stand with his feet close together, and put his head back with his eyes closed for approximately five to seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>seconds. Additionally, he was unable to walk heel to toe for seven steps. Finally, defendant admitted that he had consumed between four and six beers commencing around 9:00 p.m. He waited approximately fifteen minutes between each beer. Based on these observations, Gorski concluded that he had sufficient probable cause to arrest defendant for DWI.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Defendant was transported to the police station for the administration of a breathalyzer test. Gorski testified that he followed the established protocol for the proper operation of the machine. The two tests performed on defendant revealed a blood alcohol content (BAC) of .14.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Against these facts, we are satisfied that defendant\u2019s arguments in Points I and III, challenging the propriety of the initial motor vehicle stop, and questioning the court\u2019s finding on operation of the motorcycle, lack sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2). Defendant also challenges the admissibility of the breathalyzer test results based on Gorski\u2019s alleged failure to observe him for twenty minutes prior to the administration of the test. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">In <em>State v. Downie, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>450, 455-56, 569 A.2d 242 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 <em>U.S. </em>819, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>63, 112 <em>LEd.2d </em>38 (1990), the Supreme Court noted that \u201cfor the breathalyzer to give readings that can be used with confidence, the operator must be sure that at least twenty minutes have expired since the last ingestion of alcohol to avoid the presence of \u2018mouth\u2019 alcohol, which can give a falsely high reading.\u201d Here, Judge Alvarez emphasized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\"><em>[tjhis incident began when the officer made his initial observation at 11:54 [p.m.]. The breathalyzer tests were administered, at 12:59 [a.m.] and, 12:22 [a.m.] respectively, </em>at the police station minutes away from where the [motor vehicle] stop was made. I don\u2019t think the fact the police expert did not testify in any way impacts on my conclusion that the breathalyzer tests were properly administered by a qualified operator on a machine that was in proper working order and subject to period certifications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-9\">[ (Emphasis added.) ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">Thus, defendant was subject to direct police observation from 11:54 p.m. up to and including the time when the two breathalyzer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>tests were performed. This directly establishes that defendant did not have any opportunity to ingest alcohol for considerably more than twenty minutes prior to the administration of the tests. We find no legal basis to disturb these findings, and the legal conclusions flowing therefrom. <em>State v. Locurto, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>463, 471, 724 A.2d 234 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">We now turn to defendant\u2019s challenge of the State\u2019s use of certificates of operability to meet its burden of proof under <em>Garthe, supra, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>at 13-14, 678 A.2d 153. Under <em>Garthe, </em>the State must establish that the breathalyzer machine used to perform the two tests upon defendant was in proper working order at the time. <em>Ibid. </em>Here, the State offered into evidence two certificates of operability showing that the particular breathalyzer machine used had been tested by the State Police Breath Test Unit, and found to be in good working order, both prior and subsequent to defendant\u2019s arrest. Certificate number 127-04 was issued on August 11, 2004, one month prior to the date of defendant\u2019s arrest; certificate number 128-04 was issued on October 6,2004, less than a month after the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s reliance on these certificates violated his right of confrontation under <em>Crawford, supra, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>at 68-69, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1374, 158 L.Ed.2d at 203. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">In <em>Crawford, </em>the United States Supreme Court determined that when \u201ctestimonial evidence\u201d is at issue, dispensing with confrontation solely because testimony is deemed reliable is violative of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>State v. Renshaw, </em>390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>456, 462-63, 915 A.2d 1081 (App.Div. 2007) (citing <em>Crawford, supra, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>at 68-69,124 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1374, 158 L.Ed.2d at 203).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">Thus, in <em>Renshaw, </em>we held that a blood test certificate issued pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:62A-11 is \u201ctestimonial\u201d under <em>Crawford, </em>and therefore triggers a defendant\u2019s right to confrontation. <em>Id. </em>at 467, 915 A.2d 1081. Similarly, in <em>State v. Kent, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>352, 354-55, 918 A.2d 626 (App.Div.2007), we reaffirmed our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>holding in <em>State v. Berezansky, </em>386 <em>N.J.Super. </em>84, 94, 899 A.2d 306 (App.Div.2006), that a State Police chemist\u2019s laboratory report is \u201ctestimonial\u201d under <em>Crawford, </em>and thus cannot be used in lieu of presenting the testimony of the chemist who actually performed the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">These decisions have a common element triggering a defendant\u2019s right of confrontation: the State\u2019s use of a document created for the specific purpose of establishing an essential element of the offense. By contrast, the certificates of operability at issue here were not created with any specific case in mind. These operability certificates are intended to document the regular business function of maintaining a particular breathalyzer machine. As such, these documents are properly admissible as a business record under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Other jurisdictions that have considered this issue have come to a similar conclusion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Our appellate colleagues in New York succinctly expressed the underlying rationale supporting the application of the business record exemption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">The certificates were prepared in the course of the certifier\u2019s routine official duties and \u201csystematically\u201d produced \u201cin the conduct of ... business\u201d ... to fulfill an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>official mandate that the machines be maintained in working order. Although prepared, to an extent, in recognition of their necessity in the event of litigation and constituting a part of the foundational predicate for the admission of BAC test evidence, the certificates did not result from structured police questioning, they were not created at official request \u201cto gather incriminating evidence against a particular individual.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\"><em>[People v. Lebrecht, </em>13 Misc.3d 45, 823 N.Y.S.2d 824, 827-28 (App. Term 2006) (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Finally, we note that the Law Division reached a similar conclusion in <em>State v. Godshalk, </em>381 <em>N.J.Super. </em>326, 333, 885 A.2d 969 (Law Div.2005). We approve the holding in <em>Godshalk </em>to the extent that it is consistent with the conclusion we reach here.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b63-8\"> <em>See Neal v.
