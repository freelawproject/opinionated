The landlord claims that the court improperly (1) ordered her to comply with the commissioner\u2019s order, (2) concluded that the $900 paid to the rental agent was part of the tenant\u2019s security deposit and (3) relied on parol evidence to vary the lease terms. We conclude that, although the court was without authority to conduct a de novo hearing because the landlord did not appeal from the administrative order pursuant to the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), codified in chapter 54 of the General Statutes at \u00a7 4-166 et seq., it nevertheless properly ordered the enforcement of the commissioner\u2019s order and acted within its discretion in assessing an additional $900 penalty for the landlord\u2019s failure to comply with said order.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">The commissioner found the following facts. The tenant leased residential premises from the landlord for the period beginning April 17, 1998, through April 17, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>1999, and paid a security deposit in the amount of $1800. The tenant terminated his tenancy on April 17, 1999, and gave written notification of his forwarding address to the landlord by letter, dated May 26, 1999. The landlord failed to forward to the tenant, after deducting for any damages properly itemized, the balance of his security deposit plus accrued interest within the time frames designated by General Statutes \u00a7 47a-21 (d) (2) and (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">On October 22,1999, the commissioner issued, by registered mail, a \u201cNotice of Intent to Issue Order to Cease and Desist and Notice of Right to Hearing,\u201d that alleged that the landlord had violated \u00a7 47a-21 (d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (i).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The notice stated that the landlord had a right to a hearing, and, that if such a hearing were requested in writing, it would be held at 10 a.m. on December 16, 1999, at the department of banking, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54 of the General Statutes. The notice also directed the landlord that the legal authority and jurisdiction under which the hearing would occur could be found in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 47a-21 (j)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 36a-52 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The notice, however, was returned to the department of banking, on November 22,1999, marked \u201creturn to sender \u2014 unclaimed.\u201d The landlord did not request a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">After finding those facts, the commissioner made the following conclusions of law. The landlord met the defi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>nition of \u201clandlord\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 47a-21 (a) (6).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The tenant was a \u201ctenant\u201d as defined in \u00a7 47a-21 (a) (12).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A \u201csecurity deposit,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 47a-21 (a) (10), is \u201cany advance rental payment other than an advance payment for the first month\u2019s rent and a deposit for a key or any special equipment.\u201d The commissioner then concluded that the tenant had paid an $1800 security deposit to the landlord, which she failed to return, with interest, minus any properly itemized deductions, to the tenant in violation of \u00a7 47a-21 (d) and (i). The commissioner also concluded that the applicable rate of interest, pursuant to \u00a7 47a-21 (i) (2), was 2.6 percent through 1998 and 2.3 percent through 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">The commissioner ordered, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 47a-21 (j) (2) and 36a-52, that the landlord cease and desist from violating \u00a7 47a-21 (d) and (i), and comply with such provisions. Additionally, the commissioner ordered that the landlord pay to the tenant, within thirty days: (1) \u201cTwice the value of the security deposit received to wit Three Thousand Six Hundred Dollars ($3,600) [and (2)] Interest accrued on the security deposit from April 17, 1998 to November 24, 1999 in the amount of Seventy Dollars and Sixty-nine Cents ($70.69).\u201d The commissioner sent this order, certified mail, return receipt requested on November 30, 1999, and the landlord signed for it on December 23, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The landlord did not request a rehearing, move to open the decision, ask for reconsideration or file an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>appeal of the order in the Superior Court pursuant to the UAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">When the landlord did not make payment as ordered, the commissioner filed an action seeking to enforce the order pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 36a-50 (b) (1) and seeking the levy of an additional penalty, pursuant to \u00a7 36a-50 (b) (2), for the landlord\u2019s failure to adhere to the order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The landlord filed an answer denying several of the commissioner\u2019s findings and by way of special defense claimed that she had damages related to the tenancy at issue. Thereafter, the court, in essence, conducted a de novo trial, taking testimony and documentary evidence, before granting the commissioner\u2019s request to have the order enforced with the assessment of an additional penalty. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The landlord claims that the court acted improperly by ordering her to comply with the commissioner\u2019s order, by concluding that the $900 paid to the rental agent was part of the tenant\u2019s security deposit and by relying on parol evidence to vary the terms of the tenant\u2019s lease. Because the landlord failed to file a timely appeal from the commissioner\u2019s decision, the trial court did not have the authority to conduct a de novo trial or to review the findings and conclusions of the commissioner. See <em>Glastonbury Volunteer Ambulance Assn., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number><em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>227 Conn. 848, 851-52, 633 A.2d 305 (1993) (failure of party to file administrative appeal under UAPA within forty-five days required by General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (c) deprives trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over appeal). Further, because the landlord failed to file an appeal from the commissioner\u2019s order, her defenses at the trial on the commissioner\u2019s complaint seeking to enforce that order were circumscribed. The trial court had jurisdiction only to assess the merits of the commissioner\u2019s complaint requesting enforcement of his order and the levy of additional statutory penalties and did not have jurisdiction to consider the merits of the underlying order. Nevertheless, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s judgment enforcing the order of the commissioner, as well as its levy of an additional penalty, were well within the court\u2019s statutory authority and were legally and logically correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">On appeal, the landlord continues to attack the findings and conclusions of the commissioner despite her failure to appeal from his order. We decline to review the landlord\u2019s claims as far as they relate to those findings and conclusions. Upon the landlord\u2019s failure to file a timely appeal, the commissioner\u2019s findings and conclusions became final, binding and not subject to review. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-183.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">We address the landlord\u2019s claim that the court improperly rendered judgment ordering her to comply with the commissioner\u2019s order. In so doing, \u201c[w]e are guided in our analysis by the standard of appellate review that governs questions of law. We have long held that where the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Keeney </em>v. <em>Old Saybrook, </em>237 Conn. 135, 143, 676 A.2d 795 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>Our statutory scheme regarding the commissioner\u2019s authority to issue orders relating to residential security deposits can be briefly summarized as follows. General Statutes \u00a7 36a-52 (a) gives the commissioner the authority to hold a properly noticed hearing and to issue a cease and desist order against anyone violating a statute that falls within the commissioner\u2019s jurisdiction. General Statutes \u00a7 47a-21 (j) grants the commissioner, inter alia, the authority to receive and to investigate complaints regarding violations of \u00a7 47a-21 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Section 47a-21 (d) mandates that, unless the landlord properly documents and itemizes damages, the landlord return to the tenant the entire security deposit paid, plus interest, within thirty days of the termination of the tenancy and notification of the tenant\u2019s forwarding address. Section 47a-21 (d) also provides that any landlord found to be in violation of this subsection <em>shall </em>be liable for twice the amount of the security deposit paid by the tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">After issuing a properly noticed order to a landlord, if the commissioner becomes aware that a landlord has violated his order, the commissioner may commence an action to enforce compliance with such order. General Statutes \u00a7 36a-50 (b) (1). The statute additionally provides that the commissioner may seek an order of the court imposing a penalty of up to $7500 for each violation of his order. General Statutes \u00a7 36a-50 (b) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">In the present case, the tenant filed a complaint with the commissioner when the landlord failed to return his security deposit. The commissioner sent notice to the landlord, pursuant to \u00a7 36a-52 (a). Although the notice was returned to the commissioner, pursuant to \u00a7 36a-52 (a) it was deemed received by the landlord \u201con the earlier of the date of actual receipt, or seven days after mailing . . . .\u201d After issuing his findings of fact, conclusions of law and order, the commissioner, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>accordance with \u00a7 36a-52 (a), sent notice to the landlord by certified mail, for which she signed the return receipt. Section 36a-52 (a) clearly states that the commissioner\u2019s order must comply with chapter 54 of the General Statutes, the UAPA, and the parties do not argue otherwise, nor do they argue that the order was not in compliance with the UAPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The landlord does not challenge the procedures employed by the commissioner, nor does she challenge his authority to issue orders relating to residential security deposits. She did not appeal from the commissioner\u2019s order pursuant to the UAPA, nor did she move to open the decision or request a rehearing from the commissioner. Rather, she simply failed to comply with the commissioner\u2019s order, and, after the commissioner sought enforcement of that order, improperly sought to retry his factual findings and legal conclusions. Although the court improperly conducted what amounted to a de novo trial on the merits of the order, it properly rendered judgment, in accordance with \u00a7 36a-50 (b) (1), enforcing the commissioner\u2019s order. The court, additionally, in accordance with \u00a7 36a-50 (b) (2), properly assessed a $900 penalty against the landlord for failing to comply with the commissioner\u2019s order.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Reviewing the statutory scheme together with the procedures employed in this case, we conclude that the court properly rendered judgment enforcing the commissioner\u2019s order and assessing an additional penalty against the landlord for failing to comply therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 47a-21 (d) provides in relevant part: \u201c(2) Upon termination of a tenancy, any tenant may notify Ms landlord in writing of such tenant\u2019s forwarding address. Within thirty days after termination of a tenancy, each landlord . . . shall deliver to the tenant or former tenant at such forwarding address either (A) the full amount of the security deposit paid by such tenant plus accrued interest as provided in subsection (i) of tMs section, or (B) the balance of the security deposit paid by such tenant plus accrued interest as provided in subsection (i) of tMs section after deduction for any damages suffered by such landlord by reason of such tenant\u2019s failure to comply with such tenant\u2019s obligations, together with a written statement itemizing the nature and amount of such damages.

For purposes of this section a good faith claim is deemed to be a claim for actual damages suffered by the landlord for which written notification of such damages has been given to the tenant in accordance with the provisions of subdivisions (1), (2) and (4) of subsection (d) of this section. For the purposes of such investigation, any person who is or was a landlord shall be subject to the provisions of section 36a-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">\u201c(2) If the commissioner determines that any landlord has violated any provision of this section over which the commissioner has jurisdiction, the commissioner may, in accordance with section 36a-52, order such person to cease and desist from such practices and to comply with the provisions of this section. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b849-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 36a-52 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cWhenever it appears to the commissioner that any person has violated, is violating or is about to violate any provision of the general statutes within the jurisdiction of the commissioner, or any regulation, rule, or order adopted or issued thereunder, the commissioner may send a notice to such person by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested ....

If a hearing is requested within the time specified in the notice, the commissioner shall hold a hearing upon the matters asserted in the notice, unless the person fails to appear at the hearing. After the hearing, the commissioner shall determine whether an order to cease and desist should be issued against the person named in the notice. If the person does not request a hearing within the time specified in the notice or fails to appear at the hearing, the commissioner shall issue an order to cease and desist against the person.
