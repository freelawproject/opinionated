On appeal, the commission claims that the court improperly (1) denied its motions to dismiss because the appeal was moot and because the plaintiff failed to exhaust its administrative remedies, (2) permitted the plaintiff to amend its complaint and (3) concluded that it lacked a legal basis on which to deny the plaintiffs site plan application. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the issues raised in the commission\u2019s appeal. On June 12, 1996, the plaintiff corporation, which owns real property in Berlin, filed with the commission an application seeking site plan approval to construct a go-cart track on the rear portion of its property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff\u2019s original application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>sought approval to construct a track for use by gasoline powered go-carts. On July 14, 1996, the commission, reasoning that the application did not conform to certain zoning regulations, denied the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">On July 29,1996, the plaintiff appealed from the commission\u2019s denial to the Superior Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court later granted the plaintiffs request to amend its appeal, thereby permitting the plaintiff to challenge the validity of the regulations on which the commission relied in denying the application. The court conducted a hearing and, on May 14,1999, issued a memorandum of decision in which it reversed the commission\u2019s decision. The court concluded that the commission had relied on regulations that were not valid. Accordingly, the court remanded the matter to the commission with direction to consider the application in light of only the regulations that were valid and in effect at the time of the filing of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Both parties petitioned this court for certification to appeal from the trial court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On June 23,1999, this court granted both of the petitions. On July 8,1999, the plaintiff filed its appeal and, on July 9, 1999, the commission filed its appeal. On October 20, 1999, this court, sua sponte, ordered that the appeals be dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>because they did not challenge an appealable final judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">On July 19, 1999, after the parties had filed their appeals to this court, the plaintiff filed another site plan application with the commission. In that application, the plaintiff sought approval of a site plan to construct a track on which to operate electric powered, as opposed to gasoline powered, go-carts. On October 14, 1999, the commission approved the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">On July 6, 2000, after having reconsidered the original application in accordance with the trial court\u2019s remand order, the commission again denied the application for approval to construct and to operate a track for the use of gasoline powered go-carts. On July 14, 2000, the plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court from the commission\u2019s denial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>On February 27, 2001, the commission filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal because the controversy between the parties was moot. The court denied the motion and denied the commission\u2019s subsequent motion to reconsider its denial. On May 8, 2001, the commission filed another motion to dismiss on the ground that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiff had failed to exhaust available administrative remedies. The court also denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">After conducting a hearing, the court filed a memorandum of decision on June 6,2001. The court sustained the plaintiffs appeal and directed the commission to issue the requested permit. The commission thereafter petitioned this court for certification to appeal. This court granted the petition and, on August 31, 2001, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>commission filed the present appeal. Additional facts will be set forth as they become necessary in the context of the claims raised in the commission\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The commission first claims that the court improperly denied its motions to dismiss the appeal on the grounds (1) that the issues raised therein were moot and (2) that the plaintiff had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">A claim that an appellant in an administrative appeal seeks review of issues that are moot or that such appellant has failed to exhaust its administrative remedies implicates the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction and may be raised at any stage of the proceedings. See, e.g., <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Health, </em>48 Conn. App. 102, 108, 710 A.2d 176 (1998); <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>40 Conn. App. 501, 505-506, 671 A.2d 844 (1996). Such a claim is a proper subject of a motion to dismiss. Practice Book \u00a7 10-30 et seq. A party may challenge a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction at any time, and \u201cwhenever a court discovers that it has no jurisdiction, it is bound to dismiss the case, without regard to [its] previous rulings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Concerned Citizens of Sterling </em>v. <em>Sterling, </em>204 Conn. 551, 557, 529 A.2d 666 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">\u201cThe standard of review of a motion to dismiss is . . . well established. In ruling upon whether a complaint survives a motion to dismiss, a court must take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint, including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, construing them in a manner most favorable to the pleader. ... A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Brookridge District Assn. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>259 Conn. 607, 610-11, 793 A.2d 215 (2002). Furthermore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>whether subject matter jurisdiction exists is a question of law, and our review of the court\u2019s resolution of that question is plenary. Id., 611. We will address separately each of the commission\u2019s motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Mootness</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The commission, in its February 27, 2001 motion to dismiss, claimed that because it approved the plaintiffs application to construct and to operate an electric powered go-cart track, the controversy between the parties no longer existed, rendering the appeal moot. The commission posited that the plaintiff, having obtained approval of the subsequent application, had \u201cwaived whatever benefit it may have derived from the earlier application [and that] its development rights are controlled by the subsequent approval . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">\u201cMootness presents a circumstance wherein the issue before the court has been resolved or had lost its significance because of a change in the condition of affairs between the parties. ... A case becomes moot when due to intervening circumstances a controversy between the parties no longer exists. . . . An issue is moot when the court can no longer grant any practical relief.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>71 Conn. App. 43, 46, 800 A.2d 641 (2002). \u201c[I]t is not the province of appellate courts to decide moot questions, disconnected from the granting of actual relief or from the determination of which no practical relief can follow. ... If no practical relief can be afforded to the parties, the appeal must be dismissed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">We agree with the court that the appeal before it was not moot. The fact that the defendant granted the plaintiffs site plan application for a track for electric powered go-carts did not deprive the court of the ability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>to fashion for the plaintiff practical relief in its appeal from the denial of its site plan application for a track for gasoline powered go-carts. Simply stated, we are persuaded by the fact that those proposed uses are not mutually exclusive. In opposing the motion to dismiss, the plaintiff submitted the affidavit of Michael Nelson, the plaintiffs president. Nelson averred that after receiving approval of the application to construct a track for electric powered go-carts, he began construction of the track. He further averred that after significant inquiry of suppliers, he believed that electric powered go-carts were neither technologically nor commercially feasible. Essentially, he represented that, having obtained permission to construct a track for electric powered go-carts, he still wanted to use the track for gasoline powered go-carts, which he described as readily available, safe, manufactured by reliable suppliers and relatively inexpensive. In short, he described the defendant\u2019s approval of the plaintiffs plan to operate electric powered go-carts as \u201can approval that we can\u2019t use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">In light of those averments and, on the basis of the nature of the controversy itself, we are unable to conclude that the commission\u2019s approval of the plaintiffs applications precluded the court from affording the plaintiff practical relief. Such relief, in the form of approval of the applications to construct a track for gasoline powered go-carts, would permit the plaintiff to use the track for the purpose for which it sought such approval in the first instance. Nothing about the commission\u2019s approval of the electric powered go-cart application rendered the relief sought in the administrative appeal either impractical or inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The commission relies primarily on <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>222 Conn. 294, 608 A.2d 1181 (1992), in support of its claim that the appeal was moot. <em>Gagnon </em>is factually distinguishable. The appellant in <em>Gagnon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>appealed to the Superior Court from a planning commission\u2019s approval of an application to subdivide certain real property that abutted property owned by her. Id., 295-96. During the pendency of the administrative appeal, the planning commission granted a separate request filed by the original applicants to resubdivide the same real property. Id., 295. That second approval went unchallenged. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Thereafter, the applicants in <em>Gagnon </em>sought to dismiss the pending appeal from the approval of the original subdivision application. Id., 296. They argued that the planning commission\u2019s approval of the resubdivision application had rendered the pending appeal moot. Id. The trial court agreed and, on further appeal, this court affirmed that decision. In affirming this court\u2019s decision in <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Planning </em>Commission, 24 Conn. App. 413, 588 A.2d 1385 (1991), our Supreme Court agreed with our conclusion that the \u201capproval of the resubdivision application controls the applicants\u2019 rights to develop the parcel.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 298. Our Supreme Court further noted that the applicants, by obtaining approval for the resubdivision and having recorded the resubdivision map in the land records, had \u201cwaived irrevocably whatever benefit they may have derived from the planning commission\u2019s earlier approval of the first subdivision. The defendants having withdrawn their claim to its benefits and having effectively extinguished the original subdivision plan through recording of the resubdivided version, the subdivision\u2019s potential burdens to the plaintiff no longer presented a justiciable issue.\u201d Id., 298-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">In the present case, the fact that the plaintiff obtained approval to construct a track on which to operate electric powered go-carts did not in any way extinguish its opportunity to operate gasoline powered go-carts on that track. The plaintiff did not withdraw its original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>application and did not file its subsequent application in lieu of its original application. Nothing about the fact that the commission approved the subsequent application irrevocably changed the plaintiffs ability to use the subject property to operate a track for gasoline powered go-carts. The subsequent granting of the application concerning electric powered carts did not control the applicant\u2019s rights so as to preclude it from using the track on the subject property to operate gasoline powered go-carts. The appellant in <em>Gagnon, </em>having failed to appeal from the granting of the resubdivision application, could derive no relief from the pending administrative appeal from the granting of the original subdivision application. The appellant in this case, however, stands on different footing. Should the commission grant the plaintiffs original application, the plaintiff will gain the opportunity to pursue its plan of operating a gasoline operated go-cart track. For those reasons, the plaintiffs appeal presented a justiciable issue to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The commission, in its May 8, 2001 motion to dismiss, claimed that the plaintiff had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies, thereby depriving the court of subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal. The commission pointed out to the trial court, as it does to this court, that the plaintiff failed to appeal to the zoning board of appeals from the commission\u2019s July 6, 2000 denial of its application, which came before the commission on remand from the Superior Court. The commission posits that the plaintiff thereby failed to exhaust the administrative remedies available to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">\u201cThe doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is well established in the jurisprudence of administrative law. . . . The doctrine provides that no one is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>entitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the prescribed administrative remedy has been exhausted. . . . Where a statutory requirement of exhaustion is not explicit, courts are guided by [legislative] intent in determining whether application of the doctrine would be consistent with the statutory scheme. . . . Consequently, [t]he requirement of exhaustion may arise from explicit statutory language or from an administrative scheme providing for agency relief.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>River Bend Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Water Pollution Control Authority, </em>262 Conn. 84, 100, 809 A.2d 492 (2002). The requirement that an appellant first exhaust its administrative remedies \u201creflects the legislative intent that such issues be handled in the first instance by local administrative officials in order to provide aggrieved persons with full and adequate administrative relief, and to give the reviewing court the benefit of the local board\u2019s judgment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>O &amp; G Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>232 Conn. 419, 425, 655 A.2d 1121 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Our inquiry in the present case focuses on whether an administrative remedy was available to the plaintiff after the commission, on July 6, 2000, denied the application that was before it on remand from the court. We begin our analysis mindful that the particular regulations at issue dictate whether a further administrative remedy existed. <em>Castellon </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>221 Conn. 374, 383, 603 A.2d 1168 (1992); <em>Borden </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>58 Conn. App. 399, 406-407, 755 A.2d 224, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 921, 759 A.2d 1023 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Section XV of the Berlin zoning regulations, entitled \u201cZoning Board of Appeals,\u201d provides in relevant part: \u201cA. Powers and Duties. The Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) shall have all the powers and duties prescribed by Chapter 124, Section 8 and by Chapter 250, Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>14 of the General Statutes, and by these Regulations, which powers and duties are summarized and more particularly specified below. None of the following provisions shall be deemed to limit any of the authority of the ZBA that is conferred by general law.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\u201c1. Appeals. The ZBA shall have the authority to hear and decide upon any appeal where it is alleged that there is an error in the order, requirements, decision or determination of the ZEO.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> No question of hardship shall be involved in such appeal, and the action of the ZBA thereon shall be limited to the question of whether or not, and to what extent such order, requirement, decision, or determination was a correct interpretation of the subject provision of these Regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Subsection B of \u00a7 XV of the regulations, entitled \u201cGeneral Rules,\u201d further provides in relevant part: \u201c1. Appeals. All appeals to the ZBA from an order, requirement, decision or determination of the ZEO shall be taken within 90 days of such action by the ZEO. Such appeals shall be made in writing on a form prescribed by the ZBA and shall be accompanied by a filing fee to cover the cost of processing the appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The commission argues, essentially, that the regulations provided a further administrative remedy from its denial in that the plaintiff had the opportunity to appeal from the decision to the zoning board of appeals. The commission posits that the regulations afforded such remedy because they refer to the powers conferred on the zoning board of appeals by General Statutes \u00a7 8-6.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>As the commission correctly points out, our courts have held that pursuant to powers conferred by our statutes, a zoning board of appeals <em>may </em>hear an appeal from a planning and zoning commission. <em>Conto </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>186 Conn. 106, 114, 439 A.2d 441 (1982); <em>Borden </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 58 Conn. App. 409; <em>Leo Fedus &amp; Sons Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>27 Conn. App. 412, 415-16, 606 A.2d 725 (1992), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 225 Conn. 432, 623 A.2d 1007 (1993). In each of those cases, however, the regulations at issue provided for appellate review of the commission\u2019s action by the zoning board of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The present case is distinguishable from those cases because here, the zoning regulations do not provide for review of the commission\u2019s decisions by the zoning board of appeals. Although the regulations refer to the powers and duties conferred on the board by, inter alia, \u00a7 8 of our General Statutes, other provisions in the regulations more particularly specify the scope of the board\u2019s authority. On the basis of the excerpts of the regulations previously set forth, we conclude that the regulations unambiguously circumscribe the board\u2019s appellate authority to hearing and to deciding appeals from any \u201cerror in the order, requirements, decision or determination\u2019\u2019; Berlin Zoning Regs., \u00a7 XV (A); of Berlin\u2019s zoning enforcement officer. Having reviewed the regulations in toto, we do not find any provision that confers on the board the authority to review the commission\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">For those reasons, we conclude that no further administrative remedy existed for the plaintiff to exhaust before pursuing its appeal before the trial court. See <em>Castellon </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 382 (in absence of provision in regulations authorizing board to review commission\u2019s decision, no further remedy administrative remedy existed for plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>tiffs to exhaust before resorting to an appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-9). The court properly concluded that it possessed subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal and, accordingly, properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The commission next claims that the court improperly permitted the plaintiff to amend its complaint. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The following additional procedural history underlies the commission\u2019s claim. On November 16, 1999, the plaintiff filed a motion to amend its complaint. The plaintiff thereby sought to add grounds to its appeal that, it alleged, it had discovered only after the commencement of the appeal. Essentially, the plaintiff wanted to add to its appeal its claims that the commission improperly had denied its applications on the basis of regulations that either were not effective or had not been adopted validly in the first place. The commission timely objected to the request to amend. The court thereafter issued a memorandum of decision in which it granted the plaintiffs motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">We first set forth our standard of review. \u201cA trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion of a party to amend its complaint will be disturbed only on the showing of a clear abuse of discretion. . . . Whether to allow an amendment is a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial court. [An appellate] court will not disturb a trial court\u2019s ruling on a proposed amendment unless there has been a clear abuse of that discretion. ... It is the [burden of the party challenging the court\u2019s ruling] to demonstrate that the trial court clearly abused its discretion.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mastrolillo </em>v. <em>Danbury, </em>61 Conn. App. 693, 696, 767 A.2d 1232 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>On appeal, the commission argues, as it did before the trial court, that the court could not exercise jurisdiction to consider the plaintiffs challenge to the regulations that the commission relied on in denying the applications. The commission claims that the plaintiff could not challenge the validity of the regulations because it failed to comply with the notice requirement codified in Practice Book (1998) \u00a7 17-55 (4).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">As a preliminary matter, we note that the plaintiff in the present case did not bring a declaratory judgment action to challenge the regulations at issue in this appeal. Instead, it brought a nondeclaratory administrative appeal to adjudicate a specific claim of error concerning the commission\u2019s denial of its application. When it sought leave to amend its complaint, the plaintiff essentially sought for the court to consider a challenge to the regulations relied on by the commission as an avenue to obtain relief in its nondeclaratory administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In <em>Stafford Higgins Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>245 Conn. 551, 715 A.2d 46 (1998), our Supreme Court addressed a similar issue. The trial court in that case had declined to consider a plaintiffs challenges to certain municipal grand lists, as well as to certain public acts, because the plaintiff had failed to afford notice of those challenges to interested parties in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 390 (d), subsequently \u00a7 17-55 (4) (notice requirements of subdivision (4) were repealed January 1, 2000). Our Supreme Court held that because the plaintiff had raised those declaratory claims in the context of its administrative, or nondeclaratory, claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>for relief, it was improper for the trial court to decline to consider them. <em>Stafford Higgins Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>supra, 576-79. The court observed that the plaintiffs challenges to the grand lists and the public acts were raised properly in the context of its nondeclaratory action. Id., 577-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Our Supreme Court expressly rejected the trial court\u2019s rationale in denying the motion, i.e., that \u201cit lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the plaintiffs request for a declaratory judgment\u201d; id., 576; because the plaintiff had failed to provide notice to interested parties of certain of its declaratory claims in accordance with Practice Book (1998) \u00a7 17-55 (4).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court held that a party, without bringing a declaratory judgment action, could pursue a substantive administrative appeal in which it could challenge the validity of legislation in which many persons may have an interest. In so holding, the court, for several reasons, abandoned the rule it had set forth in <em>Cioffoletti </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>209 Conn. 544, 563, 552 A.2d 796 (1989), which required that \u201ccertain general challenges to the legality of legislation in which many persons may have an interest may be brought only through a declaratory judgment action, in order to ensure that notice be provided to all interested parties.\u201d <em>Stafford Higgins Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">In following <em>Stafford Higgins Industries, Inc., </em>we conclude that the commission\u2019s claim, i.e., that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>lacked jurisdiction to consider the plaintiffs challenge to certain municipal regulations, is without merit.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The plaintiff properly pursued its challenges to the regulations in its substantive appeal instead of in a separate declaratory action. For that reason, the court properly considered the plaintiffs claims in that regard, despite the fact that the plaintiff did not provide notice in accordance with Practice Book (1998) \u00a7 17-55 (4). Accordingly, the court\u2019s decision to grant the plaintiffs motion to amend was not improper and, on the basis of our review of the record, reflected an appropriate exercise of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Finally, the commission claims that the court improperly concluded that the commission lacked a legal basis on which to deny the plaintiffs site plan application. Specifically, the commission challenges the court\u2019s legal conclusions that (1) it improperly relied on \u00a7 X (D) (3) of the regulations because such regulation was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>ineffective and (2) it improperly applied \u00a7 XIII (9) (b) and (k) of the regulations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Before addressing each issue in turn, we note that the commission\u2019s claims challenge the court\u2019s underlying legal conclusion that, as a matter of law, it could not rely on those challenged regulations as a basis to deny the plaintiffs site plan application. We afford plenary review to such questions of law. See <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>258 Conn. 691, 699, 784 A.2d 354 (2001); <em>Quarry Knoll II Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>256 Conn. 674, 720-21, 780 A.2d 1 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Validity of \u00a7 X (D) (3) of the Regulations</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">The commission relied in part on \u00a7 X (D) (3) of the regulations as a basis for denying the site plan applications. That regulation, listed under \u00a7 X, entitled \u201cEnvironmental and Related Regulations,\u201d provides: \u201cNoise \u2014 Any noise emitted outside the property from which it originates shall comply with the provisions of Sections 22a-69-l to 22a-69-7.4 of the Regulations of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (\u2018Control of Noise\u2019).\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court concluded that this regulation was ineffective because it conflicted with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>state statutes governing noise pollution control. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Our legislature codified statutes governing noise pollution control in General Statutes \u00a7 22a-67 et seq. Section 22a-67 (a) provides in relevant part that \u201c(1) [e]xcessive noise is a serious hazard to the health, welfare and quality of life of the citizens of the state of Connecticut\u201d and that \u201c(4) the primary responsibility for control of noise rests with the state and the political subdivisions thereof . . . .\u201d The statutory scheme\u2019s expressed purpose is \u201cto establish a means for effective coordination of research and activities in noise control . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-67 (b). The scheme empowers the commissioner of environmental protection to \u201cdevelop, adopt, maintain and enforce a comprehensive state-wide program of noise regulation\u201d as well as to work with local governments in their efforts to abate noise pollution. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-69 (a), 22a-70 (a) and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">To that end, the legislature expressly encouraged municipalities to \u201cdevelop and establish a comprehensive program of noise regulation. Such program may include a study of the noise problems resulting from uses and activities within [their] jurisdiction and [their] development and adoption of a noise control ordinance.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-73 (a). The legislature further provided, in regard to municipal noise ordinances, that \u201c[n]o ordinance shall be effective until such ordinance has been approved by the commissioner. No ordinance shall be approved unless it is in conformity with any state noise control plan ... or any standards or regulations adopted by the adininistrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency .... Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, any municipality may adopt more stringent noise standards than those adopted by the commissioner, provided such standards are approved by the commissioner.\u201d General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 22a-73 (c). General Statutes \u00a7 22a-68 defines \u201ccommissioner\u201d as \u201cthe Commissioner of Environmental Protection or his designated agent as defined in subsection (b) of section 22a-2.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Section X (D) (3) of the regulations, by its terms, purported to adopt the noise control regulations promulgated by the commissioner. As the defendant concedes, only the commission approved that regulation. The commission does not suggest that the commissioner approved the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Having reviewed the statutory scheme, we conclude that the legislature intended it to be a comprehensive plan for state and local efforts to abate noise pollution. The legislature clearly envisioned that municipalities could adopt regulations promulgated by the commissioner or that they could adopt regulations of their own. The legislature, however, required that local efforts comply with \u00a7 22a-73: Local efforts must be validly adopted and gain approval by the commissioner. On the basis of the statutes, the fact that the legislature addressed the means by which a municipality could adopt noise pollution control enactments and those statutory provisions regarding such local enactments in particular, we are left to conclude that the legislature has undertaken to preempt that field of legislation and to require that local efforts aimed at noise pollution control comply with the requirements it has enumerated by statute. See <em>Bencivenga </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>183 Conn. 168, 176, 438 A.2d 1174 (1981) (whether legislature undertakes to occupy exclusively given field of legislation to be determined on analysis of statute and circumstances on which it intended to operate).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The legislature has provided, in unambiguous language, that \u201c[n]o ordinance shall be effective until such ordinance has been approved by the commissioner. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-73 (c). The commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>concedes that it did not obtain such approval. It acknowledges \u00a7 22a-67 et seq., but posits that General Statutes \u00a7 8-2 empowered the commission to adopt \u00a7 X (D) (3) of the regulations. Specifically, the commission argues that \u201c[t]he type of regulation provided for in chapter 442 of the General Statutes [titled \u2018Noise Pollution Control\u2019], by ordinance, is entirely different from the land use regulation adopted by the Berlin planning and zoning commission. Indeed, \u00a7 X (D) (3) of the zoning regulations applies only to site plan review while an ordinance adopted pursuant to chapter 442 would regulate noise emissions in all situations and not merely when a site plan is under review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">We reject the commission\u2019s argument for several reasons. Most importantly, we read chapter 442, \u00a7 22a-67 et seq., as a comprehensive scheme for state and local efforts aimed at controlling noise pollution. Second, \u00a7 8-2, which grants local zoning commissions the authority to promulgate regulations, does not govern noise pollution laws. In fact, \u00a7 8-2, which sets forth in nearly exhaustive detail the types of regulations that local zoning commissions may promulgate, does not even mention noise or noise pollution. Although \u00a7 8-2 (a) does provide that regulations \u201cshall be designed ... to promote health and the general welfare,\u201d we do not read that language in the enabling statute to necessarily confer authority in the zoning commission to promulgate regulations concerning noise pollution and, moreover, we certainly do not read that language to contradict the legislature\u2019s specific enactment in \u00a7 22a-67 et seq. In construing statutes, we are mindful that \u201cspecific terms covering the given subject matter will prevail over other general language of the same or another statute which might otherwise prove controlling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>261 Conn. 1, 23, 803 A.2d 879 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Finally, the fact that \u00a7 22a-73 refers to local <em>ordi</em>nances, while the commission has labeled the enactment at issue in this case a zoning regulation, is of no consequence. On the basis of our review of \u00a7 22a-67 et seq., we conclude that it reflects the legislature\u2019s intent to preempt the field of noise pollution control. It is clear that the regulation at issue here imposes a type of noise pollution control that the statutory scheme was enacted to effectuate; the regulation specifically refers to the commissioner\u2019s regulations, promulgated under the authority conferred by the statutes. It would yield a strange result were we to hold that the commission could do that which the legislative body of the municipality could not do, that is, circumvent the provisions of \u00a7 22a-67 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">For those reasons, we conclude that the court properly deemed \u00a7 X (D) (3) of the regulations to be ineffective and properly concluded that the commission could not rely on the regulation in denying the site plan application.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Application of \u00a7 XIII (9) (b) and (k) of the Regulations</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The commission also relied, in part, on \u00a7 XIII (9) (b) and (k) of the regulations in denying the site plan application. Those regulations are listed under \u00a7 XIII, entitled \u201cSite Plans.\u201d Subsection nine, entitled \u201cStandards for Approval,\u201d provides in relevant part: \u201cIn reviewing and acting upon an application for Site Plan approval, the Commission shall take into consideration the health, safety and welfare of the public in general and the immediate neighborhood in particular, as well as the following factors . . . .\u201d Factor (b) provides: \u201cThe arrangement of buildings, structures and uses on the site . . . .\u201d Factor (k) provides: \u201cThe adequacy of the landscaping treatment, including any buffers and other screening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>The court, in its May 14, 1999 memorandum of decision, later modified by its July 7,1999 articulation, ruled that, on remand, the commission could apply those regulations to the application \u201conly insofar as the commission has other regulations dealing with the arrangement of buildings or the adequacy of landscaping and buffers,\u201d and not in regard to the other regulations that the court ruled could not be applied to the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">After reconsidering the application on remand, the commission again denied it. The commission represents that it based its denial on \u00a7 XIII (9) (b) and (k) of the regulations and concluded that the applications did not satisfy the zoning requirements \u201cbecause of the health, safety and welfare concerns for the immediate neighborhood.\u201d Specifically, the commission represented to the court that \u201cthere was considerable concern by [it] that the noise generated by the gas go-karts would have a significant negative impact on the abutting residential property . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The court ruled that the commission\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 XIII (9) (b) and (k) of the regulations was flawed. It noted that it had ordered the defendant to consider those regulations \u201conly insofar as [it] has other regulations dealing with the arrangement of buildings or the adequacy of landscaping and buffers.\u201d As the court observed, the commission failed to do so. Instead, it grounded its decision on those regulations and its concerns about potential noise pollution that the property would generate.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">A zoning commission\u2019s authority in ruling on a site plan is limited. A site plan is \u201cfiled with a zoning commission or other municipal agency or official to determine the conformity of a proposed building, use or structure with specific provisions of the zoning regulations.\u201d R. Fuller, 9 Connecticut Practice Series: Land Use Law and Practice (2d Ed. 1999) \u00a7 2.2, p. 18. General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 8-3 (g) limits a zoning commission\u2019s authority to act on a site plan application: \u201cA site plan may be modified or denied only if it fails to comply with requirements already set forth in the zoning or inland wetlands regulations.\u201d As this court has stated: \u201cIn ruling upon a site plan application, the planning commission acts in its ministerial capacity, rather than its quasi-judicial or legislative capacity. It is given no independent discretion beyond determining whether the plan complies with the applicable regulations.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Roraback </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>32 Conn. App. 409, 412, 628 A.2d 1350, cert. denied, 227 Conn. 927, 632 A.2d 704 (1993); see also <em>R &amp; R Pool &amp; Patio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>257 Conn. 456, 468-69, 778 A.2d 61 (2001) (denial of site plan application cannot be based on subjective reasons bearing no relationship to zoning regulations).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">In the present case, the commission, after considering the applications on remand, did not evaluate the applications in light of clearly defined standards set forth in the regulations. We agree with the court that \u00a7 XIII (9) (b) and (k) of the regulations are not substantive in that they do not provide a specific basis on which to deny a site plan application. By its terms, \u00a7 XIII (9) of the regulations is procedural in nature; it instructs the commission how it should consider applications for site plan approval. The provisions provide that the defendant should consider \u201c[t]he arrangement of buildings, structures and uses on the site\u201d; Berlin Zoning Regs., \u00a7 XIII (9) (b); or \u201c[t]he adequacy of landscaping treatment, including any buffers and other screening.\u201d Id., \u00a7 (9) (k). Although it is logical that the commission will consider those provisions when determining if an application complies with clearly defined requirements set forth in the regulations, those provisions do not provide an independent basis upon which to base a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>denial. Similarly, although \u00a7 XIII (9) of the regulations also provides that the defendant may consider the \u201chealth, safety and welfare of the public,\u201d the defendant could not properly base its denial on that provision. As we previously stated, the commission was not empowered to exercise discretion in considering the application; its task was to determine if the application violated any clearly enunciated provisions set forth in the regulations. In the present case, the commission used the provisions discussed in an exercise of discretion that it did not possess.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Furthermore, to the extent that the commission denied the applications on the basis of its continued concerns about noise pollution, we conclude, as did the trial court, that this was improper. We already have concluded that the court properly invalidated the noise pollution control provisions of the regulations. That being the case, the commission lacked any basis in the regulations to deny the applications on the basis of noise. Denying the applications on the basis of its subjective concerns, as appears to be the case, is inconsistent with the commission\u2019s aforementioned ministerial role in reviewing a site plan application.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b222-10\"> The subject property is located partially in zones designated by the commission as general commercial (GC-1) and residential (R-15). The stated purpose of regulations applicable to GC-1 districts is \u201c[t]o accommodate small scale commercial uses on property that benefit from and are appropriate for a highway location in such manner so as to be compatible with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>nearby residential properties.\u201d The commission\u2019s GC-1 regulation provides in relevant part: \u201cThe following principal uses shall be permitted in the GC-1 district subject to Site Plan approval by the Planning Commission . . . o. Indoor or outdoor commercial recreation facilities including . . . go-cart facilities . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">The stated purpose of regulations applicable to R-15, or single-family residential, districts is \u201cto provide suitable areas for residential development appropriate to the environmental characteristics of the land and the character of the neighborhood. The districts are also intended to accommodate certain non-residential uses which are compatible with residential uses while preserving neighborhood character and property values.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b223-9\"> See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-8 (b) and 8-9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b223-10\"> See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-8 (o) and 8-9; Practice Book \u00a7 81-1 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b224-7\"><em> </em>This court reached its decision in light of the fact that the trial court had remanded the matter to the commission for reconsideration of the plaintiffs application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b224-9\"> The court later consolidated that appeal with the original appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b231-8\"> The regulations, in \u00a7 II, entitled \u201cRules and Definitions,\u201d provide in relevant part that \u201c[t]he abbreviation \u2018ZEO\u2019 means the Zoning Enforcement Officer of the Town of Berlin.\u201d Berlin Zoning Regs., \u00a7 II (A) (17).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b231-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-6 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe zoning board of appeals shall have the following powers and duties: (1) To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is an error in any order, requirement or decision made by the official charged with the enforcement of this chapter or any bylaw, ordinance or regulation adopted under the provisions of this chapter . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"Aai\"> Practice Book (1998) \u00a7 17-55 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe judicial authority will not render declaratory judgments upon the complaint of any person . . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">\u201c(4) until all persons having an interest in the subject matter of the complaint are parties to the action or have reasonable notice thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b235-7\"> The court further noted: \u201c [E]ven if we were to assume, without deciding, that the plaintiff was required by Practice Book \u00a7 390 (d) [later Practice Book (1998) \u00a7 17-55 (4)] to give further notice of its additional [declaratory relief] claims, any lack of proper notice under that section with respect to the declaratory judgment count did not deprive the court of jurisdiction to consider those claims in the context of the plaintiff s nondeclaratory count.\u201d <em>Stafford Higgins Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 578.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b236-6\"> The commission apparently claims that the plaintiffs failure to so provide notice deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction and, thus, the ability to pass judgment on the challenged regulations. We note that even if there were a declaratory judgment action, this characterization would be incorrect.
