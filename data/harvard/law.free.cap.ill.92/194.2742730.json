Where an alteration is made in the description of land in a deed before the execution and delivery of the deed, it will be valid; and in this case the evidence was deemed sufficient to establish that fact.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b194-8\" pgmap=\"194\">2. Acknowledoment of deed\u2014sufficiency of certificate. Three persons joined in the execution of a deed, and because the officer who took the acknowledgment used the word \u201cis\" instead of \u201care,\u201d in referring to the \u201cpersons\u201d who executed the deed, it was objected that the certificate was defective, but it was held sufficient.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b194-9\" pgmap=\"194\">3. Ejectment\u2014affidavit as to common source of title. The plaintiff in an action of ejectment, in an affidavit of common source of title, stated that \u201cthe said defendant claims title to the said premises in question in this suit from William Parrott, and that plaintiff claims title to the said premises from said William Pari'ott and John Parrott, brothers of the said plaintiff, the two titles being from a common source.\u201d This was held to be sufficient, as showing that both parties did claim title from a common source, namely, from William Parrott.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b194-10\" pgmap=\"194\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Alexander county; the Hon. David J. Baker, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-11\" pgmap=\"194\">This was an action of ejectment, and was brought by James A. Parrott to recover a tract of land claimed by plaintiff in fee, and averred to be unlawfully withheld by defendant, the Cairo and St. Louis Railroad Company. On the first trial the jury found for plaintiff, but a new trial was granted to defendant under the statute. On the second trial the cause was submitted to the court without the intervention of a jury, and the court found plaintiff was owner in fee of the premises described in the declaration, and that defendant was guilty of withholding the same. From the judgment rendered defendant prosecutes its appeal to this court.</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-12\" pgmap=\"194(29) 195(19)\">Plaintiff offered in evidence a deed from John Parrott, and William D.

Linegae &amp; Lansden, for the appellee,</attorneys><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_Kd\" pgmap=\"196\">in respect to the sufficiency of the certificate of acknowledgment, cited Hartshorn v. Dawson, 79 Ill. 108.</p> <opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b197-5\" pgmap=\"197\">Mr. Justice Scott</author> <p id=\"A8D\" pgmap=\"197\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b197-6\" pgmap=\"197\">It is said the deed under which plaintiff claims title to the premises in controversy was inadmissible in evidence, because of the alleged alteration that was said to appear on the face of the deed. The word \u201csouth\u201d is written over the word \u201cnorth,\u201d in the description of the land conveyed, and it is that which is said to invalidate the deed.</p> <p id=\"b197-7\" pgmap=\"197\">It is quite clear, from the evidence, that the alleged alteration in the description of the land was made before the deed was executed and delivered to the grantee. The writing was evidently done at the same time, by the same person, and with the same ink, and the proof is convincing that no change was made in the description of the land after the deed was delivered. Of course, if the erasure was made and the new description was written before the deed was executed and delivered, it is valid, and there is no reasonable doubt, under the evidence, that such was the fact.</p> <p id=\"b197-8\" pgmap=\"197\">Three persons joined in the execution of the deed, and because the officer who took the acknowledgment used the word \u201cis\u201d instead of \u201care\u201d in referring to the \u201cpersons\u201d who executed the deed, it is said the officer\u2019s certificate is defective. We do not think so. . It is plain, from the context, what word was intended, and the words employed leave no shadow of doubt on the mind that all the persons signing the deed were personally known to the officer acting. Hartshorn v. Dawson, 79 Ill. 108.</p> <p id=\"b197-9\" pgmap=\"197\">Objection is taken to the affidavit designed to show that both parties claim title to the land involved in this litigation from a \u201c common source.\u201d It is stated in the affidavit that both parties claim the title to the land that was in William Parrott, but. because plaintiff may also claim title from John Parrott it is none the less true that both parties claim title from a common source, viz: from William Parrott. The allegation is, both titles are from a common source, setting forth what that source is. and that we think is sufficient.</p> <p id=\"b198-4\" pgmap=\"198\">The judgment is warranted by the law and the evidence, and must be affirmed, which is done.</p> <p id=\"b198-5\" pgmap=\"198\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
