During the period of the claimant\u2019s employment and while he was continuously exposed to the effect of the dust, the employer had been insured at different times by three different insurers. The Industrial Accident Board has ruled that the appellant Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company, which carried the risk on February 19, 1934, is alone liable to pay the compensation, and the Superior Court in its decree has adopted that ruling. The only question argued and intended to be raised by this appeal is the question whether the appellant must bear the loss alone or whether all the insurers who covered the employer at different times during the years while the employee was accumulating in his lungs the dust which finally caused incapacity should be held jointly responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-3\">G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 26, provides that \u201cIf an employee . . . receives a personal injury arising out of and in the course of his employment ... he shall be paid compensation by the insurer, as hereinafter provided, if his employer is an insured person at the time of the injury . . . .\u201d If we turn to the first section of the same chapter, we find that the word insurer is defined as meaning \u201cany insurance company . . . which has contracted with an employer to pay the compensation provided for by this chapter.\u201d Reading the two sections together it would seem that the insurer contracts to pay the compensation due to an employee who \u201creceives a personal injury\u201d during the time while the contract of insurance is in force. This construction gains some further support from the language of \u00a7 15A as amended by St. 1934, c. 252, the wording of which seems to imply that, while there may be doubt as to which of several insurers is hable, only one can be held for any single injury. See also \u00a7\u00a7 41, 42, requiring notice to be given to \u201cthe insurer\u201d of the time, place and cause of the injury. It would fohow that in these cases, where the cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>operates through a period of years, the liability of any particular insurer depends upon whether or not it is found that the \u201cpersonal injury\u201d took place during the time specified as the period of coverage in the contract between that insurer and the employer. The cases show that in practice this has always been regarded as the decisive factor. It is unnecessary to review them in detail, as they are collected and further confirmed in <em>De Filippo\u2019s Case, </em>284 Mass. 531, <em>Crowley\u2019s Case, </em>287 Mass. 367, and <em>Anderson\u2019s Case, </em>288 Mass. 96. Whether there can ever be a joint liability has not been expressly decided in any of these cases, though in <em>Langford\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 461, it appeared that one member of the Industrial Accident Board had decided in favor of joint liability, but the question was not argued, and this court found it unnecessary to pass upon it. It is significant however that none of our decisions gives any support to the suggestion that several insurers can be held jointly. We think the implication from the statutes and from all the cases taken together is so strongly against the appellant that the question cannot fairly be said to be still open.' For this reason it is unnecessary to discuss <em>Plecity </em>v. <em>George McLachlan Hat Co. </em>116 Conn. 216, relied upon by the appellant. That case was decided under a statute and a practice which differ from ours.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">We do not mean to say of course that cases do not arise in which the personal injury can be found to have occurred before the date of inability to work. <em>Anderson\u2019s Case, </em>288 Mass. 96, was of that type. But in the present case, as in most of those referred to above, the board has found that the injury did occur at the time of incapacity, and that finding is not unwarranted by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
