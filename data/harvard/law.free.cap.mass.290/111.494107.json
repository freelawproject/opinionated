By an amendment to the declaration it was further alleged by the plaintiff, in substance, that another automobile was caused to collide with the motor vehicle of the plaintiff \u201cdue to the gross, wilful and wanton misconduct\u201d on the part of the defendant, its agents or servants in the operation of one of its street cars. The trial judge found for the plaintiff in the sum of $300, and denied the defendant\u2019s first, second and fourth requests for rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">It is recited in the report that it was agreed by the defendant that the finding for the plaintiff on the ground of negligence of the defendant was proper unless the motor vehicle, driven by the plaintiff at the time he was injured, was a trespasser upon the highway. It is further recited in the report that the defendant was not guilty of reckless or wanton injury to the plaintiff, and that if the automobile driven by the plaintiff was a trespasser on the highway there should be a finding for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">It appeared at the trial that the automobile operated by the plaintiff at the time of the accident was registered in the name of Edith W. Ricker, whose residence and address were stated in the application for registration, and in the registration, to be \u201c78 Kilsyth Road, Brookline, Massachusetts.\u201d The record shows that Kilsyth Road runs both in Brookline and in that part of Boston known as Brighton, that there is no number 78 Kilsyth Road in Brookline and that number 78 Kilsyth Road is in Brighton.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">At the close of the evidence the defendant made the following requests for rulings: \u201c1. Upon all the evidence the automobile driven by the plaintiff at the time of the acci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>dent was illegally registered and a finding must be made for the defendant. 2. Upon all the evidence the owner of the automobile driven by the plaintiff failed to comply with the statute in regard to registration of an automobile by misstating the owner\u2019s address, and therefore the plaintiff was a trespasser upon the highway and cannot recover from the defendant except for reckless and wanton injury to him.\u201d The judge refused to give these requests, gave the defendant\u2019s third request that \u201cThe defendant was not guilty of reckless and wanton injury to the plaintiff . . . ,\u201d and found for the plaintiff. Upon a report to the Appellate Division it was held that there was prejudicial error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s second request. It was ordered that the finding for the plaintiff be vacated and that judgment be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-3\">No error appears. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 2, provides that an application for registration, in addition to other information, shall contain \u201ca statement of the name, place of residence and address of the applicant.\u201d The intent is, that the owner may be readily found by police officers, injured persons, and others interested, without uncertainty or need for search. The required facts as to name, residence and address are simple, within the knowledge of the applicant, and ordinarily incapable of being mistaken or misstated without carelessness. Under the authority of <em>Di Cecca </em>v. <em>Bucci, </em>278 Mass. 15, the automobile in which the plaintiff was riding was improperly registered. The case is distinguishable from <em>Topf </em>v. <em>Holland, </em>288 Mass. 552. Although the plaintiff was not the owner of the automobile, he was its operator. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 9. The violation of the statute as to registration is a bar to recovery by the plaintiff on the ground of negligence, and no reckless or wanton conduct is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">\n<em>Order of Appellate Division affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
