R. Apt and Arthur Apt representing the defendant. At that interview and as a result of the negotiations which then took place Arthur Apt made out and handed to Green the following \u201cpurchase order\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">E. R.

Arthur Apt</p>\n<p id=\"b241-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>There was conflicting evidence as to what the talk was both before and at the time of the delivery of the purchase order to Green, the plaintiff\u2019s evidence tending to show that he was assured that notwithstanding the wording of the purchase order, he was getting a contract for approximately eight thousand cases iii any event, and the defendant\u2019s evidence tending to show that nothing was said to that effect, but that it was explained to Green that the defendant never gave an outright order, and that Green said he \u201cmerely wanted the order to insure the fact he would get the business by the end of the year whatever it amounted to on that particular box,\u201d and that Green took the order and walked out. The next day the plaintiff wrote the defendant as follows: \u201cWe wish to acknowledge with thanks your orders No. 7827 and No. 7828. We will be able to make delivery on No. 8 Shu-Stile and Apt Specials after August 1st.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\">Upon the case thus presented the judge was justified in finding that \u201cthe only contract made between the parties is by the defendant\u2019s written order of July 29, 1929, and its acceptance by the plaintiff\u2019s letter of July 30.\u201d His further finding that Green \u201cwas told that he was getting an order for eight thousand cases anyway and there might be a few more than eight thousand cases\u201d is not inconsistent with the finding first quoted. There was evidence that this was an estimate of the number likely to be needed based upon the defendant\u2019s past experience and orders for shoes then on hand. The purchase order of July 29 and the acknowledgment of July 30 indicating its final acceptance by the plaintiff are adequate and sufficiently definite to evidence a complete and enforceable contract on the terms set forth in the purchase order. <em>Cabot </em>v. <em>Winsor, </em>1 Allen, 546, 549. <em>Remick </em>v. <em>Sandford, </em>118 Mass. 102. See also <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>156 Mass. 581, 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">The purchase order is to be construed by the court with reference to the circumstances under which it was given and accepted. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Faulkner, </em>12 Gray, 251, 255. We think the dominant words are \u201cRequirements for Balance of year to Jan 1-1930\u201d and that those words are not eon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>trolled or extended by the words \u201cApproximate estimate\u201d and the figures which follow. The word \u201cestimate,\u201d in the connection in which it is here used, even though qualified by \u201cApproximate,\u201d cannot fairly be enlarged to denote a warranty. The words \u201cBlanket Order\u201d in the column headed \u201cQuantity\u201d lend further support to this construction. <em>Brawley </em>v. <em>United States, </em>96 U.

See <em>Burgess Sulphite Fibre Co. </em>v. <em>Broomfield, </em>180 Mass. 283. If business conditions after July 29, 1929, resulted in reducing the defendant\u2019s requirements for the balance of the year far below the approximate estimate, that is the misfortune of the plaintiff, and any loss to it is a consequence of the kind of agreement into which it entered. <em>Brawley </em>v. <em>United States, </em>96 U. S. 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The defendant accepted only one thousand two hundred six cartons of boxes, but there was no evidence that it failed to take and to pay for as many of the boxes of the type contracted for as it required for the balance of the year to January 1, 1930. The finding for the defendant was therefore proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
