A. Dever, </em>Attorney General, &amp; <em>J. P.

G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 69-75. We assume without deciding that the claimant was a \u201cfarm laborer\u201d as those words are used in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-16\">The contention of the Commonwealth is that the workmen\u2019s compensation act as it was originally passed (St. 1911, c. 751) contained provisions rendering it inapplicable to farm laborers and that the act by which it was extended to apply to public employees (St. 1913, c. 807) adopted those provisions by reference or by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-17\">The original compensation act did not exclude from its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>scope farm laborers. It applied in general to all employees, except those casually employed, and defined \u201cEmployee\u201d as including \u201cevery person in the service of another under any contract of hire, express or implied, oral or written . . . .\u201d St. 1911, c. 751, Part V, \u00a7 2. (See now G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 152, \u00a7 1.) All that act did to distinguish farm laborers from other laborers was to preserve to the employer his common law defences, when sued for personal injuries by a domestic servant or farm laborer. Part I, \u00a7 2. (See now G. L. [Ter. Ed.] 152, \u00a7 67.) Thus no inducement was held out to the employing farmer to insure under the act, and the practical effect was to leave entirely to his option whether to come in under it or not. <em>Keaney\u2019s Case, 217 </em>Mass. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The act of 1913 whereby the principle of compensation was extended to public employees (see now G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 69-75), contains nothing which can fairly be con. strued as importing into the later act the provision relative to farm labor which is contained in the earlier one. See <em>Saxe\u2019s Case, </em>242 Mass. 290. Indeed it is difficult to see what reason could exist for such an exception in the later act, which applies only to the Commonwealth and to such local subdivisions as accept it.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">On the other hand, the later act contains mandatory provisions requiring payment of compensation \u201cto such laborers, workmen and mechanics employed by it as receive injuries arising out of and in the course of their employment\u201d (St. 1913, c. 807, \u00a7 1. See now G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 152, \u00a7 69), and further provides that \u201cThis act shall apply to all laborers, workmen and mechanics in the service of the commonwealth . . . under any employment or contract of hire, expressed or implied, oral or written . . . .\u201d St. 1913, c. 807, \u00a7 6. See now G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 74. As a matter of plain English this language includes farm laborers with other laborers in the class entitled to benefits. See <em>Devney\u2019s Case, </em>223 Mass. 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">This situation is in no wise affected by subsequent amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
