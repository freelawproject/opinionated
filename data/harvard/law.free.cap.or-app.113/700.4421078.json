J.</author>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Defendant pled guilty to four counts in an indictment: Count I, theft in the second degree, ORS 164.045; Count 2, burglary in the first degree, ORS 164.225; Count 3, theft in the first degree, ORS 164.055; and Count 4, burglary in the first degree. The charges arose from what the prosecutor denominated a \u201ccrime spree\u201d during the evening of August 4, 1990. The court sentenced defendant to 6 months in jail on Count 1 and to probation on Count 3. On Count 2, it determined that he came within grid block 8-G and sentenced him to a prison term of 22 months. It then used the conviction on Count 2 as part of defendant\u2019s criminal history on Count 4 and sentenced him to 24 months in prison, within the presumptive range of grid block 7-C.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Defendant argues that the court erred in using his conviction on Count 2 to upgrade his criminal history classification on Count 4. OAR 253-04-006 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">\u201c(1) The Criminal History Scale includes nine mutually exclusive categories used to classify an offender\u2019s criminal history according to the extent and nature of the offender\u2019s criminal history at the time the current crime or crimes of conviction is sentenced. The nine categories in the scale are labelled alphabetically and are arranged in order of seriousness from the most serious (Criminal History Category A) to the least serious (Criminal History Category I).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-7\">\u201c(2) An offender\u2019s criminal history is based upon the number of adult felony and Class A misdemeanor convictions and juvenile adjudications in the offender\u2019s criminal history at the time the current crime or crimes of conviction is sentenced. Prior adult convictions or juvenile adjudications which have been expunged shall not be considered when classifying an offender\u2019s criminal history.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">Defendant argues that the commentary to that rule shows that an offense committed during a single criminal episode that gives rise to multiple convictions cannot be used as criminal history in regard to the other offenses committed in the same episode. The commentary says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-9\">\u201cThis section also makes clear that a criminal history, for purposes of sentencing under these rules, is determined as of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>the time of sentencing. This provision ensures that the severity of the sentence is commensurate with offender\u2019s characteristics at the time he or she is sentenced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-4\">\u201cThe Guidelines Board had originally adopted a rule which would only count prior convictions entered at the time the current crime of conviction was committed. This rule was intended to ensure that court proceedings not be manipulated by either the offender or the state to alter the offender\u2019s criminal history classification. The legislature, however, directed the Guidelines Board to amend this rule to provide that the offender\u2019s criminal history is to include all prior convictions or juvenile adjudications entered against the offender \u2018at the time the current crime or crimes of conviction is sentenced.\u2019 Section 98, Chapter 790, Oregon Laws 1989.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\">\n<em>\u201cThis reference to \u2018current crime or crimes of conviction \u2019 was intended to prohibit the consideration of convictions arising from the current proceeding in classification of the offender\u2019s criminal history. This prohibition applies even if the state can establish the chronological order in which the offenses were committed.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-6\">\u201cIn short, the legislative intent was to capture as accurately as possible the offender\u2019s criminal record at the time of sentencing without encouraging the manipulation of court proceedings as a means to affect the offender\u2019s criminal history classification.\u201d <em>Oregon Sentencing Guidelines Implementation Manual </em>50 (1989). (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">The state contends that the commentary is not authoritative. <em>State v. Moeller, </em>105 Or App 434, 806 P2d 130, <em>rev dismissed </em>312 Or 76, 815 P2d 701 (1991). It argues that the proposed rule referred to in the commentary would have excluded any of a defendant\u2019s convictions that had not been reduced to judgment when the defendant committed the crime for which he was being sentenced. It contends that the legislature directed the council to adopt a rule that would calculate the defendant\u2019s history as of the time of sentencing. <em>See </em>Or Laws 1989, ch 790, \u00a7 98. By doing so, the state argues, the legislature intended that the defendant\u2019s criminal history score not depend on whether or not a formal \u2018 \u2018judgment\u2019 \u2019 had been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Although the commentary is not authoritative, here it accurately reflects the legislative intent. The language of OAR 253-04-006(2) was adopted from an amendment offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>by Representative Clark.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The discussion was directed to the impact of the rule on projected prison populations. Criminal Justice Council staff member Ashford explained the effect of the proposed change in OAR 253-04-006(2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-4\">\u201cBy counting criminal history from date of sentencing, offenders who are being sentenced for multiple offenses could have counted in their criminal history the multiple offenses \u2014 the current multiple offenses, because they have been theoretically convicted of them and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving those numbers up. If the intention of the committee is only to count as prior convictions, convictions unrelated to the current, then the impact figures would be very low.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The concern was to clarify that the amendment was not intended to result in increased prison population. The legislators agreed with the explanation provided by Circuit Court Judge Ellis,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> an associate member of the Criminal Justice Council, who testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-6\">\u201cThe defendant who\u2019s before you for sentencing on four different felonies at the same time \u2014 three of those are not to me prior convictions. They\u2019re present convictions. <em>So you wouldn\u2019t count \u2018em as part of prior criminal history, no matter what rule you use for figuring prior criminal history.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">That understanding of OAR 253-04-006(2) comports with the principle underlying the guidelines to punish offenders within the limits of correctional resources. OAR 253-02-001; <em>see State v. Davis, </em>113 Or App 118, 830 P2d 620 (1992). The trial court erred in using defendant\u2019s conviction on Count 2 in determining the grid block for his conviction on Count 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">Remanded for resentencing for burglary in the first degree in Count 4; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-9\"> Proposed Amendments to B-Engrossed Senate Bill 1073, House Judiciary Sub-Committee on Crime, June 19, 1989.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b736-10\"> The quoted testimony is from Tape Recording, House Judiciary SubCommittee on Crime, Tape 103, Side A, June 20,1989.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b736-11\"> The legislators assented with comments of \u201cExactly,\u201d and \u201cThat makes sense to me.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
