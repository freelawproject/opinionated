Defendants having filed answers, the case was tried by the district court without a jury and it was stipulated that the releases might be set aside and that the sole issue became the nature and extent, if any, of plaintiff\u2019s interest in certain oil production in a tract of\" land in White county, Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-19\">The district court made findings of fact and conclusions of law and entered a judgment in favor of defendants, from, which this appeal was taken by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-20\">An opinion was filed by the district court, 150 F.Supp. 471. In that opinion, the lower court has adequately and correctly marshaled the pertinent facts and applied to them the correct principles of law. It has reached a right result. We' see no reason to encumber the shelves of the law libraries with an expression of our views. We are content to adopt the opinion of the district court, which we~ now do.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-21\">For that reason, the judgment from, which the appeal was taken is affirmed-</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
