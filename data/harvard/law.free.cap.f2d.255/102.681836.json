The proscribed practices involved the sale and use of certain \u201cskip tracing\u201d forms, cards, and envelopes, designed to obtain information about delinquent debtors, which the Commission found represented falsely that the requests for information were from an agency of the United States Government which would forward a check for a sum of money upon being furnished the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Our examination of the record satisfies us that the Commission\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence. They in turn fully support its order to cease and desist. We have considered the petitioners\u2019 other contentions that the proceeding is not in the public interest, that the complaint should be dismissed because the Commission had not established standards delineating deceptive practices in this field before the proceeding was begun, and that the corporate petitioner was not shown to be engaged in interstate commerce or in the \u201cskip tracing\u201d business. Each of them is so wholly lacking in merit as to require no detailed discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">The order of the Federal Trade Commission will be affirmed and a decree enforcing it will be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
