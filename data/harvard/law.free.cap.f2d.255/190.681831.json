The suit was brought by appellant to declare that his separation from federal employment was accomplished in violation of his rights under the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act of 1944, as amended, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 851 et seq. We agree with the District Court that appellant\u2019s two week period of full time training duty with the National Guard of the District of Columbia does not make him an ex-serviceman within the meaning of the Act and that no basis exists for setting aside his separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
