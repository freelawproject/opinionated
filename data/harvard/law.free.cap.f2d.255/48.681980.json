Davis received a cash payment of approximately $12,000 from Continental Bus System, Inc. The question for decision is whether this payment was taxable to the appellants as a long-term capital gain, as they contend, or was ordinary income, as the district court found. The answer depends upon whether the payment consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>tuted \u201cboot\u201d under Section 112(c) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">The facts are undisputed. In 1947 Mr. Davis was a stockholder in Continental Bus System, Inc. That year Continental\u2019s stockholders made agreements with two other bus companies whereby <em>the </em>assets of those two companies and the stock of Continental would be transferred to a new corporation in exchange for its stock and debentures. These agreements were carried out. The Continental stockholders as a group received less than thirty-five per cent of the common stock of the new corporation and did not control it. It is stated in the government\u2019s brief that \u201cBoth parties are in agreement that the transaction <em>in </em>which taxpayers <em>exchanged </em>their shares was not a reorganization under Section 112(g) of the 1939 Code.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The transaction was a tax free exchange, however, under Section 112(b) (5), because the parties to the agreement received stock and debentures of the new corporation substantially in proportion to the interests which they transferred to it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">The agreements provided that for purposes of the exchange the net book value of Continental\u2019s assets as of the date of consummation of the transaction would be $2,405,095, and that if a subsequent audit should show that the actual net book value was more or less than that figure, a cash adjustment would be made. The language used in the agreements was that the Continental stockholders \u201cshall pay any deficiency or have refunded to them any excess.\u201d Such an audit, which was not made until 1951, developed that the net book value of Continental\u2019s assets on the date of the exchange in 1947 had exceeded the agreed value by more than $100,000. Davis, as one of the former Continental stockholders who were parties to the 1947 agreement, received as his proportionate share of the resulting cash adjustment the payment which is here in issue. The payment was actually made by Continental, which was then being operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the new corporation. At the time of these payments to its former stockholders Continental had more than suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>cient earnings and profits to cover dividends in the amount of the payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Upon these undisputed facts the district court entered a summary judgment in favor of the government. It was the court\u2019s conclusion that the cash adjustment in question was not \u201ca part of the agreed upon exchange,\u201d that it was \u201cexcluded from the transaction for the purpose of decreasing the amount contributed by the stockholders of Continental to the new corporation,\u201d and that the distribution by Continental in 1951 \u201cwas a dividend as that term is defined in Section 115(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Although the question is a close one, it is our opinion that the transaction in question was of a character to bring the 1951 distribution within the provisions of Section 112(c) (1), and therefore taxable as a capital gain.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This case is to be distinguished from Fulton\u2019s Executors v. Commissioner, 1931, 60 App.D.C. 74, 47 F.2d 436, where the excess assets never came under control of the new corporation, but were transferred to trustees for distribution to the stockholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Here the shareholders of Continental agreed in 1947 to exchange all their stock for a specified amount of stock and debentures in the new corporation, upon the assumption that the book value of the Continental stock equaled a stated amount. If, however, it should turn out that the book value exceeded that amount, the agreement provided that the shareholders were to receive additional consideration for their stock in cash. The cash payment was therefore within the literal provisions of Section 112(c) (1) of the 1939 Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The judgment of the district court is set aside, and the case remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the views here expressed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-5\">. \u201c(c) Gain from exchanges not solely in kind.
