UNITED STATES of America, Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b542-11\">No. 322, Docket 24977.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b542-12\">United States Court of Appeals Second Circuit.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b542-13\">Argued April 30, 1958.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b542-14\">Decided May 22, 1958.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Herbert Monte Levy, New York City, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b543-5\">Mark F. Hughes, Jr., Asst. U. S. Atty., S. D. New York, New York City (Paul W. Williams, U. S. Atty., Charles H. Miller, Asst. U. S. Atty., New York City, of counsel, on the brief), for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b543-6\">Before CLARK, Chief Judge, and HINCKS and STEWART, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b543-7\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">The appellant\u2019s criminal conviction for sending obscene matter through the mails was affirmed by this court, 237 F. 2d 796, and by the Supreme Court, 352 U.S. 964, 77 S.Ct. 361, 1 L.Ed.2d 319. Thereafter he made a motion in the district court for reduction of his five-year sentence to the time already served. Rule 35, F.R.Crim.P. This appeal is from the denial of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">There is no question but that the sentence was within the allowable statutory limit. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1461. It is the appellant\u2019s contention, however, that in imposing the sentence originally, and in refusing to reduce it, the district judge applied \u201cillegal and unconstitutional standards.\u201d Specifically, it is asserted that the trial judge in determining the length of the sentence relied primarily upon the appellant\u2019s record of previous convictions for similar offenses, and that most, if not all, of these previous convictions would be invalid in the light of present standards. The record, however, shows that in addition to the appellant\u2019s prior criminal record, Judge Cashin had the benefit of a variety of other data, including a presentence investigation report, a \u201cbrochure\u201d submitted by the appellant, and information as to the appellant\u2019s health and domestic life.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\"> The rule is well settled that a United States Court of Appeals is without power to review or revise a sentence which is within permissible statutory limits. United States v. Rosenberg, 2 Cir., 195 F.2d 583, 603-609, certiorari denied 344 U.S. 838, 73 S.Ct. 20, 97 L.Ed. 687, rehearing denied 1952, 344 U.S. 889, 73 S.Ct. 134, 97 L.Ed. 687; United States v. Landi, 2 Cir., 1957, 240 F.2d 238; Jolly v. United States, 6 Cir., 229 F.2d 180, certiorari denied 1956, 351 U.S. 963, 76 S.Ct. 1024, 100 L.Ed. 1483. For the reasons stated this is not a case that demands inquiry as to what exceptions, if any, there may be to this rule. See Smith v. United States, 5 Cir., 1955, 223 F.2d 750, 754. Nor need we here inquire as to the extent of the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisdiction in this area in the exercise of its supervisory power over the administration of justice in the lower federal courts. Compare Yates v. United States, 78 S.Ct. 766, with Mr. Justice Frankfurter\u2019s memorandum in Rosenberg v. United States, 1952, 344 U.S. 889, 890, 73 S.Ct. 134, 97 L.Ed. 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
