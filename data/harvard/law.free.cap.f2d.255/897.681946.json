The record shows that the first judge summarily denied the request of defense counsel that the accused be permitted to take the stand on the motion to suppress. We do not condone this clear error, which, without more, would have caused us to reverse the judgment of conviction here obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>However, we have examined in detail the transcript of the trial. Appellant\u2019s motion was renewed at the trial, and a different judge made extensive inquiry into the disputed circumstances under which the evidence sought to be suppressed had been obtained. The arresting officer and the accused himself were heard at length. Thus the pre-trial error was cured, for the appellant, although belatedly, was afforded full opportunity to explain in detail his version of the facts and circumstances surrounding the arrest. It was thereupon ruled that the evidence had been legally obtained, a conclusion we will not disturb.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">Since the record amply sustains the jury\u2019s guilty verdict, the conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">WILBUR K. MILLER, Circuit Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
