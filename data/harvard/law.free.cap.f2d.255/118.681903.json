The motion also asked that the Grievance Committee be forbidden to use the testimony or any information derived from it and that the Committee be stayed from any investigation \u201crelated to the use of aforesaid grand jury minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">The facts were as follows. The plaintiff is a member of the New York Bar against whom the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York preferred \u201ccharges of corruption in government and * * * criminal activity\u201d as \u201ca former group chief in the [Intelligence Unit of the] Internal Revenue Service.\u201d The grand jury failed to indict; but having finished its investigation on September 21, 1955, it \u201cunanimously voted that the activities of the appellant be referred to the Grievance Committee <em>* * * </em>by the United States Attorney.\u201d The United States Attorney thereupon presented the issue to the Committee, whose own attorney filed with it a charge against the plaintiff, and thereafter \u2014 with the support of the United States Attorney \u2014 obtained from Judge Dawson an order making available to the Committee the transcripts of minutes of the grand jury testimony. The Committee began a hearing under \u00a7 90(6) of the New York Judiciary Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 30, but before its completion the plaintiff moved before Judge Dawson that the transcripts should be returned and for other incidental relief. It is from an order denying all relief that the plaintiff has appealed. We are told, although this does not appear in the record, that the Committee has proceeded with the hearing and reported to the Appellate Division unfavorably to the plaintiff; and that that court has appointed a referee to hear the evidence presented by the Committee\u2019s attorney; also that the progress of that proceeding has been suspended by the consent of both parties, pending the decision of this appeal. The plaintiff\u2019s position is that Judge Dawson\u2019s order was a violation of his privilege that all testimony taken before the grand jury should not be disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-14\">We find it unnecessary to consider whether the common law would have authorized the order, because for us Rule 6(e) of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A. is the measure of the plaintiff\u2019s privilege. It first forbids any \u201cdisclosure of matters occurring before the grand jury\u201d to anyone except \u201cattorneys for the government\u201d with exceptions not here relevant, and then declares that \u201cotherwise a juror, attorney, interpreter a stenographer, may disclose matters occurring before a grand jury only when so directed by the court preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding.\u201d The position of the Committee is that the disclosure to them of the testimony taken before the grand jury was preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>to a judicial proceeding: that is, to a proceeding upon the complaint of the Committee to the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court involving disciplinary sanctions against the plaintiff. This depends, first, upon whether the hearing by the Grievance Committee was \u201cpreliminary\u201d to any charge of professional misconduct that it might make to the Appellate Division; and, second, whether any proceeding before that court upon such a charge was \u201ca judicial proceeding\u201d within the meaning of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">The answer to the first question admits of no doubt. Section 90(7) of the New York Judiciary Law provides that in a county like that of New York the \u201cpresiding justice may * * * appoint an attorney and counsellor-at-law, designated by a duly incorporated bar association * * * to prosecute any such proceeding\u201d; and the Appellate Division of the First Department (Matter of Branch, 178 App.Div. 585, 588, 165 N.Y.S. 688, 690) has declared that it \u201chas long been the practice of this court to refer to said committee\u201d (the Grievance Committee of the City Bar Association), \u201cfor investigation, in the first instance, complaints against members of the bar to see whether such complaints furnish sufficient ground for the submission of formal charges. Its work has been of the most important character and has been of great assistance to the court. When so proceeding, as the learned official referee has well said, its acts are quasi judicial; for on its conclusions formal charges are presented to the court.\u201d See also Matter of Wyte, 231 App.Div. 539, 547, 248 N.Y. S. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\"> The second question is whether a proceeding before the Appellate Division to discipline an attorney of the state court is within the term, \u201cjudicial proceeding,\u201d of Rule 6(e). It is true that it is not a criminal proceeding, Matter of Randel, 158 N.Y. 216, 219, 52 N.E. 1106; Matter of Popper, 193 App.Div. 505, 510, 184 N.Y.S. 406. On the other hand, it is a proceeding designed in the public interest to preserve the good name and the uprightness of the bar, made up, as it is, of attorneys who are public officers. We cannot agree that the Rule should be limited to criminal proceedings; on the contrary we hold that, prima facie, the term \u201cjudicial proceeding\u201d includes any proceeding determinable by a court, having for its object the compliance of any person, subject to judicial control, with standards imposed upon his conduct in the public interest, even though such compliance is enforced without the procedure applicable to the punishment of crime. An interpretation that should not go at least so far, would not only be in the teeth of the language employed, but would defeat any rational purpose that can be imputed to the Rule. It is scarcely necessary to add that the situation is completely unlike the \u201cpresentment\u201d of a grand jury such as was the subject of Judge Weinfeld\u2019s decision in Application of United Electrical, Radio <em>&amp; </em>Machine Workers of America, D.C., 111 F.Supp. 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">We wish to guard against the assumption that we are suggesting that the District Court would have in any event jurisdiction over the dispute to be decided by the proceeding pending before the Appellate Division or its referee, or that we might interfere with its or his possession of minutes of the testimony in question. We are assuming that these remain in the possession of the Grievance Committee. It is hardly necessary to add that we make not the remotest suggestion as to how they shall be used, or what should be regarded as their evidential competence in the proceeding to discipline the plaintiff. We merely refuse to interfere with the possession of the Grievance Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"A5\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
