A review of the record convinces us that the district court\u2019s disposition of this case was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-24\"> At the administrative hearing the evidence was uncontroverted that Foundoulis, a Greek seaman, had failed to comply with the conditions of the Crewman\u2019s Landing Permit which had been issued to him. There was moreover no showing that he was prejudiced by a continuance of not more than three days to meet the lodged charge, nor denied procedural due process in any other respect. Consideration of the eligibility of Foundoulis for quota preference under the provisions of 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1153, was beyond the scope of the deportation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-25\">The order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
