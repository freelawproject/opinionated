(I.R.C. 1939) \u00a7 2553(a), in Count Two (Harrison Narcotics Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-11\">A plea of not guilty was entered by appellant. A trial by jury was subsequently had and a verdict of guilty was returned on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-16\">On September 18, 1952, appellant was brought for sentencing before the district court. Prior to that date and subsequent to the guilty verdict, the appel-lee filed an Information pursuant to Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which informed the Court that appellant had allegedly been convicted of prior narcotic violations. The appellant neither admitted nor denied that he was the identical person named in the Information.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-17\">The United States attorney tendered evidence to the court as to the commission of several previous narcotics offenses and called upon the accused to admit or deny that he was the same person previously convicted. Accused\u2019s counsel participated in the trial of this issue, by objecting to the introduction of evidence of previous convictions on the ground that this amounted to an ex post factoconviction. He then also objected \u201cbecause it is a jury question.\u201d Thereupon the United States attorney asked the-court to tender the appellant a jury trial. The court stated that appellant had not, denied being the same person as previously convicted, but said: \u201cIf they want a jury we will empanel one.\u201d After all the previous records were introduced' the court asked: \u201cOn the question of identity is the jury desired?\u201d Counsel evaded answering the question.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>A sentence of 20 years imprisonment was then imposed treating appellant as a prior offender under Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237, commonly known as the Boggs Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\">The judgment was appealed to this Court on grounds not pertinent or urged in the present case. 206 F.2d 296. The judgment was affirmed, one judge dissenting. Subsequently, the trial judge reduced the sentence to 15 years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-23\">On October 21,1957, the appellant filed a motion to correct and vacate sentence under Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, upon the grounds that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States; that the Court was without jurisdiction to impose the sentence; and that the sentence of 20 years imposed upon him on the 18th day of September, 1952, and subsequently reduced to a term of 15 years, was in excess of the maximum authorized by law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>and that the court was authorized to impose a five-year sentence only by reason of the provisions contained in Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">The motion was presented, argued and denied. This appeal was then filed. The appellant is now confined under the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">The question here is whether the trial court erred in sentencing appellant as a prior offender under the Boggs Act (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237), in that the question of identity was not submitted to the jury when appellant neither admitted nor denied that he was the same person named in the Information filed by the appellee, and in light of the failure of the accused to ask for a jury when tendered him.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Appellant urges that the last sentence in this statute, \u201cIf the offender is found by the jury to be the person previously convicted * * * he shall be sentenced as prescribed in this paragraph,\u201d prevents such sentencing unless there is a jury finding. The government contends that the earlier sentence, \u201cIf he denies the identity, sentence shall be postponed for such time as to permit a trial before a jury\u201d as to identity restricts the right to a jury trial on this issue to those cases, and to those only, in which the convicted person <em>denies the identity. </em>Otherwise the sentencing follows normal procedure under the mandatory penalties prescribed elsewhere in the Act (see footnote 1, supra).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">It should be observed that there is here no constitutional right at stake. Rule 32, Fed.Rules Crim.Proc., 18 U.S.C.A., expressly provides for post-conviction pre-sentence communication to the court by the probation officers to aid the court in fixing an appropriate sentence. There has never been any claim that any issues raised by the furnishing of this information are to be resolved by a second jury trial. Here, in view of the mandatory nature of the second offender sentence, the accused is tendered \u201cthe opportunity\u201d to affirm or deny his identity with the previous offender. This terminology is not comparable to the constitutional provision of a right of trial by jury as to which the courts have historically held there is no waiver because the accused stands mute. The earlier statute, 26 U.S.C.A. (I.R.C.1939) \u00a7 2557 note, now repealed, 65 Stat. 769, specifically required a jury trial \u201cif he refuses to answer or remains silent.\u201d Dealing with the change in language in a somewhat similar case, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUm\">\u201cThese specific requirements were omitted from the law as it was amended in 1951 and instead of those specific requirements we now have only the requirement that the defendant \u2018shall have the opportunity in open court to affirm or deny that he is identical with the person previously convicted\u2019. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2557(b) (1). The obvious intention of the Congress in so amending the laws to simplify the procedure in showing prior convictions and in sentencing defendants against whom multiple prior convictions are shown.\u201d United States v. Kapsalis, 7 Cir., 214 F.2d 677, 685, certiorari denied 349 U.S. 906, 75 S.Ct. 583, 99 L.Ed. 1242.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">The Court then held that the sentence there was properly imposed, although there was no express acknowledgment by the accused of the identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">This case was followed by Scales v. United States, 7 Cir., 249 F.2d 368, in which the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-11\">\u201cHe [defendant] contends the court had the burden of directly questioning him on this subject in a manner similar to proceedings upon formal arraignment, and that without such inquiry his attitude of silence must be resolved in his favor on this issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b952-12\">The Court rejected his contention, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-13\">\u201c* * * we think the record here clearly shows that appellant had the \u2018opportunity\u2019 to affirm or deny his identity as provided in the statutes. The court had no obligation to proceed further or more formally unless and until the identity of ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>pellant as the man previously convicted was denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">Scales v. United States, 249 F.2d 368, 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">Moreover, we think it quite clear from the record before us that if the statute requires a jury trial even when there is no denial, in absence of an admission, there was here a waiver by counsel of any such right. The record is clear that counsel was merely trying to save a point for later attack on the sentence. He specifically stated he did not request a jury, and then participated in the trial when none was forced upon his client. Even the constitutional right to a jury trial can be waived. Duignan v. United States, 274 U.S. 195, 47 S.Ct. 566, 71 L.Ed. 996.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">So much more can an accused waive \u201can opportunity\u201d to have a jury em-panelled to try an issue raised in the manner provided by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">The sentence is not void for the failure of the trial court to empanel a jury under the circumstances here disclosed. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b950-12\">. The pertinent provisions of this statute are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-13\">\u201cWhoever commits an offense or conspires to commit an offense described in this subchapter, subehapter O of this chapter, or parts V or VI of subchap-ter A of chapter 27, for which no specific penalty is otherwise provided, shall be fined not more than \u00a72,000 and imprisoned not less than 2 or more than 5 years. For a second offense, the offender shall be fined not more than \u00a72,000 and imprisoned not less than 5 or more than 10 years. For a third or subsequent offense, the offender shall be fined not more than \u00a72,000 and imprisoned not less than 10 or more than 20 years * * * After conviction, but prior to pronouncement of sentence, the court shall be advised by the United States attorney whether the conviction is the offender\u2019s first or a subsequent offense. If it is not a first offense, the United' States attorney shall file an information-setting forth the prior convictions. The-<em>offender shall have the opportunity in open court to affirm or deny that he-is identical </em>with the person previously-convicted. <em>If he denies the identity, </em>sentence shall be postponed for such time as <em>to permit a trial before a jury </em>on the sole issue of the offender\u2019s-identity with the person previously convicted. <em>If the offender is found by thejwy </em>to be the person previously convicted, or <em>if he achnowledges </em>that he is such person, he shall be sentenced as prescribed in this paragraph.\u201d (Emphasis added). 26 U.S.C. (I.R.C.1954) \u00a7 7237.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b950-21\">. Relevant parts of this colloquy are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-22\">\u201cMr. May: [United States attorney]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMAW\">\u201cNow, at this time I will ask that the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>defendant either admit or deny his identity as the same person that was sentenced at that time, because if he doesn\u2019t admit it, but denies it, we ask that we have a jury trial and that we be allowed to present the evidence before a jury ou each one of these counts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-6\">\u201cThe Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-7\">\u201cI think you might as well proceed with the trial. I will ask the defendants if they desire the services of a jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-8\">\u201cMr. May:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-9\">\u201cDo you wish mo to go ahead?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-10\">\u201cThe Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-11\">\u201cYes, on the question of identity, is the. jury desired?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-12\">\u201cMr. May:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-13\">\u201cDo you want a jury on the question of identity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-14\">\u201cMr. Martin: [Appellant\u2019s counsel]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-15\">\u201cYour Honor, this is a new law, and all we are trying to do is to protect the record in this case, and this is the first time we have over faced it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-16\">\u201cThe Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-17\">\u201cThat is true, but that is a simple part of it. The fact that it is new doesn\u2019t change the situation. An experienced lawyer should know whether he wants a jury or know whether he wants to submit it to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-18\">\u201cMr. Martin:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-19\">\u201cI think Your Honor expressed it right. The only issue is the identity. So, it was our thought, we more or less are confused with the procedure under these habitual criminal statutes, but it was onr thought that the indictment should set out these matters and name the defendants, the proof offered and let the jury pass on the innocence or guilt of the immediate offense, and then the other convictions, and so forth. That is what I had in mind awhile ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-20\">\u201cThe Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-21\">\u201cThe view of the Court is that this trial of the current indictment as had, was before the jury. Now, we have before us a motion by the District Attorney to accelerate and augment the punishment as required by law. It is a new law. It is the first time it has been invoked during this Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-25\">\u201cThe Court\u2019s view is that when this judgment of conviction is offered, the Court\u2019s understanding of the law is that if the defendant says that it was somebody else other than the defendant, or other than himself, then that becomes an issue that will be tried before a jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-26\">\u201cThe question is are you asking for a jury or waiving it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-27\">\u201cMr. Martin:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-28\">\u201cWe are not asking for a jury, and we are not waiving a jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-29\">\u201cMr. Jones:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-30\">\u201cWe don\u2019t waive it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-31\">\u201cMr. Martin:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-32\">\u201cIf the law is mandatory, we want the objection to it in the record. We are not asking for a jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-33\">\u201cThe Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-34\">\u201cThen let the record show that a jury was tendered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b951-35\">And later:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-36\">\u201cMr. May:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-37\">\u201cNow, if Your Honor please, I would move the Court at this time to inform the defendants that they have an opportunity in open Court to affirm or deny that they are the identical persons which have been named in the various convictions and presented to the Court here to Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-38\">\u201cMr. Jones:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-39\">\u201cAs we understand the law, <em>the </em>burden is on the government to do what they ought to do, and we are sitting here and requiring them to do it, and there is no burden on us to do anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-40\">\u201cThe Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-41\">\u201cMr. District Attorney, you might show by Mr. Goss, or other witnesses that were in Judge Atwell\u2019s Court if he is able to identify them as being one and the same person in all these cases. And after that you may tender the defendant a jury. The Court has a jury sitting in the box and the jury will be tendered to them if they desire the service of a jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
