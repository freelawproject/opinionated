A fair reading of his opinion, however, indicates that he understood this to mean an \u201cexercise of inventive faculty.\u201d In any event, our examination of the record discloses that the court could have arrived at only one conclusion, i. e., that there was anticipation and obviousness, and that the process has not \u201cproduced a new and useful result which called for more than the ingenuity of a mechanic skilled in the art.\u201d Fisch v. Gould, 3 Cir., 1957, 246 F.2d 5, 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-18\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
