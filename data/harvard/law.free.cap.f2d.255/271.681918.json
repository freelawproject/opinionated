That question is finally determined in the proceedings in which the accused is sentenced and cannot be considered in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding. Hastings v. United States, 184 F.2d 939, 940. Cf. Flores v. United States, 9 Cir., 238 F.2d 758; Brown v. United States, 9 Cir., 222 F.2d 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-26\">His second contention is that the District Court failed to consider the question whether the prosecuting officer had introduced false evidence concerning the prior convictions of Tucker leading to a prejudicial effect on the sentencing judge and resulting in a 25-year sentence. However, attached to and made a part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>the motion is a copy of the transcript of the testimony of the Government officers concerning the prior convictions in a hearing in which both appellant and his attorney participated. There the Government\u2019s witness testified in detail to the record of prior convictions and no objection.was made by either the defendant or his counsel to any of the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">On the contrary, appellant after so participating in the hearing was asked whether he would like to make any suggestions in his own behalf. Whereupon he stated that he had committed the crimes previously described. With the record in this condition the case is entirely unlike Townsend v. Burke, 334 U.S. 736, 68 S.Ct. 1252, 92 L.Ed. 1690, and the District Court properly held that \u201cthe motion and the files and records of the ease conclusively show that the plaintiff is entitled to no relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The judgment is affirmed. The petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-27\"> Opinion withdrawn.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
