In a comprehensive, well-reasoned opinion, the Referee concluded that an extension arrangement did not fall within the statutory bar and granted the discharge. His action the district judge confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">We too uphold the discharge. Especially significant is the distinction between extensions and compositions under \u00a7 14, sub. c(5) which is found in the legislative history of the Chandler Act. H.Rep.
