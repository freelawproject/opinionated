He was president of Joint Council No. 28, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers; chairman of the Western Conference of Teamsters; and president of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers Local 174. The charges covered his refusals (1) to produce the subpenaed books and records of Joint Council No. 28 and the Western Conference of Teamsters; (2) to examine and identify financial reports filed with the Labor Department by Joint Council No. 28 and Local 174 pursuant to the requirements of law; (3) to answer questions relating to the accuracy of these reports and of reports filed with the Bureau of Internal Revenue pursuant to the requirements of law; and (4) to answer questions as to (a) what other reasons appellant had, beside lack of Subcommittee jurisdiction, for his refusal to give information and (b) certain union instructions on the invocation of constitutional privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">Appellant\u2019s chief contention on this appeal, as it was before the Committee and before the District Court, is that the Committee lacked jurisdiction to conduct the inquiry into his and the union\u2019s activities and therefore could delegate no such authority to its Subcommittee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-12\">The Committee on Government Operations, at first called the Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments, was one of the fifteen permanent Senate Committees created by the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to replace the \u201ccrazy-quilt pattern\u201d of the Senate\u2019s then existing 33 committees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Act sought to \u201cdefine the jurisdiction of each reorganized committee so as to avoid jurisdictional disputes between them\u201d as had occurred with the supplanted committees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 102(1) (g) provided for the Committee :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-13\">\u201c(g) (1) Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments, to consist of thirteen Senators, to which committee shall be referred all proposed legislation, messages, petitions, memorials, and other matters relating to the following subjects:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-14\">\u201c(A) Budget and accounting measures, other than appropriations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-15\">\u201c(B) Reorganizations in the executive branch of the Government. \u201c(2) Such committee shall have the duty of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-16\">\u201c(A) receiving and examining reports of the Comptroller General of the United States and of submitting such recommendations to the Senate as it deems necessary or desirable in connection with the subject matter of such reports;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-17\">\u201c(B) <em>studying the operation of Government activities at all levels with a view to determining its economy and efficiency;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-18\">\u201c(C) evaluating the effects of laws enacted to reorganize the legislative and executive branches of the Government;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-19\">\u201c(D) studying intergovernmental relationships between the United States and the States and municipalities, and between the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>States and international organizations of which the United States is a member.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">To sustain the authority asserted here on behalf of the Committee, appellee relies primarily on subdivision (g) (2) (B), i. e., upon the Committee\u2019s duty of \u201cstudying the operation of Government activities at all levels with a view to determining its economy and efficiency.\u201d This duty, says appellee, required the Committee \u201cto determine whether Government activities in the labor union field were operating with economy and efficiency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">According to appellee, \u201cGovernment activities in the labor union field\u201d stem from two things: first, the requirement of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 141 et seq., that union organizations file financial and other reports with the Labor Department as a condition to invoking the processes of the National Labor Relations Board; <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> second, the grant of income tax exemptions to labor organizations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellee concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-7\">\u201cIt is clear that the misuse of union funds and the concealment thereof by false reports are evils whose existence will determine the economy and the efficiency of the Government activities in these labor union fields.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">To investigate these evils, the Subcommittee first heard testimony from officials of the Labor Department, the National Labor Relations Board and the Treasury Department concerning the operation of the laws requiring union organization reports. Then it sought information from appellant to determine whether there was misuse of union funds and concealment of such misuse in the reports required by law. At a Subcommittee hearing on January 19, 1957, appellant refused to give this information, on the sole ground that the Subcommittee lacked jurisdiction to make such an inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-12\">It is conceded that Congress has the power to conduct such an inquiry. The question is whether, by the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, it gave this power to the Committee of Government Operations with sufficient clarity and certainty to invoke \u201cthe aid of the federal judicial system in protecting itself against contumacious conduct.\u201d Watkins v. United States, 1957, 354 U.S. 178, 207, 77 S.Ct. 1173, 1189, 1 L.Ed.2d 1273. We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-13\">It is not at all clear that the power to investigate the misuse of union funds inheres in the Committee\u2019s duty, under \u00a7 102(1) (g) of the Act, of \u201cstudying the operation of Government activities at all levels with a view to determining its economy and efficiency.\u201d We have grave doubts that, merely because unions are required to file reports, their activities or the misuse of their funds or the concealment of such use become \u201cGovernment activities.\u201d We would have the same doubts about whether the requirement that corporations file tax returns makes all corporate affairs \u201cGovernment activities.\u201d Cf. United States v. Kamin, D.C.D.Mass.1956, 136 F.Supp. 791, 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-14\">According to the logic of appellee\u2019s view, the Committee would have authority, under its duty to study the \u201ceconomy and efficiency\u201d of \u201cthe operation of Government activities,\u201d to investigate all persons and companies subject to laws dealing with internal revenue, transportation, communications, banking, agriculture, shipping, subversive activities, immigration, health, international relations, etc., etc. This, for all practical purposes, would give the Committee on Government Operations jurisdiction to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>investigate virtually every activity engaged in by every person in the land. It would at least give the Committee a legislative oversight jurisdiction of the executive departments, not only overlapping in blanket fashion the other fifteen permanent Senate committees, but perhaps extending beyond them. While some unavoidable overlap might be viewed as within the contemplation of the Legislative\" Reorganization Act of 1946, we can hardly say the same for the vast overlap which inheres in the Committee\u2019s assertion of power here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">We therefore reverse the judgment of conviction and remand the case to the District Court with instructions to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1002-11\">. 60 Stat. 812 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1002-20\">. S.Rep. No. 1400, 79th Cong., 2d Sess. 2 (1946).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1002-22\">. Id. at 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">. 60 Stat. 816, emphasis supplied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1003-10\">. If union officials misuse union funds and file false reports, it is argued, the purposes of the Labor Management Relations Act are thwarted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1003-15\">. As the Government puts it: \u201cIf union oflicials misuse union funds, the union is not deserving of the bonanza of tax exemption, and the misused funds will certainly not be declared as individual taxable income by miscreant union officials.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1004-9\">. The Senate strongly indicated its belief that the Committee on Government Operations was without power to conduct the inquiry. When the question of this Committee\u2019s jurisdiction was raised before the Senate, it acted, on January 30, 1957, to create the Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field, authorized to investigate criminal and other improper activities in the labor or management field. S.Res. 74, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., Senator McClellan, Chairman of the Committee on Government Operations and Chairman of its Subcommittee on Investigations, was made Chairman of tho Select Committee. On February 15, 1957, appellant turned over the subpenaed records to the staff of the Select Committee and on March 15, 19, 20 and 21, 1957, he testified and answered questions before the Select Committee.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1004-6\">REED, Associate Justice, retired,</author>\n<p id=\"AVd\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">The power of Congress, through its committees to investigate the operation of Government activities, is unquestioned when the facts sought are to inform Congress with a view to legislation. Appellant's objection is that Congress had not authorized this committee to investigate the efficiency of the government processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">This is not a situation such as Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. 178, 77 S.Ct. 73 S.Ct. 543, 97 L.Ed. 770, where the of the investigation was not clear, nor of United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S. 41, 1173, 1 L.Ed.2d 1273, where the purpose meaning of the phrase \u201clobbying activities\u201d called for definition. Here the Committee had the duty of studying the efficiency of the operation of Government activities at all levels. In directing its investigation toward certain required reports of labor unions to the Government, it was within the scope of its authority. Legislation to protect union funds more fully might be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-11\">Congress alone has the authority to decide the scope of a committee\u2019s jurisdiction. It is only when the scope of the authority granted is uncertain or beyond constitutional power that the judiciary may intervene to protect a contumacious witness. It is conceded by the opinion that only a narrower resolution was required to call for replies to the questions asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-12\">Such judicial supervision of legislative procedure as this decision imposes is, in my opinion, not only <em>an </em>invasion of legislative prerogatives but hampers congressional investigations. Congress must empower its committees by general language to make needed investigations. The witness may be protected by questions narrowed so as fairly to inform him of the information desired. Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. 178, 215, 77 S.Ct. 1173, 1 L.Ed.2d 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-13\">I would affirm this conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
