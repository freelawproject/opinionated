In so finding Judge Dimock carefully analyzed the extensive evidence, including, <em>inter alia, </em>a considerable and rather steady work record of the deceased for the seven years between his discharge from the Army and his death in 1952. Judge Dimock\u2019s findings are far from clearly erroneous, and we are content to affirm on his careful opinion, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 161 F.Supp. 910.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
