We will set forth the facts in juxtaposition to the points under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Appellee, of course, asks us to affirm the order of certification. Initially, it wants us to overrule Barnard v. Schneider <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and to decide that the order of transfer is not subject to review as not a final order. This division of the court is not free to overrule so recent a decision as that in the Barnard case, for only by action of the entire court, sitting <em>en banc, </em>will such a step be taken. Appellee next claims that the record discloses a rational foundation for the conclusion of the trial judge, and accordingly, we must affirm his order as not arbitrary. To be sure, the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion normally will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is arbitrary, but it becomes arbitrary if that discretion has been exercised for an erroneous reason.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly we inquire into the basis for the order under attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">One Stein had sued Davis, a non-resident of the District, who operated a sightseeing business. Stein caused the Clerk of the District Court to issue an attachment before judgment in accordance with D.C.Code \u00a7 16-301 (1951),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> after filing an attachment bond for $8,-400 conditioned that if Stein \u201cand Peerless Insurance Company shall make good to the said [Davis] all costs and damages which he may sustain by reason of the wrongful suing out of said Attachment, then this obligation shall be void; otherwise the same shall be and remain in full force and virtue.\u201d After a trial, Stein\u2019s complaint was dismissed with prejudice, and a cross claim by Davis was dismissed \u201cwithout prejudice to the defendant to bring suit on the bond.\u201d The attachment upon Davis\u2019 bus and car having thereafter been released, Davis filed with the Peerless Insurance Company a demand which was rejected, whereupon Davis commenced this suit. His motion for summary judgment was denied after the trial judge concluded, as his memorandum discloses, that there is no remedy by statute for wrongful attachment in the District and that Davis must be relegated to a common law action in which Stein\u2019s malice and want of probable cause must be shown. On his own motion, the trial judge ordered the case transferred to the Municipal Court, \u201cit appearing to the court that the plaintiff\u2019s action will not justify a judgment in excess of $3,000 for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>the reasons stated in the Court\u2019s memorandum opinion of March 28, 1957.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AIT\">Appellant Davis, alleging no special damage except that his sightseeing bus and Cadillac limousine had been stored carelessly, claimed only that the property could be refurbished for use in his business at a cost of $900. While the complaint added that an itemized list of the damages sustained by Davis had been furnished to the surety, neither party has brought any such memorandum to this court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We cannot know what, if any, attention the judge paid to the items listed since he concluded that a possible recovery by Davis could be predicated only upon malice or want of probable cause in the procurement of the attachment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Appellant argues that he \u201cis entitled to judgment in the full penal sum upon breach of condition of the bond, subject to execution in the amount of damages; it simply limits the surety\u2019s liability to the penal sum.\u201d He claims that, without more, he is entitled to recover $8,400 to the payment of which the surety was bound by the terms of the attachment bond. He relies upon United States v. New Amsterdam Casualty Co.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There, however, the bond had run to the Government to require the payment of estimated duties on a cargo, and the statute expressly required that upon suit by the Government, judgment in its favor was to be entered unless the defendant in open court made oath as to and demonstrated error in the liquidation of the duties demanded upon the bond. In view of the statute, the court distinguished an action upon such a bond, \u201cfrom bonds given, with an arbitrary penal sum, to secure the performance of an undertaking, where the damages to the plaintiff may be, and generally are, much less than the penal sum of the bond.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">D.C.Code \u00a7 28-2401 (1951) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADz\">\u201cA bond, when required or referred to, in the provisions of this code, shall be understood to signify an obligation in a certain sum or penalty, <em>subject to a condition, </em>on breach of which it is to become absolute and <em>to be enforceable by action.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-14\">This action properly rests upon that section. The condition here was that the surety \u201cshall make good to the said defendant all costs and damages which he may sustain by reason of the wrongful suing out of said attachment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-15\">That Stein\u2019s failure of success resulted in a \u201cwrongful suing out of the attachment,\u201d as the term is used in our Code is not to be doubted. This result is not only recognized in practice over the years in the District of Columbia,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but Stein\u2019s case was fully tried on the merits with judgment adverse to the claims of the plaintiff-in-attachment. The court concluded that the contract and note in suit were illegal and contrary to public policy. That judgment established the wrongfulness of Stein\u2019s deprivation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>to Davis of the full use and enjoyment of his property under the attachment,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and even expressly reserved to Davis the right to pursue his remedy on the attachment bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"> While Davis may sue on the bond, he is quite in error in supposing he may automatically recover the full penal sum therein named.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He is limited to, and the surety is bound only to pay, such costs and damages as Davis can show were sustained because of the dentention of his property. Perhaps his itemized list of damages exhibited to the appellee already includes loss of business use of the vehicles, loss of profits, depreciation, and the like<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Perhaps he has shown a basis for a claim for attorney fees for procuring the return of the vehicles or of personal expenses attributable to the attachment.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The District Judge correctly observed that there had been set up no basis for punitive damages,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> but he erred in concluding that appellant had no statutory right of action, and hence was limited to such relief as might have been sought at common law for <em>mala fldes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Under the circumstances we will remand this case. We expect appellant will be permitted to amend his complaint to permit his going forward upon a basis consistent with this opinion. His complaint, so amended, may then be reconsidered by the District Judge who thus will have the opportunity to determine whether or not the damages claimed meet the jurisdictional requirement. If not, it may follow that certification to the Municipal Court is in order.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">Remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-16\">. D.C.Code \u00a7 11-750 (Supp. V 1956) provides for such a transfer from the District Court when \u201cit shall appear to the satisfaction of the court * * * <em>that </em>the action will not justify a judgment in excess of $3,000.\u201d After transfer, the jurisdiction of the Municipal Court extends \u201cto the amount claimed in such action, even though it exceed the sum of $3,000.\u201d Ibid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b637-28\">. Appellant also included in his claim a demand for $6,000, the penal sum in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>bond running to the marshal which the latter had demanded and received before attaching the property of the appellant. Peerless Insurance Company, appellee herein, had become surety on both bonds.

This section making provision for attachment before judgment requires that an attaching plaintiff must \u201cfirst file in the clerk\u2019s office a bond, executed by himself or his agent, with security to be approved by the clerk, in twice the amount of bis claim, conditioned to make good to tbe defendant all costs and damages which he may sustain by reason of the wrongful suing out of the attachment.\u201d When this legislation was first before the Senate in 1866, the debates brought out that the rule prevailing then in New England permitted an action to lie for wrongful attachment if the attaching plaintiff\u2019s purpose had been to oppress-the defendant \u201cfor injury and mischief, with malice.\u201d Senators were careful to insist that the security contemplated by the pending bill was to cover such damages as might be sustained by the defendant-in-attachment, quite apart fromi <em>mala fldes </em>of the plaintiff-in-attachment. See The Congressional Globe, April 2, 1866, pp. 1709 et seq. Attachment bonds are not to be confused with those coming within D.C.Code \u00a7 28-2403 (1951). Tri-State Motor Corporation v.

A defendant-in-attachment may obtain release of his property from the custody of the marshal upon compliance with D.C.Code \u00a7 16-311 (19551).
