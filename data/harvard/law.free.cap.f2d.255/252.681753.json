It therefore imposed a tax on such portion of the charges made by \u201csuch places\u201d which could fairly be attributable to an admission charge, regardless of the form in which the charge was made. Presently, this \u201cAdmissions Tax\u201d is imposed under the terms of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, \u00a7 4231(6) and \u00a7 4232(b), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 4231(6), 4232 (b). Both of these sections were taken intact from the Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1700(e), as amended. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1700(e) (1) provided in part, prior to its 1951 amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">\u201cA tax equivalent to 5 per cen-tum of all amounts paid for admission, refreshment, service, or merchandise, at any roof garden, cabaret, or other similar place furnishing a public performance for profit, by or for any patron or guest who is entitled to be present during any portion of such performance. The term \u2018roof garden, cabaret, or other similar place\u2019 shall include any room in any hotel, restaurant, hall, or other public place where music and dancing privileges or any other entertainment, except instrumental or mechanical music alone, are afforded the patrons in connection with the serving or selling of food, refreshment, or merchandise.\u201d 56 Stat. 981.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">A third sentence in \u00a7 1700(e) (1) was inserted by the Act of October 20, 1951 (65 Stat. 521, \u00a7 404(a), made effective as of 10:00 a. m. on November 1, 1951 by \u00a7 404(b), 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1700 note), reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">\u201cIn no case shall such term include any ballroom, dance hall, or other similar place where the serving or selling of food, refreshment, or merchandise is merely incidental, unless such place would be considered, without the application of the preceding sentence, as a \u2018roof garden, cabaret, or other similar place\u2019 * * <em>*\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-18\">The government understands this to mean that <em>after </em>November 1951, the merely incidental serving or selling of food, refreshment, or merchandise does not <em>in itself </em>create a \u201croof garden, cabaret, or other similar place\u201d subject to the Act, but that prior thereto <em>any </em>such serving or selling was sufficient. Taxpayer urges (a) that his sale of food, liquor and service was \u201cmerely incidental\u201d to his ballroom; (b) that his \u201cballroom\u201d was not a \u201ccabaret\u201d; and (c) that the effective date of the amendment of the Revenue Act of 1951 is not controlling because it was merely an enactment by Congress of an original continuing intent to exempt the merely incidental selling of food or services from the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-19\">The sole question here is whether appellant in his operations hereinafter described was subject to what all parties and the court below called \u201ccabaret taxes\u201d on sales of his food, liquor and hatcheck services.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-20\">Appellant had paid to the government the 20% admission tax required by Internal Revenue Code of 1954, \u00a7 4231(6) (formerly 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1700(e) (1)) on all admissions to the premises which he operated. No tax on admissions is here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-21\">Appellant operated at all times in question an establishment known as</p>\n<p id=\"b355-22\">\u201cRiverside Rancho,\u201d located at 3213 Riverside Drive, Los Angeles, California,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> constituting roughly one acre in area with two major buildings on it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Between December 1, 1949 and November 1, 1951, appellant paid under protest as \u201ccabaret taxes\u201d $19,590.93. He filed a written claim for a refund of such taxes on January 25, 1954, and on March 15, 1956, the government rejected such claim. Appellant thereafter filed suit for such taxes. Appellee, the United States, answered and filed a complaint in intervention for $4,450.00 allegedly due and unpaid for excise taxes incurred between October 1, 1950 and September 30, 1953 after crediting appellant with $880.49 previously paid upon such alleged obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Trial was had before the court below without a jury and resulted in a judgment for the government. The trial judge found (a) that appellant had not sustained \u201chis burden of proving that his establishment was not subject to said cabaret tax during the period herein involved\u201d (Finding VIII), and (b) that the government had sustained its burden of proof on its complaint in intervention for the additional cabaret tax (Finding X). A timely appeal was taken here. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Appellant insists that the first question to be answered is whether his ballroom was a \u201ccabaret.\u201d That is an oversimplification of the matter. The first question is whether his \u201cballroom\u201d (meaning the entire establishment to which admission was charged) was a \u201croof garden, cabaret, or other similar place.\u201d The second question, as we understand appellant\u2019s position, is whether the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (hereinafter Commissioner) is estopped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>from changing his interpretation of the law passed by the Congress which created the tax liability. The third: whether it was necessary <em>for the </em>Commissioner to publish in the Cumulative Bulletin issued by him any change in instructions to his Deputy Collectors to make them binding on taxpayers; and fourth: whether the trial court applied the correct law to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">We hold the trial court properly found that the taxpayer had not sustained the burden of proof placed upon him which would enable him to escape liability. We answer the second and third questions in the negative on the ground the Commissioner cannot be es-topped where his change of position corrects a mistake of law. (Automobile Club of Michigan v. Commissioner, 1957, 353 U.S. 180, 183, 77 S.Ct. 707, 1 L.Ed. 2d 746,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>) and we approve the legal conclusions reached by the trial court, as hereinafter appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Appellant bases his suit for refund (covering tax payments made by him under protest up to the November 1, 1951 addition of the \u201cmerely incidental\" clause in the Act) on the ground that the government had recognized the validity of the interpretation of the Act he urges here by issuing various rulings to the effect that establishments similar to his establishments were not cabarets. This was during the period from 1941 through March 1947. In approximately March of 1947, the Commissioner is charged with changing his interpretation of what constituted a \u201ccabaret\u201d and with seeking to collect a \u201ccabaret tax\u201d on all ballrooms and dance halls where food or refreshments were served.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-15\">This brought about various court reviews of the Commissioner\u2019s actions. One of the first was contested by the Avalon Amusement Corporation. Avalon Amusement Corp. v. United States, W.D. Wis., 1947, 73 F.Supp. 328.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant disagrees with the result reached in this decision, regretting that the full history of the Admissions Tax Act and the Commissioner\u2019s change of position was not before that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-16\">On appeal Avalon Amusement Corporation argued that the statutory definition \u201capplies to a situation in which a dancing privilege is a mere incident to the charge for food or refreshments.\u201d The court in affirming said: \u201cWith this we are unable to agree. * * * [The phrase] \u2018in connection with\u2019 * * * [as used in the Act] does not connote that those things connected are also in the relationship of primary and subsidiary.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-17\">In the next important case, Geer v. Birmingham, N.D.Iowa, 1950, 88 F. Supp. 189, the issue was the refund of \u201cballroom receipts\u201d for one day, December 9, 1948.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But other refunds were indirectly involved. The case was carefully tried, much evidence was introduced, and District Judge Graven wrote what\u201ewas later described as an \u201cexcellent and exhaustive opinion.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He examined the legislative history and the ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>ministrative background, including lengthy quotations from government regulations, and correspondence between the Commissioner and his Collectors. He commented on the inapplicability of the doctrine of estoppel against the Collector as a representative of the United States, on the rule of Congressional acquiescence, and the rules of statutory construction, <em>ejusdem generis, </em>and <em>noscitur a sociis. </em>He finally concluded that the Geers operated a ballroom and not a cabaret or roof garden, and hence that the tax was not due. Appellant here has re-argued many of the facts and even the exhibits of the Geer ease, as well as the legal principles involved therein, and cited other district court cases which on their facts held the establishment was not taxable. The difficulty with appellant\u2019s position here is (a) the case of Geer v. Birmingham, supra, was reversed by the Court of Appeals in Birmingham v. Geer, 8 Cir., 1950, 185 F.2d 82, and (b) we are here dealing with a ease on appeal wherein the controlling issues of fact have been decided adversely to appellant by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">The Eighth Circuit reversed the Geer case, first, because on the facts it was similar to the Avalon case, and \u201cuniformity of decision\u201d on similar facts should be preserved among the Circuits unless the decision \u201cis clearly wrong\u201d; and second, because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">\u201cDespite vigorous arguments to the contrary, it appears as clear to this court as it did to the court in the Seventh Circuit \u2018that the [taxpayer\u2019s] dance hall comes within the [statute\u2019s] definition of a \u201c * * * hall * * * where music and dancing privileges * * * are afforded the patrons in connection with the serving or selling of * * * refreshments.\u201d \u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">\u201cIn the Avalon case the taxpayer argued that the statutory definition applied to a situation in which a dancing privilege is a mere incident to the charge for food or refreshment * * * Here the taxpayer * * * [says] the definition applies to a situation where the right of patrons to dance is conditioned upon purchase of food or refreshments. * * * There is the same torturing of the plain meaning of the phrase to sustain that contention as the other.\u201d Id., at pages 85, 86.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">The Eighth Circuit then found the Seventh Circuit was <em>not </em>\u201cinsufficiently or wrongly advised\u201d with respect to interpretive regulation or legislative history; commented on the meaning and significance in the statute of the words \u201cor other similar place\u201d as alternative to, or additional to, the words \u201croof garden\u201d and \u201ccabaret\u201d; found that Congress \u201cnever treated dance halls or ballrooms as distinct subjects for excise tax and has never undertaken to define and classify them by name,\u201d but has \u201cconsistently lumped [them] together in the most general classification of unnamed \u2018places\u2019 to which admission was charged and taxed * * * \u201d, and reversed the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">After these cases, and as a result of them, and after hearings on the subject mentioned these cases by name, the 81st Congress recommended, and a subsequent Congress passed, an additional and third sentence to \u00a7 1700(e) (1), reading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-10\">\u201cIn no case shall such term [roof garden, cabaret, or other similar place] include any ballroom, dance hall, or other similar place where the serving or selling of food, refreshment, or merchandise is <em>merely incidental </em>* * * \u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">The evidence in this case indicates (Defendant\u2019s and Appellee\u2019s Exhibit A) that from December 1949 to November 1, 1951 the Admissions income to appellant\u2019s establishment was .5144% of total receipts; that food and beverage income was .4711% of total receipts and that food, beverage and check<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>room income was .4856% of total receipts. Can we say that as a matter of law almost 50% of the income from a business operation is \u201cmerely incidental\u201d? The mere asking of the question indicates that the answer must be \u201cno,\u201d and demonstrates that under the \u201cmerely incidental\u201d interpretation the facts of this case prevent any recovery by appellant, both as a matter of fact and as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">If we assume, therefore, that appellant\u2019s view is correct \u2014 that he did not below and does not now ask the Court to give retroactive effect to the change in language in Section 1700(e) (l)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u2014 but only asks the Court to hold that the amendment, though effective specifically by its terms as of 10:00 a. m. on November 1, 1951, was in reality merely declaratory of existing law (Jordan v. Roche, 1912, 228 U.S. 436, 33 S.Ct. 573, 57 L.Ed. 908; Commissioner v. Estate of Holmes, 1946, 326 U.S. 480, 66 S.Ct. 257, 90 L.Ed. 228), this still would not entitle taxpayer to recover, because of the factual evidence noted in the above paragraph, strongly overcoming the \u201cmerely incidental\u201d argument, and because even more fundamentally, the lower court impliedly found that appellant\u2019s establishment was \u201csimilar\u201d to a cabaret or roof garden. Both the rejection of the \u201cmerely incidental\u201d argument and the finding of similarity, or either of them, is supported by the record, and would be dispositive of this case adversely to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">We cannot hold clearly erroneous the District Court\u2019s finding that the taxpayer had failed to sustain his burden of proof that he was entitled to a refund from the government (Finding VIII), or the finding that the government had established its burden of proof that additional sums were due (Finding X).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b355-8\">. A Stipulation of Facts was introduced as Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 1. While oral testimony was produced on behalf of plaintiff, its content seems immaterial on this appeal, save as to the issue of estoppel, or its sought equivalent, on the part of the government, or as to the issue of appellant\u2019s good faith, which was not questioned by the government.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b355-23\">. \u201cRiverside Rancho\u201d had a frontage of approximately 170 feet on Riverside Drive, and a depth varying between approximately 100 and 125 feet with a 7 foot fence enclosing the whole area. Entry was made through a \u201cbox office\u201d or \u201cmain entrance\u201d (Ex. 1) or \u201cticket office\u201d (Ex. B). Directly inside the entrance was an open air patio and three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>separate buildings; a 9 foot by 24 foot milk bar slightly to the south; a two story building further south, 17 feet by 50 feet, combining a dining room and kitchen; and east of the patio, milk bar and dining room, was the largest building containing a 65 foot by 90 foot ballroom, a 15 foot by 30 foot checkroom, and an adjoining room about 20 feet by 65 feet containing a central double bar, 30 stools and 8 benches. The opening between the ballroom and the bar was 5 feet wide and \u201cnever closed by order of the City of Los Angeles Fire Department.\u201d Food was served in the dining room and there was a bar there serving and selling liquor and beer. Liquor and beer were sold and served in the bar adjoining the ballroom. Hot dogs, coffee and soda pop were sold and served at the milk bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Patrons were permitted to pass freely between the dance area, the bar, the dining room and the patio. No refreshments were allowed to be taken into the dance area and guards were stationed to enforce this regulation at each entrance. The ballroom and bar were operated only from 8:00 or 9:00 p.m. to 12:00 midnight or 1:30 a.m., while the dining room operated from 6:30 p.m. on. From 6 :30 p.m. until 8:00 p.m. a separate entrance on Riverside Drive was used to enter the restaurant. After 8:00 p.m. or 9:00 p.m. this entrance was closed and anyone wishing to go to the dining room had to pay an admission fee and enter by the main entrance. There were no free \u201cpass outs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">There were benches along the wall of ballroom, put no tables or chairs therein. A western dance orchestra supplied music in the ballroom. \u201cExcept for said orchestra, no dinner dance music, floor shows, or other entertainment was furnished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">Paragraphs XIII and XIV of the Stipulation raise some interesting but confusing questions \u2014 not here controlling. Cf. Hover v. United States, S.D. Cal.1958, 158 F.Supp. 179. These paragraphs, en toto, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-13\">\u201cXIII.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-14\">\u201cIt was not possible for the customers in the dining room, while in the dining room, to see or hear the music being played by the orchestra since the building housing the orchestra and the building housing the dining room were separated by approximately 100 feet as stated above. There was no dancing in the dining room, but a bar was located therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-15\">\u201cXIV.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-16\">\u201cThe patrons in the liquor bar could not see the orchestra while said patrons remained in said liquor bar area. Although the music being played by the orchestra in the dance area did drift through the 5 foot opening in the partition between the dance area and the liquor bar area, the patrons in the liquor bar area were not able to hear intelligible strains of music being played by the orchestra. There was no dancing allowed in the liquor bar area. The statements in this paragraph apply to the milk bar also, i.e., music could be heard but it was unintelligible, and no dancing was allowed in the milk bar area.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b357-7\">.
