These are fully described, with citations, in our latest decision, Rader v. Manufacturers Cas. Ins. Co. of Philadelphia, 2 Cir., 242 F.2d 419, of which, and the record on which it was based, we take judicial notice. There is no excuse for these many attempts to reopen issues thoroughly settled and now completely <em>res judicata,. </em>We modify the judgment to provide for dismissal of the complaint on the merits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
