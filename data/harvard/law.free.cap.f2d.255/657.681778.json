But he made no finding that \u201cthere is no just reason for delay\u201d or direction for the entry of judgment, as required by Fed. Rules Civ.Proc. rule 54(b), to provide an appealable judgment. Apparently he concluded that a full trial was desirable before a final judgment should be entered. Accordingly the appeal must be dismissed for lack of an appealable judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
