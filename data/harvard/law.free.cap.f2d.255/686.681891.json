Motions for a new trial and for judgment n. o. v. were denied. The defendant\u2019s principal complaint on this appeal is that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. The weight of the evidence was for the jury to determine, however, and we find no abuse of discretion on the part of the district court in refusing a new trial on this ground. The defendant also asserts that there were errors in the admission of evidence and in the charge to the jury. We have considered all these contentions but find them so insubstantial as not to require discussion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-33\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
