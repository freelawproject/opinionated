W. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>As she thereupon fell, she received injuries allegedly due to the negligence of the District of Columbia. She now complains that the trial judge erred in directing a defendant\u2019s verdict at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case. He ruled that the plaintiff\u2019s notice of her claim was inadequate as failing to comply with the requirements of D.C.Code \u00a7 12-208 (1951), but we decide otherwise in view of Stone v. District of Columbia, 1956, 99 U.S.App.D.C. 32, 237 F.2d 28, (en banc) certiorari denied 1956, 352 U.S. 934, 77 S.Ct. 221, 1 L.Ed.2d 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">It was also concluded that the plaintiff had failed to supply \u201cany proof of the alleged negligence.\u201d On this point we agree and will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The complaint had alleged that the District is charged by law with the maintenance of sidewalks, but the plaintiff was not on a sidewalk or crosswalk. It was also alleged that the District had negligently maintained the \u201cguttering\u201d and had created a dangerous condition, and that the plaintiff \u201cwas about to step onto the curb when as a result of the improper construction and/or maintenance of the curbing\u201d she fell into a storm \u00a1sewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The exhibits disclose an aperture, flush with the curbing, located some ten or twelve feet north of the crosswalk. The gutter is lined with inlaid bricks which are pitched at the mouth of the \u2022drain to divert water into a sump. The plaintiff and her sister, to like effect, \u25a0described the brick surface in front of the inset opening to the drain as \u201cslick,\u201d \u201cnot flat,\u201d \u201cslanted,\u201d \u201cstraight down.\u201d There was no foreign matter on the dry \u00a1surface. The sun was shining. It was .a bright summer afternoon. The plaintiff, wearing \u201cheels,\u201d was intent upon reaching a funeral parlor on the opposite \u2022side of the street. Having first stepped from the cab directly onto the curb, when \u25a0the cab drew away, she started. As she said, \u201cI just stepped off the curb and I .just slipped on under.\u201d She went back <em>\u25a0afterwards </em>to look at the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\"> We have carefully studied the transcript and the exhibits. There was offered no evidence of negligent construction or engineering defect or of faulty maintenance. Certainly there was no negligence as a matter of law, and it was the plaintiff\u2019s burden to establish that the District had somehow failed to perform a duty owed to her. There was a \u201ctotal lack of evidence showing negligence on the part of the District, sufficient to support a judgment in this case.\u201d District of Columbia v. Manning, 1927, 57 App.D.C. 156, 157, 18 F.2d 806, 807, 53 A.L.R. 167. We see only an unfortunate mishap wherein the plaintiff stepped off the curb into the gutter and fell while doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b644-10\">WASHINGTON, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A_e\">(dissenting) .</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s evidence showed that she stepped from the curb on to a brick gutter surface which was \u201cglazed,\u201d \u201cslick\u201d and \u201cslanted.\u201d She slipped down this slanted surface into a storm sewer opening under the adjacent curb. She went down the opening up to her armpits. Plaintiff is a married woman, and from the testimony is evidently a full-grown adult. The injuries suffered were serious. The danger to the public \u2014 and particularly to children \u2014 in permitting such a condition to exist would seem obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">The District of Columbia has the duty, as we said in Booth v. District of Columbia, 1956, 100 U.S.App.D.C. 32, 34, 241 F.2d 437, 439: \u201c \u2018to keep the streets in reasonably safe condition * * * whether a dangerous condition is the result of a general plan of improvement, or not. <em>The action is not for negligence because of a defective plan, but for maintaining the streets in an unsafe condition.\u2019 </em>(Emphasis supplied.),\u201d quoting from District of Columbia v. Caton, 1918, 48 App.D.C. 96, at page 107. In Caton, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>supra, the court illustrated this distinction as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-4\">\u201cFor example, a general plan for a sewer system may be adopted; but, in its construction, let us assume that the tops of the manholes in the street are sunk a foot below the surface of the pavement, creating a hole or depression, and as a result thereof a person sustains injury. The action would not be based upon a defective plan, or, technically speaking, upon the defective construction of the sewer, but upon the negligence of the municipal authorities in permitting a dangerous condition to exist in the street, as the result of defective construction. So, here, the question is whether the plan of construction followed, which wholly affected the condition of the surface of the street, coincided with the plan approved, and tended to make the street reasonably safe for travel. If so, the plan must be held to be a reasonable one, and the city would not be liable for injury occurring as a result of its adoption and installation. But if it left the street in a dangerous and unsafe condition, it could not be held to be a reasonable plan, when measured in the light of the paramount duty imposed, of keeping the streets at all times in a reasonably safe condition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Plaintiff introduced photographs from which a jury might find (1) that there was a steep incline or slope on the facing bricks of the catch basin, and (2) that the catch basin was within the area normally used as a crosswalk.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff\u2019s testimony, corroborated by that of her companion, was that, although there was no foreign matter on the surface of the brick facing of the catch basin, the surface of the bricks was \u201cglazed,\u201d \u201cslick,\u201d and \u201cstraight steep down.\u201d The photographs do not accord with the \u201cstraight steep down\u201d description, but they do show a not insignificant variation from the flat surface of the street. This showing, under the rationale of Caton, supra, should be sufficient to put the District to its proof. See Cellini v. Moss, 1956, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 114, 232 F.2d 371. Plaintiff introduced at least as much evidence as seems contemplated by the example quoted above from Cat\u00f3n.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">In addition, the condition here \u2014 a depression in a crosswalk \u2014 is analogous to an unevenness or irregularity in the-surface of a sidewalk. In the sidewalk cases, courts at first set up standards of unevenness in terms of inches: e.g., a bump less than one and one-half inches, high was, as a matter of law, not sufficient to impose liability on the city. In New York, formerly, a depression had to-be at least four inches to be actionable. But the recent trend and the better reasoned cases have abandoned such an arbitrary approach. Now the question of negligence does not depend upon the\u2019 application of a mathematical rule, but each case is to be determined by the jury, at least where fairminded men might, differ. See District of Columbia v. Williams, D.C.Mun.App.1946, 46 A.2d 111; Parker v. City and County of Denver, 1953, 128 Colo. 355, 262 P.2d 553, 37 A.L.R.2d 1177, and Annotation, 1954, 37 A.L.R.2d 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">I think the plaintiff here introduced sufficient evidence fairly to raise the-question for the jury whether the condition of the catch basin, under all the circumstances, created an unreasonable-risk of harm to this plaintiff. It was error, in my view, for the District Court to direct a verdict for the District at the-close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-10\">. Neither here nor in the District Court did the District contend that the point at which appellant fell was outside of the normal crosswalk area. There were no painted white lines at this intersection to indicate a crosswalk.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
