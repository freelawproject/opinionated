The appellee has not moved to dismiss the appeal, but instead has submitted a careful and thorough brief on the merits answering each point raised in the motion for new trial or, so far as is apparent, presented by the record. Upon consideration, we find no merits in any of said points and no error apparent in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-26\">The judgments are therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b729-27\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
