It was the plaintiff\u2019s contention that this should have been asserted as a compulsory counter-claim in the present action in the district court. When the appeal was called for argument it was stated at the bar of this court that the action in the state court had terminated in a decision by a board of arbitrators in favor of the present plaintiff (defendant in that action) and that no appeal would be taken. It follows that this appeal is now moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-19\">The appeal will accordingly be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
