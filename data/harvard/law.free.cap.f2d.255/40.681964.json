The district court\u2019s order of dismissal was based upon the grounds that the action was barred by the exclusive remedy provision of the Michigan Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, Comp.Laws 1948, \u00a7 411.1 et seq., and, further, that the action was foreclosed by a prior adjudication of the same claim by a Michigan court.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-12\">It appears that decedent was an employee of the defendant at the time of the accident resulting in his death and the accident occurred during working hours on the employer\u2019s property. It is uncon-troverted that decedent\u2019s mother applied for and received a compensation award as a dependent of the decedent, and no attack is made upon the regularity of that proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">On this appeal it is contended that because the complaint alleged gross or \u201cdeliberate\u201d negligence on the part of the defendant employer, the exclusive remedy provision of the Michigan Act is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-15\">The district court was not in error in dismissing the action. The Michigan statute is clear and unambiguous. \u201cWhere the conditions of liability under this act exist, the right to the recovery of compensation benefits, as herein provided, shall be the exclusive remedy against the employer.\u201d 12 Mich.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 17.144, Comp.Laws 1948, \u00a7 411.4. The statute does not differentiate among the common law actions which were previously available. An allegation of wilful and wanton conduct by the employer stands no differently if the other requirements of the Act are present. See Cell v. Yale &amp; Towne Mfg. Co., 1937, 281 Mich. 564, 567, 275 N.W. 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-16\">Moreover, the acceptance of benefits under the Act by decedent\u2019s mother, in the absence of fraud, operated as a complete release to the defendant \u201cof all claims or demands at law, if any, arising from such injury.\u201d 12 Mich.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 17.212, Comp.Laws 1948, \u00a7 416.1. Any law actions which might otherwise remain unaffected by \u00a7 17.144 are cut off by this section. Demkiw v. Briggs Mfg. Co., 1956, 347 Mich. 492, 79 N.W.2d 876; Twork v. Munising Paper Co., 1936, 275 Mich. 174, 266 N.W. 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-17\">The order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
