In this court opposer\u2019s counsel appeared and argued the case but applicant submitted on brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>The facts shown by the record are not in dispute and the principal facts are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">Opposer is a well-known manufacturer of waxes and polishes. One of its major products is, to quote the actual label, \u201cJohnson\u2019s Glo-Coat A Self Polishing Wax for Floors.\u201d Sales of this product since 1932 have exceeded $158,000,000 and advertising expenditures therefor during the same period exceeded $22,-000,000. As the Assistant Commissioner held, \u201cThere is no doubt but that opposer has wide consumer acceptance of its \u201cGlo-Coat\u201d polish, and it enjoys a valuable goodwill symbolized by the mark.\u201d The record does not show that \u201cGlo-Coat\u201d is applied to any product other than the self-polishing liquid floor wax. Opposer also has a registration, No. 544,990, for \u201cOrange Glo,\u201d said to be for a colored wax emulsion for coating vegetables. This registration is not pleaded in the notice of opposition but was introduced in evidence during the taking of testimony, as an exhibit. Opposer has also sold over $1,300,000 worth of sugar cane wax in bulk since 1947 for the fruit coating emulsion business and various industrial uses, but these sales in recent years appear to have been made through another corporation. For a short time during the later part of World War II opposer made and sold candles to the Quartermaster Corps but this business stopped with the cessation of hostilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-6\">We regard opposer\u2019s brief entry into the candle business during the war as of no significance here. There is no showing that any trademark was used in conjunction with such sales and the sales themselves ceased long ago. The public would not be led thereby to associate opposer with either candles or candle wax.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-7\">We are of the same mind as to op-poser\u2019s bulk wax sales. The record does not clearly show that any bulk wax sales were made by opposer for use in candle manufacture though it is possible some bulk wax it has sold <em>could </em>be used for that purpose. In any case, bulk wax sales were not shown to have been made under any trademark and their only possible significance is that they were made by the company that owns the Glo-Coat trademark. Under the circumstances of this case we do not feel that this is a very significant factor on the main issue of likelihood of confusion as between the marks involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-9\">The \u201cOrange-Glo\u201d mark, as we have said, was not pleaded as a ground of opposition, and, while one witness said it is a mark still in use, no evidence was given as to the extent of its use. It is not mentioned in either of the opinions below and the opposer has very little to say about it here. Every time it is mentioned in appellant\u2019s brief, the use of this mark is referred to in the past tense and it has not been alleged that there is any likelihood of confusion by reason of concurrent use of \u201cGlo-Candle\u201d and \u201cOrange-Glo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-10\">It is apparent that when the issue is cleared of irrelevancies, it comes down to the question of whether opposer\u2019s use of \u201cGlo-Coat\u201d has been such as to make it likely that purchasers and prospective purchasers of \u201cGlo-Candle Wax\u201d will be deceived or confused into thinking that the source of the latter merchandise is the same as that of \u201cGlo-Coat\u201d floor wax. After thoughtful consideration of the record, briefs and the opposer\u2019s oral argument, we find ourselves in complete accord with the conclusions of the Assistant Commissioner which are all contained in the following paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AITp\">\u201cThe sole question, then, is whether or not purchasers familiar with \u2018Glo-Coat\u2019 liquid polish are likely, upon seeing \u2018Glo-Candle\u2019 candle wax, to associate it with opposer\u2019s product or with opposer and assume that it originates with the producer of \u2018Glo-Coat\u2019 liquid polish. This question involves an evaluation of the probable psychological reaction in the minds of such purchasers when they see the marks on the goods. \u2018Glo-Coat\u2019 on liquid polish is likely to stimulate an association with a coating which imparts a shine. \u2018Glo-Candle\u2019 on candle wax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>is likely to stimulate an association with incandescence. This is to say that although each of the marks embodies the common word \u2018Glo\u2019 (a mispelling of \u2018glow\u2019) the prefix portion of the marks, when combined with the respective suffixes and applied to the respective products, creates a quite different impression. Under these circumstances, it is not believed that purchasers are likely to associate \u2018Glo-Candle\u2019 candle wax either with opposer\u2019s product or its producer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">We are,\u2019 further, in agreement with the conclusion of the Examiner of Interferences that the. cumulative effect of the differences between the goods and the differences between the marks obviates any reasonable likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">Appellant\u2019s major attack on the Assistant Commissioner\u2019s reasoning is that she applied an erroneous test in considering \u201cconfusion as to <em>goods </em>rather than <em>source of origin </em>of the goods.\u201d In view of her express statement, above quoted, that the question is whether purchasers might assume that \u201cGlo-Candle\u201d candle wax \u201coriginates with the producer of \u2018Glo-Coat\u2019 liquid polish,\u201d the alleged error of the Assistant Commissioner appears to be based on a misreading of her opinion. She was clearly passing on likelihood of confusion as to source <em>or </em>origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">To add our own reaction to appellee\u2019s mark as shown in the specimen attached to its application, the impression we get from it is that the product is wax for making glo-candles, whatever they are. On the other hand the impression we get from the \u201cGlo-Coat\u201d labels is evidence is that \u201cGlo-Coat\u201d is <em>one </em>of the several wax products of S. C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc. The by-line \u201cmade by the makers of Johnson\u2019s Wax\u201d enhances this reaction. This company has created for itself and its wax by advertising such notoriety that \u201cGlo-Coat\u201d does not create the impression of a trademark for wax products generally (and it surely is not such a markl but rathe.r that the makers of Johnson\u2019s wax have brought forth a specific product called \u201cGlo-Coat.\u201d The result is that even though this trademark is representative of a valuable goodwill for the product to which it is applied, and specifically for Johnson its maker, it is not such a mark as would cause any wax product sold under any mark including the word \u201cglow\u201d or its phonetic equivalents to be associated in the public mind with the opposer. In spite of the ingenious forensic efforts to bring bulk wax and candles into association with the trademark \u201cGlo-Coat,\u201d in our opinion no such association exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-10\">WORLEY, Judge, concurs in result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-11\">JACKSON, Judge, retired, recalled to participate, was present at the argument of this appeal, but did not participate in the decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1044-15\">.
