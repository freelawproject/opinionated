Numerous federal decisions have held that, in the absence of a showing of the timely filing of a claim for refund, the courts are compelled to dismiss suits for refund for lack of jurisdiction. See Dysart v. United States, 8 Cir., 95 F.2d 652, 654, certiorari denied 305 U.S. 608, 59 S.Ct. 67, 83 L.Ed, 386; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Fawcett v. United States, 9 Cir., 164 F.2d 696, affirming D.C.N.D.Cal., 70 F.Supp. 742, 743. Section 910, Internal Revenue Code of 1939 [58 Stat. 138; 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 910]; provides a limitation period of three years from payment of the tax for the refunding of taxes imposed by the applicable sub-chapter and alleged to have been erroneously assessed or collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">We are of opinion that the judgment of the district court was correct and should, accordingly, be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
