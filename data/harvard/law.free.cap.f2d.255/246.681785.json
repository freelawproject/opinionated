The appellant was a mechanic employed by CoitChevrolet Company of St. Joseph, Louisiana. Needing adjustment of the diesel engine of a grader and bulldozer, the appellees requested appellant\u2019s employer to send a man to do the work. The appellant was sent. While working on the equipment the appellant was injured. He sued the appellees claiming his in-\u2019 juries were caused by the negligence of an employee of the appellees and asking' for damages exceeding $100,000. The\u2019 district court, by implication, held that-the repair of their farm equipment was a part of and incidental to the trade, business or occupation of the appellees! and that appellant\u2019s sole remedy was under the Louisiana Compensation Act, and a summary judgment for the appellees was granted and from it an appeal was taken. The precedents are cited in Leslie v. Cities Service Refining Corporation, 5 Cir., 252 F.2d 902, decided March 4, 1958, and need not be here repeated. They sustain the judgment. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b348-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
