Defendants, as their primary position, argue that, since the court refused the plaintiff certain of the commissions he sought, it was creating a new and impermissible contract for the parties. This would appear to be a rather perfect example of a <em>non sequitur. </em>The other points, that an accord and satisfaction resulted from the plaintiff\u2019s retention under protest of defendants\u2019 uncashed checks and that in any event no award of interest should have been made on the amount represented by these checks, are likewise without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
