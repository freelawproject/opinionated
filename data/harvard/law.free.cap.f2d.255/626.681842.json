Appellant brought in the Drainage District by a cross-complaint asserting that under the license agreement by which the District obtained the right to build the culverts it had agreed to indemnify the railroad against any loss or damage arising from the presence of the culverts under the. tracks. The trial court dismissed the cross complaint and after judgment was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>entered for the plaintiff against appellant, the latter filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">There is thus presented for our consideration the correctness of the trial judge\u2019s determination that the indemnity agreement was void as being against the public policy of the State of Florida. This is the question presented in the companion case and which on rehearing we have decided in favor of the Drainage District. It follows therefore that the cross claim of the appellant against the Drainage District does not assert facts on which relief could be granted and the trial court did not err in dismissing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b729-6\">JOHN R. BROWN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A08\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">I am in full agreement with the Court that this presents the same issues as in Seaboard Air Line Railroad Co. v. Sarasota-Fruitville Drainage District, 5 Cir., 251 F.2d 583, reversed on rehearing, 5 Cir., 255 F.2d 622. I agree there is no valid distinction between the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">But for the reasons set forth in my dissent on rehearing, I respectfully dissent here as well.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
