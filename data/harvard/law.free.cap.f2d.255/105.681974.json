Subsequently the court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial, holding that the evidence failed to establish negligence on the part of the defendant. We have examined the evidence and are not able to say that either of these rulings is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-19\">The judgment of the district court will accordingly be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
