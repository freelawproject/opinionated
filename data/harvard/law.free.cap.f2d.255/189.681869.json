We therefore remanded the case \u201cto afford the parties an opportunity to litigate that issue * *</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">Pursuant to the remand, a jury trial was had at which cross-motions for directed verdicts were filed at the conclusion of the evidence. The District Court granted the motion of the United States. We think the record fully supports this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-12\">.
