Section 2255, Title 28, U.S.C.A., expressly provides that there is no necessity for a hearing or for the making of findings of fact and conclusions of law on the issues presented, where the motion to vacate or correct sentence upon its face and the files and records in the case show conclusively that the prisoner is entitled to no relief. See Schumpert v. United States, 6 Cir., 1955, 226 F.2d 578; Brown v. United States, 6 Cir., 1954, 212 F.2d 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-39\">Accordingly, the order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
