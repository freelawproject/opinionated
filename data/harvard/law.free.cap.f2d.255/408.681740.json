Applicant alleges use since January 10, 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-22\">Neither party took testimony, opposer has submitted on brief and the applicant has filed none.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-23\">In affirming the examiner, the Commissioner was of the opinion that \u201clikelihood of confusion must be determined by considering the commercial impressions created by the marks in their entirety and not by dissecting the marks and comparing portions thereof. The marks \u2018The Bridal Pair\u2019 and \u2018Bride\u2019s Pride\u2019 do not look alike or sound alike, nor do they stimulate the same mental association or impressions. Under such circumstances, there is no likelihood of confusion or mistake of purchasers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-24\">Appellant-opposer\u2019s. brief sets forth a hypothetical situation wherein a fianc\u00e9 first buys an engagement or wedding ring, and then, some time later, is allegedly confused as to trademarks when he purchases earrings, anklets, etc. The brief also cites a number of cases in which the court held marks entirely different from those here considered, to be confusingly similar. We have repeatedly held that past decisions on confusing similarity are of little assistance in new fact situations wherein entirely different marks and products are involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-25\">Trademarks must be considered in their entireties. While it is true in the instant case that both marks contain the implication of a \u201cbride\u201d and that the second words both begin with \u201cP,\u201d we believe that the involved marks are so different in sound, appearance and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>meaning that their concurrent use is not likely to confuse or deceive.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Therefore, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
