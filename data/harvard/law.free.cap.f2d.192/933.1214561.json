I think it was right for an additional reason, not therein stated, which is that \u00a7 1001 of 18 U.S.C. became effective September 1, 1948, as of which date Title 18 was \u201cenacted into positive law\u201d by chapter 645 of the Laws of the 80th Congress, 2nd Session, approved June 25, 1948. It is inconceivable to me that this section could be deemed \u201crepealed\u201d by any section of the Internal Revenue Code which was enacted February 10, 1939.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-35\">As I think the question discussed in Judge Denman\u2019s order is not a substantial one which should be determined by this court, and as I observe no other substantial question in the case, I think bail must he denied.</p>\n<author id=\"b989-36\">ORR, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b989-37\">I join in the order for the reasons stated by Judge POPE in his concurrence.</p>\n<author id=\"b989-38\">STEPHENS, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b989-39\">I join in the order on the showing made by the very limited portion of the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>presented to us. I do not, by joining in the order, foreclose my taking a different view when the whole record is here.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
