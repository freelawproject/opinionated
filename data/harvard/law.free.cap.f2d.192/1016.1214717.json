The July order dismissed a complaint which sought to collect on certain \u201cAgeco\u201d securities which had been denied participation in, the plan of reorganization confirmed in 1945 and consummated in 1946.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The February order denied a motion of January 15, 1951 to&gt; vacate the July order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-22\">The appeal from the order of July 21, 1950 dismissing the complaint must be dismissed for-lack of jurisdiction to review it. It was taken too late. Rule 73(a), F.R.C.P. 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-23\">The notice of motion denied by the order of February 10, 1951 was an effort to obtain a reconsideration of the July order, and was also too late. Such, a motion must be served not later than ten days after entry of the judgment. Rule 59(b), F.R. C.P. Assuming that the denial of such a motion is appealable, the order denying it was correct and should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-24\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1072-15\">.
