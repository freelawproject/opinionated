Upon consideration of the record we find the evidence sufficient to support the verdict. It was not legally required that the evidence show that each defendant actively participated in each illegal transaction when the evidence was sufficient to authorize the jury\u2019s finding that the convicted defendants were in agreement to violate the .Internal Revenue Laws as charged. Under the facts, it was for the jury to determine the weight to be accorded the pertinent circumstances in proof.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Government was not required to prove that each defendant had knowledge of each detail of each illegal transaction or that each defendant participated therein.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>sustain<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the appellants\u2019 contention that the evidence, \u201cat best, tended to show a series of disconnected conspiracies in that there was proof of crimes committed by one or more of the defendants wholly apart and without relation to each other. There was no common thread of evidence which furnished an overall tie-in of the various defendants with each other in the commission of the acts charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The judgments of the trial Court are Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b445-17\">.
