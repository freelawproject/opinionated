HAND, CHASE and WOODBURY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b364-23\">WOODBURY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b364-24\">The United States of America filed a libel of information in the court below under \u00a7 304(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 52 Stat. 1044, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 334(a), seeking the seizure and condemnation of certain phonograph records, and various accompanying items of printed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>graphic matter, all of which were moving \u2022or had moved in interstate commerce. The phonograph records are entitled in part \u201cTime To Sleep,\u201d and their accompanying literature consists of (1) an album in part entitled, \u201cDe Luxe Records Presents Time To Sleep a Tested Method of Induciug Sleep Conceived and Transcribed by Ralph Slater,\u201d (2) a leaflet in part reading: \u201cSleep With This Amazing Record \u2018Time To Sleep,\u2019 \u201d (3) a certificate entitled \u201cSleep Guaranteed,\u201d (4) display cards entitled \u201cDe Luxe Records Presents Time To Sleep,\u201d and (5) a poster headed \u201cA \u2018Dream Girl\u2019 Shows a New Way to Dreamland.\u201d The court below after full hearing without a jury filed a memorandum opinion in accordance with which it entered a final decree ordering the libel dismissed and the libeled property returned to Ralph Slater, the claimant. The United States thereupon took this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Two questions are presented. The first is whether a phonograph record is a \u201cdevice\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 201(h) of the Act. 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 321(h). The second question, which arises only if the first is answered in the affirmative, is whether the records in question are misbranded within the meaning of \u00a7 502(a) id. 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 352(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Section 201(h) of the Act under consideration provides in material part that \u201cThe term \u2018device\u2019 * * * means instruments, apparatus, and contrivances, including their components, parts, and accessories, intended (1) for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals; or (2) to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Certainly a phonograph record, if not itself an instrument or an apparatus, is a contrivance. And moreover, it is without question a component, part or accessory of a phonograph, or like record playing machine, which in its turn is without any doubt at all an instrument, apparatus or contrivance. The real question therefore is whether the libeled records were intended for either of the uses described in (1) or (2) of \u2022\u00a7 201(h), supra. Obviously the records were intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment or perhaps prevention of insomnia. But the medical experts who testified at the trial were agreed that insomnia is not a disease, but is a symptom of a disease, usually although not necessarily a neurological one, or of an emotional disturbance of some kind. Thus it may be argued that the records do not fall within the coverage of (1) above.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">However, all the expert witnesses who testified on the point were unanimous that sleep is a function of the body, or body and mind, of man and other animals, and this testimony brings the records within the terms of (2), supra, for their intended use was to affect that function, <em>i. e. </em>to induce sleep in those who needed it but had difficulty in obtaining enough. Without further laboring the point it will suffice to say that the records involved are \u201cdevices\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 201(h) (2) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">The question therefore arises whether the records are misbranded within the meaning of \u00a7 502(a) of the Act in that their labeling, which term includes not only the actual labels on the records and their containers or wrappers, but also any other written, printed, or graphic matter accompanying them (\u00a7 201 (m) id.), \u201cis false or misleading in any particular.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">The sounds produced by the record when played upon any standard phonograph or record player are the voice of Ralph Slater, the claimant, superimposed upon faint background music. On the side of the record intended to be played first the claimant explains how the record is to be used, in the course of which he says: \u201cYou may not be able to teach yourself to sleep, yet listening to me and believing as you must believe, that I can help you, malees insomnia a thing of the past.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-13\">The statements on the album stress Slater\u2019s \u201cuncanny\u201d and \u201cphenomenal\u201d power to induce sleep by suggestion, even though not personally present, his long and arduous training, and the fact that his method is well tested and efficacious \u201cin the treatment of unusual, difficult psychoneurotic cases.\u201d In the leaflet it is stated, among other things, that \u201cMr. Slater, who has put people to sleep on the stage, and by various powers of remote contact, has translated his power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>into this record which will he invaluable to everyone who suffers from insomnia.\u201d The certificate guarantees that the record \u201cwill induce blissful sleep in the most delightful manner,\u201d and the display card and poster, although they seem innocuous enough considered separately and apart from their context, convey the same impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Reading the foregoing labeling together, in the way it would be read by persons who might be sufficiently interested to read it at all, conveys the impression that the record is a cure-all for insomnia from whatever cause, or at least is an adequate substitute for medication.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This is not only misleading but also false for the evidence clearly establishes that the record can not possibly do as much. Indeed the expert witnesses called by the Government, who had made actual tests of the record on persons suffering from insomnia, testified unanimously that it proved wholly ineffectual, and one of them went even further and said that it might in some cases be actually harmful in that a person might resort to it for trial and in so doing postpone medical care and treatment for the cause of the insomnia from which he suffered. And the medical experts called by the claimant did not flatly contradict the Government\u2019s evidence. Although they said that in their opinion based upon hearing the record a few times (they had not conducted actual tests) it might prove helpful in certain cases of insomnia, they freely admitted on cross-examination that some of the statements dn the labeling were \"extravagant.\u201d For instance they would by no means go so far as to say, indeed they denied, that the record \u201cmakes insomnia a thing of the past,\u201d or that it would be \u201cinvaluable to everyone who suffers from insomnia.\u201d Thus it cannot be said that the labeling of the record is not \u201cfalse or misleading in any particular\u201d and from this it follows that the record is misbranded within the meaning of \u00a7 502(a) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The decree of the District Court is vacated and set aside and the case is remanded to that Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b366-17\">. Indeed on the inside of the front cover of the album the statement is made in a testimonial that Slater\u2019s \u201caim is to discourage the fad for sleeping pills.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
