HAND, CHASE and CLARK, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b928-23\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b928-24\">Remington Products Corporation, hereinafter called Remington, organized under the laws of New Jersey, and American <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>Aerovap, Inc., a New York corporation, to be called Aerovap, both manufacture and sell in interstate commerce an insecticide vaporizer for the control of insects within enclosed spaces. Aerovap owns Design Patent No. 158,552 for a \u201cCombined Wall Bracket and Vaporizer Casing,\u201d Patent No. 2,540,095 for a \u201cVaporizer Dispenser\u201d and Patent No. 2,541,637 for a \u201cMethod of Vaporizing Lindane in Ventilated Rooms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\">Alleging that Aerovap had groundlessly accused Remington and its distributors of infringing the above patents and was thereby trying to intimidate them and drive them out of business as well as to induce, certain of their key employees and agents to leave their employ, Remington and Electro-Vap Corporation, a Florida corporation which is Remington\u2019s Florida distributor, brought this suit against Aerovap for a declaratory judgment holding the above patents invalid or not infringed and to recover damages for unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Shortly thereafter Aerovap sued the plaintiff Electro-Vap Corporation, The Por-bur Corporation, a Florida corporation which is a user of the Remington vaporizer there, and two other Florida users of the Remington product, in the District Court for the Southern District of Florida for infringement of Patent No. 2,541,637. Por-bur Corporation became a party plaintiff in the New York action after the Florida action was begun.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Aerovap\u2019s motion for a summary judgment in the court below having been denied, the court enjoined it, and those in privity with it, from prosecuting the Florida suit until final judgment in the New York action, and from representing in any way that the Remington vaporizer is \u201cnot reliable or is unsafe.\u201d Restraint from threatening customers or prospective customers of Remington and its distributors with suits for infringement of the above patents, and from asserting that, \u201cInsect control by the revolutionary Aerovap method with complete safety to employees, visitors and guests can be obtained only by use of the genuine Aerovap\u201d was denied. An appeal from the injunction order was taken by both sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\"> On the record below we find no error. It is apparent that there is an actual controversy between the parties at least as to the validity and infringement of Patent No. 2,541,637. In the New York suit the parties include the manufacturer, a distributor and a user of the Remington vaporizer. All the issues are, or can be, there joined and the balance of convenience appears to be in favor of that action. Moreover, it was the first suit brought, and absent the showing of balance of convenience in favor of the second action, it should have priority. Hammett v. Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc., 2 Cir., 176 F.2d 145; Kerotest Mfg. Co. v. C-O-Two Fire Equipment Co., 3 Cir., 189 F.2d 31; Crosley Corp. v. Hazeltine Corp., 3 Cir., 122 F.2d 925.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">Nor was there any abuse of discretion in preventing, pending the trial, the disparagement of the Remington vaporizer as unreliable or dangerous to use.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">The plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the denial of its motion to enjoin infringement notices is also without merit, Kaplan v. Helenhart Novelty Corp., 2 Cir., 182 F.2d 311, as is the appeal from the refusal to enjoin the other allegedly disparaging statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
