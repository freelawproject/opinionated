G. Floe, as Administrator of the estate of Sarah Grady Theriault, deceased, brought a civil action to recover damages, for the sole benefit of William Theriault, husband of deceased under South Carolina Code of Laws 1942, Sections 411 \u2014 412, for the alleged wrongful death of Sarah Ther-iault, who was killed in a collision between the automobile in which she was riding and a pick-up truck, driven by the defendant, Plowden. The jury returned a verdict for defendant and plaintiff has appealed to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The only question before us is whether there was sufficient evidence to justify the District Judge in submitting to the jury the question of whether deceased and Grady, her brother and the only other occupant of the Theriault car, were engaged in a joint or common enterprise.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We think this question must be answered in the affirmative and the judgment below affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">The law of South Carolina, which is here controlling, seems to follow the law as it is generally applied. Apposite cases are Padgett v. Southern Railway Co., 219 S.C. 353, 65 S.E.2d 297; Neese v. Toms, 196 S.C. 67, 12 S.E.2d 859, 863; Long v. Carolina Baking Co., 190 S.C. 367, 3 S.E.2d 46; Funderburk v. Powell, 181 S.C. 412, 187 S.E. 742; Langley v. Southern Railway Co., 113 S.C. 45, 101 S.E. 286, 289. See, also, Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. McNulty, 8 Cir., 285 F. 97, 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">Mr. and Mrs. William Theriault lived just outside of the City of Charleston, where Mr. Theriault was employed. Some time before the fatal accident, Charles Grady, Mrs. Theriault\u2019s brother, who had previously lived at Woonsocket, Rhode Island, came to Charleston and at the time of the accident was living with the Ther-iaults. Grady had been out of work for some time and the main purpose of his coming to Charleston was to attempt to obtain employment in that locality. On August 16, 1950, Mrs. Theriault and Grady decided to go to Moncks Corner, about 30 miles North of \u00a1Charleston, to see whether work could be obtained for Grady with the Berkshire Worsted organization. The trip was made in the Theriault Buick, and the fatal accident occurred on the return from Moncks Corner to Charleston.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">Grady, who was severely injured in the collision, testified by deposition. From his evidence, which was quite hazy and inconclusive, we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-14\">\u201cQ. Now then, did you have occasion on August 16, 1950, to take any trip out of the City of Charleston? A. Yes, sir, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-15\">\u201cQ. Where did you go ? A. I went to Moncks Corner, I believe that is the name of the place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-16\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Well, now, after you left Moncks Corner, you then went in a generally Southern direction towards Charleston? A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-17\">\u201cQ. Dp you know the route number that you took going there? A. I haven\u2019t the slightest idea what it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-18\">\u201cQ. Well, it was the main highway between Charleston and Moncks Corner, was it not? A. I imagine so; I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-19\">\u201cQ. You are not particularly familiar with those roads there, - are you, Mr. Grady? A. Not at all. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-20\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-21\">\u201cQ. What means of transportation did you use? A. Automobile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-22\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Whose automobile was it? A. My sister and her husband\u2019s car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-23\">\u201cQ. Do you know which one had title to the car? A. I imagine it was in \u00a1his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>name, that is the way we usually do those things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">\u201cQ. Did you go in the automobile alone to Moncks Corner or was anyone with You? A. My sister was with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">\u201cQ. Just the two of you? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">\u201cQ. And you two went from Charleston to Moncks Comer? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">* * * * <em>*i</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Who was driving at the time of the accident? A. I think I was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">\u201cQ. Don\u2019t you know whether you were or not? A. Frankly, I do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-11\">\u201cQ. You don\u2019t know whether you were driving? A. I can\u2019t say for sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-12\">\u201cQ. You are not sure? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-13\">\u201cQ. It may be that your sister was driving insofar as you know? A. She could have been, though I question it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-14\">\u201cQ. But you are not prepared to say at this moment whether you were driving or your sister at the time of the accident? A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-15\">\u201cQ. Well, certainly one or the other was driving? A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-16\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-17\">\u201cQ. And were you a licensed driver in Rhode Island at the time this accident happened? A. My Rhode Island license had expired at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-18\">\u201cQ. Do you have any license permitting you to drive, from any other State? A. Not at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-19\">\u201cQ. You were not licensed in South Carolina, certainly? A. No, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-20\">We quote from the testimony of William Theriault:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-21\">\u201cQ. Mr. Theriault, you say that the car was registered in your name? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-22\">\u201cQ. How long had you had it? A, About a year, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-23\">\u201cQ. And you had bought it here in Charleston? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-24\">\u201cQ. Did you buy it new or secondhand? A. Secondhand, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-25\">\u201cQ. And did you pay for it, or did your wife pay for it, or did both of you pay for it? A. I paid for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-26\">\u201cQ. And did she drive it regularly? A. She didn\u2019t drive it, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-27\">\u201cQ. Not at all ? A. I drove it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-28\">\u201cQ. Well, did she ever drive it? A. Once in a while.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-29\">\u201cQ. You didn\u2019t use it to go to work in, did you? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-30\">\u201cQ. You walked to work, didn\u2019t you? A. Most of the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-31\">\u201cQ. And when you were at work, she had the right to drive the car, didn\u2019t she? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-32\">\u201cQ. What? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-33\">\u201cQ. You prohibited her from driving the car? A. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-34\">\u201cQ. You did? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-35\">\u201cQ. And you let Mr. Grady drive it though? A. That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-36\">\u201cQ. Did you know Mr. Grady didn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license ? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-37\">\u201cQ. You didn\u2019t find out from him before you let him drive the car, although you prohibited your wife from driving it? A. That\u2019s right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-38\">Theriault\u2019s evidence that he did not know that Grady had no driver\u2019s license is contradicted by. Sheriff Hill who stated concerning an interview with Theriault shortly after the accident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-39\">\u201cQ. Did he (Theriault) tell you whether or not his brother-in-law was supposed to drive an automobile? A. He asked me could I tell who was driving, and I .told him from what I saw in finding the lady in the car as I did, that whoever was with her was driving. And he said, well the man didn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license and he would have thought his wife would have been driving. He was sure he didn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-40\">\u201cQ. He thought his wife would be driving? A. He seemed to be under the impression that his wife was doing the driving because his brother-in-law, or whoever he was, didn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-41\">All this testimony seems to raise more questions than it settles. Was the prohibition against Mrs. Theriault driving the car real? In spite of the prohibition, how often did she drive it? Theriault first stated that she drove the car \u201cNot at all.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Later he said she drove it \u201cOnce in a while.\u201d In answer to the question, \u201cYou let Mr. Grady drive it?\u201d, Theriault replied \u201cThat is right.\u201d Was this a general permission or merely one given on each separate request by Grady? Did Theriault actually know that Grady had no driver\u2019s license? If he did, would he be apt to let Grady drive the car?</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Grady evidently regarded the Buick as a family car, for when asked: \u201cWhose automobile was it?\u201d, he replied: \u201cMy sister and her husband\u2019s car,\u201d and he could only imagine title to the car was in Theriault.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Did Grady or Mrs. Theriault, or both, plan the trip to Moncks Corner? Did Grady rely on a general permission from Theriault for the fatal trip, or did he ask .and receive permission from his sister? What measure of control over the car did Mrs. Theriault exercise on the trip? Did \u2022she actually do part of the driving ? Grady could not remember, though it seems clear that Grady was driving at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Theriault would be the sole beneficiary of any recovery in this suit. The jury could, of course, take this into consideration in appraising his testimony and in passing on his credibility. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Mrs. Theriault was the wife of the owner of the car, so she had at least some interest, if that word be used in a broad sense, in the car. See Neese v. Toms, supra; Langley v. Southern Ry. Co., supra. She was the sister of Grady, who apparently was driving. Again see Neese v. Toms, supra, mother and daughter; and Langley v. Southern Ry. Co., supra, the driver was plaintiff\u2019s nephew. Grady was utterly ignorant of the roads between Charleston and Moncks Corner. Apparently Mrs. Theriault knew them well. This lends color to the view that both Grady and Mrs. Theriault expected her to exercise control, and that she did exercise control, over the movements and the direction of the car. According to Grady, she may have done some of the driving. If the testimony of Sheriff Hill he believed as to his interview with Theriault, Mrs. Theriault must have had a driver\u2019s license. Clearly Grady had no license. In case of any trouble on the road, or if it seemed that a State officer might stop the car, the expedient practice would obviously be to let Mrs. Theriault take the wheel.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Finally, in this connection, the object of the trip was not one in which Mrs. Theri-ault had no concern. She was keenly interested in securing a job for her brother. He was living as a guest with the Theriaults (the jury might well infer as a non-paying guest) so it was to her economic advantage to get him employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">In the light of all the evidence in this case, viewed under the applicable South Carolina law, we think the District Judge properly submitted to the jury the question of whether or not Grady and Mrs. Theriault were engaged in a common or joint enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b348-11\">. There was abundant evidence to show that negligence in the operation of the Theriault automobile caused or contributed to the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
