The jury having found for defendant, plaintiff appeals, contending that there was error in the trial judge\u2019s charge, in the admission of certain evidence, and in the conduct of the trial. We have carefully reviewed the record of the proceedings in the District Court, and have concluded that any error committed is not such, in view of the unsubstantial nature of plaintiff\u2019s evidence on the issue of negligence, as to justify reversal. See LeVonas v. Acme Paper Board Co., 184 Md. 16, 40 A.2d 43; Williams v. United Men\u2019s Shop, 317 Mass. 319, 58 N.E.2d 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-22\">The judgment of the District Court will accordingly be</p>\n<p id=\"b670-23\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
