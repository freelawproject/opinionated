The steers did not arrive at destination until October 12, 1947. On November 4, 1947, plaintiffs filed a claim numbered 107-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>84 with defendant through their agent, the Chicago Live Stock Exchange, claiming loss and damage to the live stock caused by defendant\u2019s negligence in the \u201ctotal amount claimed\u201d of $3,128.97. The \u201cNature of the Claim\u201d v/as stated as \u201cLoss account delayed, rough, negligent and improper handling in transit\u201d and under the heading \u201cDetailed statement showing how amount claimed is determined\u201d there appeared an item \u201cTo value: 2 good average steers, $627.44\u201d, \u201c1 steer short at destination, 1 steer crippled\u201d. The other items of the claim were for Market Loss, Excessive Shrinkage and Extra Feed at Clearing, Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">On December 1, 1947, defendant replied to the claim by letter to the Chicago Live Stock Exchange as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">\u201cDecember 1, 1947. 698345-22</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQh\">\u201cThe Chicago Live Stock Exchange U.

Thereafter removal was had to the federal court which had jurisdiction on account of diversity of citizenship and amount involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-22\">Following the removal, the defendant asserted as a defense in its answer to the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint that defendant had disallowed plaintiffs\u2019 claim in writing on the first day of December, 1947, and that more than two years and one day had elapsed from said disallowance, to-wit, two years and four months, until the commencement of this action and that under the provisions of Title 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 20(11), and the uniform bill of lading issued thereunder pursuant to which the shipment was made, defendant was not liable to plaintiffs and their said claim could not 'be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-23\">Thereafter, as a result of pre-trial conference and discovery proceedings all the writings of the parties relative to the claim for damages were produced and identified as exhibits and a hearing was had on defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment in its favor. The court found on consideration of all the evidence that more than two years and one day had passed after the railroad disallowed the plaintiffs\u2019 claim in writing on December 1, 1947, before the plaintiffs commenced their action on March 31, 1950, and that the period of limitation contained in the Uniform Live Stock Contract under which the steers were shipped had expired before the action was commenced. It also held that the running of the limitation period was not tolled by negotiations for settlement shown to have been carried on after the railroad\u2019s letter of December 1, 1947. It concluded that no issue of fact remained for trial and sustained the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. It accompanied its ruling with an opinion in writing, D.C., 100 F. Supp. 405. By the terms of the judgment entered in accord with the ruling, the action of the plaintiffs was dismissed at their costs and they appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-24\">They do not question that their action was governed as to the time when it should have been brought by 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 20(11) which so far as pertinent reads, \u201cProvided further, That it shall be unlawful for any such receiving dr delivering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>common carrier to provide -by rale, contract, regulation, or otherwise a shorter period for the filing of claims than nine months, and for the institution of suits than two years, such period for institution of suits to be computed from the day when notice in writing is given by the carrier to the claimant that the carrier' has disallowed the claim or any part or parts thereof specified in the notice: * * * \u201d, and -by the terms of section 2 (c) of the Uniform Live Stock Contract under which the shipment was made and which are 'based on the above statute and so far as pertinent read: \u201cAs a condition precedent to recovery, claims must be filed in writing with the receiving or delivering carrier, or carrier issuing this bill of lading, or carrier on whose line the loss, damage, injury or delay occurred, within nine months after delivery of the property (or, in case of export traffic, within nine months after delivery at port of export), or, in case of failure to make delivery, then within nine months after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed; and suits shall be instituted against any carrier only within two years and one day from the day when notice in writing is given by the carrier to the claimant that the carrier has disallowed the claim or any part or parts thereof specified in the notice. Where claims are not filed or suits are not instituted thereon in accordance with the foregoing provisions, no carrier hereunder shall be liable, and such claims will not be paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Nor do they raise any question that the evidence submitted to and considered by the trial court on the motion for summary judgment constituted all of the evidence on the issue as to when the period of limitation within which the action could be brought was started running.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The points they argue for reversal are (1) that the court erroneously construed defendant\u2019s letter of December 1, 1947, to be a disallowance of the claim within the intendment of the Uniform Contract; that it was not so intended by the railroad, and that there was a jury question as to its true meaning, and (2) that even if the letter of December 1, 1947, constituted a disallowance, defendant revoked such dis-allowance and tolled the running of the period of limitation by subsequently carrying on negotiations for a compromise settlement of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">1. The major part of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim amounting to $2,501.53 out of the total $3,128.97 was shown on its face to be for loss suffered in respect to the 62 steers which were delivered. That damage was claimed to have resulted from rough handling and loss of market from delay. In the first paragraph of defendant\u2019s letter of December 1, 1947, above set forth, the railroad stated in reference to that major part of the claim: \u201cFrom investigation conducted we have not been able to conclude that transportation handling is answerable\u201d for expense and loss for which the claim was made. The letter then concedes a shortage of one animal and says that \u201con this animal and on the cripple noted at time of unloading of stock at Clearing, we can make the usual settlement\u201d. \u201cThis would make the amount due on the claim something like $450.00 for which voucher can be prepared immediately, the balance of the loss being respectfully disallowed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">The trial court held that \u201cthe inevitable legal effect of said letter of December 1, 1947, was that it pointed out to plaintiffs that defendant was only acknowledging liability for a part of the claim they had made against defendant, and the balance of loss for which they were making claim was being disallowed.\u201d The court declared that said letter \u201cwas to all intents and purposes a disallowance of the claim plaintiffs made against defendant and that seems to be the only conclusion that can be rationally apprehended therefrom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">The court further stated in its opinion: \u201cConsidering the contents of defendant\u2019s letter of December 1, 1947, in light of the claim previously made by plaintiffs against defendant; the interpretation given to said letter by plaintiffs\u2019 agent; and the subsequent statements of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, that plaintiffs had authorized them to institute suit on said claim after receipt thereof by plaintiffs, we believe that it is clearly established in the instant case so as to permit of no equivocation that all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>parties hereto understood that when negotiations looking to a compromise of plaintiffs\u2019 claim were subsequently entered into, said letter was considered as having been a disallowance of plaintiffs\u2019 said claim by defendant. In a case where dis-allowance was less clearly stated than in this one, Tribby v. Chicago &amp; N. W. Ry. Co., 64 S.D. 25, 264 N.W. 185, 186, the Court said, \u2018True, defendant does not state in so many words, nor in the language contained in the bill of lading, that plaintiff\u2019s claim was disallowed either in whole or in part, but we think it is sufficient to convey the understanding that such was defendant\u2019s meaning, and that it was so understood by the plaintiff is clear from the fact that he immediately commenced his action.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">We have considered the argument made for appellants to the effect that the letter was ambiguous and was insufficient to start the running of the limitation period because of the way it was worded but we are in accord with the conclusion of the trial court that the letter declared a disallowance of the claim and started the running of the statutory period for suit. The following cases lend support to the conclusion: Tribby v. Chicago, N.W.R., 64 S.D. 23, 264 N.W. 185; Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Wauchula Truck Growers Ass\u2019n, 95 Fla. 392, 118 So. 52; Barber v. Southern Pacific Company, 51 N.M. 396, 185 P.2d 979.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">2. The letter of plaintiffs\u2019 agent of December 23, 1947, supra, after expressing regret that the railroad had seen fit to decline the claim, announced the decision to place the claim in suit and stated that a law firm had been engaged. The evidence was that the law firm instead of commencing suit carried on ^ negotiations and correspondence with the railroad looking to settlement of the claim. Offers of settlement were made by the railroad company (always less than the amount of the claim), but the trial court held that \u201cThe limitation period having commenced to run from and after receipt by plaintiffs of defendant\u2019s letter of December 1, 1947, the running thereof could not be tolled by any subsequent negotiations between the parties such as are here revealed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">Although it is earnestly contended for appellants here that the subsequent negotiations carried on by the railroad and its conduct and offer of settlement (for less than the claim) amounted to a rescinding, revoking or withdrawal of its disallowance of plaintiffs\u2019 claim and tolled the running of the limitation period, we think the precedents are clearly to the contrary and the holding of the trial court was without error.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">In <em>13 </em>C.J.S., Carriers, \u00a7 243, the text reads as follows: \u201cSince the decision of the supreme court of the United States in Georgia, F. &amp; A. Ry. Co. v. Blish Milling Co., 241 U.S. 190, 36 S.Ct. 541, 60 L.Ed. 948, which involved the waiver of a stipulation for making a written claim, considered above in \u00a7 241, it has frequently been held or recognized that the carrier may not, in case of an interstate shipment, waive a provision in a contract of shipment limiting the time within which suit for loss or injury must be brought notwithstanding the alleged waiver occurs before the time limit has expired. 'The view has been taken that such a waiver would constitute an invalid discrimination <em>ft</em></p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">In Midstate Horticultural Co. v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 320 U.S. 356, 64 S. Ct. 128, 88 L.Ed. 96, the Supreme Court had before it the question of whether a shipper could effectively enter into an agreement to waive the statute of limitations set out in Sec. 16(3) (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 16 (3) (a), limiting the time within which a carrier must bring suit against a shipper for freight charges due. In that case, at the shipper\u2019s request, the carrier entered into an agreement by the terms of which the shipper expressly agreed not to avail itself of the defense of the statute of limitations against the carrier. When the carrier subsequently brought its action it was outlawed by the statute of limitations and the shipper, in violation of its express agreement, did plead the statute as a defense. . The Supreme Court held the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>statute was a bar to the carrier\u2019s action, holding that neither the carrier nor the shipper could waive the statute, or estop itself in any way from asserting the statute as a defense. The court stated, 320 U. S. loc. cit. 364, 64 S.Ct. loc. cit. 132 \u201cThe purport of the decisions is that Congress intended, when the period has run, to put an end to the substantive claim and the corresponding liability. The cause of action, the very foundation for relief, is extinguished.\u201d In deciding that case, the converse of the case at bar in that the railroad instead of the shipper was the plaintiff, the Supreme Court indicated that the same reasoning applies to all the limitations periods in the Interstate Commerce Act. Stating that it was not unmindful of the hardship to the carrier in the particular case, the court concluded its opinion, \u201cBut this case boils down to an old adage about sauce and geese, which need not be given citation.\u201d Cf. William Danzer &amp; Co. v. Gulf &amp; Ship Island R. Co., 268 U.S. 633, 45 S.Ct. 612, 69 L.Ed. 1126.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">In Shroyer v. Chicago, R. I. &amp; P. R. Co., 111 Tex. 24, 222 S.W. 1095, 1096, 226 S.W. 140, the court said: \u201cIf the representatives of a railroad company could by conversations and letters and negotiations extending beyond the statutory or contract limit of time to bring suit set estoppel in operation so that the carrier could not assert and invoke the statutory right given it, which is part of the contract of shipment, their action would, in effect, amount to the equivalent of a waiver, and would operate to enable the carrier to discriminate between shippers, and thereby virtually nullify the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The following cases also lend support to the ruling of the trial court: Texas &amp; Pacific Ry. Co. v. Leatherwood, 250 U.S. 478, 479, 39 S.Ct. 517, 63 L.Ed. 1096; Blair-Baker Horse Co. v. A. T. &amp; S. Fe Ry. Co., Mo.App., 200 S.W. 109; Cohen v. Texas &amp; N. O. R. Co., 303 Ill.App. 606, 25 N.E.2d 562; N. Pelaggi &amp; Co. v. Central Vermont Ry. Co., 97 Vt. 1, 121 A. 441 ; Barber &amp; Southern Pac. R. Co., 51 N.M. 396, 185 P.2d 979.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">We find no case holding on such a state of facts as is here presented that the plaintiffs\u2019 action was brought in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">The finding and conclusion of the trial court that no action could be maintained upon the plaintiffs\u2019 claim by reason of the lapse of more than two years from the date of the disallowance of the claim by the railroad company was without error.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
