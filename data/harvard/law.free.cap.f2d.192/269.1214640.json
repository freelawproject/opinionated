It concluded that proposals by the Union, subsequent to the oral agreement and inconsistent with it, were presented as alternatives to that agreement and to induce the company to put it in writing and to perform it. Whether the order could stand, had there been no error in the hearing before the examiner, we need not now say. The examiner erred in refusing to require the Union\u2019s witness Byrnes to answer certain questions, on cross-examination, concerning the discussions at a meeting with the New York State Mediation Board. It is argued that the company was not harmed by this refusal, because the examiner and the Board accepted the testimony of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>company\u2019s witnesses about what was said at that meeting. We think that argument insufficient. For all we know, Byrnes\u2019 testimony on this subject might have disclosed an abandonment by the Union of the July agreement. Consequently, we shall not now decide this case but shall remand to the Board with directions to reopen the hearing to permit the company to examine Byrnes concerning the State Board meeting. The examiner and the Board shall then reconsider their findings in the light of this testimony, and the Board shall then decide whether or not to abide by its order. If it does, the company may again petition this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
