Attached to the \u201csurplus list\u201d was a blank form of contract of sale. One of the provisions contained in said blank form was the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b181-26\">\u201c5. Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, the seller gives no undertaking or warranty, express or implied, as to description, quality, productiveness, or any other matter of any seeds sold by it and will not be in any way responsible for the crop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-27\">Appellee, a firm located in Denver, Colorado, and engaged in the sale of seed, received the said \u201csurplus list\u201d through the mails. Among the seeds listed were \u201cYellow Globe Danvers\u201d onion seed at a price of $3.00 per pound. Upon receipt of the list appellee\u2019s manager contacted appellant by long distance telephone and made him an offer to purchase a ton of \u201cYellow Globe Danvers\u201d onion seed, as well as several other items. After' some negotiations, appellant agreed to sell the onion seed at a price of $2.50 per pound. The manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>of shipment and the terms of payment were also 'agreed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Appellee\u2019s manager testified that during the course of the conversation \u201cI told him [appellant] at the time that we only wanted. first class quality stocks of high germination and true to type, and he -assured me that the stocks were of first class quality and of high germination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Appellee confirmed the purchase the following day by letter which stated <em>inter alia: </em>\u201cWe understand that these stocks are all choice quality stocks true to type.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Upon delivery of the onion seed appellee resold 1000 pounds of it -as \u201cYellow Globe Danvers\u201d to Dutch Valley Growers, Inc., an onion set cooperative growers\u2019 marketing association. The cooperative\u2019s members planted and cultivated the seed and discovered upon maturity of the crop that the onions did not have the characteristics of \u201cYellow Globe Danvers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Subsequently, the cooperative recovered a judgment against 'appellee for damages for breach of warranty in a suit brought in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. Appellee notified 'and requested appellant to appear and defend that suit but appellant failed to do so and similarly failed to pay the judgment recovered against appellee therein. Appellee brought this suit for damages for breach of warranty of description and obtained a judgment for the amount previously paid in satisfaction of the judgment rendered against it in favor of the cooperative, as well as attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in defending that suit. The basis of the trial Court\u2019s findings is that appellant made an express warranty of description in the course of the telephone conversation. The correctness of that finding is the important issue presented on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">In criticism of the said finding appellant urges that the express disclaimer provision of the contract form attached to the \u201csurplus list\u201d was part and parcel of the contract of sale and therefore prevented a warranty from arising. The simple answer is that the contract form was not used. It was merely a proffered convenience for the use of a purchaser in the event a contract embodying terms- contained in the blank form was negotiated. Here the \u201csurplus list\u201d was used by appellee only as a price list and, finding the quoted price unacceptable, appellee made a telephone call which resulted in an agreement as to a purchase price, different from that quoted in the \u201csurplus list\u201d, as well as an agreement as to the manner of shipment and terms of payment. The \u201csurplus list\u201d, therefore, was not within the area of negotiation covered by the telephone conversation. Furthermore, the provisions contained in the contract form do not cover the type of sale involved here. The terms contained in the contract form are primarily concerned with a sale of seeds to be grown pursuant to the purchaser\u2019s order and not in existence at the time an order is solicited. Under the circumstances prevailing in this case it cannot be said that the purchaser of the seed should have known that the terms of the contract form were <em>sub silentio </em>a part of the contract it was entering into over the telephone. Cf. Restatement, Contracts \u00a7 70. In any event, a holding that the provisions contained in the form of contract accompanying the \u201csurplus list\u201d are part of a contract, would be of little comfort to appellant. It could operate in the instant case only to the extent of preventing the -arising of the statutory implied warranty of description which would normally be created. 1 U.L.A. \u00a7 14. The disclaimer of warranty, contained in the submitted but unexecuted form, by its terms provided for -exceptions to be made and the express warranty given by the appellant in the telephone conversation clearly constituted such an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">Appellant further urges that the telephone conversation must be interpreted in the light of a custom prevailing in the seed business not to warrant description or' variety of the seed. The trial Court found that'no such custom was in existence at the time the parties contracted. We are unable to say that this finding is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">Disagreement existed between counsel for appellant and appellee as to whether the law of California or that of Colorado should be applied in construing the contract. We think it immaterial because both California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>and Colorado have adopted the Uniform Sales Act, which, in our opinion, governs the transaction in issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The Uniform Sales Act defines an express warranty as \u201cany affirmation of fact or any promise by the seller relating to the goods * * * ,\u201d and further provides that \u201cno * * * statement purporting to be a statement of the seller\u2019s opinion only shall be construed as a warranty.\u201d 1 U.L.A. \u00a712.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The telephone conversation must be understood in the practical realities of the seed business. It is impossible to ascertain from an inspection' of an onion seed the variety to which it belongs, since one onion seed is indistinguishable from another in appearance. However, the grower of onion seed by careful segregation at the time of harvest can successfully maintain that segregation, for all practical purposes, by the exercise of ordinary . care. Appellant\u2019s description of the manner in which he handled and stored seed points up this conclusion. He testified that different varieties of seed were placed in separate sacks, appropriately labeled, and but one variety placed in the warehouse at any one time. In view of this practice, it is difficult to follow appellant\u2019s argument to the effect that because of the great similarity in appearance of onion seed a warranty as to type could not be given. Present the exercise of due care in the harvesting, sacking, labeling and storing, identification at any future time should not be difficult. We profess no particular competence in the field of onion seed cultivation and sale, but do think that the plain facts presented need no expert interpretation. It is a rational conclusion to say that appellee, a dealer in seed, would have knowledge of the grower\u2019s ability to segregate and distinguish, and to require a warranty as to the variety of seeds he was ordering. Appellee\u2019s understanding of the contract is evidenced in the confirming letter written one day after the order was placed. Out of an abundance of caution, in order to prevent misunderstanding, there was reiterated in the letter the same phrase previously used in the telephone conversation, viz.: \u201cWe understand that these stocks are all choice-quality stocks true to type.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
