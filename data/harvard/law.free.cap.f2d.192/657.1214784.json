The collision occurred on a clear morning at a point where the highway crossed the appellant\u2019s main line track in the western part of the city of Birmingham, Alabama. The accident was on the customary route of travel for trucks between the terminal of the Standard Oil Company, where appellee\u2019s driver had just loaded the truck, as he had previously done frequently, and the appellee\u2019s place of business in Birmingham.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-26\">The railroad crossing was clearly visible to a motorist approaching from the south (as was true in this instance) for a distance of 700 feet. The regular railroad stop-sign, cross-arm crossing sign, electric-flasher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>red-light crossing signal, and state highway-department stop-sign, were all in place and clearly visible to the motorist for at least several hundred feet before reaching the crossing. A motorist, driving in the same direction and in front of appellee\u2019s truck, saw the flasher lights flashing, stopped for the crossing, saw no train approaching, proceeded across the tracks, and then saw the train approaching after he had driven about a block beyond the crossing. ' A motorist driving in the same direction, and following an automobile\u2019s length behind appellee\u2019s truck, saw the train approaching and stopped before reaching the tracks. Ap-pellee\u2019s driver was traveling at a speed of approximately 25 miles per hour on his approach to the crossing, and he never slowed his speed or gave any signal of preparing to stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Appellant\u2019s train was approaching the crossing from the direction of Birmingham, traveling at a speed of 31 miles per hour, with the whistle and bell sounding a warning for the crossing. Appellee\u2019s driver drove the tank tractor-truck into the left side of appellant\u2019s diesel engine with such force that the engine was derailed and the steel tracks were bent.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Considering the overwhelming weight of evidence that the appellee\u2019s driver did not take any precaution in approaching the' crossing, and was heedless of the danger to himself, to the train, and its crew, it is clear that the driver\u2019s negligence was the sole proximate cause of the collision and the damages resulting therefrom.

Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Co., 237 Ala. 267, 186 So. 457; Sec. 6(b), Title 36, Alabama Code of 1940; Sec. 1317, City Code of the City of Birmingham, Alabama (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The judgment appealed from is reversed, and the cause remanded to the district court with directions to enter judgment for the plaintiff for the amount stipulated, plus such amount of its cargo and freight loss as the plaintiff may have sustained</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
