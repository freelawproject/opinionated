Rule 10, 18 U.S.C.A., and because he was denied the right to counsel, contrary to the Sixth Amendment. He appeals from an order denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">The record shows that the indictment was read in full to the defendant in open court, whereupon the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-12\">\u201cThe Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-13\">\u201cQ. This is David Ira Ray? A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-14\">\u201cQ. You have heard the charges, are you guilty or not guilty? .A. Guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-15\">\u201cQ. You understand that a plea of guilty is an admission that the charges against you are true ? A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-16\">\u201cQ. You also understand that if you want to fight the case, you could do so? A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-17\">\u201cQ. Or you could get you a lawyer to do it for you? A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-18\">\u201cQ. And if you could not hire you a lawyer, you know the Court would appoint you one, if you ask him? A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-19\">Jj&lt; s|i $ Jfc $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-20\">\u201cQ. Do you have anything to say why sentence may not be imposed? A. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-21\">It thus appears that defendant was adequately advised of his right to counsel, and that he understandingly waived that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-22\"> The same is true as to the alleged failure to furnish defendant a copy of the indictment. The original indictment was read in full to the defendant in open court. He made no claim that he was not furnished a copy, nor did he complain of. the alleged omission, until after sentence. Moreover, the omission to furnish the defendant a copy of the indictment, even if error remediable on direct appeal, does not render the judgment subject to collateral attack under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-23\">As an excuse for his failure to demand counsel, defendant asserts that he is illiterate, having only a second grade education. It appears from the record, however, that defendant is a mature adult, with an impressive criminal record, \u2014 no stranger to the court room.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-24\">Appellant\u2019s motion discloses no fundamental infirmity which would render the judgment vulnerable to collateral attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
