Berube, Sr., appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of conviction, following a jury trial, of charges stemming from two separate informations. In the first case, the defendant was convicted of sexual assault in the fourth degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-73a (a) (l),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53-21.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the second case, the defendant was convicted of assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (l),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and risk of injury to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>child in violation of \u00a7 53-21. On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) failed to sever the cases for trial; (2) permitted the state to impeach the defendant with evidence of his postarrest silence; (3) precluded the defendant from eliciting testimony related to the decision of the department of children and families (department) to place the defendant\u2019s biological child in his custody; and (4) denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance and failed to recognize his right of allocution prior to imposing the sentences at the sentencing hearing. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">The following facts are relevant to our disposition of this appeal. This appeal involves two cases that were tried together. The first case involves the defendant\u2019s alleged sexual assault of his stepdaughter, Jane Doe,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> beginning in May or June, 1997. Jane, then thirteen years old, eventually complained to her mother, T.B., that the defendant was touching her in an inappropriate manner. Pursuant to Jane\u2019s allegations, on September 7, 1997, T.B. brought her to state police Troop D barracks to file a complaint. Trooper Thomas Clark took written statements from both Jane and T.B., and, in accordance with procedure, notified the department. Thereafter, T.B. obtained a restraining order to remove the defendant from the family home. The department conducted its investigation simultaneously with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>state police. Kathleen Payne, a department investigator, met with both Jane and the defendant. Despite Jane\u2019s continued allegations, the defendant denied any wrongdoing and claimed that he accidently could have touched Jane\u2019s breasts while wrestling with her. Payne concluded that allegations of sexual abuse had been substantiated and sent a letter to T.B. reiterating the need to protect her children. The department, thereafter, closed its file in November, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The second case involves the defendant\u2019s alleged physical assault of his stepson, John Doe, on or about September 4, 1997. A few days after the incident, John, then eleven years old, complained of back pain to his grandmother. Upon lifting his shirt, John\u2019s grandmother noticed bruises and notified John\u2019s mother, T.B. After observing the bruises on John\u2019s back, T.B. took him to state police Troop D barracks to file a complaint on September 7, 1997. Clark observed the bruises and had photographs taken to document John\u2019s condition. Clark took written statements from both John and T.B., and, subsequently, notified the department of the incident. On behalf of the department, Payne met with both John and the defendant. The defendant informed Payne that he went to spank John on his buttocks, but that John moved causing the defendant to miss and strike John in the back. Payne concluded that the allegations of physical abuse had been substantiated and sent a letter to T.B. reiterating the need to protect her children. The department, thereafter, closed its file in November, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">On December 2,1997, the defendant was arrested on two separate warrants related to these allegations. The state filed two substitute informations on May 19,1999, and the defendant, subsequently, was tried on both sets of charges before a single jury. On June 25, 1999, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on each count charged within the informations. On September 21, 1999, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>court, <em>Potter, J., </em>imposed a total effective sentence of five years imprisonment, execution suspended after two years, and five years probation. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the trial court improperly failed to sever the two cases for trial. Specifically, the defendant claims that joinder of the two cases prejudiced him because: (1) the jury likely relied on evidence presented in one case to convict him in the other; (2) the totality of the accumulated evidence at trial \u201cdemonized\u201d him; and (3) he was prevented from exercising his fifth amendment right not to testify because he wanted to testify in one case, but not in the other. Because the defendant failed to raise the severance issue at trial, we are not bound to review this claim on appeal. See <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>235 Conn. 402, 405 n.3, 665 A.2d 897 (1995) (failure to raise issue of severance at trial renders claim unreviewable); <em>State </em>v. <em>Groomes, </em>232 Conn. 455, 465, 656 A.2d 646 (1995) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">In declining to review this claim, \u201cwe reassert the fundamental principle that, if the defendant deems an action of the trial court necessary to the fairness of his trial, he has a responsibility to present such a claim clearly to the trial court so that the trial court may consider it and, if it is meritorious, take appropriate action. That is the basis for the requirement that ordinarily a defendant must raise in the trial court the issues that he intends to raise on appeal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Groomes, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">The defendant\u2019s silence, when faced with the prospect of a joint trial, may have been for tactical or other valid reasons. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>227 Conn. 32, 55 n.20, 630 A.2d 990 (1993). For example, a joint trial may have provided the defendant with the opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>demonstrate an attempt by his former wife, T.B., to turn both children against the defendant by manipulating them into believing that innocent acts were actually inappropriate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. Romero, 54 F.3d 56, 59-60 (2d Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1149, 116 S. Ct. 1449, 134 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1996) (counsel did not pursue severance for tactical reasons); <em>United States </em>v. Jackson, 33 F.3d 866, 875-76 (7th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1005, 115 S. Ct. 1316, 131 L. Ed. 2d 197 (1995) (court presumed that failure to seek severance was tactical decision); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cyprian, </em>23 F.3d 1189, 1194 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 879, 115 S. Ct. 211, 130 L. Ed. 2d 139 (1994) (counsel did not pursue severance for tactical reasons). Thus, to consider the defendant\u2019s claim on appeal would be to \u201cimpose an untenable burden on the trial court and would amount to appeal by ambuscade.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Groomes, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 466. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Having failed to raise the issue of severance at trial, and because the record contains no indication that such failure was not based on tactical reasons, the defendant waived any constitutional claims he may have had with respect to the joinder of the cases. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>209 Conn. 622, 633, 553 A.2d 589 (1989) (\u201cdefendant cannot now claim \u2018foul\u2019 because of the admission of evidence which he allowed in for tactical purposes\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harman, </em>198 Conn. 124, 136, 502 A.2d 381 (1985) (\u201c[hjaving expressly consented, for tactical reasons, to allow the state\u2019s psychiatrist to reveal information he received during the examination, the defendant waived any constitutional claims he may have had with respect to this testimony and may not now challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>its admissibility on appeal\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Moye, </em>177 Conn. 487, 499, 418 A.2d 870 (1979) (\u201cdefendant\u2019s tactical use of [testimony] amounted to a waiver of any constitutional objection\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>62 Conn. App. 217, 231, 774 A.2d 157 (2001) (claim that constitutional right to confrontation was violated does not satisfy second prong of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 [1989], because defendant made tactical decision not to cross-examine witness on particular issue); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fisher, 52 </em>Conn. App. 825, 830, 729 A.2d 229, cert. denied, 249 Conn. 912, 733 A.2d 232 (1999) (\u201cdefendant cannot now complain that he was deprived of his constitutional rights because his trial tactic failed\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the trial court violated his state and federal constitutional rights by improperly permitting the state to impeach him with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>evidence of his postarrest silence and request for an attorney. See <em>Doyle </em>v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610, 619, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Daugaard, </em>231 Conn. 195, 210-11, 647 A.2d 342 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1099, 115 S. Ct. 770, 130 L. Ed. 2d 666 (1995). This contention concerns two inquiries by the state during its cross-examination of the defendant regarding his claimed cooperation with the state police and the department. The defendant failed to raise this issue at trial and now seeks to prevail on this unpreserved claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. We conclude that the record is insufficient for review with respect to the claim involving the police, and we reject the defendant\u2019s argument with respect to the claim involving the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">During the state\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant, he volunteered that he had attempted to speak with the police, but that they had refused to take a statement from him without his attorney. Upon further inquiry, the defendant explained that he had informed his attorney of his offer to speak with the police and that his attorney had told him not to say anything unless he was present. The defendant also stated that he had presumed that his attorney would set up a meeting with the police, but that he never did. The defendant argues that the cross-examination violated his right to remain silent because the questioning revealed that he had chosen to remain silent after his arrest and receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">\u201cOrdinarily, evidence of a defendant\u2019s postarrest and <em>postMiranda </em>silence is constitutionally impermissible under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>[supra, 426 U.S. 610]. A <em>Doyle </em>violation also encompasses a prosecutor\u2019s comment upon a defendant\u2019s statement requesting an attorney. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>210 Conn. 481, 489, 556 A.2d 154 (1989). With respect to <em>post-Miranda </em>warning . . . silence does not mean only muteness; it includes the statement of a desire to remain silent, as well as of a desire to remain silent until an attorney has been consulted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Daugaard, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 210-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s argument, the record is not clear whether his conversations with the police transpired after or <em>before </em>his arrest or receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is essential to know the timing of these conversations because the \u201cuse at trial of silence prior to the receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings does not violate due process. <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Weir, </em>455 U.S. 603, 102 S. Ct. 1309, 71 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1982) . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Plourde, </em>208 Conn. 455, 466, 545 A.2d 1071 (1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 1034, 109 S. Ct. 847, 102 L. Ed. 2d 979 (1989). Because the record does not indicate whether <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given before the defendant\u2019s conversations with the police took place, the record is inadequate for review under <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">The defendant, however, claims that his receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings may be inferred because he was in custody at the time he telephoned his attorney. His reliance on <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>174 Conn. 73, 381 A.2d 563 (1977), for this proposition is misplaced. In <em>Cook, </em>this court held that it was not essential for the record to disclose at what point or whether <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given to a defendant when his postarrest silence is the subject of inquiry. Id., 76. We subsequently have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>modified that holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Leecan, </em>198 Conn. 517, 525, 504 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1184, 106 S. Ct. 2922, 91 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1986). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Leecan, </em>supra, 524-25, we adopted the holding of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Weir, </em>supra, 455 U.S. 607, that \u201cthe absence of any indication in the record that the silence of a defendant had been preceded by a <em>Miranda </em>warning rendered <em>Doyle </em>inapplicable, even though the inquiry of the prosecutor pertained to the time of arrest.\u201d Thus, we will not infer that the defendant received <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to his conversations with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">During his cross-examination by the state, the defendant testified that he was a battered spouse without a remedy or a means to protect the children. In response, the state asked the defendant about seeking the department\u2019s assistance while it investigated the allegations against him. The defendant proceeded to testify that he did not trust the department because they were not objective. He further explained that, although he had told the department that he did not want to speak with anyone without his lawyer present, he actually did speak with Payne alone. The defendant now argues that the state\u2019s inquiry was improper because his rights to remain silent and be represented by counsel with respect to the criminal investigation also were applicable to the department\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\"><em>\u201cMiranda </em>warnings inform a person of his right to remain silent and assure him, at least implicitly, that his silence will not be used against him.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>474 U.S. 284, 291, 106 S. Ct. 634, 88 L. Ed. 2d 623 (1986). \u201cAs such, silence following <em>Miranda </em>warnings is \u2018insolubly ambiguous\u2019 because it may constitute a reliance upon those rights rather than a tacit admission that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>accused has an insufficient defense or explanation for his conduct.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Talton, </em>197 Conn. 280, 295, 497 A.2d 35 (1985). Thus, <em>\u201cDoyle </em>bars the use against a criminal defendant of silence maintained after receipt of governmental assurances.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>supra, 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">In the present case, however, there is no evidence that the defendant received <em>Miranda </em>warnings with respect to the departmental investigation. \u201cThe point of the <em>Doyle </em>holding is that it is fundamentally unfair to promise an arrested person that his silence will not be used against him and thereafter to breach that promise by using the silence to impeach his trial testimony.\u201d Id., 292. Here, it is not clear that the defendant received government assurances upon which to rely. \u201cBecause it is the <em>Miranda </em>warning itself that carries with it the promise of protection, the United States Supreme Court has concluded that the prosecution\u2019s use of silence prior to the receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings does not violate due process. <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Weir, </em>[supra, 455 U.S. 603] (postarrest silence); <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>447 U.S. 231, 100 S. Ct. 2124, 65 L. Ed. 2d 86 (1980) (prearrest silence).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>223 Conn. 299, 319, 613 A.2d 242 (1992). Once again, in the absence of any such evidence, there can be no <em>Doyle </em>violation. The defendant would have this court adopt a practice that would make <em>any </em>silence inadmissible in a criminal proceeding, a position far beyond that mandated by <em>Doyle. </em>See <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 426 U.S. 615 (holding that it is fundamentally unfair to promise arrested person that his silence will not be used against him and thereafter to breach that promise); <em>see also Fletcher v. Weir, </em>supra, 607 (use at trial of silence prior to receipt of <em>Miranda </em>warnings does not violate due process); <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>supra, 240 (same); <em>State v. Montgomery, </em>254 Conn. 694, 713, 759 A.2d 995 (2000) (same); <em>State </em>v. <em>Plourde, </em>supra, 208 Conn. 465-66 (same). We decline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>to do so. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The defendant\u2019s third claim is that the trial court improperly: (1) precluded the defendant from inquiring about the department\u2019s decision to place his biological child in his custody after the victims had made their allegations of abuse; and (2) refused to conduct an in camera review of his biological son\u2019s department file. The state argues that the trial court properly determined that the department\u2019s decision to place the defendant\u2019s biological child in his custody was not relevant to the issue of whether the defendant had abused his stepchildren. The state further contends that the defendant did not make a showing sufficient to obtain an in camera inspection based on due process grounds. We agree with the state on both accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">At trial, the defendant sought to elicit testimony from a department social worker explaining that the department had placed the defendant\u2019s biological child in his custody after the allegations by Jane Doe and John Doe had arisen. In doing so, the defendant attempted to demonstrate that the department has high standards with respect to the safety and welfare of children and that the department, therefore, would not have placed his biological child in the defendant\u2019s custody if he were a danger to the child. The state objected to this line of questioning on the grounds of relevance. In sustaining the objection, the court explained that the jurors \u201cknow that this young child is with his father and they know the father is charged with risk of injury and other charges. They can draw their own inferences from the fact that the child is with the father. But, I don\u2019t think we should talk about standards of proof as it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>apply to a child who is not even the subject of [the allegations].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">\u201cAs a threshold matter, we set forth the standard by which we review the trial court\u2019s determinations concerning the exclusion of evidence. The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Billie, </em>250 Conn. 172, 180, 738 A.2d 586 (1999); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>241 Conn. 784, 789, 699 A.2d 91 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>58 Conn. App. 136, 148, 752 A.2d 1147, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 907, 755 A.2d 884 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">We find nothing in the record that persuades us to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in determining that testimony related to the placement of his biological child with the defendant, after the allegations arose, was irrelevant to the issue of whether he abused his stepchildren. We, therefore, reject the defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court improperly excluded the evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">The defendant next claims that he had a due process right under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution to an in camera inspection of a confidential department file<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in order to determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>exculpatory information existed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although we agree that due process requires that a defendant be entitled to an in camera review of confidential department files in some instances, we conclude that there is nothing in the record to indicate that the defendant in this case met the requisite threshold that would require a court to undertake such a review.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The defendant relies on <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 107 S. Ct. 989, 94 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1987), for his claim that he was entitled to an in camera review. In <em>Ritchie, </em>the defendant was charged with rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, incest and corruption of a minor, resulting from allegations made by his thirteen year old daughter. Id., 43. The victim reported the incidents to the police, who in turn referred her to a state agency, children and youth services. Id. During pretrial discovery, the defendant served the agency with a subpoena to gain access to the victim\u2019s confidential file. Id. The trial judge denied the request and the defendant was convicted on all counts. Id., 45. On appeal, the United States Supreme Court held that, under a due process analysis, the defendant was \u201centitled to have the [agency] file reviewed by the trial court to determine whether it contains information that <em>probably </em>would have changed the outcome of his trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>The defendant also cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Leduc, </em>40 Conn. App. 233, 670 A.2d 1309 (1996), for support. In Leduc, the defendant was charged with sexual assault of his daughter. Id., 235. At trial, the defendant requested an in camera inspection of confidential department files, which he believed to contain exculpatory evidence. The trial court denied the request and the defendant ultimately was convicted. Id., 240. The Appellate Court, citing <em>Ritchie, </em>concluded that the defendant had made a showing sufficient under due process standards to warrant an in camera inspection. Id., 248. The Appellate Court explained that \u201cthe defendant must at least make some plausible statement of how the information would be both material and favorable to his defense.\u201d Id. Accordingly, the case was remanded for an in camera inspection of relevant files. Id., 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">There is nothing in the record in the present case to indicate that the trial court improperly refused to conduct an in camera inspection. Unlike in <em>Ritchie </em>and <em>Leduc, </em>the department file that is the subject of the requested in camera inspection here does not involve \u201cthe same incident that forms the basis of [the defendant\u2019s] criminal charges.\u201d Id., 244. Rather, the defendant sought inspection of the department\u2019s file on his biological child, even though the criminal allegations stem from acts involving the stepchildren.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Having determined that the biological child\u2019s file is irrelevant to the question of whether the defendant had abused his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>stepchildren, the court denied the claim.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendant, \u201cof course, may not require the trial court to search through the [department] file without first establishing a basis for his claim that it contains material evidence.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Ritchie, </em>supra, 480 U.S. 58 n.15. The defendant failed to make such a showing and, therefore, we reject his claim that he was entitled to an in camera inspection of his biological child\u2019s confidential file.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim alleges that the trial court: (1) incorrectly denied his motion for a continuance; and (2) failed to recognize his right of allocution prior to the imposition of his sentence. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for a continuance and that the defendant\u2019s right of allocution was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">After the jury returned a guilty verdict, the court ordered a presentence investigation with alternate incarceration program assessment to be conducted by the office of adult probation. Both cases were, therefore, continued until August 27, 1999. On August 26, 1999, the defendant filed a motion for a continuance, which was granted until September 21, 1999. On September 20, 1999, the defendant filed another motion requesting a continuance for sentencing, which was denied. The defendant now claims that the court should have granted the continuance because the presentence investigation report referenced a psychiatric examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>tion of him that had not been made available to him pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 43-7<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and 43-10 (1).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">\u201cThe determination of whether to grant a request for a continuance is within the discretion of the trial court, and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. ... A reviewing court is bound by the principle that [ejvery reasonable presumption in favor of the proper exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion will be made. ... To prove an abuse of discretion, an appellant must show that the trial court\u2019s denial of a request for a continuance was arbitrary. . . . There are no mechanical tests for deciding when a denial of a continuance is so arbitrary as to violate due process. The answer must be found in the circumstances present in every case, <em>particularly in the reasons presented to the trial judge at the time the request is </em>denied.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>228 Conn. 234, 239-40, 636 A.2d 760 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>Contrary to the defendant\u2019s arguments on appeal, neither the motion he filed, nor his arguments before the trial court regarding the motion indicated that the purpose of the continuance was to enable the defense to obtain a copy of the psychiatric report now in question.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Rather, the defendant argued that he needed more time and that his due process rights were violated because the report was unfavorable toward him.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In response to the defendant\u2019s argument, the court noted that it sounded as if the defendant was attempting to retry the cases. The court explained: \u201cI\u2019m prepared to listen to argument regarding any claim[ed] deficiencies that appear in the presentence investigation. Whether those are factual or mistakes as a matter of law\u2014but I\u2019m not prepared to grant a continuance so that these argument[s] may be further developed.\u201d The defendant failed to argue any deficiencies regarding the presentence investigation report during discussion of the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>tinuance, and the court, therefore, denied the request. The court\u2019s reasons for denying the continuance were not arbitrary, but rather reflect a sound decision to prevent the defendant from retrying issues underlying his guilt. Our examination of the record reveals nothing that would cause us to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion, particularly in light of \u201cthe reasons presented to the trial judge at the time the request [was] denied.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that his case should be remanded for resentencing because the trial court failed to recognize his right of allocution prior to the imposition of his sentence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">The rules of practice require that the judicial authority, before imposing a sentence, \u201callow the defendant a reasonable opportunity to make a personal statement in his or her own behalf and to present any information in mitigation of the sentence.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 43-10 (3). Failure to provide the defendant with such an opportunity generally requires resentencing. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Strickland, </em>243 Conn. 339, 354, 703 A.2d 109 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Margiotti, </em>85 F.3d 100 (2d Cir. 1996), the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit addressed the identical issue with which we are faced. In that case, the judge announced a sentence prior to giving the defendant an opportunity to speak as mandated by the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Id., 101. The judge, having realized his lapse, offered the defendant the right of allocution. Id., 102. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>After the defendant spoke, the judge explained that he had considered the defendant\u2019s statements, but chose to adhere to the previously announced sentence and explained his reasons for doing so. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">In a per curiam decision, the Court of Appeals explained that \u201c [b]y affording the defendant an opportunity to address the court and reconsidering the sentence just announced, the district judge cured his earlier mistake and complied fully with the requirements of [the rule].\u201d Id., 103; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>172 F.3d 921 (D.C. Cir. 1998), United States Court of Appeals, Docket No. 97-3181 (D.C. Cir., July 31, 1998) (holding United States District Court sufficiently complied with rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure when court gave consideration to defendant\u2019s allocution prior to adjournment of sentencing proceeding and responded with reasons for adhering to previously announced sentence); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>948 F.2d 325, 331 n.5 (7th Cir. 1991) (\u201c[A] trial judge, realizing after sentencing that the right of allocution has been neglected, may rectify the situation by, in effect, setting aside the sentence, reopening the proceeding, and inviting the defendant to speak. . . . [T]he trial court must genuinely reconsider the sentence in light of the elicited statement.\u201d [Citations omitted.]). The Court of Appeals concluded: \u201cTo decide in these circumstances that a judgment ought to be vacated and the case be remanded for resentencing would be tantamount to ruling that a district judge cannot correct an inadvertent and harmless mistake made in the course of a sentencing hearing. There is no reason to adopt so inflexible a rule. . . . Where, as here, the technical violation of an applicable rule was promptly corrected and caused no harm, it cannot be said that there was a denial of justice.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Margiotti, </em>supra, 85 F.3d 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">At the sentencing hearing in the present case, the court imposed the defendant\u2019s sentence following argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>ments by the state and the defendant\u2019s counsel. After the court announced the sentence, the defense counsel notified the court that the defendant wished to exercise his right of allocution. The court granted the defendant\u2019s request and permitted him to make a statement. The court, after having listened to the defendant\u2019s remarks, declined to change the sentence. Specifically, the court explained: \u201cI will note your comments. For the record, I would have recognized you earlier had your counsel brought it to my attention. . . . But nevertheless, I do feel that the sentence that the court has just imposed is appropriate under all of the circumstances. These two young kids have been traumatized, according to this report\u2014and it\u2019s genuine. Both are in tough shape. I\u2019m not going to change the sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">We conclude that the defendant\u2019s right of allocution was not violated. The record clearly indicates that the court considered the defendant\u2019s comments and demonstrated reasons for adhering to the originally imposed sentence. By affording the defendant the opportunity to speak and reconsidering the sentence with those remarks in mind, the \u201cjudge cured his earlier mistake and complied fully with the requirements of [the rule].\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Margiotti, </em>supra, 85 F.3d 103.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-8\"> The defendant appealed from the judgment of the tried court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b764-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-73a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the fourth degree when: (1) Such person intentionally subjects another person to sexual contact who is (A) under fifteen years of age, or (B) mentally defective or mentally incapacitated to the extent that he is unable to consent to such sexual contact, or (C) physically helpless, or (D) less than eighteen years old and the actor is such person\u2019s guardian or otherwise responsible for the general supervision of such person\u2019s welfare, or (E) in custody of law or detained in a hospital or other institution and the actor has supervisory or disciplinary authority over such other person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b764-10\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53-21 provides: \u201cIpjury or risk of injury to, or impairing morals of, children.

At trial, the defendant called several witnesses who portrayed T.B. as abusive or an alcoholic, and the defendant as nonviolent. The defendant further testified that he often had to protect himself and the children from T.B.\u2019s physically abusive behavior.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b769-8\"> We are unpersuaded by the defendant\u2019s attempt to bring this claim under the mantle of <em>State v.

We note that there is no affirmative duty on the trial court, to order separate trials. <em>State </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>188 Conn. 432, 450, 450 A.2d 828 (1982). Even when raised, the derision to grant or deny severance is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent manifest abuse. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chance, </em>236 Conn. 31, 42, 671 A.2d 323 (1996). Thus, under the circumstances of the present case, where the defendant did not move for severance, we can see nothing constitutional about the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly failed, sua sponte, to sever the cases for trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 55 n.20. \u201cPatently nonconstitutional claims that are unpreserved at trial do not warrant special consideration simply because they bear a constitutional label.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">The defendant also claims that he should prevail under the plain error doctrine. \u201c[PJlain error review is reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kulmac, </em>230 Conn. 43, 77, 644 A.2d 887 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>223 Conn. 535, 551, 613 A.2d 770 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>207 Conn. 276, 288-89, 542 A.2d 299 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>202 Conn. 463, 469, 522 A.2d 249 (1987).

The state claims that the defendant never requested that the court conduct an in camera review of the department\u2019s file, but instead, raises that issue for the first time on appeal. The state argues, therefore, that because no <em>Golding </em>review was requested, the claim should not be reviewed by this court. As the defendant notes, however, the trial transcript does indicate that the defendant explicitly raised <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 107 S. Ct. 989, 94 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1987), the seminal case involving due process violations as they relate to in camera inspections of confidential juvenile files. Accordingly, we find this reference sufficient to warrant review of the merits of this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b777-7\"> In his appellate brief, the defendant claims that he was entitled to question the department social worker about, and have an in camera inspection of, the department records concerning his biological child as well as Jane Doe and John Doe. Our review of the record, however, reveals that the defendant did not inquire at trial about the department files of Jane Doe and John Doe. The entire discussion regarding access to records and relevant testimony was with regard to the defendant\u2019s biological child. Thus, the claims involving Jane Doe and John Doe were not preserved and the defendant does not claim to prevail under <em>Golding. </em>Accordingly, we decline to review this issue as it pertains to the victims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b778-10\"> In response to the defendant\u2019s claim under <em>Ritchie, </em>the court explained that it is -\u201cgoing to rule against you . . . because you did not establish a threshold ... to convince the court that these records, as they apply to [the biological child], are relevant to the issues here.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b779-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 43-7 provides: \u201cThe presentence investigation or alternate incarceration assessment report or both shall be provided to the judicial authority, and copies thereof shall be provided to the prosecuting authority and to the defendant or his or her counsel in sufficient time for them to prepare adequately for the sentencing hearing, and in any event, no less than twenty-four hours prior to the date of the sentencing.
