App. 660, 669, 740 A.2d 441 (1999). We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the [trial] court\u2019s instruction regarding [the penetration element of] attempted sexual assault in the first degree was constitutionally inadequate?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>252 Conn. 918, 744 A.2d 439 (2000). We agree with the defendant that, contrary to the conclusion of the majority of the Appellate Court panel, the trial court\u2019s instruction on attempted sexual assault in the first degree was constitutionally infirm, thereby entitling the defendant to a new trial on that charge. Consequently, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court with respect to that charge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The Appellate Court opinion sets forth the following facts that the jury reasonably could have found. \u201cOn the evening of December 31,1995, the victim, her friend, Zelda Brown, Brown\u2019s fiance, Fhde Gray, and the defendant met at the victim\u2019s apartment in East Hartford for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>cocktails. After a few drinks, the group proceeded in Gray\u2019s car to a social club in Hartford to celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve. Shortly before the club closed at 2 a.m., the victim paged her boyfriend, William Bruce Maddox, and, when he returned her call, asked him to meet her later at her apartment. As the victim left the club with Gray and the defendant, the defendant produced a nine millimeter Beretta semiautomatic pistol and fired five or six shots into the air.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">\u201cWhen they arrived at the victim\u2019s apartment, the defendant asked if he could use the bathroom. After initially refusing the request, the victim reluctantly agreed. Gray waited downstairs. After using the bathroom, the defendant told the victim that he liked her and kissed her, which she initially returned. As the defendant continued kissing, hugging and grabbing her, however, she told him to \u2018chill\u2019 and \u2018stop.\u2019 He nonetheless persisted, forcing [the victim] into her bedroom as she continued to protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">\u201cThe victim was unable to push past the defendant, and they fell onto the mattress on the floor. The defendant pulled down the victim\u2019s pants and underwear to her ankles, undid his trousers, produced a condom and told the victim to put it on his penis, which she refused to do. He inserted his penis into her vagina anyway. After engaging in vaginal intercourse with her for some time, he removed his penis from her vagina, grabbed her by the hair and, forcing her head toward his crotch, told her to \u2018lick me, lick me.\u2019 The victim refused and began screaming and crying. The defendant then recommenced vaginal intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">\u201cShortly thereafter, the victim heard Maddox\u2019s car, which was very noisy, and told the defendant that Maddox would \u2018kick his ass.\u2019 Grabbing his pistol, which was on the floor, the defendant said that Maddox \u2018ain\u2019t gonna do shit,\u2019 looked out the window and returned to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>mattress after Maddox drove away. Maddox, seeing the darkened apartment, had assumed that the victim was not yet home and left. The defendant again resumed intercourse with the victim. He still held the gun, although it was not directly pointed at the victim\u2019s head. Rather, the gun was lying near the side of her head. After completing sexual intercourse, the defendant dressed and left. The police arrested him after receiving a complaint from the victim.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Scott, supra, 55 Conn. App. 662-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">At trial, the defendant testified that he had engaged in vaginal intercourse with the victim, but insisted that the victim had consented to such conduct. The defendant also acknowledged that he had told the victim to lick his penis, but testified that he did not attempt to force the victim to do so. During closing arguments to the jury, defense counsel stated that the victim had consented to vaginal intercourse with the defendant and that the defendant merely had requested oral sex from the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found the defendant guilty of aggravated sexual assault in the first degree based on his conduct in compelling the victim to engage in vaginal intercourse with him while he was armed with and displayed a handgun. The jury also found the defendant guilty of attempted sexual assault in the first degree based on his conduct in attempting to compel the victim to perform fellatio on him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>On appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant claimed, inter alia,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that; the trial court improperly had failed to instruct<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the jury on the essential element of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>penetration with respect to the charge of attempted sexual assault in the first degree by fellatio.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id., 667. The state acknowledged that the trial court did not expressly instruct the jury regarding the penetration element of that offense, but claimed that, under the circumstances of this case, the trial court\u2019s definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>of the term fellatio as \u201cthe act of obtaining sexual gratification by oral stimulation of the penis,\u201d coupled with the defendant\u2019s testimony that he had sought to have the victim lick his penis, rendered any instructional impropriety harmless.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">A majority of the Appellate Court panel rejected the defendant\u2019s claim of instructional impropriety. Id. Specifically, it concluded that the trial court\u2019s instruction was adequate because the trial court had apprised the jury that its instruction on aggravated sexual assault in the first degree, which informed the jury that penetration is necessary to establish vaginal sexual intercourse, also was applicable to attempted first degree sexual assault by fellatio.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Id., 668. Judge Sullivan<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> dissented, concluding that the trial court\u2019s statement to the jury regarding the applicability of the court\u2019s instructions on aggravated first degree sexual assault to attempted first degree sexual assault was not sufficient to apprise the jury of the penetration element of the latter offense. Id., 670-71 <em>(Sullivan, </em>J., dissenting). Judge Sullivan also concluded that this impropriety was harmful; see id., 671 <em>(Sullivan, J., </em>dissenting); because, even though the jury found that the defendant had attempted to force the victim to stimulate his penis orally; see footnote 10 of this opinion; the jury also \u201ccould erroneously have concluded that an act that requires no penetration, such as licking, constituted fellatio.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>supra, 55 Conn. App. 671 <em>(Sullivan, J., </em>dissenting). Under Judge Sullivan\u2019s analysis, the defendant\u2019s attempt to compel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>the victim to \u201click\u201d him would not subject him to liability for attempted sexual assault in the first degree by forcible <em>sexual intercourse </em>in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-70 (a) and 53a-49, but, rather, for the lesser offense of attempted sexual assault in the third degree by forcible <em>sexual </em>contact<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-72a (a) (l)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and 53a-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">On appeal to this court, the defendant renews his claim of instructional impropriety with respect to the charge of attempted sexual assault in the first degree. For the reasons set forth by Judge Sullivan in his dissent from the majority opinion of the Appellate Court, we agree with the defendant that he is entitled to a new trial on that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">We turn first to the conclusion of the Appellate Court majority that the trial court adequately instructed the jury on the penetration element of attempted sexual assault in the first degree in view of the court\u2019s reference to its instructions regarding the offense of aggravated sexual assault in the first degree. We agree with the defendant that the trial court\u2019s reference back to its instructions on aggravated sexual assault in the first degree was inadequate to inform the jury of the penetra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>tion requirement of attempted sexual assault in the first degree by fellatio.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">We note, preliminarily, that our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim \u201cbegins with a well established standard of review. When reviewing [a] challenged jury instruction ... we must adhere to the well settled rule that a charge to the jury is to be considered in its entirety, read as a whole, and judged by its total effect rather than by its individual component parts. . . . [T]he test of a court\u2019s charge is not whether it is as accurate upon legal principles as the opinions of a court of last resort but whether it fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. ... As long as [the instructions] are correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury . . . we will not view the instructions as improper. . . . [I]n appeals involving a constitutional question, [the standard is] whether it is reasonably possible that the jury [was] misled.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Valinski, </em>254 Conn. 107, 119-20, 756 A.2d 1250 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The trial court instructed the jury with respect to the first count, namely, aggravated sexual assault in the first degree, in relevant part: \u201cSexual intercourse is defined in several ways in our statute. As it pertains [to] this count, <em>it means vaginal intercourse. </em>Penetration, however slight, is sufficient <em>to complete vaginal intercourse </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court thereafter instructed the jury with respect to the second count, namely, attempted sexual assault in the first degree: \u201cI just finished charging you on [sexual assault in the first degree] as part of the first count. I don\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>think I need to repeat it at this point. I can tell you that my instruction to you on that is the same as I would instruct you on this, the second count, with two exceptions. . . . [T]he second distinction between count two and the first [count] is that the sexual intercourse claimed in this count to have been attempted <em>is fellatio rather than vaginal intercourse. </em>And I would instruct you that fellatio is, of course, <em>the act of obtaining sexual gratification by oral stimulation of the penis.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.) The trial court did not inform the jury that penetration also is a requirement of the crime of sexual assault in the first degree by fellatio.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">A careful examination of the relevant portion of the trial court\u2019s instructions; see footnote 8 of this opinion; persuades us that the jury was not likely to have understood that penetration is an element of attempted first degree sexual assault by fellatio. The trial court\u2019s reference to penetration in connection with its instruction on aggravated sexual assault in the first degree was limited to its definition of <em>vaginal intercourse-, </em>the court neither stated nor intimated that penetration is a requirement generally of the crime of attempted sexual assault in the first degree.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus, when the court referred back to its instructions on aggravated first degree sexual assault in connection with its instruction on attempted first degree sexual assault by fellatio, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>there was no reason for the jury to have known that proof of penetration was necessary to find the defendant guilty of attempted first degree sexual assault by fellatio as well as of aggravated first degree sexual assault by vaginal intercourse. That reference, therefore, was insufficient to inform the jury of the penetration element of attempted first degree sexual assault by fellatio.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">We next address the state\u2019s claim that, in the circumstances of this case, the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that penetration is an essential element of the crime of attempted first degree sexual assault by fellatio did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial on that charge. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The state advances two separate arguments in support of its claim that the defendant has failed to demonstrate that he is entitled to a new trial on the attempted first degree sexual assault charge. First, the state asserts that the trial court\u2019s definition of the word \u201cfellatio\u201d as \u201cthe act of obtaining sexual gratification by oral stimulation of the penis,\u201d coupled with the defendant\u2019s concession during his testimony that he had implored the victim to \u201click him\u201d and defense counsel\u2019s statement during closing arguments that the defendant had sought oral sex from the victim,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> satisfied the statutory requirement of penetration. Specifically, the state asserts that \u201c[u]nder the circumstances of this case, there is no reasonable possibility that any juror would have understood \u2018oral stimulation\u2019 of the penis to mean anything other than insertion of the penis into the victim\u2019s mouth.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We are not persuaded by this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Although the defendant acknowledged that he sought to have the victim <em>lick </em>his penis, he did not concede that he ever attempted to have the victim <em>insert </em>his penis <em>into </em>her mouth. The act of licking a penis does not require insertion of the penis into the mouth. Thus, the jury reasonably may have found that the defendant sought to obtain \u201csexual gratification by oral stimulation of the penis\u201d by having the victim lick his penis rather than having her insert his penis into her mouth. Contrary to the state\u2019s argument, therefore, there is a reasonable likelihood that, under the trial court\u2019s instructions, the jury convicted the defendant of attempted first degree sexual assault by fellatio without the required predicate finding of attempted \u201c[pjenetration, however slight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The state also contends that any instructional impropriety was harmless because, \u201cproperly construed, [the requirement of] \u2018penetration, however slight,\u2019 occurs whenever the penis is stimulated by the mouth, tongue or lips, whether or not the penis is actually inserted into the mouth.\u201d In support of this contention, the state asserts that the defendant\u2019s demand to the victim that she lick his penis is \u201c[no] less intrusive, demeaning or traumatizing\u201d than a demand that the victim insert his penis into her mouth and, consequently, that \u201c[t]his court should feel warranted in construing ... \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1) as intending to prohibit stimulation of the penis by the mouth, tongue or lips, regardless of whether the organ is actually placed in the mouth of the person performing the sexual act.\u201d We also are unpersuaded by this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\u201c[A] jury instruction that improperly omits an essential element from the charge constitutes harmless error if a reviewing court concludes beyond a reasonable doubt that the omitted element was <em>uncontested and supported by overwhelming evidence, </em>such that the jury verdict would have been the same absent the error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Montgomery, 254 </em>Conn. 694, 738, 759 A.2d 995 (2000), quoting <em>Neder </em>v. <em>United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 17, 119 S. Ct. 1827, 144 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1999). Thus, only if the defendant\u2019s attempt to compel the victim to lick his penis satisfies the penetration requirement of the offense of first degree sexual assault by fellatio would the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury regarding that requirement be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in light of the defendant\u2019s own testimony that he told the victim to lick his penis.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Our resolution of this issue is guided by well established principles. \u201cWe have long held that [c]riminal statutes are not to be read more broadly than their language plainly requires . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Crowell, </em>228 Conn. 393, 400, 636 A.2d 804 (1994). Thus, we begin with the proposition that \u201c[cjourts must avoid imposing criminal liability where the legislature has not <em>expressly </em>so intended . . . and ambiguities are ordinarily to be resolved in favor of the defendant.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrell, </em>238 Conn. 828, 832, 681 A.2d 944 (1996). In other words, \u201cpenal statutes are to be construed strictly and not extended by implication to create liability which no language of the act purports to create.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>234 Conn. 301, 308, 662 A.2d 732 (1995). \u201c[Tjhis does not mean [however] that eveiy criminal statute must be given the narrowest possible meaning in complete disregard of the purpose of the legislature. . . . No rule of construction . . . requires that a penal statute be strained and distorted in order to exclude conduct clearly intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>to be within its scope\u2014nor does any rule require that, the act be given the narrowest meaning. It is sufficient if the words are given their fair meaning in accord with the evident intent of [the legislature].\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Singh </em>v. Singh, 213 Conn. 637, 646, 569 A.2d 1112 (1990). \u201cThe rule that terms in a statute are to be assigned their ordinary meaning, unless context dictates otherwise; General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mattioli, </em>[210 Conn. 573, 579, 556 A.2d 584 (1989)]; also guides our interpretive inquiry.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Woods, supra, 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the issue of whether the penetration element of sexual assault in the first degree by fellatio is satisfied when the victim of the sexual assault is compelled to lick the perpetrator\u2019s penis without necessarily also being compelled to insert the penis into the mouth. We conclude that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">\u201cIn this case, neither the defendant nor the state argues that the word [penetration] in [General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (2)] is unclear or ambiguous, nor does the fact that opposing counsel contend for different meanings support such a characterization. . . . Furthermore, the text of the statute nowhere indicates that the legislature intended to assign to the word anything other than its ordinary meaning. Accordingly, in the absence of other statutory guidance, we may appropriately look to the meaning of the word as commonly expressed in the law and in dictionaries.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lubus, </em>216 Conn. 402, 407, 581 A.2d 1045 (1990); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">\u201cPenetration\u201d is defined as \u201cthe act or process of penetrating,\u201d and \u201cpenetrate\u201d means \u201cto pass <em>into </em>or through\u201d or \u201cto extend <em>into </em>the <em>interior </em>of . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Webster\u2019s Third New International <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Dictionary. Thus, under \u00a7\u00a7 53a-70 and 53a-65 (2), it is necessary for the state to establish that the defendant intended to insert his penis <em>into </em>the victim\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The act oflicking a penis does not satisfy this requirement. That act involves <em>extending </em>the tongue <em>from </em>the mouth, not <em>inserting </em>the penis <em>into </em>the mouth. The state does not seriously contest that fact, but, rather, suggests that we are not bound to follow the definition of the term \u201cpenetration\u201d strictly in circumstances, as the state contends exist in this case, in which the act sought to be compelled is as \u201crepulsive and abhorrent\u201d as the forced insertion of the penis into the mouth. We do not disagree with the state\u2019s characterization of the defendant\u2019s conduct in this case. We reject the state\u2019s argument, however, because it is contrary both to the plain language of \u00a7 53a-65 (2) and to the principle that criminal statutes \u201cmust be construed strictly against the state and liberally in favor of the accused.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Crowell, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">We also are not persuaded that the interpretation urged by the state can be squared with the purpose of the phrase \u201cpenetration, however slight.\u201d This court recently had occasion to consider the purpose of that requirement in <em>State </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>252 Conn. 795, 750 A.2d 1037 (2000), in which we stated: \u201cAlthough the plain language of the statute does not specify <em>what </em>must be penetrated, the legislature, in using the phrase [penetration, however slight, evinced an intent to incorporate, into our statutory law, the common-law least penetration doctrine. . . . We first encounter the notion that the least penetration is sufficient to complete the crime of rape<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> in <em>State </em>v. <em>Shields, </em>45 Conn. 256 (1877). [In that case] [t]he defendant requested that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>the trial court charge the jury that to constitute rape actual penetration of the <em>body </em>of the woman by the insertion into her of the private parts of the accused is absolutely necessary. Id., 259. After charging as requested, the court added, but the least penetration is sufficient .... [This] [c]ourt affirmed the charge as correct. Id., 263. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">\u201c[Thus], in . . . <em>Shields </em>... we upheld a jury charge that referred to penetration of the <em>body . . . </em>and stated that the least penetration doctrine is sufficient [to commit rape].\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>supra, 252 Conn. 804-805. In <em>Albert, </em>we concluded \u201cthat the public policy underlying our holding in <em>Shields, </em>namely, that the least penetration of the body is sufficient to commit rape, was to protect victims from unwanted <em>intrusions into the interior of their bodies </em>[and that] [t]he legislature endorsed this public policy through its codification of the phrase \u2018[penetration, however slight\u2019 in \u00a7 53a-65 (2).\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Upon application of the statutory penetration requirement in <em>Albert, </em>we concluded that, for purposes of first degree sexual assault by vaginal intercourse, the state need not prove penetration of the vagina, but, rather, penetration of the labia majora.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See id., 806, 809. In so concluding, we explained that a touching of the labium majora satisfies the penetration requirement of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-70 and 53a-65 (2) \u201cbecause penetration of the labia majora constitutes penetration of the body . . . .\u201d Id., 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\"><em>Albert </em>supports our conclusion that the penetration requirement is met, for purposes of first degree sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>assault by fellatio, when a perpetrator forcibly inserts his penis into the victim\u2019s mouth.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Upon proof of such conduct, both the plain language of \u00a7 53a-65 (2) and its purpose are satisfied: the forcible insertion of the penis into the victim\u2019s mouth constitutes an unwanted intrusion \u201cinto the interior of [the victim\u2019s] body.\u201d Id. The act of licking a penis, by contrast, does not satisfy the penetration element of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-70 and 53a-65 (2): that act simply does not involve an intrusion into the interior of the body.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> To conclude otherwise would require us to stretch the statutory language beyond its breaking point; indeed, it would require us to read the penetration element out of the statute.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Thus, as Judge Sullivan stated in his dissent from the majority opinion of the Appellate Court, the defendant\u2019s \u201cconduct would constitute [attempted] sexual <em>contact </em>[under \u00a7 53a-65 (3)]<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> rather than [attempted] sexual <em>intercourse </em>[under \u00a7 53a-65 (2)].\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>supra, 55 Conn.

App. 662. The Appellate Court rejected both of these claims; id., 664, 669; neither of which is a subject of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b543-7\"> The trial court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cGoing to the first count . . . that is, the crime of aggravated sexual assault in the first degree . . . a person is guilty of aggravated sexual assault in the first degree when such person commits sexual assault in the first degree and, in the commission of such offense, he is armed with or displays or represents by his conduct that he possesses a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">\u201cAnd now I will explain to you what is meant by sexual assault in the first degree. A person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person compels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such person or by the threat of use of force against such person, which reasonably causes such person to fear physical injury to herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">\u201cFor you to find the defendant guilty of this charge, the state must prove each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt: One, that the defendant compelled another person, [the victim], to engage in sexual intercourse, and two, that the sexual intercourse was accomplished by the use of force against [the victim], or by the threat of use of force against her, which reasonably caused [the victim] to fear physical injury to herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">\u201cSexual intercourse is defined in several ways in our statute. As it pertains [to] this count, it means vaginal intercourse. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete vaginal intercourse and does not require the emission of semen.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">\u201cI\u2019m going to read now count number two from the information. [The state] further accuses the defendant ... of the crime of attempted sexual assault in the first degree and alleges that, on the same date as in count one, at the same time as in count one and in the same place as in count one, the defendant . . . acting with the kind of mental state required for the commission of the crime of sexual assault in the first degree, intentionally did something which, under the circumstances as he believed [them] to be, was an act constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime of sexual assault in the first degree in that he attempted to compel [the victim] to engage in the act of fellatio in violation of the pertinent statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">\u201cSo, in this count, the defendant is charged with attempting to commit the crime of sexual assault in the first degree. Under our law, the attempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>to commit a crime, even if that attempt is not successful, is just as criminal as actually committing the attempted crime. This requires, therefore, that I explain to you both the elements of the crime of sexual assault in the first degree, the crime which the state claims the defendant attempted, and the elements of the crime of attempting to commit that crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">\u201cNow as to the underlying crime of sexual assault in the first degree, I just finished charging you on that particular crime as part of the first count. I don\u2019t think I need to repeat it at this point. I can tell you that my instruction to you on that is the same as I would instruct you on this, the second count, with two exceptions. First . . . there was no evidence presented relative to this second count of any threat of use of force against [the victim] by the defendant. And so you will disregard that element that pertain[s] to count one only. Secondly, the second distinction between count two and the first [count] is that the sexual intercourse claimed in this count to have been attempted is fellatio rather than vaginal intercourse. And I would instruct you that fellatio is, of course, the act of obtaining sexual gratification by oral stimulation of the penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">\u201cOtherwise, the instructions that I have given you regarding sexual assault in the first degree apply equally to this, the second count.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b544-15\"> The defendant did not object to the trial court\u2019s instructions regarding penetration and, therefore, sought to prevail on his claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).

On appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant claimed that the trial court improperly had failed to instruct the jury on the essential element of penetration with respect to the charge of attempted sexual assault in the first degree by fellatio in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1) and 53a-49 (a) (2). <em>State v. Scott, </em>55 Conn. App. 660, 667, 740 A.2d 441 (1999). The state acknowledged that the trial court did not expressly instruct the jury regarding the penetration element of that offense, but claimed that, under the circumstances of this case, the trial court\u2019s definition of the term \u201cfellatio\u201d as \u201c \u2018the act of obtaining sexual gratification by oral stimulation of the penis\u2019 id., 668; coupled with the defendant\u2019s testimony that he had sought to have the victim lick his penis, rendered any instructional impropriety harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">The Appellate Court rejected the defendant\u2019s claim of instructional impropriety. Id. The court concluded that the trial court\u2019s charge was adequate because it had apprised the jury that the instruction on the other charge against the defendant, aggravated sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70a (a) (1), informed the jury that penetration is necessary to establish vaginal sexual intercourse, and that that charge also was applicable to attempted first degree sexual assault by fellatio, the only difference being the type of intercourse charged. Id., 667-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>In this certified appeal, the defendant reasserts his claim of instructional impropriety with respect to the charge of attempted sexual assault in the first degree by fellatio. The majority of this court concludes, contrary to the determination of the Appellate Court, that the trial court improperly failed to instruct the jury that penetration is an essential element of the crime of sexual assault in the first degree by fellatio. The majority also concludes that that impropriety was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Although I agree with the majority that the trial court\u2019s reference to its prior instructions on the aggravated sexual assault charge was inadequate to inform the jury of the penetration requirement under the attempted sexual assault charge, I respectfully disagree with its determination as to harmlessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The state acknowledges that the trial court did not instruct the jury that penetration is a requirement of the crime of sexual assault in the first degree by fellatio. It claims, however, that, in the circumstances of this case, that failure did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial. Specifically, the state claims that any instructional impropriety was harmless in light of the defendant\u2019s testimony that he sought to have the victim lick his penis. I agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The standard by which harmless error in omitted jury instructions should be measured is well settled. \u201cA jury instruction that improperly omits an essential element from the charge constitutes harmless error if a reviewing court concludes beyond a reasonable doubt that the omitted element was <em>uncontested and supported by overwhelming evidence, </em>such that the jury verdict would have been the same absent error .... <em>Neder v.

Therefore, I agree with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>the majority that, \u201cif the defendant\u2019s attempt to compel the victim to lick his penis satisfies the penetration requirement of the offense of first degree sexual assault by fellatio . . . the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury regarding that requirement [was] harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in light of the defendant\u2019s own testimony that he told the victim to lick his penis.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Resolution of this issue is guided by well established principles. \u201cWe have long held that criminal statutes are not to be read more broadly than their language plainly requires . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Crowell, </em>228 Conn. 393, 400, 636 A.2d 804 (1994). \u201c[Although we recognize the fundamental principle that [penal] statutes are to be construed strictly, it is equally fundamental that the rule of strict construction does not require an interpretation which frustrates an evident legislative intent. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>236 Conn. 18, 26-27, 670 A.2d 851 (1996).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>240 Conn. 317, 330, 692 A.2d 713 (1997). \u201c[Construction should not exclude common sense so that absurdity results and the evident design of the legislature is frustrated. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pastet, </em>169 Conn. 13, 21-22, 363 A.2d 41, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 937, 96 S.

Contrary to the majority, I would conclude that it is. In other words, I do not distinguish between a penis that is stimulated orally inside the mouth and one that is stimulated orally by the tongue protruding beyond the lips.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">It is well established that, when determining the meaning of a word, \u201cit is appropriate to look to the common understanding of the term as expressed in a dictionary.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Indrisano, </em>228 Conn. 795, 809, 640 A.2d 986 (1994). \u201cPenetration\u201d generally is defined as \u201cthe act or process of penetrating,\u201d and \u201cpenetrate\u201d means \u201cto pass into or through ... to extend into the interior of . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary.

The tongue is an integral part of the mouth, in essence, its floor. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine an act of fellatio without the use of the tongue. In these particular circumstances, it is reasonable to treat the usual boundary of the mouth as having been extended by the reach of the victim\u2019s tongue beyond the lips. When the forcible extension of the victim\u2019s tongue from its usual place within the oral cavity is viewed as extending the boundary of the mouth, the conduct of the accused in compelling the victim to lick his penis reasonably may be considered a violation, or penetration, of the boundary of the mouth as so extended.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">This conclusion is supported by the fact that \u201cthe legislature, in using the phrase \u2018[pjenetration, however slight,\u2019 [in \u00a7 53a-65 (2)] evinced an intent to incorporate, into our statutory law, the common-law least penetration doctrine.\u201d Id.

We conclude that the public policy underlying our holding in Shields, namely, that the least penetration of the body is sufficient to commit rape, was to protect victims from unwanted intrusions into the interior of their bodies. </em>The legislature endorsed this public policy through its codification of the phrase [p]enetration, however slight in \u00a7 53a-65 (2).\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis altered; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>supra, 252 Conn. 804-805.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The public policy underlying the least penetration doctrine of \u00a7 53a-65 (2), which defines the term \u201csexual intercourse\u201d for puiposes of \u00a7 53a-70, would be furthered by a determination that the conduct at issue in the present case satisfies the penetration requirement of that statutory provision. Although the tongue may be extended from its usual location inside the oral cavity, it is a part of the mouth\u2019s <em>internal </em>structure. Thus, when an attacker compels his victim to lick his penis by forcibly removing the victim\u2019s tongue from inside her mouth, the gross nature of that unwanted bodily intrusion is obvious. As we have stated, \u201c[t]he penetration, however slight language of [\u00a7 53a-65 (2)] is a common-law carryover that was designed to . . . punish the fact, not the degree, of penetration.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 805. A conclusion that the defendant\u2019s conduct here does not satisfy the least penetration principle would fly in the face of common sense and, even more importantly, the clear public policy underlying our sexual assault statutes generally and \u00a7 53a-65 (2) specifically. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>251 Conn. 285, 387, 743 A.2d 1 (1999), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 84, 121 S. Ct. 106, 148 L. Ed. 2d 64 (2000) (\u201cThis court does not interpret statutes in a vacuum, nor does it refuse to consider matters of known historical fact. . . . And although criminal statutes are strictly con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>strued, it is equally fundamental that the rule of strict construction does not require an interpretation which frustrates an evident legislative intent.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">I recognize that the common definition of fellatio is oral stimulation of the penis and that fellatio can exist in the absence of penetration of the oral cavity. By adding to that definition the requirement of penetration, the legislature made mere placement of the victim\u2019s mouth on the penis insufficient as a basis upon which to convict under \u00a7 53a-70. In my view, the element of penetration is satisfied by penetration of the oral cavity, \u2022that is when the victim has been forced to extend her tongue outside the mouth\u2019s customary boundary, the lips. The extension of the victim\u2019s tongue from its customary home extends the boundary of the mouth, and the placement of the penis on the tongue constitutes actual penetration. When the defendant forcibly touches the victim\u2019s tongue with his penis, whether the victim\u2019s tongue happens to be inside or outside the mouth when the unwanted touching occurs, the penetration requirement is satisfied. A statute should not be interpreted to thwart its purpose simply because the legislature\u2019s purpose could have been more clearly stated. See <em>Frillici </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>231 Conn. 418, 435-36, 650 A.2d 557 (1994). \u201c \u2018[W]e will assume that the legislature intended to accomplish a reasonable and rational result.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>235 Conn. 502, 516, 668 A.2d 1288 (1995), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Breton, </em>235 Conn. 206, 226, 663 A.2d 1026 (1995). It is inconceivable to me that the legislature intended to draw the distinction that the defendant makes and the majority endorses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b558-8\"> The jury, by virtue of its guilty verdict on the charge of attempted sexual assault in the first degree by fellatio, necessarily found that the defendant had attempted to compel the victim to stimulate his penis orally.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b560-7\"> The crime of rape has been assimilated into our state\u2019s sexual assault statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b562-8\"> \u201cWe are not satisfied to be right, unless we can prove others to be quite wrong.\u201d W.
