Thalheim, an attorney, who seeks reversal of an order of the trial court sanctioning him for filing an amicus brief in the underlying matter; see <em>Leydon </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>57 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>App. 712, 750 A.2d 1122, cert. granted, 254 Conn. 904, 905, 755 A.2d 881, 882 (2000); <em>Leydon </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>57 Conn. App. 727, 750 A.2d 492 (2000); without first obtaining permission from the court or filing an appearance in the case. Brenden Leydon and the town of Greenwich, the plaintiff and the defendant, respectively, in the underlying action, informed this court that they did not intend to file a brief or participate in this proceeding despite being named by Thalheim as the defendants in error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We subsequently granted the motion of the attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, to intervene and be made the defendant in error in order to defend the trial court\u2019s decision. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The following facts and procedural history as set out by the Appellate Court are relevant to our resolution of this writ. \u201cIn April, 1995, Brenden P. Leydon filed an amended complaint challenging an ordinance of the defendant town of Greenwich (town) that restricts use of its public parks and public beaches to residents of the town. On August 30, 1995, the trial court ordered that notice be published inviting interested parties to apply to the court to be made parties to that action. The court\u2019s order required Leydon to publish the notice prior to September 29, 1995, in the Greenwich Time newspaper and further stated that any person desiring to be made a party to the action must apply within twenty-one days of the publication date. Thalheim did not move to intervene to become a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">\u201cThe [trial] court heard the underlying case in early 1998 with final arguments scheduled for March 26,1998. On March 23, 1998, the trial judge received, by hand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>delivery through the clerk\u2019s office, a twenty-three page \u2018Amicus Memorandum of Law In Opposition Of Relief Claimed By Plaintiff,\u2019 signed by Thaiheim. Although [Thaiheim] is an attorney admitted to the practice of law in this state, his brief did not identify him as purporting to represent any party in the action, nor did it represent that he had filed an appearance in the case or had been granted permission to file an amicus curiae brief. On March 26, 1998, the [trial] court discussed the receipt of the brief with the attorneys in the case. The consensus was that the court should not read the brief, and it did not do so.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Leydon </em>v. Greenwich, supra, 57 Conn. App. 728-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The following additional facts are also relevant to this writ. On July 8, 1998, the trial court rendered judgment for the defendants in the underlying action,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and on July 9, 1998, the court issued an order to Thaiheim to appear and show cause why he should not be sanctioned under General Statutes \u00a7 51-84<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for filing an amicus curiae brief without following the rules of practice. Because the notice did not specify which rules were alleged to have been violated, Thaiheim wrote to the trial court requesting notification as to which rules he allegedly had violated. The court thereafter informed Thaiheim that it was his burden to show the court which rule he had followed in filing the brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>At the July 22, 1998 show cause hearing, the trial court determined that an amicus curiae brief could not be filed without first obtaining permission from the court. Accordingly, it concluded that Thalheim had violated Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 3-2 through 3-8, 5-1, 10-6 and 11-1 because he had not filed an appearance in the underlying action or obtained permission from the court to file an amicus curiae brief.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court sanctioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Thalheim pursuant to \u00a7 51-84; see footnote 5 of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>opinion; ordering him \u201cto read the Connecticut Practice Book, to listen to audiocassettes available from the Connecticut Bar Association pertaining to civil practice and procedure in Connecticut courts, and to certify to the court within four months that he had listened to the tapes and read the entire Connecticut Practice Book, including the rules concerning professional conduct.\u201d <em>Leydon </em>v. Greenwich, supra, 57 Conn. App. 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Although not a party in the underlying action, Thalheim filed a direct appeal from the trial court\u2019s order in the Appellate Court, under the case caption <em>\u201cLeydon </em>v. <em>Town of </em>Greenwich,\u201d on August 7, 1998. Id. Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 67-3,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> both the plaintiff and the defendant in the underlying case indicated that they did not intend to file a brief or participate in the appeal. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>attorney general moved to intervene and be made a party defendant in order to defend the decision of the trial court. The Appellate Court granted this request. On May 16, 2000, in light of our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Salmon, </em>250 Conn. 147, 167, 735 A.2d 333 (1999), in which this court clarified that only an actual <em>party </em>to the underlying action may file an appeal, the Appellate Court dismissed Thalheim\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because Thalheim was not a party to the underlying action, the Appellate Court concluded that he had \u201cno right of appellate review pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-263. \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Leydon </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>supra, 57 Conn. App. 730-31. This writ of error by Thalheim followed. Because the parties to the underlying action again notified the court that they did not intend to participate in this proceeding, insofar as it did not affect their interests, we granted the attorney general\u2019s motion to intervene as the defendant in error (defendant).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>Thalheim claims in his writ of error that the trial court improperly sanctioned him under \u00a7 51-84 for filing an amicus curiae brief in the underlying matter without first obtaining permission from the trial court or filing an appearance in the case. Specifically, Thalheim raises two constitutional issues. First, he contends that the rules of practice are void for vagueness, both on their face and as applied to him in this case, because they do not address the filing of amicus curiae briefs in the Superior Court. Second, he maintains that \u00a7 51-84 is unconstitutional on its face because it provides for the deprivation of property without providing for notice or a hearing. In addition, Thalheim argues that the trial court\u2019s order requiring him to show cause as to why he should not be sanctioned violated his procedural due process rights because that order did not specify which rules of practice he had violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Thalheim also makes several claims that challenge the trial court\u2019s authority to sanction him. Specifically, he claims that the trial court did not meet its burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence under \u00a7 51-84 that he had violated any of the rules of practice. He argues further that, because \u00a7 51-84 requires a violation of a specific rule before sanctions may be imposed and he did not violate any of the rules of practice, the trial court improperly sanctioned him under that statute. Finally, he contends that the trial court exceeded its authority under \u00a7 51-84 by imposing sanctions beyond those enumerated in the statute. We disagree with and therefore reject all of Thalheim\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Thalheim first contends that the rules of practice are void for vagueness, both on their face and as applied. Specifically, he claims that Practice Book \u00a7 \u00a7 3-2 through 3-8, 5-1, 10-6, 11-1; see footnote 6 of this opinion; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Practice Book \u00a7 67-7<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> are void for vagueness because a person of common intelligence \u201cwould not know that the filing of an amicus curiae brief at the Superior Court ... by a nonparty [is] prohibited.\u201d He further argues that, because the submission of an amicus curiae brief implicates the first amendment right of free speech, he may levy a facial challenge to the rules of practice on vagueness grounds. We are not persuaded by either argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">It is well settled that \u201c[i]n the absence of weighty countervailing circumstances, it is improvident for the court to invalidate a statute on its face.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sweetman </em>v. <em>State Elections </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number><em>Enforcement Commission, </em>249 Conn. 296, 320, 732 A.2d 144 (1999). \u201cThe general rule is that the constitutionality of a statutory provision being attacked as void for vagueness is determined by the statute\u2019s applicability to the particular facts at issue.\u201d <em>Packer </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>246 Conn. 89, 105, 717 A.2d 117 (1998). \u201cTo do otherwise, absent the appearance that the statute in question intrudes upon fundamental guarantees, particularly first amendment freedoms, would be to put courts in the undesirable position of considering every conceivable situation which might possibly arise in the application of [the statute].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 106; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ehlers, </em>252 Conn. 579, 584, 750 A.2d 1079 (2000) (noting that \u201cwhen an allegedly vague statute implicates the first amendment right of free speech, the statute\u2019s constitutionality is tested for vagueness on its face\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Thus, when no fundamental constitutional right is implicated; <em>Ramos </em>v. <em>Vernon, </em>254 Conn. 799, 843, 761 A.2d 705 (2000); \u201cin order to challenge successfully the facial validity of a statute, a party is required to demonstrate as a threshold matter that the statute may not be applied constitutionally to the facts of his case.\u201d <em>Packer </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 106; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilchinski, </em>242 Conn. 211, 218, 700 A.2d 1 (1997) (concluding that if statute may be applied constitutionally to facts of case, facial vagueness claim fails). These principles apply with equal force to the rules of practice. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Genotti, </em>220 Conn. 796, 807, 601 A.2d 1013 (1992) (rules of statutory construction apply with equal force to rules of practice).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">In this case, Thalheim claims that, because Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 3-2 through 3-8, 5-1, 10-6, 11-1 and 67-7 implicate his first amendment rights, he may challenge their constitutionality for vagueness on their face. His argument is premised on the notion that the rules of practice, as interpreted by the trial court, <em>prohibit </em>the filing of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>amicus curiae brief in the Superior Court by a nonparty, thereby infringing his first amendment \u201cright \u2018to petition the government for redress of grievances.\u2019 \u201d We, however, read the trial court\u2019s decision differently. The trial court concluded that the rules of practice do not permit the filing of an amicus curiae brief <em>without prior permission from the </em>court; it did not conclude that those rules <em>wholly prohibit </em>the filing of an amicus brief. Nor do we interpret the rules of practice to provide as such. Therefore, because the rules of practice do <em>not prohibit </em>the filing of an amicus brief in the Superior Court, we conclude that they do not implicate the first amendment to the United States constitution. Moreover, Thalheim has made no claim that the requirement calling for court permission prior to the filing of an amicus brief violates the right of free speech. Accordingly, because no fundamental right has been implicated, Thalheim\u2019s facial challenge must fail. See <em>Ramos </em>v. <em>Vernon, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Thalheim also claims that Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 3-2 through 3-8, 5-1, 10-6, 11-1 and 67-7 are unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts of this case. In analyzing this claim, \u201cwe proceed from the well recognized jurisprudential principle that [t]he party attacking a validly enacted statute . . . bears the heavy burden of proving its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt and we indulge in every presumption, in favor of the statute\u2019s constitutionality.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>240 Conn. 766, 777, 695 A.2d 525 (1997). Again, this principle applies with equal force to the rules of practice. <em>State </em>v. <em>Genotti, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">To demonstrate that \u00a7\u00a7 3-2 through 3-8, 5-1, 10-6, 11-1 and 67-7 are unconstitutionally vague as applied to him, Thalheim must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>that the policies advanced by the void for vagueness doctrine were violated. Specifically, he must show that he had \u201cinadequate notice of what was prohibited or that [he was] the [victim] of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sweetman </em>v. <em>State Elections Enforcement Commission, </em>supra, 249 Conn. 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">\u201cBecause perfect precision is neither possible nor required . . . the [vagueness] doctrine does not mandate the invalidation of all imprecisely drafted [rules].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u201cIf the meaning of a [rule] can be fairly ascertained a [rule] will not be void for vagueness since [m]any [rules] will have some inherent vagueness, for [i]n most English words and phrases there lurk uncertainties. . . . References to judicial opinions involving the [rule], the common law, legal dictionaries, or treatises may be necessary to ascertain a [rule\u2019s] meaning to determine if it gives fair warning.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Mindful of the intrinsic ambiguity of statutory language, the United States Supreme Court; has stated that \u201c[t]he degree of vagueness that the Constitution tolerates . . . depends in part on the nature of the enactment. . . . [PJerhaps the most important factor affecting the clarity that the Constitution demands of a law is whether it threatens to inhibit the exercise of constitutionally protected rights.\u201d <em>Hoffman Estates </em>v. <em>Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 489, 498-99, 102 S. Ct. 1186, 71 L. Ed. 2d 362 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">The United States Supreme Court has also acknowledged \u201cgreater tolerance of enactments with civil rather than criminal penalties because the consequences of imprecision are qualitatively less severe.\u201d Id.; accord <em>State Management Assn. of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>204 Conn. 746, 757, 529 A.2d 1276 (1987) (\u201c[c]ivil stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>utes . . . may survive a vagueness challenge by a lesser degree of specificity than in criminal statutes\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); <em>Sweetman </em>v. <em>State Elections Enforcement Commission, </em>supra, 249 Conn. 323 (same). In the present case, because the rules of practice at issue herein are civil rules that do not implicate any fundamental constitutional rights, we must indulge in every presumption in favor of upholding them.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Sweetman </em>v. <em>State Elections Enforcement Commission, </em>supra, 324. In addition, because the rules of practice are designed for the guidance primarily of attorneys and judges\u2014as well as pro se litigants who choose to enter the realm of litigation\u2014the nature of that primary audience is significant in determining whether they are constitutionally vague. We note, moreover, in this regard that Thalheim is an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the facts and circumstances of Thalheim\u2019s void for vagueness claim. In so doing, our principal inquiry is whether Thalheim had sufficient notice and warning that he was required, under the rules of practice, to obtain court permission prior to filing an amicus curiae brief in the underlying matter.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Thalheim contends that there is no rule of practice that <em>specifically </em>addresses whether and how an individual may file an amicus curiae brief in the <em>Superior Court. </em>On that basis, he maintains that, as applied to the filing of amicus curiae briefs in the Superior Court, Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 3-2 through 3-8 governing notice of appearance, \u00a7 5-1 regarding trial briefs, \u00a7 10-6 concerning pleadings, \u00a7 11-1 regarding the form of motions, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>\u00a7 67-7 governing appellate amicus briefs, are void for vagueness because a person of common intelligence \u201cwould not know that the filing of an amicus curiae brief at the Superior Court ... by a nonparty [is] prohibited.\u201d The defendant agrees with Thalheim that there is no Superior Court rule of practice that <em>specifically </em>addresses whether and how an individual may file an amicus curiae brief in the Superior Court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendant maintains, however, that a cursory examination of legal encyclopedias, case law and existing rules of practice would have given Thalheim adequate notice that he was required to obtain court permission prior to filing an amicus brief. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>236 Conn. 561, 566, 674 A.2d 416 (1996) (granting motion by criminal defense lawyers association to appear as amicus curiae and to file brief); <em>Goodridge </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>58 Conn. App. 760, 764, 755 A.2d 329 (2000) (granting permission for Connecticut Bar Association to file amicus curiae brief); <em>Asjes </em>v. <em>Parish of Christ Church, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Stamford-Norwalk, Docket No. CV960152470S (March 11, 1997) (20 Conn. L. Rptr. 461, 466) (granting permission for amicus curiae brief); <em>Village Condominium Assn. </em>v. <em>Loricco, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Housing Session, Docket No. CVNH95117219 (December 6, 1996) (state \u201csought and received amicus curiae status\u201d); <em>Pip\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westford Asset Management, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Housing Session, Docket No. CVNH96027368 (February 9, 1996) (16 Conn. L. Rptr. 400) (court allowed appearance of amicus curiae); <em>Field </em>v. <em>Kearns, </em>Superior Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>judicial district of Fairfield, Docket No. CV930301282S (April 6, 1995) (14 Conn. L. Rptr. 35) (court permitted amicus curiae to file memorandum of law supporting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment). We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The \u201c[a]ppearance of an amicus curiae is generally authorized by the court\u2019s <em>grant of an application for the privilege </em>of appearing as amicus curiae and <em>not as of right. </em>Accordingly, the fact, extent and manner of an amicus curiae\u2019s participation is entirely <em>within the court\u2019s discretion </em>and an amicus curiae may ordinarily <em>be heard only by leave of the court.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 4 Am. Jur. 2d, Amicus Curiae \u00a7 3 (1995). Indeed, when this court and the Appellate Court resolved to allow certain individuals the <em>right </em>to file an amicus brief without court permission, we enacted a specific court rule expressly stating so. See Practice Book \u00a7 67-7 (attorney general may file amicus curiae brief as of right when constitutionality of statute is in issue). In the absence of such a rule, however, it is well settled that participation by an amicus party in a pending case \u201crests within the <em>sound discretion of the court </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) 4 Am. Jur. 2d, supra, \u00a7 8; see also <em>Northern Securities Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>191 U.S. 555, 555-56, 24 S. Ct. 119, 48 L. Ed. 299 (1903) (\u201c[w]here in a pending case application to file briefs is made by counsel not employed therein . . . it is within our discretion to allow it in any case when justified by the circumstances\u201d); <em>Eberl </em>v. <em>Scofield, </em>244 Mont. 515, 520, 798 P.2d 536 (1990) (\u201cThe Montana Rules of Civil Procedure and the Uniform District Court Rules neither provide for nor prohibit the use of briefs by amicus curiae in the district courts. This [c]ourt has stated that [t]he right to be heard as amicus curiae is within the discretion of the court.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]); <em>In re Justice, </em>59 Ohio App. 2d 78, 80, 392 N.E.2d 897 (1978) (\u201c[generally, the rule is that permitting the appearance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>of an amicus curiae and the extent of his participation in the proceedings is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court\u201d); 4 Am. Jur. 2d, supra, \u00a7 3 (\u201c[t]here are no prerequisites to the granting of amicus curiae status; but before granting such status, the court will determine if the [proffered] information is timely, useful or otheiwise necessary to the administration of justice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">An examination of existing rules of practice also supports the conclusion that the rules, as a whole, do not permit the filing of an amicus curiae brief without court permission. Practice Book \u00a7 5-1 provides that \u201c[t]he <em>parties may, as of right, </em>or shall, if the judicial authority so orders, file, at such time as the judicial authority shall determine, written trial briefs discussing the issues in the case and the factual or legal basis upon which they ought to be resolved.\u201d (Emphasis added.) By expressly providing the parties with the <em>right </em>to file written briefs, it is clear that the rules of practice do not provide such a right to nonparties, including potential amicus curiae. See <em>Gay &amp; Lesbian Law Students Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>236 Conn. 453, 476, 673 A.2d 484 (1996) (citing rule of statutory construction, expressio unius est exclusio alterius, or \u201cthe expression of one thing is the exclusion of another\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>In addition, Practice Book \u00a7 67-7, governing appellate procedure, expressly provides that \u201c[a] brief of amicus curiae in cases before the court on the merits may be filed <em>only with the permission of the court. </em>...\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thalheim contends that because this rule is a rule of <em>appellate </em>procedure, he had inadequate notice that court permission was required prior to filing an amicus brief in the <em>Superior Court. </em>We disagree. This court previously has stated that \u201c[a] statute is not unconstitutional merely because a person must inquire further as to the precise reach of its prohibitions, nor is it necessary that a statute fist the exact conduct prohibited.\u201d <em>Packer </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 246 Conn. 101. That same principle applies in this case. Had Thalheim inquired further as to the exact reach of \u00a7 67-7, he would have learned that he was required to obtain permission from the trial court prior to filing an amicus brief in the underlying matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">We conclude that Thalheim, upon being apprised of the language of Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 5-1, 3-7 (a) and 67-7, as well as the voluminous literature and prior case law involving amicus curiae participation in pending cases, was adequately warned and on notice that court permission is required prior to the filing of an amicus brief in the Superior Court. In addition, we note that Thalheim testified at the show cause hearing that he had been practicing law for more than fifteen years. Therefore, he is expected to have superior knowledge on general court procedure based on his status as an attorney and his ability to access literature on court procedure. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFrancesco, </em>235 Conn. 426, 446, 668 A.2d 348 (1995) (because defendant had \u201cheightened knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>edge\u201d of bobcats she had adequate warning that possession of hybrid bobcat violated General Statutes \u00a7 26-40a). Indeed, as a member of the Connecticut bar, he is expected to <em>know </em>the rules of practice. The combination of these factors provided Thalheim with adequate notice that filing an amicus brief without court permission violates the mies of practice. Accordingly, on the facts of this case, the mies of practice are not unconstitutionally vague as applied to Thalheim\u2019s conduct in the filing of an amicus brief in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Thalheim next claims that \u00a7 51-84 is unconstitutional on its face under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution because it provides for the deprivation of property without notice or a hearing.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> He also maintains that the trial court violated his fourteenth amendment due process rights by failing to specify, prior to the show cause hearing, which rules of practice he had violated in filing his amicus curiae brief in the underlying matter. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">\u201cIt is important, at the outset, to recognize that the challenge of any state statute on constitutional grounds imposes a difficult burden on the challenger.\u201d <em>Heslin </em>v. <em>Connecticut Law Clinic of Trantolo &amp; </em>Trantolo, 190 Conn. 510, 522, 461 A.2d 938 (1983). As noted previously, \u201c[w]e have consistently held that every statute is presumed to be constitutional and have required invalidity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>to be established beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id.; <em>Eielson </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>179 Conn. 552, 557, 427 A.2d 814 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Olds, 171 </em>Conn. 395, 411, 370 A.2d 969 (1976); <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Rubinow, </em>157 Conn. 150, 152-53, 251 A.2d 49 (1968). \u201cIn the absence of weighty countervailing circumstances, it is improvident for the court to invalidate a statute on its face. ... In construing a statute, the court must search for an effective and constitutional construction that reasonably accords with the legislature\u2019s underlying intent.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sassone </em>v. <em>Lepore, </em>226 Conn. 773, 778, 629 A.2d 357 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">A procedural due process challenge to the validity of \u00a7 51-84 cannot proceed in the abstract. \u201cA claim that a statute fails, on its face, to comport with the constitutional requirements of procedural due process reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the law of due process. Due process is inherently fact-bound because due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands. . . . The constitutional requirement of procedural due process thus invokes a balancing process that cannot take place in a factual vacuum.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 779; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>189 Conn. 471, 476, 457 A.2d 290 (noting that due process \u201cis not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), appeal dismissed, 464 U.S. 801, 104 S. Ct. 46, 78 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1983). Therefore, Thalheim\u2019s facial procedural due process challenge must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Although ThaLheim was afforded a hearing in this case, he nevertheless, makes a veiled \u201cas applied\u201d challenge to \u00a7 51-84. Specifically, he claims that the <em>trial court </em>violated his due process rights by ordering him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>to appear and show cause as to why he should not be sanctioned for filing an amicus brief without following the rules of practice. He claims that, because the trial court\u2019s order did not specify which rules of practice he had violated, he did not have fair notice of the charges against him prior to the show cause hearing and, therefore, was deprived of a meaningful opportunity to be heard.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">\u201cAt their core, the due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions require that one subject to a significant deprivation of liberty or property must be accorded adequate notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Council on Probate Judicial Conduct re: James H. Kinsella, </em>193 Conn. 180, 207, 476 A.2d 1041 (1984); see <em>CFM of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chowdhury, </em>239 Conn. 375, 393, 685 A.2d 1108 (1996) (\u201cAs a procedural matter, before imposing . . . sanctions, the court must afford the sanctioned party or attorney a proper hearing on the . . . motion for sanctions. . . . There must be fair notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the record.\u201d [Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]), overruled on other grounds, <em>State </em>v. <em>Salmon, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 154-55; see also <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Botwick, </em>226 Conn. 299, 308, 627 A.2d 901 (1993) (before disciplined, attorney entitled to notice of charges, fair hearing and appeal to court for determination of whether he was deprived of due process). These requirements apply to the imposition of sanctions. See, e.g., <em>CFM of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chowdhury, </em>supra, 393; <em>In the Matter of Presnick, </em>19 Conn. App. 340, 34951, 563 A.2d 299, cert. denied, 213 Conn. 801, 567 A.2d 833 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">In the context of attorney misconduct proceedings, this court previously has stated that notice must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>\u201csufficiently intelligible and informing to advise the . . . attorney of the accusation or accusations made against him, to the end that . . . [he] may prepare to meet the charges against him .... If this condition is satisfied, so that the accused is fully and fairly apprised of the charge or charges made, the complaint is sufficient to give him an opportunity to be fully and fairly heard . . . .\u201d <em>In re Peck, </em>88 Conn. 447, 453, 91 A. 274 (1914). This court also has explained that \u201ca hearing such as this is not the trial of a criminal or civil action or suit, but an investigation by the court into the conduct of one of its own officers, and that, therefore, while the complaint should be sufficiently informing to advise the . . . attorney of the charges made against him, it is not required that it be marked by the same precision of statement, or conformity to the recognized formalities or technicalities of pleadings, as are expected in complaints in civil or criminal actions.\u201d <em>Grievance Committee of the Bar of New Haven County </em>v. <em>Sinn, </em>128 Conn. 419, 424-25, 23 A.2d 516 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">In this case, the trial court issued an order to Thalheim to appear and \u201cshow cause why [he] should not be sanctioned under [\u00a7] 51-84 for filing an amicus curiae brief without following the [r]ules of [practice.\u201d Thus, there is no question that the trial court\u2019s order adequately apprised Thalheim of the nature of the charges against him, namely, that he had violated the rules of practice in his attempt to file an amicus curiae brief in the underlying matter. Cf. <em>In re Peck, </em>supra, 88 Conn. 454 (concluding that notice requirement satisfied where \u201cthe charges of misconduct [were] there\u201d; complaint need not contain \u201csuch distinct and precise specification and characterization of acts of misconduct as would be incorporated into a criminal indictment, or even a well-drafted civil complaint\u201d). In addition, the record before this court reflects that Thalheim was given a full and fair opportunity at the show cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>hearing to respond to the charges against him. Therefore, we conclude that, because Thalheim received adequate notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard, his due process claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Thalheim next contends that the trial court failed to meet its burden of proof under \u00a7 51-84, to establish by clear and convincing evidence that he had violated a specific rale of practice. He further claims that because \u00a7 51-84 requires a violation of a specific rale prior to the imposition of sanctions, the court improperly sanctioned him under that statute. Finally, he maintains the trial court exceeded its authority because the sanctions it imposed were beyond those enumerated in \u00a7 51-84. These claims have no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">Thalheim\u2019s first contention regarding the trial court\u2019s failure to meet its burden of proof under \u00a7 51-84 requires little comment. Thalheim claims that because the trial court initiated an action against him, it took on the role of a plaintiff and, therefore, was required to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that he had violated the rales of practice. Because the trial court did not prove that Thalheim had violated a specific rule of practice, Thalheim claims that it failed to meet its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">The phrase \u201cburden of proof\u2019 has been defined as \u201cthe necessity or duty of affirmatively proving <em>a, fact or facts in dispute </em>on an issue <em>raised between the parties </em>in a cause.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th Ed. 1968); see also J. Berman, Connecticut Evidence (1953) p. 64 (defining burden of proof as \u201cburden which rests upon every <em>party </em>to a cause\u201d of going forward with the evidence <em>if it is in dispute </em>[emphasis added]). \u201cClear and convincing evidence\u201d refers to the quantum of <em>factual </em>proof required for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>the court to find facts. <em>Council on Probate Judicial Conduct re: James H. Kinsella, </em>supra, 193 Conn. 190-91; <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Presnick, </em>18 Conn. App. 316, 322, 559 A.2d 220 (1989). In this case, Thalheim has not challenged the factual basis of the trial court\u2019s decision as being clearly erroneous. Indeed, it is an undisputed fact that Thalheim filed an amicus brief without permission and without entering an appearance. See <em>Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut </em>v. <em>Mohegan Tribe &amp; Nation, Inc., </em>255 Conn. 358, 379, 769 A.2d 34 (2001) (\u201c[w]here the factual basis of the [trial] court\u2019s decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out . . . are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Put another way, because it is undisputed, there <em>is </em>clear and convincing evidence that Thalheim filed an amicus curiae brief in the underlying matter without court permission and without entering an appearance. Accordingly, Thalheim\u2019s claim has no merit.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Thalheim next contends that sanctions may be imposed under \u00a7 51-84 <em>only </em>for the violation of a <em>specific rule. </em>On that basis, he claims that, because he did not violate any of the rules of practice, the imposition of sanctions against him was improper. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">At the outset, we reiterate, as discussed in part I of this opinion, that, insofar as the Practice Book rules, specifically \u00a7\u00a7 5-1 and 3-8, only authorize <em>parties </em>to file trial briefs and require attorneys to file appearances prior to addressing the court, Thalheim violated these rules by filing a brief without authorization and without entering an appearance. Accordingly, we reject Thalheim\u2019s claim that he did not violate any specific rule of practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Moreover, we conclude that the failure of the trial court to identify any <em>one </em>specific rule of practice did not undermine its authority to sanction Thalheim. \u201cThe trial court; has the authority to regulate the conduct of attorneys and has a duty to enforce the standards of conduct regarding attorneys.\u201d <em>Bergeron </em>v. <em>Mackler, </em>225 Conn. 391, 397, 623 A.2d 489 (1993). The court also has the \u201cinherent power ... to discipline members of the bar, and to provide for the imposition of reasonable sanctions to compel the observance of its rules\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Gionfrido </em>v. <em>Wharf Realty, Inc., </em>193 Conn. 28, 33, 474 A.2d 787 (1984); <em>\u201ceven in the absence of a specific rule or order of the court that is claimed to have been violated. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>CFM of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chowdhury, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 393; cf. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Botwick, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 299 (reference to specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>rules does not constitute only basis for finding of guilt in attorney misconduct proceedings; reference to specific rule simply assists trial court in determining whether professional misconduct occurred). Section 51-84, \u201cby its broader language, encompassing all judicial proceedings, recognizes the inherent power of courts to impose sanctions against attorneys.\u201d <em>In re Mongillo, </em>190 Conn. 686, 692, 461 A.2d 1387 (1983), overruled on other grounds, <em>State </em>v. <em>Salmon, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 154. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court reasonably concluded that Thalheim knew of his obligations under <em>several </em>Practice Book provisions and our case law and that he had disregarded those obligations.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Finally, Thalheim claims that the trial court exceeded its authority under \u00a7 51-84 by imposing sanctions beyond those enumerated in the statute. Specifically, he maintains that \u00a7 51-84 authorizes only two types of sanctions: a maximum of $100 fine, or suspension or displacement from the bar. Accordingly, he claims that the trial court exceeded its authority in ordering him to read the Practice Book and to listen to audiocassettes available from the Connecticut Bar Association pertaining to civil practice and procedure in Connecticut courts. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">As noted previously, \u201cit is an inherent power of the court to discipline members of the bar, and to provide for the imposition of reasonable sanctions to compel the observance of its mies.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gionfrido </em>v. <em>Wharf Realty, Inc., </em>supra, 193 Conn. 33. \u201cA court disciplining an attorney does so not to punish the attorney, but rather to safeguard the administration of justice and to protect the public from the misconduct or unfitness of those who are members of the legal profession. <em>In re Durant, </em>80 Conn. 140, 147, 67 A. 497 (1907).\u201d <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Fountain, </em>56 Conn. App. 375, 378, 743 A.2d 647 (2000); see also <em>In re Dodson, </em>214 Conn. 344, 354, 572 A.2d 328, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 896, 111 S. Ct, 247, 112 L. Ed. 2d 205 (1990) (\u201c[t]he trial judge . . . has the duty to deter and correct misconduct of attorneys with respect to their obligations as officers of the court to support the authority of the court and enable the trial to proceed with dignity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">With these principles in mind, we previously have determined that \u201c [appropriate sanctions include, but <em>are not limited to </em>fining the attorney in accordance with [\u00a7] 51-84 . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gionfrido </em>v. <em>Wharf Realty, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>supra, 193 Conn. 34. Indeed, \u201c[a] court is free to determine in each case, as may seem best in light of the entire record before it, whether a sanction is appropriate and, if so, <em>what the sanction should be. Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Shluger, </em>230 Conn. 668, 678-79, 646 A.2d 781 (1994).\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. Fountain, supra, 56 Conn. App. 378; see also <em>In re Peck, </em>supra, 88 Conn. 457 (\u201c[T]he power of the courts is left unfettered to act as situations, as they may arise, may seem to require, for efficient discipline of misconduct .... Such statutes as ours are not restrictive of the inherent powers which reside in courts to inquire into the conduct of their own officers, and to discipline them for misconduct.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">\u201cAs with any discretionary action of the trial court, appellate review requires every reasonable presumption in favor of the action, and the ultimate issue for us is whether the trial court could have reasonably concluded as it did.\u201d <em>Biro </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>231 Conn. 462, 465, 650 A.2d 541 (1994); see also <em>Higgins </em>v. <em>Karp, </em>239 Conn. 802, 808, 687 A.2d 539 (1997). Therefore, whether this court would have imposed a different sanction for the defendant is irrelevant. Cf. <em>Gionfrido </em>v. <em>Wharf Realty Inc., </em>supra, 193 Conn. 34 (concluding that trial court did not abuse its discretion in choosing more powerful sanction of dismissing case rather than more moderate sanction directed at attorney himself). Rather, we must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that the appropriate sanction was for Thalheim to read the Practice Book and listen to civil procedure tapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">In this case, the trial court determined that Thalheim lacked a basic understanding of civil procedure and the rules of practice. Specifically, the trial court concluded that, in filing an amicus curiae brief without permission from the court, Thalheim had violated Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 3-2 through 3-8, 5-1, 10-6 and 11-1. In addition, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>trial court expressed its concern that an unsolicited amicus curiae brief could contain facts or arguments that prejudice the parties, or scandalous material about the parties or their attorneys that should not be before the court. See <em>Abington Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Heublein, </em>246 Conn. 815, 825-26, 717 A.2d 1232 (1998) (trial judge should have recused himself after visiting property that was subject of pending action and discussing case with person residing near property). Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the trial court reasonably could have found that a sanctions order was appropriate. We further conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in requiring the defendant to read the Practice Book and to listen to civil procedure tapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The writ of error is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-10\"> Named as defendants in error in the writ were: the town of Greenwich; the board of selectmen of Greenwich; John Margenot, first selectmen of Greenwich in 1995; the Lucas Point Association, Inc.; and Brenden P.

See part I A of this opinion. Therefore, this case does not implicate the first amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b662-9\"> Thalheim has made no claim that he was the victim of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b663-6\"> The defendant notes that some trial courts have concluded that they have no authority to grant a motion to appear as amicus curiae. See, e.g., <em>Bristol Resource Recovery Facility Operating Committee </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at New Britain, Docket No. 0453461 (June 30, 1995); <em>Sevetz </em>v. <em>Coe, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. 700275 (December 26,1990) (3 Conn. L. Rptr. 93).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b665-7\"> The trial court also cited several additional rales of practice that should have put Thalheim on notice that court permission was required prior to filing an amicus curiae brief in the Superior Court. For example, Practice Book \u00a7 3-7 (a) expressly provides that \u201c[e]xcept by leave of the judicial authority, no attorney shall be permitted to appear in court or to be heard in behalf of a party until the attorney\u2019s appearance has been entered. . . The trial court\u2019s point in citing this particular rule was simply to show that, although Thalheim was not representing a particular party in the underlying action, he nevertheless was on notice that prior to filing atiythini7 in the Superior Court, he was required, at a minimum, to enter an appearance with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">The trial court also cited Practice Book \u00a7 10-6, which refers to pleadings that are allowed and the order in which they are to be filed. See footnote 6 of this opinion. The court\u2019s point in referring to this rule of practice was to show that it does not otherwise authorize the filing of an amicus brief without permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Finally, the trial court referred to Practice Book \u00a7 11-1, which prescribes the procedure for filing motions, requests, applications and objections. See footnote 6 of this opinion. In citing this rule of practice, the court noted that, at the very least, upon reading this rule, Thalheim should have been apprised that some sort of permission was needed prior to filing an amicus brief. We agree with the trial court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b667-8\"> Section 1 of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution provides: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b669-8\"> Thalheim acknowledges that he in fact had a hearing before the imposition of any sanction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b672-6\"> Thalheim also maintains that the trial court\u2019s order, requiring him to appear and show cause why he should not be sanctioned for violating the rules of practice, improperly placed the burden of proof upon him to show that he had not violated the rules. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">This court previously has stated that \u201can order to show cause has simply the effect of notice of a motion.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Gilhuly\u2019s Petition, </em>124 Conn. 271, 282, 199 A. 436 (1938). In this case, the order to show cause put Thalheim on notice that the court believed he had no authority under the rules of practice to file an amicus curiae brief in the manner that he had done. Thalheim was given a hearing, at which he could have \u201cshown cause\u201d as to why he should not be sanctioned. That is, he could have shown that he in fact <em>had </em>the authority to file an amicus brief. Therefore, the trial court properly informed Thalheim at the hearing: \u201cYou\u2019re a member of the bar and [are] presumed to know the rules. The rules of law in trial practice are the Practice Book, so you\u2019re presumed to know those rules. So the burden is on you to tell me where I say to you that you improperly filed the amicus brief for you to say to me, \u2018Judge, I beg to differ with you. Here\u2019s the authority under which I\u2019ve filed it . . . .\u2019\u201d Thus, the court did not place the burden on Thalheim to show that he had not violated the rules of practice. Rather, having provided Thalheim with notice that it believed he had violated the rules and had improperly filed an amicus brief, and having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>been unpersuaded by his response, the court concluded from its own observations and proper construction of the rules that Thalheim had violated the rules of practice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b674-6\"> To the extent that Thalheim claims that the trial court was required to make a finding of bad faith before sanctioning him, we disagree. \u201c[A]ny . . . court may fine an attorney for <em>transgressing </em>its rules . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 51-84 (b). The plain language of the statute does not mandate a finding of bad faith prior to the imposition of sanctions. Moreover, this court has never interpreted \u00a7 51-84 to require bad faith. Cf. <em>Gionfrido </em>v. <em>Wharf Realty, Inc., </em>supra, 193 Conn. 28 (trial court\u2019s dismissal of case for failure of plaintiffs counsel to timely appear and prosecute case was not abuse of discretion despite counsel\u2019s contention that traffic conditions contributed to his delay); <em>In re Application of Courtney, </em>162 Conn. 518, 523, 294 A.2d 569 (1972) (noting in context of disbarment procedure that \u201cthe [trial] court is not restricted in this function to removal solely for misconduct. Any unfitness\u2014whether moral, mental, educational or otherwise\u2014will constitute just cause for denying one the power to act as an attorney.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">In addition, Thalheim\u2019s reliance on <em>Fattibene </em>v. <em>Kealey, </em>18 Conn. App. 344, 359-60, 558 A.2d 677 (1989), and <em>CFM of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chowdhury, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 402, for the proposition that bad faith is an essential prerequisite to the imposition of sanctions is misplaced. At issue in both of those cases was the inherent authority of the trial court to award <em>attorney\u2019s fees to an opposing party, </em>not the authority of the court to impose sanctions against an attorney for violating a rule of practice or order of the court. Although an award of attorney\u2019s fees generally requires bad faith; <em>CFM of Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chowdhury, </em>supra, 401; an order of sanctions against an attorney under \u00a7 51-84 mandates no such finding. Cf. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Presnick, </em>supra, 18 Conn. App. 322 (concluding that \u201c[w]hile the trial court may consider evidence of good motives and good faith in reaching its conclusions, neither of the disciplinary rules involved requires a finding of corrupt motive or bad faith\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court was not required to make a finding of bad faith prior to sanctioning Thalheim under \u00a7 51-84.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
