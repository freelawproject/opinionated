We conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding of manifest necessity was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">The record discloses the following pertinent facts. The defendant, James Tate, was charged with the intentional murder of the victim, Carol Chapman, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 <em>SSa-\u00f3ia.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At trial, the state claimed that the defendant intentionally had caused the death of the victim by manual strangulation. The defendant denied having caused the victim\u2019s death intentionally. He raised several weaknesses in the state\u2019s case and suggested, in accordance with his earlier statement to the police, that after they had smoked crack cocaine together, the victim started to choke and that he may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>have damaged the victim\u2019s neck accidentally while trying to help her.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">In addition to the crime of murder as charged in the one count information, the trial court, <em>Nigro, J., </em>instructed the jury, at the request of the state, on the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On its own motion, the trial court also instructed the jury on the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56 (a) (l),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, at the defendant\u2019s request, the trial court also charged the jury on criminally negligent homicide in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-58.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">As part of its charge, the trial court also advised the jury that it could not deliberate on a lesser included offense unless and until it first unanimously had acquitted the defendant on the greater charge. Specifically, following its instructions on murder, the trial court stated the following to the jury: \u201cUnder this rule of law [you may consider lesser included offenses] if and only if you find that the proof is not sufficient to justify conviction of the crime of murder specifically charged, you must then go on to consider whether it is sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant\u2019s guilt of a lesser included crime as I shall define those crimes for you. Therefore, if you do find the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>guilty <em>of </em>the crime charged, that is, if you do find the state has proved all the elements of the crime of murder beyond a reasonable doubt, you need go no further in your deliberations and your verdict will be guilty as charged. If, however, you do not find him guilty of the specific crime charged, murder, you must then go on to consider whether he is guilty of any of the lesser included offenses that I\u2019m going to describe, that is, manslaughter in the first degree by reckless indifference, manslaughter in the second degree or criminally negligent homicide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">After advising the jury of the elements of first degree manslaughter, the trial court stated: \u201cIf you have determined that the state has failed to prove the elements of the crime of murder . . . and also has failed to prove the elements of the crime of manslaughter in the first degree, you should then consider if the State has proven . . . the offense of manslaughter in the second degree.\u201d Thereafter, following its instructions on the elements of manslaughter in the second degree, the trial court told the jury: \u201cFinally, if you find that the state has failed to prove the crime of manslaughter in the second degree, you should finally come to consider whether the state has proven the elements of the offense of criminally negligent homicide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The trial court then provided the jury with the following summary of its prior instructions: \u201cFirst, has the state proven the defendant guilty of the crime of murder as charged. Secondly, if the state has not proven the defendant guilty of the crime of murder, has the state proven the defendant guilty of the crime of manslaughter in the first degree. . . . [I]f the state has not proven the elements of the crime of manslaughter in the second degree by reason of reckless indifference, has the state proven the element of the crime of manslaughter in the second degree reckless indifference, first degree, second degree. And finally, if the state hasn\u2019t proved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>any of those, has the state proven the elements of the crime of criminally negligent homicide. Or if the state hasn\u2019t proved anything, your verdict must be not guilty.\u201d Lastly, before allowing the juiy to commence its deliberations, the trial court provided them with a written list summarizing the possible verdicts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">On September 30,1999, the third day of deliberations, the trial court received a note from the jury requesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>that the pertinent criminal statutes be provided to it in writing. The jury then sought clarification on how circumstantial evidence can be used to determine recklessness, an element of first and second degree manslaughter.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thereafter, the jury sent another note indicating that it was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. In response, the trial court delivered a \u201cChip Smith\u201d instruction<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> asking them to make another effort to reach a verdict. Before asking them to return to the jury deliberation room, the trial court provided the jury with a template for guidance. Specifically, the trial court stated: \u201cConsider first the crime that\u2019s charged in the information, that is, the crime of murder. If you\u2019re unconvinced that the state has proven that count, that charge beyond a reasonable [doubt], then you should return a verdict\u2014your decision would be not guilty of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u201cIf you find the state hasn\u2019t proven the murder, next consider whether or not the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree. You have that explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u201cIf you all agree that the state hasn\u2019t proven that count, then consider the next count, the next lesser one, that is, manslaughter in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>\u201cAnd if you have concluded that the state hasn\u2019t proven that count, then consider the last count of criminally negligent homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u201cIf none of you can come to an agreement on the first count and you can\u2019t come to a unanimous agreement on the second count and you can\u2019t come to a unanimous agreement on the third count and you can\u2019t come to a unanimous agreement on the final count, then, of course, you can\u2019t come to an agreement, a unanimous agreement. But I\u2019m just going to ask you again to go back and see and make an effort to see if you can resolve this because you\u2019ve spent a lot of time on it, all of you have. You\u2019ve spent a lot of time discussing the issues and so on and it would require a second trial, if you come back and say you can\u2019t reach a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\u201cIf you feel the state hasn\u2019t proven the defendant guilty, then have no reluctance in returning a verdict of not guilty, but you have to be satisfied that the state hasn\u2019t proven the element of any of these crimes or if all of you can\u2019t come to a decision on these matters, then, of course, you just can\u2019t come to a decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">\u201cI\u2019m going to ask you to make one more effort to see if you can resolve the situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Another note followed, again reflecting the jury\u2019s inability to reach a unanimous verdict. Concluding that there was no point to bringing the jury back for another Chip Smith instruction, the trial court determined that it should discharge the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">The defendant then requested the court to inquire of the juiy as to whether it had reached a partial verdict. Specifically, the defendant argued that, consistent with <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>227 Conn. 566, 630 A.2d 1064 (1993),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>and pursuant to the trial court\u2019s instructions, the jury could not have deliberated regarding first degree manslaughter until it had acquitted him first of the murder charge, and it could not have deliberated regarding second degree manslaughter until it had acquitted him first of first degree manslaughter. On the basis of the earlier note regarding the clarification of recklessness, an element that pertains both to first and second degree manslaughter, the defendant claimed that the jury unanimously had agreed that he was not guilty of murder, and that perhaps he was not guilty of either first or second degree manslaughter. Relying on Practice Book \u00a7 42-29,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Aparo, </em>223 Conn. 384, 391, 614 A.2d 401 (1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 972, 113 S. Ct. 1414, 122 L. Ed. 2d 785 (1993), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Goodman, </em>35 Conn. App. 438, 447, 646 A.2d 879, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 940, 653 A.2d 824 (1994), the defendant contended that the trial court had the authority to obtain a partial verdict, and that, if the jury indeed had acquitted him of murder, as he had argued, the state would be precluded from retrying him under the double jeopardy protection afforded under both the state and federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>constitutions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s request, concluding that the record as to whether the jury had reached a verdict was ambiguous, and that, because this case did not involve multiple counts, there was no authority to support his position. The defendant responded that, even if the record had been ambiguous, the trial court had the <em>ability </em>and the <em>obligation </em>to clarify the record by asking whether the jury had reached a partial verdict. Nevertheless, the trial court declared a mistrial and discharged the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">On December 1,1999, the defendant filed an amended motion to dismiss, outlining the aforementioned procedural history. He claimed that the trial court improperly had declared a mistrial in the absence of manifest necessity. Additionally, the defendant asserted, on the basis of attached affidavits from seven of the twelve jurors, that, had the trial court granted his request for a partial verdict, the jury would have reported verdicts of not guilty as to the crimes of murder and first degree manslaughter. According to the affidavits, the jurors were deadlocked only on the offense of second degree manslaughter.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The affidavits aside, in the absence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>inquiry sought by the defendant, the defendant main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>tained that there had been no manifest necessity for declaring a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s amended motion to dismiss. In its memorandum of decision, the court first pointed to its instructions to the jury authorizing it, in accordance with <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 566, to consider a lesser included offense only after it had acquitted the defendant of the greater offense. The court concluded nonetheless that \u201cthere was no basis in assuming that the jury had resolved the issue of the crime of murder just because of the request for clarification [of an element in the manslaughter charges], especially since the note appeared to be from a juror other than the foreperson.\u201d Additionally, the trial court noted that, because \u201cthe only crime charged in the information was that of murder, there was no basis for such an inquiry since the jury had been instructed not to address the lesser charges unless it found the state had failed to prove the crime of murder, in which event it was to return a verdict of not guilty of murder.\u201d The jury\u2019s failure to report a partial verdict as to the crime of murder apparently led the trial court to conclude that the jury had not reached a verdict as to that charge. Although later in its memorandum of decision the trial court recognized that it was reasonably possible that the jury had been misled by its <em>Sawyer </em>instructions, the trial court nevertheless denied the defendant\u2019s amended motion to dismiss, concluding that, because the jury ultimately indicated that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>unable to reach a verdict, the court had had a reasonable basis for declaring a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">The defendant appealed from the denial of his motion to dismiss to the Appellate Court, claiming that the trial court had violated his rights against double jeopardy when, by rejecting his request to inquire of the jury whether it had reached a partial verdict, the trial court improperly declared a mistrial in the absence of manifest necessity. Accordingly, he contends that the trial court improperly denied his motion to dismiss. The defendant also claimed that the trial court improperly had denied his motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds by failing to consider the affidavits that demonstrated that the jurors, in fact, had reached a verdict acquitting him of murder and first degree manslaughter. We agree with the defendant that the trial court improperly declared a mistrial in the absence of manifest necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Following our transfer of the appeal to this court, the state filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to consider this interlocutory appeal. Because the order from which the defendant has appealed is not a final judgment, it is an interlocutory proceeding, and is appealable in two narrowly defined circumstances, neither of which, according to the state, is satisfied in this case. Although we agree that the defendant\u2019s appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss is an interlocutory order, we disagree with the state\u2019s contention that this order is not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">There is a small class of cases that meets the test of being effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment and therefore, is subject to interlocutory review. The paradigmatic case in this group involves the right against double jeopardy. <em>State </em>v. <em>Moeller, </em>178 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Conn. 67, 420 A.2d 1153, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 950, 100 S. Ct. 423, 62 L. Ed. 2d 320 (1979). Because jeopardy attaches at the commencement of trial, to be vindicated at all, a colorable double jeopardy claim must be addressed by way of interlocutory review. The right not to be tried necessarily falls into the category of rights that can be enjoyed only if vindicated prior to trial, and, consequently, falls within the second prong of <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983) (otherwise interlocutory order appealable in two circumstances: \u201c[1] where the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding, or [2] where the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them\u201d). See <em>Shay </em>v. <em>Rossi, 253 </em>Conn. 134, 167, 749 A.2d 1147 (2000) (because criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional double jeopardy right includes right not even to be tried for same offense, denial of motion to dismiss criminal charges, filed on basis of colorable claim of double jeopardy, is immediately appealable final judgment under second prong of Curcio).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">We have entertained several interlocutory appeals from denials of motions to dismiss based on double jeopardy claims. See <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-AB), </em>195 Conn. 303, 305-309, 488 A.2d 778 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Aillon, </em>189 Conn. 416, 425, 456 A.2d 279, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 837, 104 S. Ct. 124, 78 L. Ed. 2d 122 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Seravalli, </em>189 Conn. 201, 206 n.6, 455 A.2d 852, cert. dismissed, 461 U.S. 920, 103 S. Ct. 2076, 77 L. Ed. 2d 291 (1983). That constitutional right not only protects against being twice punished but also \u201cis a guarantee against being twice put to trial for the same offense.\u201d <em>Abney </em>v. <em>United States, </em>431 U.S. 651, 661, 97 S. Ct. 2034, 52 L. Ed. 2d 651 (1977). The onlyreal questionis whether the double jeopardy claim is colorable.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">For a claim to be colorable, the defendant need not convince the trial court that he necessarily will prevail; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>he must demonstrate simply that he <em>might </em>prevail. As our discussion of the substantive issue in part II of this opinion demonstrates, the defendant\u2019s claim satisfies the test. Accordingly, we conclude that we have jurisdiction to consider this interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">We begin with a brief review of our double jeopardy jurisprudence. When a criminal defendant objects to the declaration of a mistrial, as he did in the case before us, and the mistrial is declared for reasons that the trial court properly concluded amounted to \u201cmanifest necessity,\u201d his right to have his trial completed by his chosen tribunal is no longer protected and the double jeopardy clause does not bar a second trial. <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>410 U.S. 458, 463, 93 S. Ct. 1066, 35 L. Ed. 2d 425 (1973). In construing the double jeopardy clause of the United States constitution in the context of a declaration of a mistrial over a defendant\u2019s objection, the seminal decision is <em>United States </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 6 L. Ed. 165 (1824). That case enjoys continued vitality. <em>See Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 506, 98 S. Ct. 824, 54 L. Ed. 2d 717 (1978); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. 600, 606-607, 96 S. Ct. 1075, 47 L. Ed. 2d 267 (1976); <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>supra, 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Justice Story, writing for the United States Supreme Court in <em>Perez, </em>supra, set forth standards for determining when to order a retrial after a mistrial has been declared over a defendant\u2019s objection. \u201cWe think, that in all cases of this nature, the law has invested Courts of justice with the authority to discharge a juiy from giving any verdict, whenever, in their opinion, taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is a manifest necessity for the act, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated. They are to exercise a sound discretion on the subject; and it is impossible to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>define all the circumstances, which would render it proper to interfere. To be sure, the power ought to be used with the greatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes; and, in capital cases especially, Courts should be extremely careful how they interfere with any of the chances of life, in favor of the prisoner. But, after all, they have the right to order the discharge; and the security which the public have for the faithful, sound, and conscientious exercise of this discretion, rests, in this, as in other cases, upon the responsibility of the Judges, under their oaths of office.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>supra, 22 U.S. 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">The United States Supreme Court posits that \u201c[t]he words \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 appropriately characterize the magnitude of the prosecutor\u2019s burden.\u201d <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 434 U.S. 505. Because of the importance of the defendant\u2019s right to have his trial concluded by a particular tribunal, \u201cthe prosecutor must shoulder the burden of justifying the mistrial if he is to avoid the double jeopardy bar. His burden is a heavy one. The prosecutor must demonstrate \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 for any mistrial declared over the objection of the defendant.\u201d Id. With respect to construction of the terms \u201cmanifest necessity,\u201d a \u201chigh degree\u201d of necessity is required before a conclusion may be reached that a mistrial is appropriate, and it is apparent that whether that high degree has been reached is to be answered more easily in some cases than in others. Id., 506-507. Manifest necessity is not amenable to a precise formulation or mechanical application because the high degree of necessity mandated by that phrase can be found in a variety of circumstances. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\u201cA reviewing court looks for a manifest necessity by examining the entire record in the case without limiting itself to the actual findings of the trial court. <em>Grooms </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>610 F.2d 344 (5th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>445 U.S. 953, 100 S. Ct. 1605, 63 L. Ed. 2d 789 (1980).\u201d <em>Abdi </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>744 F.2d 1500, 1503 (11th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1006, 105 S. Ct. 1871, 85 L. Ed. 2d 164 (1985); see <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 434 U.S. 515-17; <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>336 U.S. 684, 691-92, 69 S. Ct. 834, 93 L. Ed. 974 (1949). \u201cIt is the examination of the propriety of the trial court\u2019s action against the backdrop of the record that leads to the determination [of] whether, in the context of a particular case, the mistrial declaration was proper. Given the constitutionally protected interest involved, reviewing courts must be satisfied, in the words of Justice Story in <em>Perez, </em>that the trial judge exercised \u2018sound discretion\u2019 in declaring a mistrial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Van Sant, </em>198 Conn. 369, 379, 503 A.2d 557 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Against this background, we must determine whether the trial court properly declared a mistrial or whether, by failing to ask the jurors if they had reached a unanimous partial verdict on any of the greater offenses before them, as requested by the defendant, the court lacked the required manifest necessity for declaring a mistrial on the greater offenses. We begin with this court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">In <em>Sawyer, </em>we determined that, in order to assist the jury in making the transition from considering the greater offense to one or more lesser included offenses, the jury must be given an \u201cacquittal first\u201d instruction. Id., 583. \u201cOnly after it has confronted and unanimously completed the difficult task of deciding the guilt or innocence of the accused as to the charged offense should the juiy consider lesser included offenses. Anything less dilutes the right of the state and the defendant to have the juiy give its undivided attention and most serious deliberations to the offense with which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>defendant is charged . . . Id. Although the jury in this case, as is often the case, was instructed on lesser included offenses, the imposition of the acquittal first rule effectively prohibited it from actually considering the lesser included offenses unless and until it had arrived at a unanimous verdict of acquittal on the crime of murder. This approach makes Connecticut what is termed a \u201chard transition\u201d acquittal first jurisdiction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">This scheme of acquittal on the greater charge as a condition precedent to deliberation of charges for offenses requiring a lesser element, in this case, a lesser specific mental state, requires the jury to reach a partial verdict. See, <em>e.g.,Rookey v.

This partial verdict reflects the jury\u2019s unanimous determination that the state has failed to prove the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the charged offense. Therefore, \u201c[t]he ends of justice require that the State be barred from relitigating [that crime] because [allowing a second jury to reconsider the very issue upon which the defendant has prevailed . . . implicates concerns about the injustice of exposing a defendant to repeated risks of conviction for the same conduct, and to the ordeal of multiple trials, that lie at the heart of the double jeopardy clause.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>247 Conn. 662, 675-76, 725 A.2d 316 (1999); <em>State </em>v. <em>Aparo, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The trial court in the present case indicated that it did not believe it had the authority to accept a partial verdict when the jury unanimously acquits a defendant of the greater charge and thereafter reaches a deadlock only on a lesser included offense.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Jurisdictions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>have adopted the \u201csoft transition\u201d approach<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> occasionally have expressed reluctance to accept a partial verdict because it impedes the jury\u2019s ability to move from consideration of the greater offense to the lesser offense as a means of seeking compromise and without actually having acquitted the accused of the greater offense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>103 Mich.

See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gooday, </em>714 F.2d 80, 83 (9th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 468 U.S. 1217, 104 S. Ct. 3587, 82 L.

In jurisdictions with an acquittal first requirement, where the jury \u201chas confronted and unanimously completed the difficult task of deciding the guilt or innocence of the accused as to the charged offense\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 583; but is deadlocked with respect to the lesser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>included offense, the trial court is required to accept a partial verdict. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>supra, 1987 Ohio App. LEXIS 8939, *6 (where jury able to reach verdict on greater charge but deadlocked on lesser charge, jury allowed to render verdict on greater offense on which it does agree; such partial verdict bars retrial on acquitted greater offense but not on lesser offenses on which jury deadlocked); see also <em>Whiteaker </em>v. <em>State, </em>808 P.2d 270, 274 (Alaska 1991) (\u201cwhere the jury has unanimously decided [on a verdict on the greater] charge but is deadlocked on the lesser included offenses,\u201d accused \u201centitled\u201d to have partial verdict accepted by trial court). Thereafter, jeopardy attaches \u201cto those [greater] offenses upon which the jury has unanimously agreed to acquit, even if [the jury] is unable to reach a final verdict as to any of the lesser included offenses.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Castrillo, </em>90 N.M. 608, 611, 566 P.2d 1146 (1977), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>State </em>v. <em>Wardlow, </em>95 N.M. 585, 587, 624 P.2d 527 (1981) (affirming rule of <em>Castrillo, </em>which \u201crequires that where a jury is deadlocked on a charge involving [lesser] included offenses, the trial court must determine whether the jury\u201d has unanimously reached verdict on any of greater offenses and, if so, court must accept that partial verdict).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Therefore, two principles are at play in this analysis. First, pursuant to the trial court\u2019s instructions as dictated by <em>Sawyer, </em>the jury must first acquit the defendant of the greater offense before it is permitted to consider the lesser offense. Second, it is a fundamental principle of the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy that a defendant may not be retried for an offense of which he has been acquitted. See footnote 10 of this opinion. Therefore, we are persuaded that <em>Sawyer </em>and the guarantees provided by the double jeopardy clause dictate that: (1) it is a valid verdict for the jury to acquit the accused of a greater offense and only thereafter to reach a deadlock on a lesser offense; (2) such a valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>verdict must be accepted; and, finally, (3) the failure to accept that valid verdict would violate the constitutional protection against double jeopardy. See note, \u201cAcceptance of Partial Verdicts as a Safeguard Against Double Jeopardy,\u201d 53 Fordham L. Rev. 889, 901 (1985) (\u201c[w]hen the jury reaches a unanimous decision of acquittal on a greater crime but deadlocks on a lesser offense, failure to receive a partial verdict on the greater crime violates the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy protection by allowing the state to reprosecute him for an offense of which he has been acquitted\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Because the trial court in the present case did not regard itself as authorized to accept a partial verdict, it never informed the jury that it could or should return a partial verdict on a greater offense while continuing to deliberate on a lesser offense. Nor did the court ever advise the jury that it could return such a partial verdict as to a greater offense when deadlocked on a lesser offense. Consequently, we are, at best, left to deduce, based upon the jury\u2019s request for an instruction pertaining to recklessness, that it was deliberating on a manslaughter charge, having acquitted the defendant of murder. At worst, on this record, the jury\u2019s declaration that it was deadlocked is ambiguous as to the root of the deadlock, that is, as to which charge its deliberations had reached an impasse.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">In this case, the defendant asked the trial court to inquire of the jury reporting its deadlock whether it had, in fact, reached a partial verdict. The trial court refused to do so. The issue is whether the trial court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>in rejecting the defendant\u2019s request to conduct an inquiry,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> properly declared a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">As we have stated, the law is clear that a judge may declare a mistrial without the defendant\u2019s consent only if there is a \u201cmanifest necessity for the act, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. Perez, supra, 22 U.S. 579. It is obvious from the record before us in this case that the defendant did not consent to the mistrial. Therefore, the question is whether the trial court properly concluded that a high degree of necessity existed to justify the mistrial or that the ends of public justice would have been defeated had it not declared the mistrial. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">We conclude that neither ground for declaring a mistrial was satisfied. Had the jury been asked whether it had reached a verdict on the murder charge, public justice would not have been defeated, or even compromised. \u201cIf the answer had been in the negative, there would then have been a basis for the mistrial. If the answer had been that the jury had agreed on acquittal, then the defendant\u2019s \u2018valued right\u2019 [to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal] would have been upheld. There was no necessity at all, much less a high degree of necessity, to declare a mistrial before making the inquiry requested. All possible alternatives to a mistrial must be considered, employed and found wanting before declaration of a mistrial over the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>objection is justified.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pugliese, </em>120 N.H. 728, 730, 422 A.2d 1319 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">In this case, by not seeking clarification from the jury, the trial court failed to explore all reasonable alternatives to declaring a mistrial. <em>Robles </em>v. <em>Bamberger, </em>219 App. Div. 2d 243, 246, 640 N.Y.S.2d 882 (1996) (where defendant requested that jury be asked if they had reached partial verdict, court had duty to explore all reasonable alternatives before declaring mistrial); see also <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>31 Cal. 3d 503, 519, 646 P.2d 809, 183 Cal. Rptr. 647 (1982) (\u201c[T]he trial court is constitutionally obligated to afford the jury an opportunity to render a partial verdict of acquittal on a greater offense when the jury is deadlocked only on an uncharged lesser included offense. Failure to do so will cause a subsequently declared mistrial to be without legal [manifest] necessity.\u201d). Without the inquiry by the trial court as to whether the jurors had reached a partial verdict on a greater offense, no manifest necessity existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Therefore, the only issue remaining to be determined is the appropriate relief. We are left with a record that suggests that the jury may have been unanimous on one or more offenses, but deadlocked on at least one charge.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he record is not clear as to which of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>included offenses the jury was considering at the time of its discharge. Without inquiry by the trial court into the jury\u2019s deliberations on the greater, included offenses, no necessity is manifest to declare a mistrial as to those offenses and thus jeopardy has attached.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Castrillo, </em>supra, 90 N.M. 613-14. Consequently, the defendant contends that we must remand the case for a new trial limited to the last lesser included offense on which the jury had been charged, the charge of criminally negligent homicide. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Our confusion in this case \u201cresults from the fact that the trial judge declared a mistrial when the record was not clear whether the jury was hopelessly deadlocked on any particular charge. We can only say with certainty that the jury had to be deadlocked on murder in the first degree or one of the included offenses.\u201d <em>Whiteaker </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 808 P.2d 279; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Castrillo, </em>supra, 90 N.M. 614 (\u201cJeopardy did not attach to the . . . least of the included offenses. Had the jury reached a unanimous decision on that offense it could not have been in the posture it announced to the court.\u201d). \u201cBecause we have no way of knowing which charge the jury was deadlocked on, we must presume that it was the least serious charge, negligent homicide. We reach this conclusion noting that doubts about whether an offense is jeopardy-barred must be resolved \u2018in favor of the liberty of the citizen.\u2019 <em>Downum </em>v. <em>United States, </em>372 U.S. 734, 738, 83 S. Ct. 1033, 1036, 10 L. Ed. 2d 100 (1963).\u201d <em>Whiteaker </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 279. If we were to reach any other result, the defendant would face repros<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>ecution for crimes of which he already might have been acquitted. This would directly contravene his constitutional protections against double jeopardy.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">In the circumstances of this case, therefore, we are constrained to conclude that further prosecution of the defendant on murder and first and second degree manslaughter would violate the double jeopardy provision of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">The judgment is reversed in part, and the case is remanded with direction to grant the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the charges of murder and first and second degree manslaughter, and to order a new trial on the charge of criminally negligent homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">In this opinion BORDEN and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person or causes a suicide by force, duress or deception; except that in any prosecution under this subsection, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant committed the proscribed act or acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be, provided nothing contained in this subsection shall constitute a defense to a prosecution for, or preclude a conviction of, manslaughter in the first degree or any other crime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b285-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) provides in relevant part: \"A person is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree when ...

See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Aparo, </em>supra, 22.3 Conn. 388-92 (where jury acquitted accused of accessory to intentional murder but deadlocked on charge of conspiracy to commit murder). The fact that the defendant in the present case was charged in a one count information as opposed to a multicount information should not warrant a different outcome. Our research reveals several jurisdictions in which the fact that a partial verdict is acceptable when an accused has been charged with more than one count, also resolves the question of whether a partial verdict is allowed when the defendant has been charged with only one count and the jury is instructed thereafter on lesser included offenses. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chestaro, </em>197 F.3d 600, 608-609 (2d Cir. 1999) (noting that partial verdict on some counts and deadlock on other counts is in principle \u201cno <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>different [from] where the jury acquits the defendant of the greater offense but is deadlocked on a lesser included offense\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gooday, </em>714 F.2d 80, 83 (9th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 468 U.S. 1217, 104 S. Ct. 3587, 82 L. Ed. 2d 884 (1984) (holding that for purposes of accepting partial verdicts \u201clesser included offenses should be treated as if they had been specified in separate counts of the indictment . . . [and thus the accused\u2019s] acquittal [by the first jury] on the indictment\u2019s first degree murder count does not preclude retrial on the three lesser included offenses on which the [original] jury was [deadlocked]\u201d); <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>31 Cal. 3d 503, 517-18, 646 P.2d 809, 183 Cal. Rptr. 647 (1982) (where partial verdict allowed on multiple counts such partial verdict must also be allowed when jury is given lesser offenses on single count; noting that because prosecutors may choose to charge lesser offenses as separate counts or leave it to judge to instruct on lesser offenses as part of single count, \u201c[i]t would be anomalous to formulate a rule that prevents a trial court from receiving a partial verdict on a greater offense on which the jury [has acquitted] merely because the prosecutor elected to charge only that offense, and left it to the court to instruct on . . . lesser included offense[s]\u201d); see also note, \u201cAcceptance of Partial Verdicts as a Safeguard Against Double Jeopardy,\u201d 53 Fordham L.

Acceptance of apartial verdict of acquittal on murder in the first degree when the jury [thereafter] deadlocks on the second degree charge is indistinguishable from receiving a verdict of not guilty on robbery when the jury cannot agree on the accompanying kidnapping charge.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Indeed, it would be anomalous to formulate a rule that prevents a trial court from receiving a partial verdict on a greater offense on which the jury clearly favors acquittal merely because the state has chosen to charge only that offense, leaving the issue of lesser offenses to the trial court. The substantive rights involved in this case should not turn on the formality of whether the defendant was charged in separate counts with the greater offense and the lesser included offense, or in a single count with only the greater offense. See <em>Green </em>v. <em>United States, </em>355 U.S. 184, 78 S. Ct. 221, 2 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b302-8\"> This approach allows the jury, in the absence of a unanimous acquittal of the greater offense, to consider the lesser included offenses. The jury is instructed that they may consider the lesser offenses after they have used reasonable efforts to reach a unanimous verdict on the greater offense. See footnote 12 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b305-9\"> We are not persuaded by the state\u2019s contention that allowing inquiry into whether the jury had reached a partial verdict would violate the policy against invading jury deliberations. Reporting a verdict, even apartial verdict, does not intrude impermissibly into the jury deliberations. It focuses on the results, if any, of its deliberations, and not on the nature or content of those deliberations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b306-8\"> We do not hold in this case that, in the absence of a request, the trial court, sua sponte, has an obligation to make such an inquiry of the jury. The general rule is that the trial court does not have such an obligation. See, e.g., <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Lile, </em>732 F. Sup. 784, 789-90 (N.D. Ohio), aff'd, 918 F.2d 178 (6th Cir. 1990); <em>Whiteaker v. State, </em>supra, 808 P.2d 277. A defendant may have a tactical reason for not requesting the trial court to question the jury about a partial verdict. Because jurors are presumed to understand and follow instructions, we do not, and the defendant here has not requested us to, place a burden on the trial court to inquire, sua sponte, further or perform a special poll of jurors who deliberate on cases involving lesser included offenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b307-9\"> The defendant offered affidavits by seven of the twelve jurors in conjunction with his motion to dismiss in an attempt to persuade the trial court that the jury had in fact reached a partial verdict on the murder charge, as well as on the first degree manslaughter charge. See footnote 11 of this opinion. The trial court concluded, nonetheless, that \u201c[e]ven if the defense were to assemble affidavits from all of the jurors and all the jurors agreed that they had unanimously voted the defendant not guilty of the crime of murder, the defense has offered no precedent for substituting that assemblage of documents for the jury's declaration at the time of trial that it was unable to reach a verdict.\u201d Consequently, the trial court never made any findings regarding the affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">This court would then, by way of fact-finding, be required to adjudicate the validity and the reliability of that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">At this stage of the proceedings, we are incapable of making those neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>sary determinations. In general, \u201c[i]t is the function of the trial court, not this court, to find facts.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Lafferty, </em>189 Conn. 360, 363, 456 A.2d 272 (1983). Imposing a fact-finding function on this court, therefore, would be contrary to generally established law. Indeed, it would be inconsistent with the entire process of trial fact-finding for an appellate court to do so. Thus, viewed through this prism, the affidavits had their primary role for the guidance of the fact finder\u2014the trial court\u2014and can play no role at this level in helping to determine the crimes of which the defendant was acquitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b309-11\"> Chief Justice Sullivan, in his concurring and dissenting opinion, is dissatisfied with the limited nature of the remand ordered by the majority. Specifically, he would remand the case to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing to determine precisely which of the offenses the jury was considering at the time of its discharge. Unlike other cases in which we have been asked to exercise our supervisory authority and order the trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>245 Conn. 301, 332-34, 715 A.2d 1 (1998); neither the state nor the defendant in this case has sought such a hearing, perhaps because they appreciate the difficulty that all twelve jurors could have in recalling the various included offenses on which they had been instructed nearly two years ago. In the absence of any request, Chief Justice Sullivan essentially invokes, sua sponte, our supervisory authority. This course is exercised without precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b309-10\">SULLIVAN, C. J., with whom NORCOTT, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AsE\">joins, concurring and dissenting. I agree with the majority that the trial court should have instructed the jury that it could return a partial verdict as to a greater offense when deadlocked on a lesser included offense, and that the trial court should not have declared a mistrial without inquiring if the jury had reached such a verdict. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>my view, however, this court should remand the <em>case </em>to the trial court to conduct such an inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The defendant, James Tate, argued in his briefs to this court and at oral argument that this court may consider the affidavits from seven of the jurors, in which they stated, in essence, that the jury had unanimously determined that the state had not proven the elements of first degree manslaughter, but that the jurors were deadlocked on the charge of second degree manslaughter. See footnote 11 of the majority opinion. I agree with the majority that this court is not a fact-finding tribunal, but I see no reason that the trial court should not consider the affidavits and make such a factual determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">The trial court concluded that \u201c[e]ven if the defense were to assemble affidavits from all of the jurors and all the jurors agreed that they had unanimously voted the defendant not guilty of the crime of murder, the defense has offered no precedent for substituting that assemblage of documents for the jury\u2019s declaration at the time of trial that it was unable to reach a verdict.\u201d See footnote 17 of the majority opinion. The affidavits would not be a substitute for the jury\u2019s declaration, however, but merely a clarification of it. The majority has concluded, and I agree, that the court should have granted the defendant\u2019s request that the jury clarify whether it had acquitted the defendant of any of the offenses. Although that would have been the preferable course, I see nothing in our case law to suggest that, after the jury has been discharged, juror testimony should be inadmissible for the purpose of establishing whether the jury had reached a partial verdict.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>hold that, if the state, at a factual hearing after the jury is discharged, can establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not acquitted of a particular offense, the defendant may be retried for that offense.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-8\"> We previously have not addressed this specific issue, but it is well established in this state that jurors may testify as to factual issues that do not involve the jurors\u2019 thought processes during deliberations. \u201c[Affidavits of jurors may be received for the purpose of avoiding a verdict, to show any matter occurring during the trial or in the jury room, which does not essentially inhere in the verdict itself, as that a juror was improperly approached by a party, his agent, or attorney; that witnesses or others <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>conversed as to the facts or merits of the cause, out of court and in the presence of jurors; that the verdict was determined by aggregation and average or by lot, or game of chance or other artifice or improper manner. . . . [S]uch affidavit to avoid the verdict may not be received to show any matter which does essentially inhere in the verdict, itself, as that the juror did not assent to 1he verdict; that he misunderstood the instructions of the court; the statements of the witnesses or the pleadings in the case; that he was unduly influenced by the statements or otherwise of his fellow jurors, or mistaken in his calculations or judgment, or other matter resting alone in the juror\u2019s breast. . . . [J]urors [are] competent to testify to the occurrence of incidents during trial or during their deliberations which might have affected the result of the trial, but [cannot] testify as to the impact of such incidents on their verdict.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Josephson </em>v. <em>Meyers, </em>180 Conn. 302, 310-11, 429 A.2d 877 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">In <em>Aillon </em>v. <em>State, </em>168 Conn. 541, 363 A.2d 49 (1975), this court considered the admissibility of testimony concerning an ex parte conversation between the trial judge and one of the jurors, and the juror\u2019s subsequent statements to the jury concerning that, conversation. We noted that the policies behind the outdated rule that a juror is always incompetentto testify in impeachment of his verdict \u201cwere to give stability to the verdicts of jurors, to minimize the temptation for jury-tampering, and to prevent inquisition into the arguments and reasoning of the jurors that go into their ultimate verdict.\u201d Id., 550. We held that those policies were served equally well by a narrower rule that allowed the admission of certain evidence extraneous to the mental operations of the jury. Id. Allowing postdischarge juror testimony on the narrow factual question of whether the jury reached a partial verdict would not undermine any of these policies.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
