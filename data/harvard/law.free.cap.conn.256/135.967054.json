The trial court concluded that, based on the \u201ctotality of the evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom,\u201d the state had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that: (1) the victim, Mary Crook, had lacked the mental capacity to make reasonable decisions with respect to her assets and estate, or to make any gifts therefrom; (2) the defendant had had regular contact with the victim and knew or should have known of her mental incapacity; and (3) the \u201cdefendant with intent to deprive [the victim] of her property and to appropriate the same to herself or a third person, wrongfully [had taken] and obtained [the victim\u2019s] property,\u201d which was valued at approximately $800,000. The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the defendant\u2019s appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">On appeal, the defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence produced by the state. First, the defendant argues that we should abandon the waiver rule of <em>State </em>v. <em>Rutan, </em>194 Conn. 438, 440-41, 479 A.2d 1209 (1984) (if defendant chooses to present evidence after motion for acquittal is denied immediately following state\u2019s evidence, defendant waives right to appellate review of trial court\u2019s ruling on motion). Second, the defendant argues that the state failed to prove that the victim had lacked the mental capacity to make gifts. The defendant also claims that the state failed to prove that she had the requisite, unlawful intent permanently to deprive the victim of the appropriated funds. Consequently, she argues that the state failed to prove the elements necessary to convict her of the crime of larceny in the first degree. We disagree with the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>and conclude that, even without the defendant\u2019s evidence, the trial court reasonably could have concluded that the evidence offered by the state was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had committed larceny in the first degree by wrongfully taking the victim\u2019s assets without consent and with the intent permanently to deprive her of them in violation of \u00a7 53a-122 (a) (2). We, therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">As a preliminary matter, we address the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly denied her motion for judgment of acquittal at the end of the state\u2019s casein-chief. The defendant argues that appellate review of a claim of evidentiary sufficiency should be limited to the evidence in the record at the close of the state\u2019s case. Therefore, she advocates that we abandon the waiver rule; e.g., id., 440-41; which provides that, if a defendant elects to introduce evidence after the trial court denies his or her motion for judgment of acquittal at the end of the state\u2019s case, appellate review encompasses the evidence in toto, including evidence introduced by the defendant. Accordingly, in applying the waiver rule, \u201cwe . . . look at the evidence in toto in order to review the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion for judgment of acquittal after all of the evidence had been presented.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Simino, </em>200 Conn. 113, 118, 509 A.2d 1039 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">We need not consider abandoning the waiver rule, however. Based on a review of the state\u2019s evidence only, the state had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of larceny in the first degree. \u201cOn its merits, the defendant\u2019s claim is a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence at the end of the state\u2019s case. Our review of the state\u2019s evidence is limited to an inquiiy whether the jury could have reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>ably concluded, upon the facts established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, that the cumulative effect of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rutan, </em>supra, 194 Conn. 444, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 255, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S. Ct. 1455, 79 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1984); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Haddad, </em>189 Conn. 383, 387, 456 A.2d 316 (1983). We conclude that the evidence at the close of the state\u2019s case was sufficient to sustain the state\u2019s burden of proving the defendant guilty of larceny in the first degree beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we do not reach the issue of whether we should abandon the waiver rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The trial court reasonably could have found the following facts. The victim is an elderly, childless widow, whose only surviving family is a sister, Anne Shea,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who, at the time in question, was a resident of a nursing home. The victim had a close friend, Minnie Calonico, the mother of the defendant. The victim spent most of her time with Minnie Calonico after her sister had become incapacitated, and Minnie Calonico and the victim were best friends and had a very close, family-like relationship.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During the early period of their friendship, the victim and Minnie Calonico went to casinos and out for meals together.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Suspicion of larceny arose after legal and financial professionals assisting the victim discovered evidence that the defendant was mishandling the victim\u2019s funds. An initial review of the victim\u2019s accounts showed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>several bank accounts had been consolidated into one large account over the course of several months in 1995. Further investigation revealed that the defendant appropriated approximately $800,000 of the victim\u2019s money from that consolidated account over a period of less than three weeks through cash withdrawals and transfers into bank accounts of the defendant and her friends and family.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">In early 1995, at age eighty-nine, the victim sought the assistance of her attorney, Daniel H. Dennis, Jr., to create a new will.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Dennis referred the victim to Richard K. Snyder, an attorney specializing in estate planning and administration for geriatric clients. Dennis expressed some concern to Snyder about the victim\u2019s ability to handle everyday financial matters. As a result, Snyder recommended to the victim that she \u201cget some reputable professional assistance with her financial affairs\u201d because of her age and substantial assets.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Upon her request, Snyder contacted the victim\u2019s accountant at the firm of Luppi, Mahon, Schulz and Company (accounting firm). Snyder suggested to Robert Boudreau, the accountant in charge of the victim\u2019s account, that the victim needed regular assistance paying bills, balancing her checkbook and making deposits. In response, Boudreau assigned one of the accounting firm\u2019s assistants, Susan Frame,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to help the victim with her finances on a regular basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Beginning in January, 1995, Frame would go to the victim\u2019s residence either weekly or every other week and sort through bills, write out checks for bills that needed to be paid immediately, show them to the victim, explain what they were for and have the victim sign them. Frame also discovered a suitcase full of stock certificates. Upon Snyder\u2019s request,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Charles Noble, a stockbroker, visited the victim\u2019s home, went through the securities and opened a brokerage account for her. The victim\u2019s securities were worth approximately $400,000 when Noble opened the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Early in their professional relationship, Frame saw evidence that the victim was suffering from some mental deterioration. Specifically, Frame noticed that the victim often misread check amounts and had difficulty signing her name. The problem intensified in the summer of 1995, when the victim became ill after suffering injuries from a fall.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A subsequent computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan revealed that the victim likely had suffered a stroke.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Just prior to this incident, in June, 1995, the victim sold her house on Jackson Road in Hamden and moved into her sister\u2019s condominium.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Dennis was the closing attorney for the sale of the home, and Snyder continued to play a role in administering the victim\u2019s assets. Frame also continued to assist the victim with financial matters after her move. Sometime in the summer of 1995, Minnie Calonico moved into the victim\u2019s home to assist the victim while she was recuperating from her fall and injuries resulting therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>In December, 1995, Frame went to the victim\u2019s home for one of her regular visits. Upon her arrival, she noticed what appeared to be a new automobile in the driveway.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> When she went inside, Frame was greeted by the defendant who explained that she was Minnie Calonico\u2019s daughter and that she was there just to clean for the victim. While going through the bills that day, Frame noticed that there was an entry in the victim\u2019s checkbook that indicated that a check had been made out to the defendant. Because the writing was somewhat illegible, Frame could not tell whether the amount was $500 or $5000. Among the victim\u2019s papers, Frame also noticed a cashier\u2019s receipt in the amount of $24,039.20, dated October 4,1995, that had been issued to a local car dealership. Knowing that the victim did not have a license to operate a motor vehicle,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and making the connection between the new car in the driveway and the receipt, Frame found the situation unusual. Aware of the victim\u2019s usually conservative spending habits,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Frame became concerned enough to speak to Boudreau when she returned to her office. Boudreau agreed that Frame should inform the victim\u2019s attorneys, namely, Snyder and Dennis, of the incident. After Frame contacted Snyder about her concerns, Snyder notified adult protective services for the elderly (protective services) and informed them of the suspicious findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">A few weeks later, Frame returned to the victim\u2019s home to pay bills and prepare deposits. At that time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>she questioned the victim about the illegible entry in her checkbook, which indicated that money had been given to the defendant. The victim did not respond, but looked at her \u201cblankly, like she didn\u2019t understand the question.\u201d Frame met with the victim periodically throughout January, 1996. During this time, Snyder, after consulting with Frame and Barbara Sachs of protective services, arranged a meeting with the victim. Snyder also contacted Boudreau and asked that the accounting firm begin a review of the victim\u2019s bank account records.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">On January 30, 1996, Frame arrived early at the victim\u2019s home for the prearranged meeting with Snyder and Dennis. The defendant and Minnie Calonico were present in the home along with the victim. While waiting for Snyder and Dennis to arrive, the victim told Frame that she no longer needed her services, but she agreed to have the accounting firm continue doing her tax returns. It was Frame\u2019s understanding that the defendant would now be taking care of the victim and her financial affairs. When the attorneys arrived, the defendant became confrontational. Frame, Snyder and Dennis all testified that the defendant was hostile and agitated, demanding to know why they were there \u201cbothering\u201d the victim. The defendant also said that she knew that they were there because of the $5000 that the victim had given her because the victim felt sorry that the defendant had lost her job,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and prodded the victim to ask the attorneys \u201chow much this [was] . . . costing [her].\u201d The defendant further suggested that there were other attorneys whom the victim could use, and that Snyder\u2019s and Dennis\u2019 \u201ctenure would shortly be over . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">After the visit with the victim, Snyder again contacted protective services and stated that he was \u201ctotally con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>vinced that [the victim] was being manipulated financially and that [he] thought it was quite urgent that they take action.\u201d Snyder became increasingly concerned in February and March, 1996, when he was denied access to the victim, always being told that she was not feeling well or that she did not want to speak with him. Frame also had trouble contacting the victim in February, 1996, but was able to arrange a meeting for tax preparation purposes in March. When Frame arrived at the victim\u2019s home for the March, 1996 meeting, she noticed overdue bills and public utility shut off notices on the dining room table, indicating that the defendant had been neglecting the victim\u2019s financial obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Also, in March, 1996, Snyder received a call from Noble. Noble relayed to Snyder that the defendant had called him, claiming to represent the victim\u2019s wishes, with instructions to liquidate securities from the victim\u2019s account and deposit the proceeds into certain bank accounts for the care of the victim\u2019s sister. Snyder then contacted protective services with this new information. Barbara Sizemore from protective services went to see the victim as a result of Snyder\u2019s report. When she arrived, Minnie Calonico met her at the door and handed her an envelope on which there was a note stating that she could not come in and that she should speak to the victim\u2019s attorney, Herbert Fischer. After this incident, Sizemore made a referral to the office of the chief state\u2019s attorney and filed an application for the appointment of a conseivator of the victim\u2019s estate and person.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Both Snyder and Sizemore were con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>vinced that the defendant and her family had been taking advantage of the victim\u2019s deteriorating mental health for their own financial gain.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">In April, 1996, the defendant telephoned Noble\u2019s office a second time, stating that the victim wanted to sell all of her investments and \u201cinvest in other things.\u201d She also complained that Noble did not send her the paperwork necessary to liquidate the account subsequent to their prior conversation. Noble told the defendant that the victim would have to pay very high capital gains taxes if she chose to liquidate the account all at once. The defendant, whom Noble heard whispering to someone in the background during their telephone conversation, ignored Noble\u2019s warnings about tax consequences and indicated that the victim still wanted to sell all of her stocks. Noble set up a meeting in early April, 1996, to discuss the liquidation of the account and the associated tax consequences. Neither the victim nor the defendant appeared at the meeting. Instead, Noble received a telephone call from the victim on the day of the meeting.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In a \u201cstartling strong voice,\u201d the victim demanded the money from the sale of her stocks. The victim flatly rejected Noble\u2019s claim that there would be high capital gains taxes after someone whom Noble heard talking in the background instructed her to do so.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Alarmed by the situation, Noble again notified Snyder. Snyder told Noble to delay taking any action on the account, informing him that the Probate Court appointed him as temporary conservator of the estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>of the victim\u2019s sister and that he might also be appointed conservator of the victim\u2019s estate at the conservatorship hearing scheduled for April 24, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Prior to the conservatorship hearing, David Esposito was appointed by the Probate Court to represent the victim.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Esposito visited with the victim at her home the day before the hearing. Initially, he spoke to the victim and Minnie Calonico and had a pleasant conversation. During the visit, he found the victim to be confused about why the conservatorship hearing was taking place, and that the victim was convinced that Snyder and Dermis were trying to take her money and to put her in a nursing home. After the defendant and her companion, Marcella Burch, arrived at the victim\u2019s home and Esposito informed them why he was there, they became \u201cvisibly upset\u201d and the conversation became hostile. The defendant and Burch kept saying \u201c[w]e don\u2019t need you, we have a lawyer.\u201d The victim, however, did not seem to recall meeting with Fischer the day before. At one point in the conversation, the victim said that she gave the defendant $700 to buy a car. The defendant corrected her and said that the amount was $700,000. Only fifteen minutes after the defendant had arrived, Esposito felt that he should leave as \u201cthe level of hostility was reaching the danger zone.\u201d Alarmed by this dialogue involving the defendant, and concerned about the victim\u2019s seemingly confused state of mind, Esposito articulated in his report to the Probate Court that he \u201cwas absolutely certain that [the victim] was being financially exploited and that she desperately needed a conservator of [her] estate . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Snyder arranged for an evaluation to be performed by Alan Siegal, a psychiatrist who specializes in geriatric <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>psychiatry with a concentration in the study of illnesses such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia, prior to the conservatorship hearing in order to prove that the victim had suffered from dementia that could be traced back to 1994. Siegal reviewed 1994 and 1995 medical records from the Hospital of Saint Raphael and a report from a 1994 Gaylord Hospital driver assessment evaluation of the victim, the results of which led to the permanent revocation of the victim\u2019s license to operate a motor vehicle. He also performed an in home assessment on April 22,1996, in order to determine the victim\u2019s mental competency. Siegal administered a Folstein test<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and determined that the victim\u2019s score put her in a range of \u201cmild to moderate\u201d dementia. He found the victim to be mildly disoriented and paranoid. It was Siegal\u2019s opinion that the victim had been suffering from some form of dementia beginning in at least 1995, after she likely had suffered a stroke, and possibly since as early as her hospitalization in 1994, when discharge reports of the Hospital of Saint Raphael, where the victim had been admitted, indicated that the victim was suffering from \u201cmoderate cerebral atrophy,\u201d also known as organic brain syndrome or dementia. In light of these findings, Siegal opined that the victim was not only unaware of the extent of her assets and their current disposition, but also that she was being unduly influenced by the defendant with regard to the distribution of those assets. Siegal concluded that the victim\u2019s condition and the surrounding circumstances necessitated the appointment of a conservator for the victim and her estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The defendant also made arrangements for the representation and evaluation of the victim before the conser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>vatorship hearing. The defendant requested that Jeremy August, a psychiatrist, participate as an independent physician for the purposes of the hearing.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> August met with the victim daily for approximately one week before the hear ing and saw her for the last time on the date of the hearing. August concluded that the victim suffered from mild organic brain syndrome.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> August concluded that: (1) the victim\u2019s mental capacity had improved over the week that he evaluated her; (2) it was difficult to determine what her mental state had been over the past two years; and (3) she did have the capacity to make gifts to the defendant. He did not, however, review the victim\u2019s medical records from the Hospital of Saint Raphael or the Gaylord Hospital records from 1994. Consequently, he did not know that the victim had failed a driver assessment evaluation test in 1994 or that she probably had suffered a stroke in 1995. When August was informed of Frame's accounts of the victim\u2019s delusions and her regular state of confusion, he agreed that such symptoms could signify severe organic brain syndrome. August also was unaware of the full extent of the bank transactions involving the defendant until the conservatorship hearing. When August was confronted with the nature of the transfers, he commented that he was \u201cimpressed by the number of transactions\u201d and acknowledged that he would question whether a person with even mild organic brain syndrome \u201cwould . . . be capable of organizing and directing money transfers of that magnitude within [such a short] time frame . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>On April 24, 1996, a hearing was held to determine whether a conservator should be appointed for the victim. The victim testified at the hearing, appearing frail and confused. When Fischer questioned the victim about giving gifts to the defendant, she stated only that she had bought the defendant a car for $350,000.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This testimony, coupled with evidence regarding the bank transfers, convinced the Probate Court judge that the victim required a conservator. Consequently, Snyder was appointed conservator of the victim\u2019s estate, and Dennis was appointed conservator of her person and the person of the victim\u2019s sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Concerned for the victim\u2019s physical well-being, Snyder made arrangements with Victoria Austin, a social worker from the Hamden Healthcare Center, to remove the victim from her home and arrange for a physical evaluation. On two occasions, Snyder and Austin went to the victim\u2019s home to remove the victim, once with a representative of the Visiting Nurse Association and again with someone from protective services. On both occasions, they were turned away. After contacting the Hamden police department, Snyder and Austin were advised to try again before involving police officers. They were able to get into the victim\u2019s home the third time, however. The victim was at home with Minnie Calonico and agreed to accompany Snyder and Austin.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> They took the victim to the Hamden Healthcare Center, had her admitted and arranged for a full medical evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Once the victim safely was removed from the defendant\u2019s influence, Snyder wrote to the office of the chief state\u2019s attorney about his concern for the victim\u2019s assets. Additionally, Snyder served all of the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>financial institutions with documentation of his appointment as conservator and requested that certain information be forwarded to him and the victim\u2019s accountant. Snyder contacted the accounting firm and requested that it continue its analysis of the transactions that had occurred since 1995 based upon new information that was being provided by the various financial institutions. Snyder asked the accounting firm to determine how much money had been transferred, where and when it was deposited and how much remained as of April, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Boudreau prepared a report for Snyder concerning the status of the victim\u2019s accounts. Boudreau reviewed records dating from January 1, 1995, through at least June, 1996. The records of several different banks were analyzed, including Centerbank,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> First Union, formerly First Fidelity and Union Trust, Bank of Boston, New Haven Savings Bank, Fleet Bank, Dime Savings Bank,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> American Savings Bank<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and Shawmut Bank. Boudreau\u2019s review of the records from all of the banks concentrated on \u201ctransactions involving deposits and transfers of [the victim\u2019s] accounts into one large account ... at Centerbank . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> He also looked at bank transactions involving cash withdrawals and transfers of funds from the main Centerbank account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>into the defendant\u2019s personal accounts and accounts held in the names of related third parties. Boudreau created a flowchart to depict both the victim\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s account activities. The flowchart illustrated the manner in which most of the victim\u2019s money had been consolidated into one account, then rapidly withdrawn over approximately a three week period, either in cash withdrawals, transfers to the defendant\u2019s accounts or transfers to the defendant\u2019s friends and family. From November 30, 1995, until December 19, 1995, the defendant, by various means, transferred, withdrew, deposited and gifted almost $800,000 from the victim\u2019s Centerbank account, an account that the defendant had created by consolidating all of the victim\u2019s assets. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">We employ a well established standard of review when a defendant challenges a trial court\u2019s finding of guilt on the ground of insufficient evidence. \u201cIn reviewing [a] sufficiency [of the evidence] claim, we apply a [two part] test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the [finding of guilt].

We disagree. General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53a-122 (a) provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] person is guilty of larceny in the first degree when he commits larceny as defined in section 53a-119 and . . . (2) the value of the property or service exceeds ten thousand dollars . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119 provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] person commits larceny when, with intent to deprive another of property or to appropriate the same to himself or a third person, he wrongfully takes, obtains or withholds such property from an owner. ...\u201d The elements of larceny include: \u201c(1) the wrongful taking or carrying away of the personal property of another; (2) the existence of a felonious intent in the taker to deprive the owner of [the property] permanently; and (3) the lack of consent of the owner.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Huot, </em>170 Conn. 463, 467-68, 365 A.2d 1144 (1976), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Banet, </em>140 Conn. 118, 122, 98 A.2d 530 (1953). Consequently, \u201ca conviction for larceny [cannot] stand . . . [when the] property is taken with the knowing consent of the owner . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>174 Conn. 338, 342, 387 A.2d 550 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">When the state claims that there is no knowing and voluntary consent to the taking of property because of the property owner\u2019s mental incapacity, mental incapacity may be considered by the trier of fact as a \u201ctheory . . . demonstrating] at least one of the elements of the crime, [namely] failure to consent to the taking and carrying away\u201d notwithstanding that mental capacity is not, itself, an element of larceny. <em>People </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>238 Mich. App. 95, 128, 605 N.W.2d 28 (1999); see also <em>People </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>v. <em>Camiola, </em>225 App. Div. 2d 380, 380-81, 639 N.Y.S.2d 35, appeal denied, 88 N.Y.2d 877, 668 N.E.2d 422, 645 N.Y.S.2d 451 (1996) (where defendant stole significant assets from elderly, senile victim over two year period, jury may consider victim\u2019s mental capacity to form consent in determining trespassory nature of taking). Furthermore, a \u201cvictim\u2019s nonconsent to a transfer of property can be proven by circumstantial evidence . . . [which] may include evidence that the defendant knew the victim lacked the mental capacity to consent to the taking of his or her property.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Deranger </em>v. <em>State, </em>652 So. 2d 400, 401 (Fla.

Penal Law \u00a7 155.05 (1),<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> a larceny statute containing language similar to that of \u00a7 53a-119, that \u201ca donative victim\u2019s inability to consent to [a] taking [is a factor] . . . properly considered in the context of a traditional understanding of the larceny statute . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>People </em>v. <em>Camiola, </em>supra, 225 App. Div. 2d 380-81. Other states employ a similar interpretation of their own larceny statutes. For example, in Alabama, \u201ceven without an express statutory provision . . . mental deficiency on the part of the victim, which is known or should be known to the defendant, can render ineffective the apparent consent by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>the victim in a prosecution for theft [under the relevant statute].\u201d <em>Gainer v. State, </em>553 So. 2d 673, 679 (Ala. Crim. App. 1989); cf. <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>State, </em>183 Ga. App. 637, 642, 360 S.E.2d 12 (1987); <em>People </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>supra, 238 Mich. App. 128-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">In the present case, the trial court, as the trier of fact, found that the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim had lacked the capacity to consent to the bank transactions. The trial court properly concluded, therefore, that the defendant, with intent to deprive the victim of her property and permanently to appropriate the same to herself or a third person, wrongfully had taken and obtained the victim\u2019s property without her knowing consent, satisfying the elements of larceny. The defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence to prove the victim\u2019s mental incapacity, and, consequently, that the state did not sustain its burden of proving that the transfer of the victim\u2019s assets was wrongful, i.e., without her consent. The defendant contends, therefore, that, without proof of wrongfulness, she cannot be guilty of larceny as defined by \u00a7 53a-119. The state argues that the victim\u2019s deteriorating mental state rendered her incapable of understanding the nature of the transactions being facilitated by the defendant and that, consequently, the victim\u2019s inability to consent renders the defendant\u2019s taking of the victim\u2019s assets wrongful. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">It is true that there is a presumption that human beings are ordinarily of sound mind, but that presumption may be rebutted. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>197 Conn. 115, 133, 496 A.2d 466 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1067, 106 S. Ct. 822, 88 L. Ed. 2d 795 (1986). The state had the burden of proving that the victim was not of sound mind and that she was, therefore, incapable of consenting to a transfer of her property. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the court\u2019s finding of guilt, we conclude that there is suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>cient evidence in the record to demonstrate that the victim was incapable of knowingly consenting to the transfer of her assets due to mental incapacity, and that the victim\u2019s mental incapacity would have been apparent to the defendant. In reviewing the evidence in the record, we conclude that the trial court reasonably could have found that the victim\u2019s mental incapacity rendered her incapable of consenting to the defendant\u2019s financial stratagem and that the defendant was aware of the victim\u2019s mental incapacity during the extended period of time when she plundered the victim\u2019s assets. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court reasonably could have concluded that the taking was nonconsensual and wrongful.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The evidence of the victim\u2019s mental incapacity can be summarized as follows. As early as 1994, the victim began to have cognitive difficulties. In approximately January or February, 1994, the victim\u2019s license to operate a motor vehicle temporarily was revoked because she had operated her car erratically and had failed to exhibit basic traffic safety. After subsequently failing a driver assessment evaluation administered at Gaylord Hospital, the victim\u2019s license was revoked permanently.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Janine Stancanelli, the occupational therapist conducting the driver assessment evaluation, testified at trial that the victim had been unable to \u201ccomply\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>with the test, even after going over directions more than one time, because \u201cit was too hard for her to follow the directions and understand and process the information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Records from the Hospital of Saint Raphael relied upon by Siegal also indicate that the victim had been subject to some form of mental incapacity as far back as 1994. The victim\u2019s discharge summary states that the victim was suffering from \u201cmoderate cerebral atrophy\u201d and \u201corganic brain syndrome,\u201d also known as dementia.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Siegal testified that dementia affects a person\u2019s executive functioning abilities, thereby decreasing his or her capacity to handle simple tasks in life.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Siegal also testified that age is a factor in the diagnosis of dementia because it is an illness that increases with age. Siegal also saw evidence of dementia in his review of the Gaylord Hospital driver assessment evaluation of the victim. Additionally, the results of a CAT scan performed at the Hospital of Saint Raphael in 1995 after the victim had suffered injuries from a fall indicate that the victim likely had suffered a stroke at that time. According to Siegal, a stroke could have affected the victim\u2019s executive functioning and, therefore, would be consistent with Siegal\u2019s diagnosis in April, 1996, that the victim had been suffering from some form of dementia for a significant period of time. Siegal testified \u201cwith reasonable medical certainty\u201d that \u201cthe condition of mild dementia [that he had] observed on April 22, 1996, existed for some time prior to [that date] . . . [f]or a period at least [commencing in] July of 1995 and proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>bly [1994] based on the discharge summary from [the Hospital of] Saint [Raphael] . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">There was also testimony from legal and accounting professionals that they had observed a significant decline in the victim\u2019s mental capacity during the course of their relationship with her.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> As stated previously, Frame testified that the victim often was confused about check amounts and more concerned with her cats than her finances. Frame also testified that the victim had difficulty signing her name and reading checks and bills and had delusions that people were stealing from her, causing her to sleep with her pocketbook. Frame further testified that the victim had told Frame that the victim\u2019s sister slept over in a spare bedroom one night, when, in actuality, her sister resided in a nursing home. Snyder and Dennis testified that they noticed the victim\u2019s mental deterioration the day she came to see them about a new will. Thus, as early as January, 1995, they determined that she needed assistance with her finances.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Esposito found the victim to be confused and disoriented at their first meeting as well. During that meeting, the victim manifested signs of paranoia by indicating that \u201csome men were trying to put her in a nursing home and that they had taken her money away.\u201d According to Esposito, she also thought that she had given the defendant only $700 to buy a car, yet remained quiet when the defendant said it was \u201c$700,000.\u201d Esposito became more convinced of the victim\u2019s mental incapacity on the day of the conservatorship hearing when he heard the victim testify that she had purchased a car for the defendant for $350,000. Noble also found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>victim to be confused at their first meeting, basing his finding on the fact that the victim was unaware of the sizeable investments at her disposal. Noble testified that, later in their relationship, the victim had begun acting out of character, as though someone was telling her what to say. According to Noble, the victim seemed convinced that Noble was trying to take her money. When the victim began making unreasonable requests regarding her stocks, it was apparent to Noble that it was the defendant, and not the victim, who sought to liquidate the victim\u2019s accounts. Once Snyder learned from accounting professionals that the victim\u2019s bills were being neglected and that a sizeable portion of the victim\u2019s funds were being withdrawn by the defendant, he was certain that the defendant was manipulating the victim in order to obtain her assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The witnesses\u2019 testimony as to the victim\u2019s mental incapacity, coupled with evidence that the defendant was siphoning the victim\u2019s accounts, supports the trial court\u2019s conclusions that: (1) the victim lacked the capacity to understand the transfers or consent to them; and (2) the defendant had been unduly influencing the victim in the transfer of her assets. It is a well settled principle that \u201c[t]he determination of a witness\u2019 credibility is the special function of the [trier of fact, which, in the present case, is the] trial court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Trine, </em>236 Conn. 216, 227, 673 A.2d 1098 (1996). The trial court had the opportunity to observe the witnesses and to assess their credibility, and reasonably could have relied on the testimony of the professionals who tried to protect the victim\u2019s assets. As Siegal pointed out, the victim was suffering from dementia, which affects simple executive functioning. Thus, the trial court reasonably could have determined that, in light of the victim\u2019s condition, the victim lacked the capacity to understand transactions of this \u201cmagnitude, frequency and irregular nature.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Spiegel, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>48 N.Y.2d 647, 648-49, 396 N.E.2d 472, 421 N.Y.S.2d 190 (1979). The testimony of the witnesses reasonably could have established beyond a reasonable doubt that, in the trial court\u2019s words, the victim \u201clacked the mental capacity to make any reasonable decision with respect to her assets, her estate and the distribution of those assets and estates, and that she did not have the mental capacity to make gifts,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Having determined that the trial court reasonably could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim was mentally incapable of consenting to the transfer of her assets and that the defendant was aware of that fact, we now focus on the evidence that establishes the defendant\u2019s intent to deprive the victim of her assets permanently in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-122 (a) (2) and 53a-119. \u201cA person commits larceny when, with intent to deprive another of property or to appropriate the same to himself or a third person, he wrongfully takes, obtains or withholds such property from an owner.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119. \u201cAn \u2018owner\u2019 [is] any person who has a right to possession superior to that of a taker, obtainer or withholder.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-118 (a) (5); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Morant, </em>242 Conn. 666, 671, 701 A.2d 1 (1997). In order to sustain a conviction under Connecticut\u2019s larceny provisions, therefore, we require proof of the existence of a felonious intent to deprive the owner of the property permanently. See <em>State </em>v. Marra, supra, 174 Conn. 342. \u201cIt has been firmly established as a constitutional right that the state bears the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt on each essential element of the crime charged. . . . [Thus, since a] specific intent [to deprive an owner permanently of his or her property] is an essential element of larceny . . . [it] must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt by the state.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>198 Conn. 1, 20, 501 A.2d 1195 (1985). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>review the evidence presented at trial, and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, in a light most favorable to sustaining the trial court\u2019s finding of guilt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>supra, 231 Conn. 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The substantial evidence recounted previously in this opinion and the nature of the defendant\u2019s handling of the victim\u2019s accounts point to an intent on the part of the defendant permanently to deprive the victim of her assets. It is evident that the defendant attempted to isolate the victim from those individuals who were concerned for the security of her assets, namely, Frame, Snyder and Sizemore of protective services. Furthermore, once a conservatorship hearing was scheduled, the defendant did everything in her power to contest the proceedings. She retained an attorney to oppose the appointment of a conservator, retained a physician to evaluate the victim and even went as far as \u201ccoaching\u201d the victim on her pending testimony regarding the nature of, and reasons for, the transfer of her assets. Furthermore, when the defendant faced opposition from the victim\u2019s attorneys and individuals seeking to protect the victim\u2019s assets, she became alarmingly hostile and defensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Bank records, however, paint the most vivid picture of the way in which the defendant wrongfully gained control of the victim\u2019s assets. The defendant, over a period of time, transferred $833,145.03 of the victim\u2019s assets from various accounts and sources into one of the victim\u2019s accounts at Centerbank. From that cumulative Centerbank account, in a matter of twenty days, the defendant made cash withdrawals and transferred almost $800,000 to herself, accounts in her name and accounts in the names of related third parties. Between November 30, 1995, and December 19, 1995, the defendant withdrew, transferred and gifted approximately $794,000 from the Centerbank account that she had created with the victim\u2019s funds. That $794,000 was dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>bursed in the following manner: $75,000 was deposited into an account at New Haven Savings Bank in the defendant\u2019s name; $150,000 was deposited into a First Fidelity bank account in the defendant\u2019s name; $145,800 was deposited into two separate accounts at Dime Savings Bank, both in the defendant\u2019s name; $320,491.07 was deposited into an account at American Savings Bank in the name of the defendant and Burch; $40,008.93 was deposited into two separate Centerbank accounts, one in the name of the defendant\u2019s brother, Leo Calonico, the other in the name of Leo Calonico and his wife, Jennifer Calonico; and the defendant withdrew $32,100 in cash. Additionally, $30,500 was withdrawn in the form of a cashier\u2019s check payable to a car dealership for the purchase of an automobile that ultimately was registered in the defendant\u2019s name. The defendant purchased a home, held in her name and the name of Burch, with at least some of the appropriated funds. The defendant also bought a used car for Katherine Terry, Burch\u2019s daughter. Additionally, some of the money withdrawn in cash remains unaccounted for. In March, 1996, the main Centerbank account that the defendant had created with the victim\u2019s money was frozen with a remaining balance of only $40,472.86.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">We conclude that the trial court reasonably could have found that the victim\u2019s money was transferred with the specific intent to deprive the victim of her assets in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-122 (a) (2) and 53a-119. \u201cLarceny involves both taking and retaining. The criminal intent involved in larceny relates to both aspects. The taking must be wrongful, that is, without color of right or excuse for the act . . . and without the knowing consent of the owner. . . . The requisite intent for retention is permanency.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kurvin, </em>186 Conn. 555, 568, 442 A.2d 1327 (1982). \u201cIntent . . . can be inferred both from the defendant\u2019s conduct and his [or her] statements at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>crime . . . [and therefore] whether such an inference should be drawn is properly a question for the [trier of fact] to decide.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>212 Conn. 31, 45-46, 561 A.2d 897 (1989). According to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-118 (a) (3), \u201cdeprive\u201d means \u201c(A) to withhold [property] or cause it to be withheld from [the owner] permanently or for so extended a period or under such circumstances that the major portion of its economic value or benefit is lost to him, or (B) to dispose of the property in such manner or under such circumstances as to render it unlikely that an owner will recover such property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The defendant\u2019s intent to deprive the victim of her assets was demonstrated, not only by the victim\u2019s obvious inability to consent to the transfers, but also by the lengths to which the defendant had gone to gain control over the victim\u2019s assets and appropriate them for her own permanent use. We are satisfied that the status of the victim\u2019s assets as summarized by the state proves that the defendant intended to deprive the victim of her assets permanently and use them solely for the benefit of herself, her friends and family.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Therefore, the trial court reasonably could have found, on the basis of the evidence presented at trial, that the defendant intended permanently to appropriate the victim\u2019s assets for her own use, that the victim was incapable of giving consent and that the defendant was aware of the victim\u2019s mental incapacity. Consequently, the trial court reasonably could have concluded that the state had proven all of the elements of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-122 (a) (2) and 53a-119 beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53a-122 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of larceny in the first degree when he commits larceny as defined in section 53a-119 and ...

Fischer was contacted by the defendant and retained to represent the victim at a hearing being held to determine whether the victim needed a conservator. He testified that the defendant contacted him to oppose the appointment of a conservator for the victim\u2019s estate, stating that the victim feared it was only taking place to put her in a nursing home. The conservatorship, however, was initiated solely to protect the assets and physical well-being of the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\"> There were suspicious circumstances surrounding the telephone call from the victim on the day of the scheduled meeting. First, there was evidence that a younger woman claiming to be the victim called and then hung up when Noble picked up the telephone. Shortly thereafter, a second telephone call was made, but the victim was on the line when Noble picked up the telephone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b166-8\"> Noble testified that, when he told the victim about the capital gains taxes she would be required to pay, she faltered in her speech and began talking to someone in the background.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b167-8\"> Esposito testified that, pursuant to statute, a Probate Court judge must appoint an attorney when a conservatorship is being proposed and the subject of the conservatorship \u201cis either unable or unaware that [he or she] need[s] an attorney.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b168-7\"> According to Siegal\u2019s <em>testimony, </em>the Folstein <em>test, </em>or Folstein mental status questionnaire, \u201cis a thirty point cognitive rating assessment instrument\u201d that tests a person\u2019s capacity to concentrate.

Although there is some question as to whether the defendant hired August, August did forward a bill to the defendant after he had rendered his services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b169-7\"> August agreed with Siegal that mild organic brain syndrome is the functional equivalent of mild dementia. August indicated, however, that the difference between the two conditions is that mild organic brain syndrome could be subject to some reversibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b170-8\"> Fischer testified that this testimony had played a part in changing his opinion regarding the victim\u2019s competency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b170-9\"> They encountered some protest from Minnie Calonico, who had been instructed not to let anyone into the victim\u2019s home.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b171-7\"> Nine differenl Centerbank accounts were reviewed.

They were unsuccessful. Records from Gaylord Hospital describe how the victim required verbal cues to locate door handles and physical assistance to start the car. The victim also drove excessively slow, made wide right turns, crossing into traffic, and had difficulty recalling verbal directions. Additionally, she made several unsafe left turns in front of oncoming traffic and stopped the vehicle at every side road and green light. The records also report that, at one point, the victim stated that her right shoe was loose and, thereafter, stopped the car in the middle of moderate traffic to adjust it. Finally, when the victim went to park the car, she hit a metal post that served as a visual guide and tried to exit with her seatbelt still fastened and the keys in the ignition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b177-7\"> Siegal defined, dementia as \u201can overall term that refers to impairments in cognitive functioning to such a degree that it [sic] interferes with an individual\u2019s day-to-day existence.\u201d Dementia is usually thought of in stages of mild, moderate or severe.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b177-8\"> Siegal testified that \u201cpatients [suffering from dementia] . . . have impairments in executive functioning, their ability to plan for the future [and in] dealing] with instrumental activities of daily living, which includes [sic] paying bills [and] handling their finances [among other things].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b178-8\"> \u201cIt is well settled that a nonexpert witness may testify as to his [or her] impression of another\u2019s mental or emotional state if that opinion is reliable and based on the [witness\u2019] observations.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Spigarolo, </em>210 Conn. 359, 371, 556 A.2d 112, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 933, 110 S.
