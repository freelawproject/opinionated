(Reader\u2019s Digest), and QSP, Inc. (QSP), with respect to a controversy with the defendants, American Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Company and American Motorists Insurance Company (collectively American Motorists), General Star National Insurance Company (GenStar) and Federal Insurance Company (Federal),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> over potential insurance coverage to be provided by the defendants under commercial general liability and excess liability policies that they had issued to the plaintiffs. The policies covered, among other things, the defense of actions based on advertising or personal injury. The plaintiffs sought a declaration as to whether they were entitled, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>the terms of any or all of the policies effective during the relevant time period, to the defense of and indemnification for an underlying antitrust class action filed in federal court and entitled <em>Roman Catholic Bishop of San Diego </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Assn., Inc., &amp; QSP, Inc., </em>United States District Court, Docket No. 93-1953-IEG (CM) (S.D. Cal.) <em>(Bishop </em>action).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court concluded that the defendants were not under a duty to defend the plaintiffs in the <em>Bishop </em>action. We agree and therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the disposition of the issues on appeal. QSP is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the state of Delaware, with its principal place of business in Ridgefield. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Reader\u2019s Digest. Reader\u2019s Digest is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the state of Delaware, with its principal place of business in Pleasantville, New York. American Motorists sold commercial general liability insurance coverage to Reader\u2019s Digest for the period from 1990 to 1996.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> GenStar and Federal provided excess liability coverage to Reader\u2019s Digest from 1989 to 1994. QSP, as a subsidiary of Reader\u2019s Digest, is covered as an insured under the relevant policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>In December, 1993, the plaintiffs in the <em>Bishop </em>action filed their federal antitrust class action lawsuit, alleging that QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest had violated federal antitrust laws by monopolizing the school and youth group magazine fund-raising market. The class of plaintiffs in the <em>Bishop </em>action consisted of all school-related entities in the continental United States that had purchased magazine fund-raising programs from QSP in any one or more years from 1990 to 1993. The <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs alleged that QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest had eliminated or weakened competition in the school fund-raising market by conducting \u201canticompetitive, predatory and exclusionary acts\u201d including, but not limited to: (1) defamation of the character and competence of their competitors; (2) commercial disparagement; (3) unfair competition; and (4) threatening and instituting bad faith litigation as part of a campaign of anticompetitive disparagement<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as a result of the alleged unlawful conduct of Reader\u2019s Digest and QSP. The <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs claimed that they were deprived of substantial magazine fund-raising revenues that they otherwise would have received if there were competition in the market. They further claimed that, because of the diminished revenue, they were forced to cut important educational and extracurricular programs and activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest entered into a settlement agreement with the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs in October, 1996. The terms of the settlement expanded the class of <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs to include all United States schools that had purchased magazine fund-raising programs from QSP between 1990 and 1995, and obligated Read<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>er\u2019s Digest and QSP to pay members of the class of <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs $15 million, plus certain additional cash equivalents.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest gave notice of the lawsuit and settlement to their primary carriers, American Motorists, which refused either to defend them in the <em>Bishop </em>action or to reimburse them for costs incurred in defending or settling the class action lawsuit. American Motorists stated that their insurance policies covered only claims by competitors, and did not cover claims by customers, like the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs, who alleged damages flowing from the anticompetitive conduct of the insured. Additionally, American Motorists argued that their policy provisions covering \u201cadvertising injury,\u201d \u201cadvertising offense,\u201d and \u201cpersonal injury\u201d did not cover federal antitrust violations when those violations \u201carose out of\u2019 covered offenses, such as defamation, disparagement, malicious prosecution or unfair competition, where those offenses had not been committed against the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> GenStar and Federal, as Reader\u2019s Digest\u2019s excess liability carriers, also refused to defend Reader\u2019s Digest and QSP or indemnify them for damages awarded in the <em>Bishop </em>action under the \u201cadvertising offense\u201d section of their policies, claiming that the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs\u2019 injuries arose out of the existence of a monopoly, rather than out of unfair competition committed in the course of advertising activities.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest filed the present action in the Superior Court in response to the insurance companies\u2019 refusal to defend or indemnify them in the underlying <em>Bishop </em>action. In their complaint, QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest alleged that because the antitrust complaint in the underlying <em>Bishop </em>action alleged defamation, commercial disparagement, bad faith litigation and unfair competition, they were entitled to defense and indemnification on the ground that their insurance policies expressly covered claims arising out of those offenses. The defendants responded that there was no duty to defend because: (1) the <em>Bishop </em>action was based solely on allegations of illegal monopolization and antitrust violations, rather than any offenses enumerated under the relevant policy provisions; and (2) the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs did not suffer any direct injury as a result of the alleged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">In a thorough and well reasoned decision, the trial court, <em>Levin, </em>J., granted the cross motions by the defendants for summary judgment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court: found that \u201cthe defendants were not under a duty to defend [QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest] in the <em>Bishop </em>action because (1) the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs [did] not state facts showing defamation, disparagement, malicious prosecution or unfair competition [as recognized under the \u2018personal injury,\u2019 \u2018advertising injury\u2019 or \u2018advertising offense\u2019 sections of the American Motorists and GenStar policies]; (2) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number><em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs did not allege that they were the targets of those offenses; and (3) the antitrust injuries which the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs [did] allege [did] not \u2018arise out of these torts.\u201d QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest appealed to the Appellate Court on their motion, and the matter was transferred to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-2.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We agree with the conclusions of the trial court and, therefore, affirm its judgment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">On appeal, QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest claim that the trial court, in granting the defendants\u2019 cross motions for summary judgment, improperly concluded that the defendants had no duty to defend or indemnify them in the underlying antitrust action. QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest challenge the trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment in the insurers\u2019 favor, relying on the settled principle that \u201can insurer\u2019s duty to defend, [is] much broader in scope and application than its duty to indemnify, [and] . . . [t]he obligation of the insurer to defend does not depend on whether the injured party will suc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>cessfully maintain a cause of action against the insured but on whether he has, in his complaint, stated facts which bring the injury within the coverage.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Springdale Donuts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. of Illinois, </em>247 Conn. 801, 807, 724 A.2d 1117 (1999). QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest argue that, because the antitrust claim in the underlying <em>Bishop </em>action was couched in terms of defamation, commercial disparagement, bad faith litigation and unfair competition, they were entitled to defense and indemnification under the \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d \u201cadvertising injury\u201d and \u201cadvertising offense\u201d sections of the relevant policies. We conclude that these allegations do not trigger the defendants\u2019 duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Before addressing the merits of this dispute, we set forth the standard of review for summary judgment which is well established. \u201cSummary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. . . . In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Orkney </em>v. <em>Hanover Ins. Co., </em>248 Conn. 195, 201, 727 A.2d 700 (1999); see Practice Book \u00a7 17-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Our standard of review with respect to insurance contracts is also well settled. \u201cIt is the function of the court to construe the provisions of the contract of insurance. . . . The [interpretation of an insurance policy . . . involves a determination of the intent of the parties as expressed by the language of the policy . . . [including] what coverage the . . . [insured] expected to receive and what the [insurer] was to provide, as disclosed by the provisions of the policy. ... [A] contract of insurance must be viewed in its entirety, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>intent of the parties for entering it derived from the four comers of the policy . . . [giving the] words . . . [of the policy] their natural and ordinary meaning . . . [and construing] any ambiguity in the terms ... in favor of the insured . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Springdale Donuts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. of Illinois, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 805-806.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018[B]ecause the proper constmction of a policy of insurance presents a question of law, the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the policy is subject to de novo review on appeal.\u2019 \u201d Id., 806; see also <em>Imperial Casualty &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>State, </em>246 Conn. 313, 322 n.6, 714 A.2d 1230 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\u201cIt is well established [however] that a liability insurer has a duty to defend its insured in a pending lawsuit if the pleadings allege a covered occurrence, even though facts outside the four corners of those pleadings indicate that the claim may be meritless or not covered . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Fitzpatrick </em>v. <em>American Honda Motor Co., </em>78 N.Y.2d 61, 63, 575 N.E.2d 90, 571 N.Y.S.2d 672 (1991); see also, e.g., <em>Ruder &amp; Finn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Seaboard Surety Co., </em>52 N.Y.2d 663, 669-70, 22 N.E.2d 518, 439 N.Y.S.2d 858 (1981). \u201c[T]he oft-stated principle [is] that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Fitzpatrick </em>v. <em>American Honda Motor Co., </em>supra, 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">PERSONAL INJURY</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">We begin our analysis with a review of the language of the American Motorists policies. The American <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Motorists\u2019 commercial general liability policies provide that the insurer \u201cwill pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of [a] \u2018personal injury\u2019 ... to which this coverage part applies. [The insurer] will have the right and duty to defend any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking those damages. . . . [The insurer] may . . . investigate any \u2018occurrence\u2019 . . . and settle any claim or \u2018suit\u2019 that may result. ...\u201d Section V (10) of the policy provides in relevant part that \u201c \u2018[p]ersonal injury\u2019 means injury, other than \u2018bodily injury,\u2019 arising out of . . . malicious prosecution . . . [or] [o]ral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person\u2019s or organization\u2019s goods, products or services . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> An \u201c \u2018occurrence\u2019 \u201d is defined in section V (9) as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d In order for the allegations of the underlying complaint to fall within the policy coverage for \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d the complaint must allege an injury that \u201carose out of\u2019 one of the offenses listed in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest first contend that the trial court improperly concluded that the defendants had no duty to defend them in the <em>Bishop </em>action because it is an action for federal antitrust violations not covered by the policies. More specifically, QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest claim that the trial court should have found coverage because the charges of federal antitrust violations in the <em>Bishop </em>action rested on underlying allegations of defamation, disparagement and malicious prosecution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>all covered offenses under the \u201cpersonal injury\u201d section of the American Motorists policy. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">As stated previously, the duty to defend does not arise only when the injured party can successfully maintain a cause of action against the insured. That duty arises when the complaint states facts that bring the injury within the policy coverage. See <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em>252 Conn. 405, 409, 746 A.2d 1252 (2000) (\u201c[i]f an allegation of the complaint falls even possibly within the coverage, then the insurance company must defend the insured\u201d). \u201cOn the other hand, if the complaint alleges a liability which the policy does not cover, the insurer is not required to defend.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Springdale Donuts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. of Illinois, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 807; see also <em>First Investors Corp. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>152 F.3d 162, 165 (2d Cir. 1998) (duty to defend under New York law \u201cexceedingly broad\u201d but not without limits). \u201c[T]he duty to defend derives . . . not from the complaint [as] drafted by a third party, but rather from the insurer\u2019s own contract with the insured . . . .\u201d <em>Fitzpatrick </em>v. <em>American Honda Motor Co., </em>supra, 78 N.Y.2d 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest claim that the following allegations in the <em>Bishop </em>complaint trigger coverage under the \u201cpersonal injury\u201d provisions of the American Motorist policy:<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (1) paragraph 29 (c) alleges that QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest <em>\u201cdefamed </em>the character and competence of individual owners, officers, agents and employees of <em>competitors </em>... by falsely stating . . . that such individuals had embezzled or stolen large sums of money, had been fired by QSP for dishonesty or incompetence, or had illegally taped conversations\u201d; (emphasis added); (2) paragraph 29 (d) alleges that QSP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>and Reader\u2019s Digest <em>\u201cdisparaged competing firms </em>by misrepresenting their reliability, capability, integrity and financial stability\u201d through false statements; (emphasis added); (3) paragraph 29 (e) alleges that QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest <em>\u201cthreatened and instituted bad faith </em>litigation\u201d as part of their campaign of anticompetitive disparagement. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest claim that because the <em>Bishop </em>complaint describes the underlying offenses in terms of defamation, disparagement and malicious prosecution, there is at least a possibility of coverage. The defendants, on the other hand, argue that the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs simply were using these tort-based descriptions to identify the primary charge: wilful violation of federal antitrust laws by Reader\u2019s Digest and QSP. We agree with the defendants and conclude that there is no duty to defend under the personal injury provision of the American Motorists\u2019 policy because the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs are not the proper parties to raise the allegations that QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest claim trigger coverage, nor did the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs suffer any injury that would be causally connected to any offense covered under \u201cpersonal injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">First, we address the claim by QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest that paragraph 29 (c) of the <em>Bishop </em>complaint, which alleges that QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest <em>\u201cdefamed </em>the character and competence of individual owners, officers, agents and employees of competitors\u201d; (emphasis added); brings the <em>Bishop </em>action within their policy coverage under the \u201cpersonal injury\u201d provision as defined previously. The trial court disagreed, concluding that \u201c[bjecause the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs did not allege that they themselves were defamed, the <em>Bishop </em>action did not allege a claim for defamation which the defendants were required to defend.\u201d We agree with the trial court. Where the alleged defamatory statements were not made about the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>do not satisfy the \u201cof and concerning\u201d element crucial to prevailing on a common-law defamation claim. See <em>Daley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>249 Conn. 766, 795, 734 A.2d 112 (1999); <em>Torosyan </em>v. <em>Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>234 Conn. 1, 27, 662 A.2d 89 (1995); see also <em>Eckhaus </em>v. <em>Alfa-Laval, Inc., </em>764 F. Sup. 34, 37 n.4 (S.D.N.Y. 1991); 3 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 564 and comment (a) (1976) (\u201c[a] defamatory communication is made concerning the person to whom its recipient correctly, or mistakenly but reasonably, understands that it was intended to refer\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In order for QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest to establish that the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs suffered prima facie defamation, they must show that: (1) QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest made a defamatory statement; (2) the defamatory statement identified the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs to a reasonable third person; (3) the defamatory statement was published to a third person; and (4) the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs\u2019 reputation suffered injury as a result of the defamatory statement. See <em>Lizotte </em>v. <em>Welker, </em>45 Conn. Sup. 217, 219-20, 709 A.2d 50 (1996), aff'd, 244 Conn. 156, 709 A.2d 1 (1998); see also 3 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 559 (\u201c[a] communication is defamatory if it tends to so harm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with him\u201d). Where a plaintiff cannot prove a fundamental element of the underlying tort, e.g., defamation, a claim for personal injury coverage will be denied. See <em>Liberty Bank of Montana </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. of America, </em>870 F.2d 1504, 1508 (9th Cir. 1989); <em>Brooklyn Law School </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>661 F. Sup. 445, 453 (E.D.N.Y. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>The <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs were not the parties about whom the defamatory statements allegedly had been made by QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest, nor had the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs suffered any harm to their reputation from the alleged defamation. Instead, as the <em>Bishop </em>complaint suggests, QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest defamed \u201cindividual owners, officers, agents and employees <em>of competitors </em>in the school/youth group magazine fund raising market . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest do not provide any authority that the \u201cof and concerning\u201d element is unnecessary when establishing a cause of action for defamation. See, e.g., <em>Auvil </em>v. <em>CBS 60 </em>Minutes, 800 F. Sup. 941, 944 (E.D. Wash. 1992) (court aware of no case law suggesting that publication not \u201cof and concerning\u201d identifiable target can be converted into \u201cof and concerning\u201d attack due to actions of third parties). They argue only that no \u201cof and concerning\u201d requirement appears in the policy language. This observation is inapposite because we interpret the words of the policies according to their \u201ccommon, ordinary and customary meaning.\u201d <em>Izzo </em>v. <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co., </em>203 Conn. 305, 309, 524 A.2d 641 (1987). In this case, it was the competitors of QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest who allegedly were defamed, and they have been compensated through the settlement of a separate underlying action brought on their behalf entitled <em>Burkett </em>v. <em>Reader's Digest Assn., Inc., </em>San Diego County Superior Court, Case No. 621222 <em>(Burkett </em>action). The <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs make no claim for damages arising out of defamation. We conclude, therefore, that QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest are not entitled to \u201cpersonal injury\u201d coverage for defamation charges that never were alleged in the <em>Bishop </em>complaint. If the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs did suffer damages as a result of the defamation by QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest of their magazine fund-raising competitors, those damages were indirect and only tenuously related to that defamatory conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>We next address the argument by QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest that the <em>Bishop </em>complaint states a cause of action for commercial disparagement, also known as \u201cinjurious falsehood\u201d or \u201ctrade libel,\u201d committed by QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest against their competitors. Paragraph 29 (d) of the <em>Bishop </em>complaint alleges in relevant part that QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest \u201cdisparaged competing firms by misrepresenting their reliability, capability, integrity and financial stability\u201d by falsely alleging, among other things, that they did not deliver magazine orders despite having been paid. Included in the definition of \u201cpersonal injury\u201d in the American Motorists\u2019 policy is coverage for injuries arising out of the \u201c[o]ral or written publication of material that . . . disparages a person\u2019s or organization\u2019s goods, products or services . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Defamation or disparagement of a business\u2019 goods and services may be considered trade libel; <em>Securitron Magnalock Corp. </em>v. <em>Schnabolk, </em>65 F.3d 256, 265 (2d Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1114, 116 S.

This is consistent with our treatment of business disparagement like defamation, requiring that the statement that disparages a person\u2019s goods or services be made \u201cof and concerning\u201d the person stating the cause of action. See, e.g., <em>Charles Parker Co. </em>v. <em>Silver City Crystal Co., </em>supra, 142 Conn. 609-15; <em>Ruder &amp; Finn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Seaboard Surety Co., </em>supra, 52 N.Y.2d 670-71. Not only were the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs not harmed in their trade or business, but no such claim of business disparagement was made by the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs in their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">It is clear from the allegations of the <em>Bishop </em>complaint that any commercially disparaging conduct on the part of QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest had been directed against their competitors and not against the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs. Because the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs were not the targets of the alleged commercial disparagement committed by QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest, the complaint simply does not give rise to a disparagement action. As a result, the complaint did not trigger coverage for commercial disparagement under the defendants\u2019 policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">We finally address the claim by QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest that the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of \u201cmalicious prosecution\u201d triggered personal injury coverage.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>In a malicious prosecution or vexatious litigation action, \u201cit is necessary to prove want of probable cause, malice and a termination of [the] suit in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor.\u201d <em>DeLaurentis </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>220 Conn. 225, 248, 597 A.2d 807 (1991).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201c[Establishing] a cause of action for vexatious suit requires proof that a civil action has been prosecuted not only without probable cause but also with malice. <em>Bridgeport Hydraulic Co. </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>139 Conn. 186, 194, 91 A.2d 778 (1952) ....

Paragraph 29 (m) also alleged that QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest \u201cmade unfounded allegations of possible legal and ethical violations, and have threatened to initiate actions against individual lawyers and their firms if they participated in [the <em>Bishop] </em>action.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Again, we conclude that, because the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs did not allege that they had suffered personal injury due to vexatious litigation or malicious prosecution, personal injury coverage was not triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest rely on <em>Ethicon, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>737 F. Sup. 1320 (S.D.N.Y. 1990), in which the court found a duty to defend in an antitrust action that, when stripped of its antitrust label, met the requirements for a malicious prosecution claim in California. The present case is different. In <em>Ethicon, Inc., </em>the plaintiffs in the underlying antitrust action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>were also the victims of the vexatious litigation. As a result, the court held that they satisfied the elements necessary to raise such a claim and trigger personal injury coverage. Id., 1333. The <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs, on the other hand, are not claiming injuries as a result of vexatious litigation and do not base their complaint on that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">In this case, the threats of litigation were lodged against competitors of QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest, and their lawyers, not the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs. The use of the phrase \u201cbad faith litigation\u201d in their description of the antitrust allegations does not bring the <em>Bishop </em>complaint within the policy coverage. Therefore, the <em>Bishop </em>complaint was not a personal injury action arising out of vexatious litigation or malicious prosecution and could not trigger personal injury coverage under that policy language.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">ADVERTISING INJURY</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest also make a claim for coverage under the \u201cadvertising injury\u201d and \u201cadvertising offense\u201d provisions of the American Motorists and Gen-Star policies. First, they claim that \u201cthe <em>Bishop </em>complaint\u2019s allegation that [Reader\u2019s Digest] and QSP engaged in a \u2018campaign\u2019 of disparagement, misstatements to customers in promoting [Reader\u2019s Digest] and QSP, and subsidizing promotional activities constitute advertising.\u201d Second, QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest argue that several subparagraphs of paragraph 29 of the <em>Bishop </em>complaint give rise to coverage under GenStar\u2019s policies for the advertising offense of unfair competition. The trial court concluded that \u201c[b]ecause the <em>Bishop </em>complaint did not allege that any wrong covered by the defendants\u2019 policies was caused by advertising, there was no duty to defend under the advertising injury [or] advertising offense coverage of either [the Ameri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>can Motorists or GenStar policies]\u201d and that the <em>Bishop </em>complaint did not allege a cause of action for unfair competition under the advertising offense provision of the GenStar and Federal policies because \u201cit neither alleged the misappropriation of a commercial advantage belonging to the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs, nor [did it allege] that the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs suffered [a] competitive injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest challenge the trial court\u2019s conclusions and argue that: (1) the term \u201cadvertising\u201d should be defined broadly, to include a \u201ccampaign\u201d of conduct; and (2) the term \u201cunfair competition\u201d also should be defined broadly to include underlying allegations of antitrust violations, even where the acts constituting such violations are not committed directly against the parties bringing the cause of action. We are not persuaded by their argument and, therefore, agree with the conclusions of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">We first address the claim of QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest that the defendants have a duty to defend under the \u201cadvertising injury\u201d and \u201cadvertising offense\u201d sections of their policies. Section V (1) of the American Motorists policies provides in relevant part that \u201c \u2018[advertising injury\u2019 means injury arising out of . . . [o]ral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person\u2019s or organization\u2019s goods, products or services . . . .\u201d This coverage applies to only \u201c \u2018[advertising injury\u2019 caused by an offense committed in the course of advertising [the insured\u2019s] goods, products or services . . . .\u201d Gen-Star\u2019s policy language defines \u201c \u2018Advertising Offense\u2019 \u201d in relevant part as any \u201c(1) libel, slander or defamation . . . [or] (3) piracy or <em>unfair competition </em>or idea misappropriation under an implied contract . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The policy states that GenStar will \u201cdefend any suit against the Insured seeking damages on account of . . . [an] advertising offense,\u201d where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>such offense is \u201ccommitted or alleged to have been committed in any advertisement, publicity article, broadcast or telecast and arising out of the Named Insured\u2019s advertising activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The trial court in this case defined \u201c \u2018advertisement,\u2019 \u201d according to its dictionary definition, as \u201c \u2018the act or process of advertising ... a public notice; esp: one published in the press or broadcast.\u2019 Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary (1991).\u201d We defined the word \u201cadvertise\u201d in <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>208 Conn. 146, 155, 543 A.2d 1339 (1988), as follows: \u201cto announce publicly especially] by a printed notice or a broadcast; [and] to call public attention to esp[ecially] by emphasizing desirable qualities so as to arouse a desire to buy or patronize.\u201d \u201cBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary defines advertising in a manner that would include such dissemination of information [as]: [a]ny oral, written, or graphic statement made by the seller in any manner in connection with the solicitation of business . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Elan Pharmaceutical Research Corp. </em>v. <em>Employers Ins. of Wausau, </em>144 F.3d 1372, 1377 (11th Cir. 1998). As pointed out by the trial court, in New York, advertising has been defined by the courts as \u201cthe calling of information to the attention of the public, by whatever means.\u201d <em>Koffler v. Joint Bar Assn. Grievance Committee, </em>51 N.Y.2d 140, 146, 412 N.E.2d 927, 432 N.Y.S.2d 872 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">\u201cCourts have differed over precisely what type of conduct constitutes advertising activity. A number of courts have defined the term expansively to include even individual sales pitches to individual consumers; but other courts have defined it more narrowly.\u201d <em>Elan Pharmaceutical Research Corp. </em>v. <em>Employers Ins. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number><em>Wausau, </em>supra, 144 F.3d 1376.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The court in <em>Elan Pharmaceutical Research Corp. </em>stated that \u201c[a] plain and ordinary reading of the definition of advertising activity in [the insurer\u2019s] policies would include an insured\u2019s dissemination of information to promote a product or service.\u201d Id., 1377. \u201cMoreover, the courts that have considered the issue of advertising activity in similar contexts have defined it in terms that include the dissemination of information to promote a product. See e.g., <em>Smartfoods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Northbrook Property &amp; Cas. Co., </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 239, 243-44, 618 N.E.2d 1365, 1368 (1993) (\u2018[Advertising means a public announcement to proclaim the qualities of a product. . . . Wide dissemination of information is typically the objective of advertising.\u2019) . . . .\u201d <em>Elan Pharmaceutical Research Corp. </em>v. <em>Employers Ins. of Wausau, </em>supra, 1377 (dissemination of clinical studies to develop market for one of Elan\u2019s products appears to fall well within definition of advertising activity provided in insurance policies and case law). A common theme, however, is the requirement that information must be publicly or widely disseminated in order to be considered \u201cadvertising.\u201d See <em>Delta Pride Catfish, Inc. </em>v. <em>Home Ins. Co., </em>697 So. 2d 400, 403 (Miss. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest argue that the term \u201cadvertise\u201d should be broadly defined; see <em>Amsel </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>141 Conn. 288, 299, 106 A.2d 152 (1954) (term \u201c \u2018advertise\u2019 \u201d covers \u201ca wide range . . . through [a] whole gamut of means and devices for arousing public interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>and patronage\u201d); and should include the \u201ccampaign\u201d of monopolistic conduct that ultimately gave rise to the underlying antitrust action. We disagree. The <em>Bishop </em>complaint, phrased in terms of monopolistic and anti-competitive conduct, never mentions the word \u201cadvertising,\u201d nor is there any evidence that the alleged anticompetitive conduct was facilitated by a widespread advertising campaign by QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest against the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs. To the contrary, there is little evidence in the record that even suggests that a derogatory advertising campaign was launched by QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest against their competitors in the magazine fund-raising market. QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest seem to be relying on catchphrases from their own complaint, such as \u201c \u2018scheme\u2019 to obtain monopoly power,\u201d and \u201cadvertising . . . the Reader\u2019s Digest name,\u201d to sustain an argument that they launched a campaign of anticompetitive and disparaging conduct that would be covered under the auspice of advertising injury.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> There is nothing in the record that suggests that the alleged defamatory or disparaging conduct would have taken place in connection with advertising against anyone other than competitors in the magazine fund-raising market. More importantly, there is nothing in <em>the Bishop </em>complaint that warrants a charge of advertising injuiy in the first place. Thus, because there was no public dissemination of defamatory or disparaging materials, there can be no causal connection between the advertising by QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest and the injuries alleged by the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest also argue that there is coverage under the \u201cadvertising offense\u201d provision of the GenStar and Federal policies because the <em>Bishop </em>complaint stated a cause of action for common-law \u201cunfair competition.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> GenStar\u2019s policy language defines \u201cadvertising offense\u201d to include <em>\u201cunfair compe</em>tition(emphasis added); and states that GenStar will \u201cdefend any suit against the Insured seeking damages on account of [unfair competition] . . . committed or alleged to have been committed in any advertisement, publicity article, broadcast or telecast and arising out of the Named Insured\u2019s advertising activities.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In order to trigger coverage for \u201cunfair competition,\u201d the policies require that the underlying action allege not only the offense itself, but also that it arose out of the insured\u2019s advertising activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\u201c[T]he policy imposes two requirements for coverage of an advertising injury, even when a specified offense ... is involved.

Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Connecticut has not addressed the issue, New York does not require direct competition between a plaintiff and a defendant in order to sustain a cause of action for common-law unfair competition.

In the context of advertising injuries, however, we agree with the decision in <em>Granite State Ins.

After all, \u2018competition\u2019 connotes an insured\u2019s relationship with other persons or entities supplying similar goods or services.\u201d Id., 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest argue that the <em>Bishop </em>complaint states a cause of action for improper interference \u25a0with business practices, analogous to unfair competition under the broad <em>Larsen Chelsey Realty Co. </em>standard, thereby warranting coverage as an \u201cadvertising injury.\u201d GenStar argues that QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest are manufacturing coverage by injecting into their briefs phrases like \u201c \u2018wrongfully competed\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018unfair competitive practices,\u2019 \u201d which did not appear in the underlying action. We conclude not only that there was no claim of unfair competition raised in the <em>Bishop </em>complaint, but also that, even if there were such a claim, there would have been no plausible nexus between it and the insureds\u2019 advertising activity. We conclude that there was nothing in the record to show that QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest improperly interfered with anyone\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>business or property, or that they did so through advertising. Emphasizing our original personal injuiy analysis, we therefore conclude that the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs made no allegations of advertising offenses, or unfair competition arising therefrom, that would trigger advertising injury coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\u201cARISING OUT OF\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest also argue that the trial court improperly concluded that the defendants had no duty to defend because: (1) the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs\u2019 injuries did not arise out of covered torts, but rather arose out of the existence of a monopoly; and (2) there was no coverage where the underlying action alleged only consequential damages by parties not directly injured by the covered torts. QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest assert that even though the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs\u2019 claimed injuries were indirect, they arose out of the torts of defamation, disparagement, malicious prosecution and unfair competition, all of which are covered by the defendants\u2019 policies. They assert, therefore, that coverage is triggered as a result of the consequential damages arising out of those offenses alleged by the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs in the underlying complaint. The defendants, on the other hand, assert that the \u201carising out of\u201d language in an insurance policy refers to the injury suffered and cannot be used to expand the list of enumerated offenses or broaden coverage to include even those remote injuries suffered by a tenuously connected plaintiff. We agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">The relevant policy language covers \u201cpersonal injury\u201d and \u201cadvertising injury\u201d <em>arising out of </em>defamation, disparagement, malicious prosecution or unfair competition.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The trial court recognized that the term \u201carising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>out of\u2019 is very broad, and that it is the phrase that provides the causal connection between the injury and the offense in both the American Motorists and GenStar policies. \u201c[I]t is generally understood that for liability for an accident or an injury to be said to \u2018arise out of [an occurrence or offense], it is sufficient to show only that the accident or injury \u2018was connected with,\u2019 \u2018had its origins in,\u2019 \u2018grew out of,\u2019 \u2018flowed from,\u2019 or \u2018was incident to\u2019 [that occurrence or offense], in order to meet the requirement that there be a causal relationship between the accident or injury and [that occurrence or offense].\u201d <em>Hogle </em>v. <em>Hogle, </em>167 Conn. 572, 577, 356 A.2d 172 (1975), and cases cited therein. To \u201carise\u201d out of means \u201cto originate from a specified source.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1961); see also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed. 1999) (defining \u201carise\u201d as \u201c1. [t]o originate; to stem [from] ... 2. [t]o result [from]\u201d). \u201cThe phrase arising out of is usually interpreted as indicating] a causal connection.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Coregis Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>American Health Foundation, </em>United States Court of Appeals, Docket No. 99-9300 (2d Cir.

Simply because we recognize, however, the breadth of the term \u201carising out of\u2019 and often interpret coverage ambiguities in favor of the insured does not mean that we will \u201cobligate an insurer to extend coverage based . . . [upon] a reading of the complaint that is . . . conceivable but tortured and unreasonable.\u201d <em>New York </em>v. <em>AMRO Realty Corp., </em>936 F.2d 1420, 1428 (2d Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">In the first paragraph of their complaint, the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs described their class action as one seeking \u201cDamages and Injunctive Relief Based on Violation of Federal Antitrust Laws\u201d through the \u201cmonopolization of trade or commerce in the sale of magazine fund raising plans ... in violation of Section 2 of the Sher<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>man [Antitrust] Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2)\u201d by QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest. Paragraph 29 outlines the monopolistic conduct QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest allegedly committed <em>against their competitors, </em>which lead to the antitrust action, including the claims of defamation, disparagement, malicious prosecution and unfair competition. As this language suggests, and the preceding analysis concludes, none of these torts were committed against the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The <em>Bishop </em>complaint also outlined the \u201canticompetitive effects intended by and resulting from the monopolistic practices\u201d of QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In their conclusion, the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs asserted that the antitrust violations, along with the \u201canticompetitive, predatory, and exclusionary acts\u201d of QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest caused them to suffer injury in their business and property \u201cbecause they have received lower percentages of magazine subscription revenues from QSP, and/or [have] paid more for promotional prizes, than would have been the case in a competitive marketplace.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">It is plain, from a reading of the complaint, that the injuries alleged <em>arose out </em>o/the existence of a monopoly in the school fund-raising market, and not out of the torts of defamation, disparagement, malicious prosecution or unfair competition. As the trial court pointed out, the damages claimed by the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs are inextricably connected to the loss of profits they suffered as a result of the monopoly created by QSP and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Reader\u2019s Digest. <em>See Lazzara Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Columbia Casualty Co., </em>683 F. Sup. 777, 780 (M.D. Fla. 1988). To avoid this conclusion, QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest appear to rely on the general concept that where \u201can allegation of the complaint falls even possibly within the coverage, then the insurance company must defend the insured.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Community Action for Greater Middlesex County, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Alliance Ins. Co., 254 </em>Conn. 387, 399, 757 A.2d 1074 (2000), quoting <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em>supra, 252 Conn. 409; <em>Fitzpatrick </em>v. <em>American Honda Motor Co., </em>supra, 78 N.Y.2d 61 (insurer must defend claim whenever complaint suggests reasonable possibility of coverage despite merits of action). QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest also rely on those cases that hold that the duty to defend does not hinge on the skill or manner in which a complaint is drafted; see, e.g., <em>Andover </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>153 Conn. 439, 443-44, 217 A.2d 60 (1966); but rests on the substantive thrust of the complaint and the surrounding facts. However, \u201c[t]he language [of the policies] in no way can be interpreted to extend coverage to other torts, not specifically enumerated, which bear [only] some similarity to those listed in the policy.\u201d <em>Wake Stone Corp. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>995 F. Sup. 612, 617 (E.D.N.C. 1998). Therefore, although we adhere to \u201cbroad interpretation\u201d standards in construing insurance policies, we conclude that the allegations in the <em>Bishop </em>complaint do not fall \u201ceven possibly within the coverage\u201d; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Continental Casualty Co., </em>supra, 409; of the defendants\u2019 policies because the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs\u2019 damages resulted from antitrust violations, rather than the indeterminately pleaded common-law torts that serve solely as factual background in the underlying complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest argue that \u201cinsurers . . . have a duty to defend their insureds against antitrust suits that also allege other common law business torts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>[e.g., commercial disparagement] where the insurer has issued a general liability insurance policy.\u201d <em>Tews Funeral Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ohio Casualty Ins. Co., </em>832 F.2d 1037, 1043 (7th Cir. 1987), and cases cited therein. Although we do not disagree with this proposition, we conclude nonetheless that in order for covered common-law torts to trigger coverage, those torts and their resultant injuries must have been alleged by the proper plaintiffs. The proper plaintiffs are those individuals who can prove direct injury as a result of defamation, disparagement and the like. For example, in <em>Tews Funeral Home, Inc., </em>the plaintiff was one of thirty-seven other defendants in a nine count antitrust damages action brought in federal court in Illinois entitled <em>Cedar Park Funeral Home </em>v. <em>Illinois Funeral Directors\u2019 Assn., </em>Docket No. 85 C 2137. In <em>Cedar Park Funeral Home, </em>\u201cTews and the other named defendants [were] accused of conspiring to make \u2018false, misleading and defamatory\u2019 statements \u2018disparaging\u2019 the Cedar Park plaintiffs\u2019 [funeral] services and products \u2018with the expressed interest of discouraging\u2019 consumers from buying the Cedar Park plaintiffs\u2019 products and services.\u201d <em>Tews Funeral Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ohio Casualty Ins. Co., </em>supra, 1040. Tews sued the defendant, Ohio Casualty Insurance Company, to determine its rights to defense and indemnification for costs arising out of the antitrust action after a dispute arose regarding coverage. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, adopting the trial court opinion, found that the insurance company did have a duty to defend where \u201cthe federal suit \u2018painted a picture which, had it been established, conceivably could have subjected [the] defendant\u2019s insured ... to liability for commercial disparagement.\u2019 \u201d Id., 1043, quoting <em>Ruder &amp; Finn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Seaboard Casualty Co., </em>supra, 52 N.Y.2d 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\"><em>Tews Funeral Home, Inc., </em>is distinguishable from the present case, however, because the plaintiffs in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>underlying action in that case were the direct targets <em>of </em>the commercial disparagement. In this case, on the other hand, the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs cannot argue that they suffered from commercial disparagement when it was not their goods or services that were being disparaged. The damages they suffered were economic damages arising out of the monopoly allegedly created by the commercial disparagement of the competitors of QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest. The connection between the covered offenses and the resultant injury is far too tenuous to trigger coverage under the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">In <em>Springdale Donuts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. of Illinois, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 806-807, for example, we declined to impose a duty to defend under a workers\u2019 compensation and employer\u2019s liability policy where the plaintiffs in the underlying action claimed injuries for slander and invasion of privacy arising out of sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The plaintiff sought coverage, in part, from Farmington Casualty Company for the claims that had been brought against it in the underlying action by arguing that the workers\u2019 compensation policy language was ambiguous. We concluded, however, that the policy \u201c[vjiewed in its entirety . . . unequivocally indicate[d] that [it] was intended to provide coverage only for claims for worker\u2019s compensation benefits.\u201d Id., 809. The plaintiffs in the underlying action had not gone through the workers\u2019 compensation commission, nor did they state any claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Therefore, where the plaintiff was not making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>a claim for benefits paid pursuant to workers\u2019 compensation law, there was no coverage under the policies. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The defendants in this case cite <em>Wake Stone Corp. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 995 F. Sup. 617, to support their argument that \u201c[t]he \u2018arising out of language . . . refers to the injury, not to the offense\u201d alleged in the underlying complaint and that the \u201cbroad construction [of the phrase \u2018arising out of applies to] . . . causation, not interpretation of the covered offenses.\u201d In that case, the plaintiff, Wake Stone Corporation, argued that there was a duty to defend under its \u201cpersonal injury\u201d coverage for an underlying action brought by a competitor, Martin Marietta Corporation, for unfair trade practices. The personal injury coverage at issue, however, covered injuries arising out of libel and slander, but did not list unfair competition or unfair trade practices among the covered torts. Refusing to impose a duty to defend on the insurer, the court held that where coverage for libel or slander did not include coverage for unfair trade practices, it could not be extended to any tort simply because \u201ca claim may arise out of the same facts as the [covered offense], . . . Otherwise, the enumeration in the policy of covered offenses would be purposeless.\u201d Id. We agree with this reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest, on the other hand, rely on several cases to support their argument that the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs did not have to suffer direct injury in order to trigger a duty to defend. See <em>Izzo </em>v. <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co., </em>supra, 203 Conn. 305; see <em>also Burroughs Wellcome </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>632 F. Sup. 1213 (S.D.N.Y. 1986); <em>Charles F. Evans Co. </em>v. <em>Zurich Ins. Co., </em>95 N.Y.2d 779, 731 N.E.2d 1109, 710 N.Y.S.2d 301 (2000). As the trial court pointed out, these cases are easily distinguishable. In <em>Izzo, </em>the husband of a woman injured in an automobile accident sought coverage under a $300,000 \u201c \u2018per occurrence\u2019 \u201d limit of bodily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>injury coverage for loss of consortium, after his wife recovered $100,000 under the \u201c \u2018per person\u2019 \u201d limit of coverage. <em>Izzo </em>v. <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co., </em>supra, 308-309. Denying recovery for the husband, we concluded that it was the wife who could not perform the spousal functions who suffered the bodily injury, not the husband claiming a resultant loss of consortium. Id., 312. Even though we considered the loss of consortium a separate cause of action, we held that it was \u201cderivative and inextricably attached to the claim of the injured spouse.\u201d Id. The couple, therefore was limited to the \u201c \u2018per person\u2019 \u201d coverage. QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest claim that this language supports their argument that courts recognize policy coverage even in cases where the injury is suffered indirectly, as long as that indirect injury is derivative and inextricably connected to the direct injury. <em>Izzo, </em>however, dealt with bodily injury coverage, and followed the well settled principle that \u201cdamages for loss of consortium . . . are subject to \u2018per person\u2019 limitation.\u201d Id., 310, and cases cited therein. Furthermore, <em>Izzo </em>was dealing with the unique relationship between husband and wife. Its holding, therefore, is inapposite for purposes of our analysis in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The reliance by QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest on <em>Burroughs Wellcome </em>and <em>Charles F. Evans Co. </em>is similarly misplaced. In <em>Burroughs Wellcome </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>supra, 632 F. Sup. 1215, the court found a duty to defend derivative claims brought by the spouses and grandchildren of women who had taken DES, a harmful prenatal drug prescribed from the 1940s to the 1960s to prevent miscarriages. The issue in that case, however, was whether the injuries claimed by these individuals had become apparent or had manifested themselves before termination of coverage, not whether the injuries were proximately caused by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>claimants\u2019 exposure to DES.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Again, as the trial court pointed out, the analysis has no bearing on this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In <em>Charles F. Evans Co. </em>v. <em>Zurich Ins. Co., </em>supra, 95 N.Y.2d 779, the plaintiff was a construction subcontractor who installed skylights in the building of a local company. Because of faulty installation, the area around the skylights leaked, causing the floor underneath them to become wet and slippery. Employees of the company occupying the building suffered \u201cslip and fall\u201d injuries for which their employer brought an action. In that underlying action the employer alleged that, owing to the leaking roof, his employees \u201c \u2018slipped and fell in puddles . . . and were injured,\u2019 \u201d and his company was \u201c \u2018forced to incur expenses, in the form of lost-time and workers\u2019 compensation claims ....\u2019\u201d Id., 780. The Court of Appeals held that the defendant insurance company had a duty to defend the employer\u2019s underlying action because the bodily injuiy coverage in the plaintiffs policy covered \u201c \u2018those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d \u2019 id.; which the court found \u201cat least ambiguous\u201d with respect to whether the claims in the employer\u2019s action were covered. Id. Thus, although the plaintiff employer in the underlying action did not suffer direct bodily injury, the ambiguity in the policy was interpreted in favor of the insured. Unlike the policy in <em>Charles F. Evans </em>Co., the policies at issue in this case do not suffer from any ambiguities. The <em>Bishop </em>complaint simply does not allege damages suffered as the result of any covered offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The term \u201carising out of\u2019 requires that we look at the injuries sustained by the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs, rather than the underlying offenses that QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest claim caused those injuries. As stated previously, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs\u2019 injuries did not arise out of the covered offenses of defamation, disparagement, malicious prosecution or unfair competition, because the schools and youth groups making up the class of plaintiffs were not the parties injured by those offenses. The injuries alleged in the <em>Bishop </em>action were economic injuries that arose out of the monopolization of the magazine fund-raising market by QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest. We conclude that because there was no causal relationship between the <em>Bishop </em>plaintiffs\u2019 injuries and the torts that QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest claim caused those injuries, there is no duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">DUTY TO INDEMNIFY</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The final contention of QSP and Reader\u2019s Digest is that the trial court improperly concluded, as a result of the aforementioned determinations, that the defendants had no duty to indemnify the plaintiffs for the <em>Bishop </em>settlement. We disagree. As we previously have held, where there is no duty to defend, there is no duty to indemnify, given the fact that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. See <em>Heyman Associates No. 1 </em>v. <em>Ins. Co. of Pennsylavnia, </em>231 Conn. 756, 798, 653 A.2d 122 (1995); see also <em>Nationwide Ins. </em>v. <em>Zavalis, </em>52 F.3d 689, 693 (7th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-10\"> The appeal does not involve Travelers-Aetna Insurance Company, Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company, or TIG Insurance Company, which were all defendants in the underlying action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b366-6\"> Prior to the filing of the <em>Bishop </em>action, QSP\u2019s competitors in the school and youth group magazine fund-raising market filed in California Superior Court an action entitled <em>Burkett </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Assn., Inc., </em>San Diego County Superior Court, Docket No. 621222.

The distinction between malicious prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>tion or vexatious suit and abuse of process as tort actions is that in the former the wrongful act is the commencement of an action without legal justification, and in the latter it is in the subsequent proceedings, not in the issue of process but in its abuse.\u201d Id.; <em>Vandersluis </em>v. <em>Weil, </em>176 Conn. 353, 356, 407 A.2d 982 (1978).
