The defendant, Constance Andresen,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was convicted of five counts of selling unregistered securities in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 36b-16.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant concedes that the securi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>ties were not registered, but contends that there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>insufficient evidence presented by the state to prove that the securities were not exempt from registration.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the trial court improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>placed on her the burden of proving that the securities were exempt, and that, by shifting the burden of proving this exemption to her, the trial court deprived her of her constitutional right to due process under the federal and state constitutions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant also contends that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence a cease and desist order that had been issued against her by the state department of banking (department) in 1985, and improperly permitted testimony concerning that order. Finally, the defendant claims that her reasonable reliance on the advice of counsel precluded a conviction for selling unregistered securities. We dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>agree with the defendant and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The record contains the following relevant facts. In early 1972, John Andresen and two associates formed a research and development company called Microbyx Corporation (Microbyx), which they incorporated in Delaware. Microbyx developed a specialized tampon-like device for collecting cells from menstrual fluid that, potentially, could be utilized for the early detection of cervical and endometrial cancers. Microbyx had planned to market the device as an easier and more reliable means of obtaining cell samples for cancer screening than the Pap smear test. To date, Microbyx has never marketed the device, never turned a profit, and has no employees, other than two officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The defendant married John Andresen in 1976 and began serving as corporate secretaiy and chief financial officer of Microbyx in 1984. Although the defendant had not become involved officially with Microbyx in a managerial capacity until that time, she had engaged in activities relating to its financing in 1981. After joining Microbyx, the defendant devoted the bulk of her time to the company and she and her husband conducted almost all of the business from their home in New Canaan. Sarles Associates, Inc. (Sarles Associates), an investment management and advising company that the defendant\u2019s husband had formed and controlled, provided management services to Microbyx. Beginning in 1984, Microbyx paid Sarles Associates monthly fees ranging from $8000 to $15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">In 1983, after receiving a complaint from an investor who had purchased securities from the company, the department began investigating Microbyx. The department discovered that Microbyx securities were not registered in Connecticut and promptly issued to the defendant and her husband a cease and desist order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>prohibit further sales. The defendant and her husband requested a hearing on the cease and desist order, which was held on March 9, 1984. As a result of the hearing, the department issued findings of fact and conclusions of law, and ordered that the original cease and desist order enter permanently against the defendant and her husband.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">In 1987, Microbyx filed an application with the department to register its securities by coordination.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The department requested that Microbyx provide a list of all of those people who had invested in the company prior to 1987 and explain on which exemption from registration it had relied in selling those securities. Microbyx withdrew the application shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">In 1993, Microbyx filed another application with the department to register securities by qualification.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>department then issued subpoenas to Microbyx, the defendant and her husband. On April 13,1994, the defendant testified before the department regarding her possible sale of unregistered Microbyx securities between 1991 and 1993. After turning over to the department records of prior sales, Microbyx attempted to withdraw its second application. The department did not permit the withdrawal,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and instead initiated a further investigation that culminated in criminal charges against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">From 1990 to 1993, approximately ninety investors purchased securities from Microbyx, with the defendant or her husband listed on the stock certificates as the seller. At trial, several investors testified that the defendant and her husband had solicited their stock purchases and had represented to them that Microbyx had a patented, market-ready device approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration that would lead, to a public offering of Microbyx stock and returns on their investments. Many were novice investors, and some were given unpaid management positions with Microbyx after they had purchased the securities. The investors were not informed of the cease and desist order, nor were they informed that the device collected cell samples that were of little use in diagnosing cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Between 1990 and 1994, investors poured $1.3 million into Microbyx while the company spent only $35,000 on research and development for the cell collection device. More than $1 million was funneled to the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>dant and her husband either directly or indirectly through Sarles Associates.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The state charged the defendant in 1995 with five counts of securities fraud in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 36b-4 (2),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and five counts of selling unregistered securities in violation of \u00a7 36b-16.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A trial to the court began on August 3,1999, and continued through August 6, 1999. The trial court, <em>Hiller, J., </em>found the defendant guilty on the five counts of selling unregistered securities and acquitted her of all charges involving securities fraud. The defendant received a total sentence of ten years incarceration, suspended after two years, five years of probation and a fine of $10,000.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> From the judgment of conviction, the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Before addressing the defendant\u2019s claims, we note that state securities laws, or \u201cblue sky laws,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> are reme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>dial statutes. See <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Giacomi, </em>242 Conn. 17, 67, 699 A.2d 101 (1997); see also <em>Securities &amp; Exchange Commission </em>v. <em>C. M. Joiner Leasing Corp., </em>320 U.S. 344, 353, 64 S. Ct. 120, 88 L. Ed. 88 (1943) (noting that state securities laws have \u201cdominating purpose to prevent and punish fraudulent floating of securities\u201d); <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Giacomi, </em>233 Conn. 304, 320, 659 A.2d 1166 (1995) (noting that state securities laws contain antifraud provisions, require registration of brokers and sellers of securities and registration of securities themselves); <em>People v. Landes, </em>84 N.Y.2d 655, 660, 645 N.E.2d 716, 621 N.Y.S.2d 283 (1994) (\u201cpurpose of [New York securities] statute is remedial: to protect the public from fraudulent exploitation in the offering and sale of securities\u201d). \u201cIn 1977, the Connecticut legislature formally adopted the Uniform Securities Act (Uniform Act).\u201d <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Giacomi, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 319. Although this court has had occasion to address civil liability under the Uniform Act; see id.; and has interpreted the criminal portions of the prior Connecticut Securities Act; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Kreminski, </em>178 Conn. 145, 147-53, 422 A.2d 294 (1979); this case requires us to address, as a matter of first impression, the criminal provisions of CUSA that prohibit the sale of unregistered securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">The defendant contends that the state failed to provide sufficient evidence to support a conviction for selling unregistered securities under \u00a7 36b-16. The defendant claims that the evidence at trial \u201cclearly established that the transactions at issue were exempt from registration under the private placement exemption . . . .\u201d See General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 36b-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>21 (b) (9).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendant contends that this issue \u201cwas properly preserved for appeal by [a] motion to set aside the verdict made by the defendant at the close of evidence.\u201d Our review of the record shows that no such motion was filed. Moreover, the defendant has neither requested review of her claim as plain error; Practice Book \u00a7 60-5;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> nor has she sought review under <em>State </em>v. Golding, 213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989) (establishing requirements for appellate review of unpreserved claims). Consequently, we decline to review this claim because it was neither raised sufficiently at trial nor properly preserved for appeal.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number><em>Ghant </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>255 Conn. 1, 17, 761 A.2d 740 (2000) (inappropriate to engage in level of review not requested).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The primary issue in this appeal is whether the trial court properly placed the burden of proving an exemption from registration on the defendant. The defendant contends that, because the trial court shifted the burden to her to prove that the securities or transactions were exempt, she was denied her constitutional right to due process under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. See footnote 5 of this opinion. The defendant failed to object at trial and claims that this issue is reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40 (defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim will fail unless \u201c[1] the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; [2] the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; [3] the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and [4] if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">\u201cThe first two steps in the <em>Golding </em>analysis address the reviewability of the claim, while the last two steps involve the merits of the claim. <em>State </em>v. <em>Beltran, </em>246 Conn. 268, 275, 717 A.2d 168 (1998).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>253 Conn. 354, 359, 752 A.2d 40 (2000). In the absence of any one of the four <em>Golding </em>conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hafford, </em>252 Conn. 274, 305, 746 A.2d 150, cert. denied, 331 U.S. 855, 121 S. Ct. 136, 148 L. Ed. 2d 89 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>(2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 240. We agree with the defendant that the record of the trial court\u2019s decision to place on the defendant the burden of proving an exemption is adequate for review. Although the defendant did not object, if improper, the trial court\u2019s decision in this regard clearly implicates her constitutional right to a fair trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>239 Conn. 481, 512, 687 A.2d 489 (1996), cert. denied, 521 U.S. 1121, 117 S. Ct. 2515, 138 L. Ed. 2d 1017 (1997) (jury instruction that dilutes state\u2019s burden of proof or places burden on defendant to prove innocence is unconstitutional); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wolff, </em>237 Conn. 633, 669, 678 A.2d 1369 (1996) (due process requires for conviction proof beyond reasonable doubt of every fact necessary for crime charged). Indeed, the state does not dispute that the first two prongs have been met. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\u201c[I]f we are persuaded that the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim should be addressed, we will review it and arrive at a conclusion as to whether the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and whether it clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d Id., 241. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim does not satisfy the third condition under <em>Golding, </em>because she has failed to establish a constitutional violation that clearly deprived her of a fair trial. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\u201c \u2018[T]he Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which [she] is charged.\u2019 <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Valinski, </em>254 Conn. 107, 120, 756 A.2d 1250 (2000).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cIt is constitutionally permissible for the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>to place the burden on a criminal defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence elements which would constitute an affirmative defense but which do not serve to negate any essential element of the crime which the state has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict. <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>New York, </em>432 U.S. 197, 210, 97 S. Ct. 2319, 53 L. Ed. 2d 281 [(1977)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>181 Conn. 426, 430, 435 A.2d 967 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Valinski, </em>supra, 120-21. Thus, the question is whether proving an exemption is an affirmative defense or whether the nonexistence of an exemption from registration under \u00a7 36b-21 is a required element for a conviction of selling unregistered securities under \u00a7 36b-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The defendant contends that, to support a conviction under \u00a7 36b-16, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the security, in addition to being sold or offered, was not registered <em>and </em>was not exempt from registration. Specifically, the defendant claims that an exemption from registration is nowhere \u201cdeclare [d] ... to be an affirmative defense\u201d by the legislature, and that, in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 53a-12,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the state should have had the burden of disproving the exempt status of the securities or transactions beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">The state claims that the plain language of CUSA places on the defendant the burden of proving an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>exemption and that, because an exemption from registration is an affirmative defense, rather than an element of the crime of selling unregistered securities, the trial court properly placed the burden on the defendant to prove that the securities fell within an exemption. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Whether an exemption from registration is an affirmative defense to the crime of selling unregistered securities requires us to construe provisions of CUSA. \u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary. . . . [O]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Murray, 254 Conn. 472, 487-88, 757 A.2d 578 (2000). On the basis of these factors, we conclude that an exemption from registration under CUSA is an affirmative defense to the charge of selling unregistered securities under \u00a7 36b-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The language of CUSA is clear. General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 36b-21 (d) provides that \u201c[i]n any proceeding under sections 36b-2 to 36b-33, inclusive, the burden of proving an exemption or an exception from a definition is upon the person claiming it.\u201d The defendant does not dispute that the reference to \u201csections 36b-2 to 36b-33, <em>inclusive\u201d </em>includes \u00a7 36b-16, the statute that defines the prohibited conduct of which she was found guilty. (Emphasis added.) She claims, without citing any legal authority, that simply because \u00a7 36b-21 (d) is codified among the other provisions of CUSA, rather than in the Penal Code, it \u201capplies only to civil or administrative proceedings, not criminal trials.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>The defendant\u2019s reliance on General Statutes \u00a7 53a-2 is misplaced. That section applies generally to offenses defined in the Penal Code or offenses defined elsewhere in the General Statutes, \u201cunless otherwise expressly provided or unless the context otherwise requires . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Section 36b-21 (d) applies specifically to the provisions of CUSA and expressly provides that a party claiming an exemption or an exception from a definition shall have the burden of proof on that issue. \u201cAs a matter of statutory construction, specific statutory provisions are presumed to prevail over more general statutory provisions dealing with the same overall subject matter. <em>McKinley </em>v. <em>Musshorn, </em>185 Conn. 616, 623-24, 441 A.2d 600 (1981); <em>Edmundson </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>169 Conn. 630, 635, 363 A.2d 1031 (1975).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>206 Conn. 346, 359, 538 A.2d 185 (1988); see <em>Velez </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>250 Conn. 536, 550, 738 A.2d 604 (1999). Had the legislature intended the burden articulated in \u00a7 36b-21 (d) to apply <em>only </em>in civil matters, it certainly could have drawn that distinction in the text of the statute. See <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>235 Conn. 185, 195, 663 A.2d 1001 (1995) (\u201c[w]e will not impute to the legislature an intent that is not apparent from unambiguous statutory language in the absence of a compelling reason to do so\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In addition, the purpose of CUSA supports the conclusion that a defendant should bear, as an affirmative defense, the burden of proving that no registration was required for the offer or sale of the securities at issue. \u201c[T]he primary purpose behind [CUSA] was to institute comprehensive registration requirements and thereby improve surveillance of securities trading.\u201d <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Giacomi, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 320, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>citing Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Banks, Pt. 1, 1977 Sess., pp. 175-76, remarks of Banking Commissioner Lawrence Connell. Given this regulatory purpose, we conclude that, as a matter of policy, it would make little sense to construe the statute in a manner that would make it exceedingly difficult for the state to enforce the prohibition on the sale of unregistered securities in \u00a7 36b-16.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Moreover, because numerous, varied exemptions exist under General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 36b-21 (a)<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>and (b),<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u201c[o]nce the seller has determined that a security falls within a class of exempt securities, that knowledge is peculiarly within the personal knowledge of the seller.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Shott </em>v. <em>Tehan, </em>365 F.2d 191, 195 (6th Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 1012, 87 S. Ct. 716, 17 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1967). It is apparent that an exemption from registration is an affirmative defense to the charge of selling unregistered securities under \u00a7 36b-16. This conclusion comports with cases from other jurisdictions that maintain statutory provisions virtually identical to \u00a7 36b-16. See, e.g., id., 194-95; <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>State, </em>330 Ark. 198, 201-202, 952 S.W.2d 145 (1997); <em>People </em>v. <em>Morrow, </em>682 P.2d 1201, 1205 (Colo. App. 1983), cert. denied, 682 P.2d 1201 (Colo. 1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kershner, </em>801 P.2d 68, 70 (Kan. App. 1990); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Crooks, </em>84 Or. App. 440, 445-46, 734 P.2d 374 (1987).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Because an exemption is an affirmative defense to the crime of selling unregistered securities, the question devolves to whether requiring the defendant to bear the burden of proving the existence of an applicable exemption by a preponderance of the evidence passes constitutional muster. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Valinski, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 129-30. \u201cThe proper approach to resolving this question, as dictated by <em>Patterson </em>[v. <em>New York, </em>supra, 432 U.S. 210], is first to determine the elements of [the offense of selling unregistered securities], and second to determine whether the defense [that the securities were exempt from registration] necessarily negates any of those elements. <em>White </em>v. <em>Arn, </em>788 F.2d 338, 343-44, (6th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 917, 107 S. Ct. 1370, 94 L. Ed. 2d 686 (1987).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Valinski, </em>supra, 129-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">A conviction under \u00a7 36b~16 requires proof that the defendant (1) sold or offered a security in this state, and (2) that the security is not registered under \u00a7\u00a7 36b-2 through 36b-33, inclusive. If we were to agree with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>the defendant that the state must also prove, in addition to the aforementioned elements, that the securities at issue were not exempt under \u00a7 36b-21, the state would be required to prove the nonexistence of some thirty-six exemptions. See footnotes 3 and 21 of this opinion. Given the remedial purpose of the Uniform Act; see <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Giacomi, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 67; we cannot conclude that such a construction is warranted. See <em>Southington </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins.

Ed. 2d 467 (1982) (nonexistence of exemption from registration not element of offense of selling unregistered securities).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">It is equally clear that the availability of an exemption from registration does not negate any of the essential elements of the crime of selling unregistered securities. An unregistered security or transaction that qualifies for one of the statutory exemptions enumerated in \u00a7 36b-21, and may be offered or sold in Connecticut because of its exempt status, is still an unregistered security. The mere fact that an issuer may legally sell such a security does not transform an otherwise unregistered security into one that is registered under CUSA. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Frost, </em>57 Ohio St. 2d 121, 127, 387 N.E.2d 235 (1979) (not unconstitutional to require defendant to carry burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>proof on exemption under Ohio blue sky law \u201cbecause it does not require the defendant to negate any facts of the crime which the state must prove in order to convict\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Decisions from other jurisdictions addressing the crime of selling unregistered securities under the Uniform Act or similar provisions of state blue sky laws consistently have placed the burden on the defendant to prove an exemption. See, e.g., <em>United States ex rel. Shott </em>v. <em>Tehan, </em>supra, 365 F.2d 194; <em>State </em>v. <em>Goodman, </em>110 Ariz. 524, 526, 521 P.2d 611 (1974); <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 330 Ark. 201-202; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kershner, </em>supra, 801 P.2d 70; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>David, </em>365 Mass. 47, 53-54, 309 N.E.2d 484 (1974); <em>People </em>v. <em>Dempster, </em>396 Mich. 700, 713-14, 242 N.W.2d 381 (1976); <em>Fullerton </em>v. <em>State, </em>116 Nev. , 8 P.3d 848, 850 (2000); <em>State </em>v. <em>Goetz, </em>supra, 312 N.W.2d 9-10; <em>State </em>v. <em>Frost, </em>supra, 57 Ohio St. 2d 127; <em>State </em>v. <em>Shepherd, </em>989 P.2d 503, 509 (Utah App. 1999); cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Morrow, </em>supra, 682 P.2d 1207 (\u201c [o]nce the prosecution raised the issue of [the applicability of an exemption as an] affirmative defense, it assumed the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the affirmative defense was not applicable\u201d); accord <em>Securities &amp; Exchange Commission </em>v. <em>Ralston Purina Co., </em>346 U.S. 119, 126, 73 S.

The defendant contends that the cease and desist order \u201cwas neither relevant nor material\u201d and its admission \u201cprejudiced [her] by diverting attention from the actual issues in the case . . . [specifically] whether or not \u00a7 36b-16 [had been] violated.\u201d The defendant concedes that the evidence was admitted without objection, but seeks review under the plain error rule of Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. See footnote 15 of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">\u201cPlain error review is reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. . . . <em>Westport Taxi Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westport Transit District, </em>235 Conn. 1, 25, 664 A.2d 719 (1995).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 502. We detect no impropriety in the trial court\u2019s admission of the cease and desist order.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">\u201cRelevant evidence is evidence that has a logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of an issue. . . . [E]vidence need not exclude all other possibilities [to be relevant]; it is sufficient if it tends to support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>conclusion [for which it is offered], even to a slight degree. . . . [T]he fact that evidence is susceptible of different explanations or would support various inferences does not affect its admissibility, although it obviously bears upon its weight. So long as the evidence may reasonably be construed in such a manner that it would be relevant, it is admissible.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Copas, </em>252 Conn. 318, 326-27, 746 A.2d 761 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">In this case, the defendant was charged with five counts of selling unregistered securities in violation of \u00a7 36b-16, as well as five counts of securities fraud in violation of \u00a7 36b-4 (2). See footnote 10 of this opinion. Several witnesses testified that the defendant had not informed them of the existence of the department\u2019s cease and desist order in connection with their purchases of Microbyx securities. In addition, the 1993 prospectus submitted by Microbyx to the department in conjunction with its efforts to register its securities did not mention the cease and desist order, as did the 1987 submission. See footnote 9 of this opinion. Thus, evidence of the cease and desist order was both relevant and material to the question of whether the defendant had violated \u00a7 36b-4 (2). The defendant has offered no compelling argument that suggests that she was unduly prejudiced by its admission for that purpose. Likewise, she does not argue, nor could she persuasively, that her acquittal on the fraud charges rendered the evidence improper. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court\u2019s admission of the cease and desist order amounts to plain error is without merit.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Finally, the defendant argues that because she reasonably relied on the advice of legal counsel in selling unregistered Microbyx securities, her convictions under \u00a7 36b-16 cannot stand. The defendant contends that she lacked \u201cintent to violate the law\u201d because she acted reasonably in relying on the advice of her lawyers. The state argues that \u00a7 36b-16 requires no specific intent to violate the law, but that it is a \u201cstrict liability\u201d offense and that advice of counsel is \u201cnot a legitimate defense to the sale of unregistered securities . . . .\u201d At oral argument before this court, the defendant conceded that, if a violation of \u00a7 36b-16 is in the nature of strict liability, requiring no specific intent to violate the law, then her claim regarding reliance on the advice of counsel \u201cgoes out the window.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\u201cWhether or not a statutory crime requires mens rea or scienter as an element of the offense is largely a question of legislative intent to be determined from the general scope of the act and from the nature of the evils to be avoided.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Swain, </em>245 Conn. 442, 454, 718 A.2d 1 (1998). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Kreminski, </em>supra, 178 Conn. 145, this court reviewed a conviction under the Connecticut Securities Act, the predecessor to CUSA. In that case, the defendant argued that \u201cthe requirement of mens rea or evil intention should be effectively read into the statute.\u201d Id., 147. This court noted that \u201c[p]ersonal blame on the part of the actor, except in the general sense that he should have known better or exercised a greater degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>of care, is not a necessary element of many offenses where protection of the public against the harm which would result in the absence of regulation is the principal legislative concern.\u201d Id., 150. This court ultimately concluded that \u201c \u2018[s]tate of mind is of as little relevance in a charge of sale of an unregistered security by an unlicensed person . . . as it would be in a prosecution for a speeding violation.\u2019 \u201d Id., 151, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Terranova, </em>38 Colo. App. 476, 483, 563 P.2d 363 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">As noted previously, the criminal provisions of CUSA; General Statutes \u00a7 36b-28; prohibit \u201cwilful\u201d violations thereof. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kreminski, </em>supra, 178 Conn. 152 (noting that CUSA requires wilful violations); see also footnote 12 of this opinion. The issue in this case is whether \u201cwilfully\u201d as used in \u00a7 36b-28 requires that the defendant both wilfully engaged in prohibited conduct\u2014that, is, she wilfully sold unregistered securities\u2014 <em>and, </em>in so doing, maintained specific intent to violate the law. We conclude that wilfully violating provisions of the Uniform Act, and therefore CUSA, requires \u201cproof that the person acted intentionally in the sense that [she] was aware of what [she] was doing. Proof of evil motive or intent to violate the law, or knowledge that the law was being violated, is not required.\u201d L.

If [she] did so intend, [she] has the requisite general intent for culpability.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McClary, </em>207 Conn. 233, 240, 541 A.2d 96 (1988). \u201cIntent to do the prohibited act, not intent to violate the criminal law, is the only intent requisite for conviction in the case of many crimes constituting violations of statutes in the nature of police regulations.\u201d (Internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Swain, </em>supra, 245 Conn. 455. \u201c[Protection of the financial interest of the public may not be as paramount as safeguarding its health and morals by suppressing activities which endanger those interests, nevertheless, it is a matter of serious concern . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kreminski, </em>supra, 178 Conn. 151-52.

As explained previously, the cease and desist order was relevant to the fraud charges. To the extent that the defendant contends that ambiguity in the record requires reversal of her conviction under \u00a7 36b-16, we note that she was required to provide, in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 CO-5, an adequate record for review. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>See Practice Book \u00a7 61-10 (\u201c[i]t is the responsibility of the appellant to provide an adequate record for review\u201d); <em>Willow Springs Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Seventh BRT Development Corp., </em>245 Conn. 1, 38, 717 A.2d 77 (1998) (\u201c[i]t is the responsibility of the appellant ... to move for an articulation in order to clarify the basis of the trial court\u2019s decisions should such clarification be necessary for effective appellate review of the issue on appeal\u201d [citation omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b359-8\"> We note that the official comment to \u00a7 409 of the Uniform Act, the criminal provision requiring wilful violations, refers to the official comment under \u00a7 204 (a) (2) (B) for the meaning of the word wilfully. L.

Our research has revealed only one such case. See <em>Hentzner </em>v. <em>State, </em>613 P.2d 821, 825-27 (Alaska 1980) (consciousness of wrongdoing required as separate element for conviction of selling unregistered securities; requires more than awareness of act but less than knowledge of illegality). At least one recent case characterized the <em>Hentzner </em>decision as \u201can aberration.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dumke, </em>supra, 901 S.W.2d 104; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Mueller, </em>201 Wis. 2d 121, 134-35 n.3, 549 N.W.2d 455 (App. 1996) (noting apparent divergence of authority and no need to \u201center the debate\u201d concerning mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>state required for sale of unregistered securities). In our view, <em>Hentzner </em>is a solitary departure from otherwise uniform authority, and we decline to follow it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b362-9\"> We assume for purposes of this appeal that the reasonable, good faith reliance on the advice of counsel, like intoxication, could, in some circumstances, negate specific intent and thereby negate a required element of the crime charged. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>244 Conn. 226, 239, 710 A.2d 732 (1998) (noting that \u201c \u2018evidence of a defendant\u2019s intoxication is relevant to negate specific intent which is an essential element of the crime of murder\u2019 \u201d). Because a conviction under \u00a7 36b-16 requires only general intent, the defendant\u2019s argument must fail. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>210 Conn. 132, 138, 554 A.2d 713 (1989) (noting that intoxication \u201cis generally held to be relevant to negate a crime of specific intent but not a crime of general intent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">We emphasize that this court has never applied the advice of counsel \u201cdefense\u201d in such a manner, and we express no opinion on the viability of such a claim in other circumstances. See <em>Lurie </em>v. <em>Wittner, </em>228 F.3d 113, 134 (2d Cir. 2000) (noting that \u201c[t]here is no [United States] Supreme Court precedent requiring that an advice-of-counsel defense be allowed in state court; indeed, the situations in which the advice-of-counsel defense may be employed are severely limited\u201d); but see <em>Ratzlaf v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 135, 142 n.10, 114 S. Ct. 655, 126 L.
