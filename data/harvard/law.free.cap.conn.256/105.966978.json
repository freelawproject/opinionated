On May 13, 1998, the town adopted the ordinance prohibiting cigarette vending machines within its borders.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>ticular, the ordinance provides that \u201c[n]o person shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>dispense or cause to be dispense[d] cigarettes, tobacco <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>or smokeless tobacco products from vending machines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>at any location within the Town . . . The ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>contains a number of factual determinations that were reported, essentially, as legislative findings. Specifically, the ordinance reported that local school officials had noticed a significant rise in teenage smoking, and further recounted that \u201c[c]urrent laws and regulations have proved ineffective and inadequate in preventing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>the illegal purchase of cigarettes by children under the age of [eighteen] years, particularly from cigarette vending machines . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Prior to the adoption of the ordinance, the plaintiff, Modem Cigarette, Inc., a duly licensed distributor of tobacco products as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 12-285 (4),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which owns and operates approximately 100 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>cigarette vending machines statewide, had been operating one cigarette vending machine within the town. Following the adoption of the ordinance, the plaintiff removed the vending machine from service and brought this action against the town and its selectpersons, seeking, inter alia, a declaration that the town\u2019s ordinance was invalid, and an injunction prohibiting the town from enforcing it. The plaintiff claimed that the ordinance was invalid because it: (1) was preempted by state law; (2) constituted a taking without just compensation; and (3) violated the plaintiffs substantive due process rights. The plaintiff also claimed that the state\u2019s delegation of power to municipalities to ban cigarette vending machines was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court, <em>Pittman, J., </em>granted a motion to intervene by the state.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>In addition to the parties\u2019 written stipulation regarding most of the factual issues in the case,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the trial court found the following facts based on \u201ccertain additional and largely uncontroverted evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court determined that both the state and the town have a legitimate interest in promoting the health, safety and welfare of its citizens through the regulation of tobacco products and in preventing youth access to cigarettes. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53-344 and 53-344a.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Despite these statutes prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to minors, the trial court noted that Connecticut youth, including minors in the town, had experienced \u201clittle difficulty in making illegal purchases of tobacco products from [cigarette vending] machines.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>In reaching this conclusion, the court recognized a 1988 survey commissioned by the state department of mental health and addiction services, which, the court said, \u201cdemonstrated that minors were successful in their efforts to purchase cigarettes from a vending machine in six out of every ten attempts.\u201d Indeed, the survey indicated that \u201ca minor is twice as likely to be able to purchase cigarettes from a vending machine as from a convenience store or other over-the-counter outlet.\u201d According to the survey, minors \u201chave even succeeded in illegally purchasing cigarettes from restricted vending machines, which are designed to prevent the sale of tobacco to minors by requiring a face-to-face transaction with the operator of the machine.\u201d The trial court noted the fact that cigarette vending machines are essentially age-blind and, therefore, remain a significant source of tobacco products for minors, despite the existence of state laws prohibiting or limiting their placement in areas accessible to minors. Indeed, the court noted, \u201c[t]he ordinance in question was a product of the [town\u2019s] concern, based, inter alia, on the data previously mentioned, that teenage smoking is a public health hazard and that vending machines are a prime source of cigarettes for those youths who wish to smoke them.\u201d The trial court acknowledged that the town\u2019s purpose of preventing youth access to tobacco was well served by the ordinance, which was both rationally and reasonably related to that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Despite its findings regarding youth access to cigarettes, the trial court concluded that \u00a7 12-289a (h) preempts the ordinance, and therefore, the court declared the ordinance invalid. Thereafter, the plaintiff withdrew its claims for damages, and, accordingly, the trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiff. The defendants appealed to the Appellate Court and, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-2 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c), we transferred the appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Before we determine the merits of the plaintiffs claims, we begin with a discussion of certain controlling legal principles. First, it is undisputed that \u201c[t]he challenged ordinance is an exercise of the police power conferred upon the town by statute. There is no doubt that the town has a right to regulate a business, pursuant to its police power, in the interest of protecting the public safety or the welfare of its inhabitants. . . . Any such regulation, however, must be reasonably calculated to achieve that purpose; it must have a rational relationship to its objective. . . . The State may regulate any business or the use of any property in the interest of the public welfare or the public convenience, provided it is done reasonably. . . . The limit of the exercise of the police power is necessarily flexible, because it has to be considered in the light of the times and the prevailing conditions. . . . Whether the times and conditions require legislative regulation, as well as the degree of that regulation, is exclusively a matter for the judgment of the legislative body .... Courts can interfere only in those extreme cases where the action taken is unreasonable, discriminatory or arbitrary. . . . Every intendment is to be made in favor of the validity of [an] ordinance and it is the duty of the court to sustain the ordinance unless its invalidity is established beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . [T]he court presumes validity and sustains the legislation unless it clearly violates constitutional principles. . . . If there is a reasonable ground for upholding it, courts assume that the legislative body intended to place it upon that ground and was not motivated by some improper purpose. . . . This is especially true where the apparent intent of the enactment is to serve some phase of the public welfare.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Blue Sky Bar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>203 Conn. 14, 22-23, 523 A.2d 467 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Second, in determining whether a local ordinance is preempted by a state statute, we must consider whether the legislature has demonstrated an intent to occupy the entire field of regulation on the matter or whether the local ordinance irreconcilably conflicts with the statute. In this case, we examine the statute to assess whether there is a conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u201cWhether an ordinance conflicts with a statute or statutes can only be determined by reviewing the policy and purposes behind the statute and measuring the degree to which the ordinance frustrates the achievement of the state\u2019s objectives. . . . <em>Helicopter Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>201 Conn. 700, 705, 519 A.2d 49 (1986); <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>193 Conn. 506, 517, 479 A.2d 208 (1984); <em>Dwyer </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em>193 Conn. 7, 12-14, 475 A.2d 257 (1984).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Waste Management of Connecticut, Inc., </em>234 Conn. 221, 232, 662 A.2d 1179 (1995). Therefore, \u201c[t]hat a matter is of concurrent state and local concern is no impediment to the exercise of authority by a municipality through the enactment of an ordinance, so long as there is no conflict with the state legislation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>143 Conn. 698, 706, 125 A.2d 477 (1956); <em>City of Junction City </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>216 Kan. 495, 498-99, 532 P.2d 1292 (1975). Where the state legislature has delegated to local government the right to deal with a particular field of regulation, the fact that a statute also regulates the same subject in less than full fashion does not, ipso facto, deprive the local government of the power to act in a more comprehensive, but not inconsistent, manner. See <em>Connecticut Theatrical Corporation </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>147 Conn. 546, 553, 163 A.2d 548 (1960); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>supra, 706; see also <em>Page v. Welfare Commissioner, </em>[170 Conn. 258, 266, 365 A.2d 1118 (1976)].\u201d <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>183 Conn. 532, 543, 441 A.2d 30 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Therefore, merely because a local ordinance, enacted pursuant to the municipality\u2019s police power, provides higher standards than a statute on the same subject does not render it necessarily inconsistent with the state law. Whether a conflict exists depends on whether the ordinance permits or licenses that which the statute forbids, or prohibits that which the statute authorizes. \u201cIf, however, both the statute and the ordinance are prohibitory and the only difference is that the ordinance goes further in its prohibition than the statute, but not counter to the prohibition in the statute, and the ordinance does not attempt to authorize that which the legislature has forbidden, or forbid that which the legislature has expressly authorized, there is no conflict. . . . Where a municipal ordinance merely enlarges on the provisions of a statute by requiring more than a statute, there is no conflict unless the legislature has limited the requirements for all cases.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Finally, our resolution of this case is guided by our statutory construction jurisprudence. \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of this case .... In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . <em>Luce </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>247 Conn. 126, 133, 717 A.2d 747 (1998). In construing a statute, common sense must be used and courts must assume that a reasonable and rational result was intended. <em>Kron </em>v. <em>Thelen, </em>178 Conn. 189, 192, 423 A.2d 857 (1979); accord <em>Willow Springs Condominium </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Assn., <em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Seventh BRT Development Corp., </em>245 Conn. 1, 26, 717 A.2d 77 (1998). Finally, because the question presented [in] this appeal involves an issue of statutory construction, our review is plenary. E.g., <em>Coley </em>v. <em>Camden Associates, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 311, 318, 702 A.2d 1180 (1997).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schreck </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>250 Conn. 592, 596-97, 737 A.2d 916 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Against this background of controlling legal principles, we must determine whether the town ordinance conflicts with, or is in conformity with \u00a7 12-289a (h). In answering this question, it is important to note that this case does <em>not </em>involve the <em>total </em>prohibition of the sale of cigarettes. Indeed, the availability of tobacco products in the town, to people who are legally permitted to purchase them, remains unabated.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The sole purpose of this ordinance is to prevent <em>minors, </em>those persons who are <em>not </em>legally permitted to use tobacco products, from obtaining them via vending machines. The only effect of the ordinance is to eliminate <em>vending machines </em>as a source of tobacco products to minors. Indeed, as the trial court recognized, minors have been successful in using these machines, despite the legislative restrictions on their placement. As the record amply demonstrates, even when the use of cigarette vending machines requires the purchase of tokens from an adult, and even when the machines are located in areas within the line of sight of adults, minors nevertheless manage to use them to purchase tobacco products.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">It requires little analysis to conclude that local regulation in the area of public health was not only anticipated, but expressly authorized by the legislature. See General Statutes \u00a7 7-148 (c) (7) (H) (xi) (towns granted broad police powers to \u201c[pjrovide for the health of the inhabitants of the municipality and do all things necessary or desirable to secure and promote the public health\u201d). This broad statutory mandate authorizing regulations at both the state and local levels, in conjunction with specific legislative findings and declarations of policy, serves as the setting in which we evaluate the claims of the parties. \u201cIn doing so, we are mindful that the statutory scheme of this legislation envisages its adaptation to infinitely variable conditions for the effectuation of the purposes of these statutes.\u201d <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 183 Conn. 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">We begin with the specific legislation that the trial court was called upon to consider. Section 12-289a reflects, in general, the legislature\u2019s concern that tobacco products are being used by minors, and in particular, its intent to eliminate cigarette vending machines as a source of tobacco products for minors. The statute provides in relevant part: \u201cNo cigarette vending machine or restricted cigarette vending machine may be placed in an area, facility or business which is frequented primarily by minors. No cigarettes may be dispensed from any machine other than a cigarette vending machine or a restricted cigarette vending machine.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-289a (a). It further provides: \u201cA cigarette vending machine may be placed only in (1) an area, facility or business which is accessible only to adults or (2) an area, facility or business permitted under chapter 545 if the area, facility or business has a separate area accessible only to adults and the machine is placed in such area.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-289a (b). Violation of these restrictions is punishable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>by the imposition of fines and, upon a third violation, the removal of the machines. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-289a (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Examination of the legislative history confirms that the primary purpose of \u00a7 12-289a was to prevent youth access to cigarettes that otherwise had been made available by vending machines. Proponents of this statute recognized that more than 80 percent of all nicotine addicts became addicted before turning eighteen years of age, 25 percent of those smokers started at age twelve, while another 25 percent began smoking by the age of thirteen or fourteen.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Despite the fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>purchase of tobacco products by minors was illegal, this target audience had been able, nevertheless, to gain access to such products. Indeed, it was readily apparent to our lawmakers that minors were purchasing tobacco products through means that did not require adult involvement. Vending machines were at least partly responsible. As the trial court remarked: \u201c[Restrictions [on the use of vending machines] have been systematically increased over the years in ways that reflect the state\u2019s legitimate concern that such machines are an important source of tobacco products illegally obtained by minors.\u201d Therefore, if the government were to address the issue comprehensively, it had to control access by minors to the easiest source available\u2014the vending machine. Section 12-289a directly addresses that concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The provision of the statute upon which the trial court in the present case relied to decide that the town\u2019s ordinance was preempted provides: \u201cNothing in this section shall be construed as limiting a town or municipality from imposing more restrictive conditions on the use of vending machines for the sale of cigarettes. A municipality shall be responsible for the enforcement of such conditions.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 12-289a (h). According to the trial court, because \u00a7 12-289a (h) refers to the imposition of \u201cmore restrictive conditions on the use of vending machines,\u201d and does not use the word \u201cprohibit,\u201d it did not believe that the legislature had given municipalities the power to impose an outright ban on cigarette vending machines. Accordingly, the trial court concluded that, by banning cigarette vending machines, the ordinance prohibits that which the statute authorizes, and therefore the ordinance was \u201c \u2018irreconcilably inconsistent\u2019 \u201d with state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The defendants argue that the trial court\u2019s reasoning was flawed in that it viewed \u00a7 12-289a (h), not as an indication that municipalities are free to impose even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>greater regulatory control over cigarette vending machines than that already imposed by the state, but rather, as the sole statutory delegation of power for a municipality to regulate, but not prohibit outright, cigarette vending machines. We agree with the defendants that the town\u2019s power to adopt an ordinance regarding cigarette vending machines is not derived exclusively from \u00a7 12-289a (h), but, rather, emanates from the general police powers of municipalities to \u201c[p]rovide for the health of the inhabitants of the municipality and do all things necessary or desirable to secure and promote the public health . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-148 (c) (7) (H) (xi). Therefore, as the defendants maintain, in the absence of a clear legislative directive in \u00a7 12-289a (h), \u201cit simply cannot be said that the ordinance, as a valid exercise of the [t] own\u2019s police power, irreconcilably conflicts with a statute that ensures that a municipality retains its power to enact provisions ensuring the health, safety and welfare of its inhabitants.\u201d We therefore conclude that the legislature intended to preserve municipal authority to enact health, safety and welfare ordinances that preserve and promote the well-being of the municipality\u2019s inhabitants, and that, by enacting \u00a7 12-289a (h), the legislature intended to ensure that municipalities remained free to decide if local conditions warranted additional regulation of the machines, up to and including an outright ban. Thus, rather than preempt municipal authority to regulate cigarette vending machines by adopting, at the state level, placement restrictions on cigarette vending machines, the legislature left the municipal police authority intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">We have no quarrel with the plaintiffs contention that when a local ordinance irreconcilably conflicts with a state statute, the local regulation is preempted. The plaintiff suggests that a conflict exists because \u00a7 12-289a (h) allows municipalities \u201cto impose more restric<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>tive conditions on the use of vending machines for the sale of cigarettes\u201d but not to prohibit them. Thus, the core of the plaintiffs argument is that the power to regulate does not include the power to prohibit. The plaintiff views \u00a7 12-289a (h) as \u201ca hull, so to speak, [within which] to allow municipal regulation to take place.\u201d Specifically, the plaintiff interprets \u00a7 12-289a (h) as allowing towns to regulate only the <em>placement </em>of the machines, not the time during which they may be used. It argues that the phrase \u201cmore restrictive conditions on the use\u201d implies that cigarette vending machines will continue to be used, and is therefore evidence that the legislature did not contemplate that a municipality could impose a total ban on the machines. The plaintiffs view of the term \u201crestrict,\u201d however, fails to provide a workable interpretation of the statute, and raises essentially the same claim that this court expressly rejected in <em>Beacon Falls </em>v. <em>Posick, </em>212 Conn. 570, 563 A.2d 285 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">In <em>Beacon Falls, </em>the court considered whether a local ordinance that prohibited the use of real property as a landfill was invalid when the property owner had received a permit from the state department of environmental protection to open a landfill within the town. Id., 583; see General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 22a-208 (c). The property owner claimed that the term \u201cregulate\u201d in the statute necessarily barred the municipality from imposing a prohibition, relying on this court\u2019s language in <em>Blue Sky Bar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 20, that that term \u201cnecessarily implfied] . . . the continued existence of that which [was] regulated.\u201d In affirming the validity of the prohibition, the court in <em>Beacon Falls </em>addressed the question that had been left open in <em>Blue Sky Bar, Inc., </em>specifically, under what circumstances a complete prohibition of an activity that the state regulates but has not banned is permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>The court explained in <em>Beacon Falls </em>that, although it had stated previously in <em>Blue Sky Bar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 20, that \u201c \u2018the power to regulate . . . does not <em>necessarily </em>imply the power to prohibit absolutely any business or trade,\u2019 \u201d it did not conclude therein that the power to prohibit the activity was precluded. (Emphasis in original.) <em>Beacon Falls </em>v. <em>Posick, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 582. In <em>Blue Sky Bar, Inc., </em>the court had recognized that every regulation could result in prohibition, stating that the power to regulate entails a certain degree of prohibition. <em>Blue Sky Bar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>supra, 20. Indeed, \u201cit requires no citation of authority to say that regulation may in many instances result in prohibition.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. In <em>Beacon Falls </em>v. <em>Posick, </em>supra, 584, however, the court explained that, when the authority to impose restrictions, at least in part, stems from a municipality\u2019s police power, such ordinances must foster the public health, safety and general welfare of the community. \u201cTherefore, when a statute authorizes a municipality to regulate a certain activity, a prohibition of that activity will be valid if it is rationally related to the protection of the community\u2019s public health, safety and general welfare.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The ordinance at issue in this case clearly meets this standard. As the plaintiff acknowledged in the stipulation of facts submitted to the trial court, \u201c[t]he [t]own . . . has a legitimate interest in promoting the health, safety and welfare of its citizens through the regulation of tobacco products. [In addition] [t]he [tjown . . . has a legitimate and significant interest in preventing youth access to tobacco products.\u201d As the trial court recognized, the minors of the town \u201chave had little difficulty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>in making illegal purchases of tobacco products from [cigarette vending] machines. [Indeed, a] 1988 survey commissioned by the state department of mental health and addiction services . . . demonstrated that minors were successful in their efforts to purchase cigarettes from a vending machine in six out of every ten attempts. ... [It also showed that] minors have even succeeded in illegally purchasing cigarettes from restricted vending machines, which are designed to prevent the sale of tobacco to minors by requiring a face-to-face transaction with the operator of the machine. A minor is twice as likely to be able to purchase cigarettes from a vending machine as from a convenience store or other over-the-counter outlet.\u201d The director of planning for the department of mental health and addiction services testified in the present case that, based on a survey of 15,000 schoolchildren, approximately 36 percent of junior high school students who regularly smoke and 32 percent of high school students who regularly smoke \u201csometimes or often\u201d purchase their cigarettes from vending machines. He also noted that minors were even able to purchase cigarettes successfully from the so-called \u201crestricted vending machines\u201d 43 percent of the time. Based on the evidence, the trial court recognized that cigarette vending machines are essentially age-blind and, therefore, remain a significant source of tobacco products for minors despite the existence of state laws prohibiting or limiting their placement in areas accessible to minors. Accordingly, the trial court concluded that \u201c[t]he ordinance in question was a product of the [town\u2019s] concern, based, inter alia, on the data previously mentioned, that teenage smoking is a public health hazard and that vending machines are a prime source of cigarettes for those youths who wish to smoke them.\u201d Given the uncontroverted evidence in this case, the plaintiff does not seriously dispute that the town\u2019s ordinance is not rationally related to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>protection of its citizens\u2019 health, safety and welfare. Therefore, the ordinance and the statute are not in conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The plaintiff also argues that the ordinance is invalid because it removes a right bestowed on it by the cigarette distributor\u2019s license conferred by General Statutes \u00a7 12-288.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The plaintiffs reliance on the state\u2019s licensing provisions, however, is misplaced. The regulatory scheme at issue in this case is prohibitory. In the absence of chapter 214 of the General Statutes, in general, and \u00a7 12-288, in particular, the plaintiff could distribute tobacco products without any regulatory controls or state interference. The statutoiy provisions in chapter 214 do not expressly authorize vending machines, but, rather, they impose a series of limitations or prohibitions on the use of cigarette vending machines.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Except for the limitations set forth in \u00a7 12-289a; see footnote 1 of this opinion; vending machines may otherwise exist and subsection (h) of \u00a7 12-289a is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>merely part of a prohibitory statute that enables municipalities to go further, including outright prohibition. As we have stated previously, this is not the first time that this court has rejected a challenge to an ordinance based upon a claim that it irreconcilably conflicted with a permit or license issued by a state agency. See, e.g., <em>Beacon Falls </em>v. <em>Posick, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 572; see also <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Waste Management of Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra, 234 Conn. 221 (rejecting claim that permit issued by department of environmental protection to construct landfill with maximum height of 190 feet preempted local ordinance limiting maximum height to ninety feet). \u201c[The] test frequently used to determine whether a conflict exists is whether the ordinance permits or licenses that which the statute forbids, or prohibits that which the statute authorizes; if so, there is a conflict. If, however, both the statute and the ordinance are prohibitory and the only difference is that the ordinance goes further in its prohibition than the statute, but not counter to the prohibition in the statute, and the ordinance does not attempt to authorize that which the legislature has forbidden, or forbid that which the legislature has expressly authorized, there is no conflict.\u201d <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 183 Conn. 544. The town ordinance in this case merely goes further than the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">We recognize that the state has a significant interest in monitoring youth access to tobacco, as it should. Simply because the legislature has chosen to legislate on the subject does not mean, however, that the municipalities are without the power to regulate activities with local effects. If that were the case, municipalities would have been powerless to pass many of the ordinances that this court has approved already.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The issue of youth access to tobacco also is very much a local matter. \u201cWhile restrictions upon minors of access to cigarettes can be the subject of uniform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>state-wide regulation, sale of cigarettes to minors within the borders of a municipality is also a matter of municipal concern that can readily be regulated on a local basis.\u201d <em>C.I.C. Corp. </em>v. <em>East Brunswick Township, </em>266 N.J. Super. 1, 12, 628 A.2d 753 (App. Div. 1993) (state statutory scheme not intended to strip municipalities of police power regarding youth access despite fact that state law regulated, through licensing, distribution of tobacco products through cigarette vending machines). Evidence that the legislature has recognized this concern is found in \u00a7 12-289a (h), which ensures that municipalities are free to exercise their traditional police powers and impose additional prohibitions if appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Once again, simply because a matter is of concurrent state and local concern does not mean that a municipality is prohibited from legislating on the subject. \u201cWhere the state legislature has delegated to local government the right to deal with a particular field of regulation, the fact that a statute also regulates the same subject in less than full fashion does not, ipso facto, deprive the local government of the power to act in a more comprehensive, but not inconsistent, manner.\u201d <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 183 Conn. 543. Because the ordinance does not frustrate the state\u2019s objective in limiting youth access to tobacco products, and indeed, is fully consistent with that purpose, it is valid.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Finally, we note that if the legislature had wanted to preempt the town from enacting such an ordinance, it could have done so. In General Statutes \u00a7 19a-342 (f), we see an example of the legislature doing just that (\u201c[t]he provisions of this section shall supersede and preempt the provisions of any municipal law or ordinance relative to smoking effective prior to, on or after October 1, 1993\u201d). In the absence of a clear expression of intent to preclude local action, we conclude that the ordinance and the statute can coexist peacefully.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">In this opinion BORDEN, NORCOTT, PALMER and VERTEFEUILLE, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b127-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-289a provides: \u201cVending machines: Placement restrictions.

The plaintiff, therefore, is not forbidden absolutely from selling its products. Rather, the effect of the ordinance is to eliminate one method by which the plaintiff may sell its products. Although the ordinance limits the plaintiff in the manner of merchandising its product, there is nothing in the ordinance that forbids the plaintiff from selling its products directly through adult vendors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b143-6\"> The following excerpts are examples of the discussion in 1992 by legislators in favor of \u00a7 12-289a and its 1996 amendment that best demonstrate the legislature\u2019s intent to eliminate the sale of tobacco products to minors:</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for nicotine addicts to need a fix every 20 minutes. Nicotine is such an addicting drug that once addicted it becomes a lifetime addiction. An interesting thing about nicotine, however, is that <em>over 80% of all of the nicotine addicts in our society become addicted before the age of 18.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">\u201cYet we live in a society where it is illegal to buy tobacco products before the age of 18. If we can prevent those youngsters under the age of 18 from ever smoking, we can in fact prevent, eliminate most of the use of tobacco in our society. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">\u201cThe fact of the matter is that in our society anyone tall enough to put quarters in the machine can buy cigarettes. If we are serious about wanting to reduce the tragic: toll that results from the addiction to nicotine and the use of tobacco product in our society we have to start by controlling access by youngsters.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">\u201cTherefore, I think it is absolutely essential that we control the use of vending machines in our society. I\u2019m not unique in 1hat thought. Other states are examining this, other municipalities are doing this and in addition, the Surgeon General of the United States is also supportive of either the elimination of vending machines or the control so that they would only be placed in positions or locations where youngsters would not have access to them.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Public: Health, Pt. 2, 1992 Sess., pp. 309-10, remarks of Representative Robert Farr.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">Similarly, in 1996, Representative Pamela Z. Sawyer testified: \u201cI think one of the most horrifying facts is that 25% of the smokers start at age 12. 25% staxl ed by the age of 13 or 14. And what was shown was that these children, these youngest children, had the easiest access through vending machines, which is one of the reasons that this particular area was targeted.\u201d 39 H.R. Proc., Pt. 17, 1996 Sess., p. 6055.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b147-6\"> We note that \u00a7 12-289a (h) uses the term \u201crest rictive,\u201d while the operative term in <em>Beacon Falls </em>v. <em>Posick, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 583, was \u201cregulate.\u201d The terms, however, are susceptible to the same analysis. Every restriction, like every regulation, speaks as a prohibition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b149-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-288 provides: \u201cDistributor\u2019s license. Each person engaging in, or intending to engage in, the business of selling cigarettes in this state as a distributor shall secure a license from the Commissioner of Revenue Services before engaging or continuing to engage in such business. Subject to the provisions of section 12-286, such license shall be renewable annually. The annual fee for a distributor\u2019s license shall be one thousand dollars, provided in the case of a distributor who sells cigarettes as a distributor exclusively to retail stores which such distributor is operating, the fee for such distributor\u2019s license shall be: (1) Two hundred fifty dollars annually if such distributor operates less than fifteen such retail stores; (2) five hundred dollars annually if such distributor operates fifteen or more but less than twenty-five such retail stores; and (3) one thousand dollars annually if such distributor operates twenty-five or more such retail stores. Such license shall be valid for a period beginning with the date of license to the thirtieth day of September next succeeding the date of license unless sooner revoked by the commissioner as provided in section 12-295 or unless the person to whom such license was issued discontinues business, in either of which cases the holder of the license shall immediately return it to the Commissioner of Revenue Services.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b149-7\"> Indeed, the state retains the exclusive power to license cigarette vending machines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b151-6\"> To the extent that the plaintiff suggests that the ordinance frustrates a legislative purpose of the statute in protecting the vending machine industry, we see no authority for that claim. Merely because the state stopped short of imposing a ban on cigarette vending machines does not translate into an intent by the legislature to preserve the vending machine industry. Cerl ainly, if that had been the intent, we would be hard pressed to understand why the legislature would have adopted subsection (h) of \u00a7 12-289a preserving municipal authority to regulate cigarette vending machines. Nor can it be argued legitimately that the ordinance frustrates the state\u2019s statutory scheme with respect to taxation. Anyone who purchased cigarettes from vending machines could simply buy them elsewhere and pay state taxes on that transaction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b152-7\">MCDONALD, C. J., with whom SULLIVAN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AFI\">joins, dissenting. While I wholeheartedly agree that control of access to addictive tobacco products by young people is entirely desirable, I cannot find in General Statutes \u00a7 12-289a authority for towns to prohibit all sales of tobacco products by cigarette vending machines. The statute, while delegating to the towns authority to regulate cigarette vending machines, simply fails to give the towns authority to forbid their use entirely.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">In <em>Blue Sky Bar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>203 Conn. 14, 20, 523 A.2d 467 (1987), we observed that the power to regulate an activity given to a town by a state statute does not necessarily imply the power to prohibit an activity absolutely. This is because \u201cregulating\u201d an activity implies that it is allowed to exist. We said: \u201cIt is fair to say that the power to regulate, however, does not necessarily imply the power to prohibit absolutely any business or trade, as the very essence of regulation, which infers limitations, is the continued existence of that which is regulated.\u201d Id. In <em>Blue Sky Bar, Inc., </em>we found that there was no prohibition of street sales of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>ice cream products since only sales from motor vehicles were prohibited by Stratford. Id., 21. We concluded that Stratford did not prohibit all street sales but merely regulated the manner in which they were done. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The plain words of \u00a7 12-289a, allowing for more restrictive conditions on the use of cigarette machines, assume the continued existence of that which is to be regulated; id., 14; or, as the majority recognizes, to be restricted. See footnote 10 of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">This case is distinguishable from <em>Blue Sky Bar, Inc., </em>because the activity being regulated by \u00a7 12-289a is not all sales of cigarettes but sales by use of cigarette vending machines. Orange\u2019s ordinance, therefore, does entirely prohibit cigarette machine sales, an activity directly regulated by the state under General Statutes \u00a7 12-289.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, I would conclude that <em>Blue Sky Bar, Inc., </em>rather than supporting the majority\u2019s position, supports the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">I would also conclude that nothing in <em>Beacon Falls </em>v. <em>Posick, </em>212 Conn. 570, 563 A.2d 285 (1989), supports the majority. <em>In Beacon Falls, </em>we found that local zoning ordinances were not preempted by a state statute. Id., 586. We said: \u201cBecause the statutory terms are clear, we must assume that the legislature intended only to preempt local zoning authority to the extent that it conflicted with the operation of a CRRA [Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority] facility on property owned by the CRRA prior to May 11, 1984, and we cannot construe the act otherwise. . . . Accordingly, by its terms, [the act] cannot be construed to have preempted all local zoning with regard to the location of solid waste disposal areas.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 579. <em>Beacon Falls </em>is not relevant to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>The majority\u2019s reliance on the town\u2019s general authority to exercise police powers for public health would, if taken to the extreme, authorize towns to prohibit any activity regulated and authorized by state statute. This would be in contradiction to the state\u2019s power to govern within the 169 towns and would make each town a sovereign power. Each town is, however, merely an instrumentality of the state and not a sovereign. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>227 Conn. 363, 372-73, 630 A.2d 1315 (1993) (\u201cMunicipalities, because they are creations of the state, have no inherent legislative authority. . . . Rather, the legislative authority of municipalities derives solely from express legislative grants.\u201d [Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]); <em>Buonocore v. Branford, </em>192 Conn. 399, 401, 471 A.2d 961 (1984) (\u201c[i]t is settled law that as a creation of the state, a municipality has no inherent powers of its own\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Under the majority\u2019s theory, a town could restrict certain state licensed motor vehicle operators from driving in that town and create chaos on our highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Furthermore, the legislature has in the past shown that it knows how to grant towns power to prohibit state authorized and regulated activities. In General Statutes \u00a7 30-9, the legislature granted municipalities the power to prohibit within their boundaries the sale of alcoholic beverages, a state regulated activity. It may be that cigarette smoking by young people should be discouraged by the legislature by giving towns authority to ban cigarette vending machine sales within the towns in the same way as it gave them the authority under \u00a7 30-9 to ban sales of alcoholic beverages. This has not yet occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The majority finds a legislative intent to grant towns a power to prohibit state regulated activity in the face of the legislature\u2019s failure to grant such a power explicitly. In doing so, this court, while adopting the guise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>\u201cthe least dangerous branch\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of government, in effect becomes the legislature. Our role is properly that of an interpreter of the laws and not that of law giver. Under our constitution, the power to legislate belongs to those elected by the people and not to appointed judges. Judges should not be social engineers. See <em>Claremont School District </em>v. <em>Governor, </em>142 N.H. 462, 477, 703 A.2d 1353 (1997) (Horton, J., dissenting). Although I admire the majority\u2019s intention and goal, I believe that law should be made by lawmakers who present their views to the people and whose power rests upon the people\u2019s support.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Our state led our country in establishing a system of government that directly responds to the will of the people. We must be careful to maintain that system.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-8\"> Section 12-289a follows \u00a7 12-289, which requires that each cigarette vending machine used in Connecticut be licensed by the state of Connecticut.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b155-11\"> In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton described the judiciary as the \u201cleast dangerous\u201d department of power because it has \u201cneither force nor will, but merely judgment . . .
