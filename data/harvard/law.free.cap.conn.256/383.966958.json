The respondent father, Genero F.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> argues that the trial court improperly issued temporary custody orders and that he was entitled to \u201cpostpone\u201d his appeal of those temporary orders until issuance of a final judgment terminating his parental rights. We disagree and conclude, as we did <em>in Madigan </em>v. <em>Madigan, </em>224 Conn. 749, 757, 620 A.2d 1276 (1993), that \u201ctemporary custody orders are immediately appealable because an immediate appeal is the only reasonable method of ensuring that the important rights surrounding the parent-child relationship are adequately protected\u201d; id.; and, further, that an immediate appeal is the only way to ensure the protection of the best interests of children. We conclude, therefore, that the respondent\u2019s collateral attack on the temporary custody order, after the order terminating parental rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>had been entered, is \u201c \u2018a procedurally impermissible substitute for an appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Joe\u2019s Pizza, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>236 Conn. 863, 876, 675 A.2d 441 (1996). We therefore affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court dismissing the respondent\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The record of the proceedings below reveals the following facts and procedural history. The respondent is the father of Shamika F. and her three siblings, whose custody is at issue in this appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The children\u2019s mother is not a party to this appeal. The respondent\u2019s family had a history with child protection services in the Bronx, New York, prior to moving to Connecticut in 1995. In 1995, the family became involved with the Connecticut department of children and families (department) after reports were received that the children were neglected and without parental supervision. Investigations conducted by the department disclosed that the respondent\u2019s four children lived in a dirty apartment where there was no food and no furniture. The youngest child was not toilet trained, but had no diapers and little clothing. The older children were scantily clad or wore clothes that did not fit. There was evidence that both parents used narcotics and that the respondent had, at one time, received psychiatric treatment at Hartford Hospital. In interviews with social workers, the children stated that their parents often left them alone while they went out to buy drugs. In December, 1995, the family left Connecticut without notifying the department. In January, 1996, when the social worker assigned to the case was unable to obtain a new address for the family, the case was closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">In March, 1996, the department received reports that the family had returned to Connecticut, that the children were being neglected, and that they went to school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>hungry or that they did not attend school at all. After receiving these reports, the department reopened the family\u2019s case file. Subsequent investigation determined that the family had in fact returned to Connecticut, that the children continued to live in conditions dangerous to their well-being, and that they again frequently were left without parental supervision. The situation was such that on March 29, 1996, a \u201cninety-six hour hold\u201d on the children was granted to the commissioner of the department (commissioner) pending further investigation to determine neglect and to proceed on petitions for temporary custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">In April, 1996, the commissioner filed neglect petitions as to Shamika F. and her three siblings pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 46b-129 (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the same time, the commissioner filed a petition for an ex parte order of temporary custody pursuant to \u00a7 46b-129 (b). The petition for temporary custody was granted on April 2, 1996, and a hearing was scheduled for April 12, 1996, as required by General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 46b-129 (b), to address the ex parte order. Both parents were served with a notice of the order and were present at the April 12,1996 hearing, at which time they were advised of their rights and informed of the charges of neglect.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The respondent did not raise any jurisdictional challenges to the court\u2019s granting of the temporary custody orders at that time. On May 30, 1996, the respondent appeared, with counsel, at the hearing on the neglect petitions, and entered pro forma denials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>with respect to the charges of neglect. At that time, the children\u2019s mother requested that they remain in the commissioner\u2019s custody. The respondent neither objected to this request nor raised any jurisdictional challenge at the neglect proceedings. On June 28, 1996, the trial court found, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, that the children were being neglected by their parents.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thereafter, the children were committed to the care and custody of the commissioner for a period of twelve months without objection from the parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">At the same time as it made the neglect determination, the court imposed requirements on the parents in order to deal with the issues that were causing them to neglect their children. Extensive referrals to drug counseling providers and parenting classes were made for both parents, yet neither showed any dedication to, or progress from, the assistance available. In June, 1997, the commissioner filed a petition for a twelve month extension of the children\u2019s commitment to the department pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 46b-129 (d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Both parents were notified of the petition to extend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>commitment and neither objected. The extension was granted, and the parents were given additional time for rehabilitation and reunification with their children. The children\u2019s mother, however, participated infrequently in the programs provided and made little or no progress. As late as March, 1998, she tested positive for heroin use. The respondent did not participate in any of the programs recommended by social workers and made available through the department. In March, 1998, the parents returned voluntarily to New York despite the children\u2019s placement in Connecticut foster homes while they were under the care and custody of the Connecticut department. As a result, the respondent and the children\u2019s mother missed at least three scheduled visits with their children in February and March, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>In April, 1998, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 17a-112,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the commissioner of the department filed petitions to terminate the parental rights of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>respondent and the children\u2019s mother on the grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>of neglect, failure to rehabilitate and failure to comply with reunification efforts.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The parents were served with the petitions for termination and notified of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>hearing that would take place on May 21, 1998. Neither parent was present on that date. Instead, counsel for the respondent argued, pursuant to a motion for in-court review, that the court should consider transferring the case to the New York state child protection agency under the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court denied the motion, noting that \u201cmore delay and disruption\u201d was not in the best interest of the children in light of the fact that all of them were well established in the Connecticut foster care system. A transfer to New York would require that state\u2019s child protection agency to restart the process and uproot the children.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">In June, 1998, during the pendency of the termination petition, the commissioner again filed a petition for a twelve month extension of the children\u2019s commitment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>to the department pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 46b-129 (d), which the court granted. Both parents were notified that the commissioner was seeking another extension of the children\u2019s commitment. There is no evidence in the record that the respondent challenged the extensions of temporary custody despite his presence at the hearings. From March, 1998, until the termination of parental rights proceedings in 1999, the parents had few visits with their children. The children have continued to reside in foster homes since their placement in June, 1996.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Notably, according to social workers, the children showed little attachment to their biological parents and rarely spoke of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">In January, 1999, prior to the trial on the termination petitions, the respondent again challenged Connecticut\u2019s jurisdiction over the matter, filing a \u201cMotion for Order Disowning or Declining Subject Matter Jurisdiction.\u201d In his supporting memorandum of law, the respondent made several arguments refuting Connecticut\u2019s jurisdiction. First, he argued that the commissioner was infringing upon his constitutionally protected \u201cright to travel,\u201d because the department\u2019s custody of his children forced him to remain in Connecticut despite the availability of better job opportunities and more family support in New York. Second, he argued that, according to the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (act); see General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 46b-90 et seq.;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> New York, not Connecticut, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>the home state of Shamika F. and her siblings. Citing General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 46b-91 (a) (3), the respondent claimed that the family had a closer connection with New York than Connecticut, and that they had not lived in Connecticut for six consecutive months prior to the commencement of the original neglect proceedings.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Finally, the respondent argued that the commissioner \u201cis not, and cannot be, \u2018a parent or person acting as parent,\u2019 within contemplation of the [act].\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Citing the act as adopted by Connecticut and other states, the commissioner opposed the respondent\u2019s motion on the grounds that: (1) Connecticut had been the children\u2019s home state since at least 1996; (2) adjudication in Connecticut was in the best interest of the children because of the family\u2019s substantial connection to the state; and (3) the children needed to be removed from an emergency situation in Connecticut, giving the department in Connecticut original jurisdiction under \u00a7 46b-129 (b). Furthermore, the commissioner argued that, despite the Superior Court\u2019s power to decline jurisdiction where doing so would be in the best interests of the children; see General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 46b-97; such action would not be prudent in this case because of the children\u2019s significant connection to Connecticut and to their Connecticut foster parents. It was also the commissioner\u2019s position that, because termination proceedings were separate from neglect proceedings, the children had lived in Connecticut for more than six months before the filing of the termination petitions. In fact, the children had been living in Connecticut since at least 1996 when they were first adjudicated as neglected and placed in the care and custody of the commissioner.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>At a hearing on the jurisdictional issue held on January 11, 1999, the court agreed with the commissioner and denied the respondent\u2019s motion, concluding that Connecticut had jurisdiction over the matter based on the facts that (1) there were no proceedings pending in New York; (2) the children had been in Connecticut foster care since being adjudicated neglected in 1996 and ordered into the custody of the department; (3) all of the children\u2019s caregivers since 1996 were located in Connecticut; and (4) the only connection the family had to New York was the parents\u2019 voluntary relocation there in 1998, despite the children\u2019s establishment in Connecticut foster homes. On the basis of these determinations, the court found that it was in the best interest of the children \u201cthat they not be up and moved simply to make accommodations to the present residence of the parents in New York.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">On February 8, 1999, a hearing was conducted to determine whether parental rights should be terminated. At the hearing, several witnesses testified regarding the parents\u2019 neglect of the children, the alleged physical, sexual and substance abuse that took place in the home, and the negative psychological effect the parents had on their children. Social workers from the department testified to the fact that the parents did not take advantage of the rehabilitation programs offered to them. In its memorandum of decision dated February 26, 1999, the trial court found by clear and convincing evidence that the parents of Shamika F. and her siblings had failed to rehabilitate themselves in order to reunify their family despite the department\u2019s reasonable efforts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>to facilitate such rehabilitation and reunification.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The trial court concluded that as of April 23, 1998, neither parent had complied with the requirements of any assigned rehabilitation program and that, because of their behavior, they had denied the children the care, guidance or control necessary for their physical, educational or emotional well-being. In accordance with \u00a7 17a-112; see footnote 9 of this opinion; therefore, the court concluded that: (1) both the respondent and the children\u2019s mother had abandoned their children; and (2) neither parent had achieved a degree of personal rehabilitation that would encourage the belief that they could assume a responsible position in their children\u2019s lives. As a result, an order terminating parental rights was entered on February 26, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">In his appeal to the Appellate Court, the respondent challenged the trial court\u2019s decision to terminate his parental rights to his four minor children. He based his challenge, however, on alleged jurisdictional errors committed by the court in the 1996 temporary custody proceedings, rather than on any alleged error committed in the course of the termination proceedings. In a motion to dismiss the appeal, the commissioner argued that, because the neglect and temporary custody proceedings were separate and distinct from the termination proceedings, the respondent\u2019s appeal raised an impermissible collateral attack on a previous final judgment in a prior proceeding. First, the commissioner asserted that the respondent\u2019s appeal was barred on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>timeliness grounds because he was raising claims of error in a proceeding that took place three years earlier, in violation of Practice Book \u00a7 63-1 (a), which provides that \u201can appeal must be filed within twenty days of the date notice of the judgment or decision is given. . . .\u201d Second, the commissioner argued that \u201c[a] collateral attack on a judgment [in a prior, separate proceeding] is a procedurally impermissible substitute for an appeal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Joe\u2019s Pizza, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>supra, 236 Conn. 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">In his opposition to the motion to dismiss, the respondent argued that termination of his parental rights was a final judgment from both the initial neglect and temporary custody proceedings <em>and </em>the termination proceedings, and that any appeal prior to that would have been premature and dismissed as interlocutory. This, he argued, was because the two proceedings are both part of a collective decision regarding parental rights, and are not separate and distinct. Therefore, he claimed that challenging the temporaiy orders was not a collateral attack on a previous judgment. Finally, he argued that even if his claims were held to be collateral attacks on the neglect and temporary custody proceedings, they should not be barred because his challenge to the temporary custody orders was grounded in the trial court\u2019s lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and he may appeal that issue at any time. See <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (85-BC), </em>195 Conn. 344, 363, 488 A.2d 790 (1985) (question of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time in proceedings). Finding no merit in the respondent\u2019s arguments, the Appellate Court granted the commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss, and the respondent petitioned this court for certification to appeal pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 84-1.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We granted certification to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>appeal limited to the following question: \u201cIs an order of temporary custody a final judgment for purposes of appeal or must any such appeal wait until an order of termination of parental rights is entered in the matter?\u201d <em>In re Shamika F., </em>252 Conn. 940, 757 A.2d 2 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u201cThe right of appeal is purely statutory [and stems from General Statutes \u00a7 52-263]. It is accorded only if the conditions fixed by statute and the rules of court for taking and prosecuting the appeal are met.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 30, 463 A.2d 566 (1983).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Not only must the appellant be aggrieved by the decision of the court, but the appeal must be taken from a final judgment of the court. \u201cBecause our jurisdiction over appeals, both criminal and civil, is prescribed by statute, we must always determine the threshold question of whether the appeal is taken from a final judgment before considering the merits of the claim.\u201d Id., and cases cited therein. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-142 (b), regarding juvenile matters, provides in relevant part: \u201cThe Department of Children and Families, or any party at interest aggrieved by any <em>final judgment </em>or order of the court, may appeal to the Appellate Court in accordance with the provisions of section 52-263. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, it is important for us to determine initially whether the determinations made regarding neglect and temporary custody were final for purposes of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">In general, we recognize the statutory principle that appellate jurisdiction is limited to appeals from final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>judgments. We also recognize, however, that there is a \u201cgray area\u201d between those judgments \u201cwhich are undoubtedly final and others that are clearly interlocutory and not appealable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Madigan </em>v. <em>Madigan, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 753, quoting <em>E. J. Hansen Elevator, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stoll, </em>167 Conn. 623, 627, 356 A.2d 893 (1975). The <em>Curcio </em>rule provides that \u201c[a]n otherwise interlocutory order is appealable in two circumstances: (1) where the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding, or (2) where the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 31.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>there have been occasions \u201c[i]n both criminal and civil cases, [in which] we have determined certain interlocutory orders and rulings of the Superior Court to be final judgments for purposes of appeal.\u201d Id. \u201cWe note the existence of a narrow category of cases in which certain temporary orders have been held to be appealable final judgments because they so conclude the rights of a party that further proceedings could not affect them. See, e.g., <em>Goodson </em>v. <em>State, </em>228 Conn. 106, 114, 635 A.2d 285 (1993) (order of reinstatement to employment pending arbitration); <em>Madigan </em>v. <em>Madigan, </em>[supra, 755] (temporary custody order in dissolution case); <em>Litvaitis </em>v. <em>Litvaitis, </em>162 Conn. 540, 548, 295 A.2d 519 (1972) (temporary order of child support in dissolution case); <em>Hiss </em>v. <em>Hiss, </em>135 Conn. 333, 336, 64 A.2d 173 (1949) (pendente lite order of support in equitable action for support).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Waterbury Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>230 Conn. 441, 451, 645 A.2d 978 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">In <em>Madigan </em>v. <em>Madigan, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 753-54, we applied the <em>Curcio </em>standard to determine whether, in the context of a dissolution case, an order of temporary custody was a final judgment for purposes of appeal. In that case, temporary custody orders were entered in favor of the defendant wife during the pendency of a dissolution proceeding in the Superior Court. Id., 750-51. The plaintiff husband appealed from the temporary custody orders on the grounds that they would interfere with his right to spend significant time with his child, and that such an opportunity \u201ccannot be replaced by a subsequent order of custody as part of an ultimate dissolution judgment.\u201d Id., 756. The Appellate Court dismissed his appeal for lack of a final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>judgment. Id., 752. We granted certification to appeal regarding the issue of the finality of the temporary custody order and reversed the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment. Id., 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Relying on the second prong of the <em>Curcio </em>test, we concluded in <em>Madigan </em>that \u201cdenying] immediate relief to an aggrieved parent [would interfere] with the parent\u2019s custodial right over a significant period [of time] in a manner that [could not] be redressed by a later appeal.\u201d Id., 756. Even \u201ca temporary custody order may have a significant impact on a subsequent permanent custody decision . . . [by] establishing] a foundation for a stable long-term relationship that becomes an important factor in determining what final custodial arrangements are in the best interests of the child.\u201d Id., 756-57; see General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56. We concluded that temporary custody orders did \u201cso [conclude] the rights of the parties that further proceedings [could not] affect them\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 31; and, therefore, they were final for purposes of appeal. Following <em>Madigan, </em>we subsequently also have held that a one year- ban on custody and visitation motions imposed by a court to prevent parents involved in a custody dispute from filing further motions is a final judgment for purposes of appeal because it had the potential to interfere seriously with the parent-child relationship. See <em>Taff v. Beltcher, </em>243 Conn. 380, 386-87, 703 A.2d 759 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The considerations that led us to our conclusions in <em>Madigan </em>and <em>Taff </em>also apply here to the extent that \u201ccourts and state agencies must keep in mind the constitutional limitations imposed [upon them when they undertake] any form of coercive intervention in family affairs . . . [which includes] the right of the family to remain together without the . . . interference of the awesome power of the state.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Juvenile Appeal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number><em>(83-CD), </em>189 Conn. 276, 284, 455 A.2d 1313 (1983). Thus, we consider orders of temporary custody in light of these constitutional considerations and reaffirm our conclusion that \u201can immediate appeal of [a court order of temporary custody] is the only reasonable method of ensuring that the important rights surrounding the parent-child relationship are adequately protected.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Taff </em>v. <em>Bettcher, </em>supra, 243 Conn. 387, quoting <em>Madigan </em>v. <em>Madigan, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 757.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As we pointed out in <em>Madigan, </em>several of our sister states have come to the same conclusion. See <em>Madigan </em>v. <em>Madigan, </em>supra, 757 n.9.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Accordingly, we conclude that, in order to protect the parent\u2019s interest in retaining custody of the child, an order of temporary custody is a final judgment for purposes of appeal. That reasoning means, moreover, that any party with standing to challenge that order by appeal must do so at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">In this case, moreover, the best interest of the children, especially their interest in family stability, supports our analysis. When a parent has spent three years neglecting to challenge the temporary removal of his children from his custody, the children\u2019s strong interest in stability counsels firmly against allowing a belated appellate challenge to that temporary order. When the extensions to the temporary custody orders were granted in both 1997 and 1998, the separation of the children from their parents was approved for a period extending to almost three years. During that time, Shamika F. and her siblings all were establishing themselves in the Connecticut foster care system and attempting to achieve a degree of stability with their foster families. As we pointed out in <em>Madigan, </em>spending a significant amount of time in foster care has the potential to \u201cestablish a foundation for a stable long-term relationship that becomes an important factor in determining what final custodial arrangements are in the best interest of the [children].\u201d Id., 757. Thus, the second prong of the <em>Cur-do </em>\u201cfinal judgment\u201d test requires an immediate appeal of those judgments that have an irreversible effect on important familial relationships in order to protect the interests of the parties involved. Neglecting to appeal the removal of the children in a timely fashion also can affect the interests of the children. Therefore, we conclude that temporary custody orders are immediately appealable not only to protect a parent\u2019s interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>in their children, but also to protect the individual interests of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Accordingly, such appeals are obligatory so that parents may act in the best interest of their children. A grave injustice would be committed against children if a parent were permitted to appeal from a judgment of temporary custody long after they had established a stable relationship with foster parents. We therefore protect the best interest of the children by requiring parents immediately to appeal decisions that, as here, interfere substantially with their family integrity. Those parents must do so in a timely fashion not only to protect themselves, but also to protect the children. Appealing from a temporary custody order after allowing children to languish in foster care for three years does nothing for family integrity. To the contrary, it would interfere seriously with their ability to experience any kind of family stability with either a biological or a foster family, even in situations where parents have demonstrated a total lack of interest in reunifying the family. We, therefore, limit a parent\u2019s right to attack collaterally a temporary custody order in order to avoid further disruption of the lives of neglected children. By doing so, not only are we protecting the parent-child relationship, but we are also protecting the important interests of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\u201cThe reason for the rule against collateral attack is well stated in these words: The law aims to invest judicial transactions with the utmost permanency consistent with justice. . . . Public policy requires that a term be put to litigation and that judgments, as solemn records upon which valuable rights rest, should not lightly be disturbed or overthrown. . . . [T]he law has established appropriate proceedings to which a judgment party may always resort when he deems himself wronged by the court\u2019s decision. ... If he omits or neglects to test the soundness of the judgment by these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>or other direct methods available for that puipose, he is in no position to urge its defective or erroneous character when it is pleaded or produced in evidence against him in subsequent proceedings. Unless it ,is entirely invalid and that fact is disclosed by an inspection of the record itself the judgment is invulnerable to indirect assaults upon it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lampson Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Hoer, </em>139 Conn. 294, 297-98, 93 A.2d 143 (1952), quoting 1 A. Freeman, Judgments (5th Ed. 1925) \u00a7 305, pp. 602-603. Although public policy in Connecticut favors the protection of the integrity of the family, there is also a strong public policy in favor of protecting the best interest of our children. It is in the best interest of children, especially those growing up in situations of neglect, that the state provide them with a stable family life to the extent that it is able to do so. The commissioner and the department seek to do this through our state foster care system. Allowing a collateral attack three years into that effort would undermine the purpose of the collateral attack rule as well as the goal of our state agencies in protecting the neglected children of Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The respondent had three years, and several in-court hearings, during which he could have challenged the temporary custody orders that led to the temporary removal of his children. Even when the trial court denied or dismissed his jurisdictional challenges, the respondent failed to appeal. Although we are not suggesting that any challenge would have succeeded, his failure to act at the time the temporary custody orders were entered does not give him a right at this late date to launch a collateral attack on the neglect and temporary custody proceedings. See <em>In re Jessica S., </em>51 Conn. App. 667, 671 and n.4, 723 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 251 Conn. 901, 738 A.2d 1090 (1999). \u201cUnless a litigant can show an absence of subject matter jurisdiction that makes the prior judgment of a tribunal entirely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>invalid, he or she must resort to direct proceedings to correct perceived wrongs .... A collateral attack on a judgment is a procedurally impermissible substitute for an appeal.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Joe\u2019s Pizza, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>supra, 236 Conn. 876. \u201c[A]t least where the lack of jurisdiction is not entirely obvious, the critical considerations are whether the complaining parly had the opportunity to litigate the question of jurisdiction in the original action, and, if he did have such an opportunity, whether there are strong policy reasons for giving him a second opportunity to do so.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>224 Conn. 96, 104, 616 A.2d 793 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">We see no reason to give the respondent a second opportunity to litigate the issue of temporary custody or Connecticut\u2019s jurisdiction with respect to the proceedings related thereto. He had a fair chance to do so at the time of the neglect and temporary custody proceedings, and he failed to act. Although we note that we previously have held that a collateral attack may be appropriate when the trial court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction was obvious, we conclude in this case that \u201c[t]he lack of jurisdiction, if any, was far from obvious . . . .\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b404-10\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 46b-129 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) . . .

To the extent that both parties relied on the first prong of the <em>Curcio </em>test in their briefs, however, we will address briefly the \u201cseparate and distinct proceedings\u201d issue. In <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (84-AB), </em>192 Conn. 254, 471 A.2d 1380 (1984), the parents appealed to this court from two separate judgments after their minor child was adjudicated neglected and their parental rights were terminated. The parents claimed that the trial court erred in using \u201cfair preponderance of [the] evidence\u201d as the standard of proof in the adjudicatory phase of the proceedings and in changing the standard of proof between the adjudicatory phase and the dispositive phase of the proceedings. Id., 257-58. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. Id. We concluded that a \u201cfair preponderance of the evidence\u201d is the proper standard of proof for a neglect petition because \u201cany deprivation of right s [at that stage] is reviewable and nonpermanent\u201d and, thus, warrants a slightly less exacting standard of proof. Id., 264-65. \u201cWhile [however] a finding of neglect, resulting in non-permanent, custody, may be proved by a fair preponderance of the evidence, all of the elements of the termination of parental rights petition [as set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 45a-717 (g) (1) and (2), formerly \u00a7 45-6If] must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d Id., 266. Our rationale for using two different standards was that \u201c]w]hile an adjudication of neglect may lead to removal of a child from parental custody pending investigation and resolution of the child\u2019s circumstances, removal [or termination of parental rights] is only one of a number of possible dispositions after a finding of neglect.\u201d Id., 263. We concluded, therefore, that a \u201cpetition for neglect and [a] petition to terminate parental rights are separate and distinct petitions . . . [each with] its own specific requirements.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 261-62. This supports our conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>that temporary custody orders are final judgments for purposes of appeal because (1) they are separate and distinct from the termination proceedings, and (2) they so conclude parents\u2019 rights to be free from interference with their family integrity that further proceedings cannot affect them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b424-6\"> In <em>Madigan, </em>we compared temporary orders for alimony and support to temporary custody orders in order to draw our analogy. See <em>Hiss </em>v. <em>Hiss, </em>supra, 135 Conn. 336-37 (temporary orders for alimony and support immediately appealable). We found temporary orders of alimony and support to be \u201c \u2018final\u2019 \u201d because \u201conce paid by one spouse to another, such sums could not subsequently be recovered on appeal from the final dissolution judgment.\u201d <em>Madigan </em>v. <em>Madigan, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 755. \u201cThis reasoning applies with equal force to temporary custody orders that affect the irreplaceable time and relationship shared between parent and child. It would be anomalous, therefore, to permit the appealability of otherwise nonreviewable orders relating to financial matters and to deny the appealability of orders relating to the personal interaction between a parent and a child.\u201d Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b424-7\"> \u201cAn inquiry into the law of other jurisdictions supports our conclusion that temporary custody orders are immediately appealable. Although a number of jurisdictions have held that such orders are not immediately appeal-able, emphasizing the broad rule that interlocutory orders must await the end of an action to be appealed; see, e.g., <em>Chancellor </em>v. <em>Chancellor, </em>282 Ark. 227, 230, 667 S.W.2d 950 (1984); <em>In re Temporary Custody of Five Minors, </em>105 Nev. 441, 443, 777 P.2d 901 (1989); <em>Craft </em>v. <em>Craft, </em>579 S.W.2d 506, 508 (Tex. App. 1979); others recognize that temporary orders may be appealed pursuant to local rules recognizing interlocutory appeals. See, e.g., <em>Sanchez v. Walker County Dept. of Family &amp; Children Services, </em>235 Ga. 817, 818, 221 S.E.2d 589 (1976); <em>In re Marriage of Kitchen, </em>126 111. App. 3d 192, 194-95, 467 N.E.2d 344 (1984). Likewise, a limited number of jurisdictions recognize temporary custody orders as final for the purpose of immediate appeal. See, e.g., <em>In re Interests of L. W., </em>241 Neb. 84, [95-96, 486 N.W.2d 486] (1992); <em>In re Murray, </em>52 Ohio St. 3d 155, 159-61, 556 N.E.2d 1169 (1990). On balance, we find that the rationale for allowing immediate appeals adopted in the latter jurisdictions, in conjunction with the practice in other jurisdictions that allow these appeals by special interlocutory appeals rules, to be more persuasive than the traditional reasons of judicial economy generally offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>as a justification to adhere to a rule of nonappealability.\u201d <em>Madigan </em>v. <em>Madigan, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 757 n.9.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
