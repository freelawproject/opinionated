The defendant relied solely upon a general denial. The plaintiff produced the note and offered it in evidence. The defendant stated that he was willing that the face of the note should be put in evidence, but not the indorsement. The presiding judge, subject to an exception by the defendant, ruled that, the defendant having failed to deny the genuineness of the signature in accordance with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>provisions of R. L. c. 173, \u00a7 86, the plaintiff was not called upon to prove the genuineness of the indorsement, and that the plaintiff was entitled to introduce the note in evidence. There was no other evidence. The jury found for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b549-4\"><em>E. W.

J. Raymond, Gen\u2019l Manager.\u201d The declaration was on the note as indorsed to the plaintiff and the answer was a general denial. The only point raised is whether in this state of the pleadings the plaintiff was required to prove the genuineness of the indorsement. It was said in <em>Lowell </em>v. Bickford, 201 Mass. 543, 545, with ample citation of authorities, that \u201c It is the settled law of this Commonwealth that a holder of a negotiable promissory note payable to bearer or payable to order and indorsed in blank can sue on it in his own name. ... It is not necessary for him to prove that he owns the note or if not that he has the consent of the true owner to bring suit on it in his own name.\u201d That case fully covers the present one, as the genuineness of the signature of the payee in the indorsement was not denied. R. L. c. 173, \u00a7 86. It was called to the attention of the parties in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\"><em>Bradlee </em>v. <em>Warren Five Cents Savings </em>Bank, 127 Mass. 107, relied upon by the defendant, rests upon the law respecting savings banks, and has no bearing here.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">These exceptions appear frivolous and are overruled, and double costs and interest at the rate of twelve per cent from the time when the exceptions were allowed are awarded against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
