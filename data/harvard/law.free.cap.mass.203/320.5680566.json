Writ dated February 15,1908.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-4\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before Bishop, J. The facts shown by the evidence are stated in the opinion. One Picard was the other carpenter referred to in the opinion, who was working with the plaintiff as a fellow employee at the time of the accident. Picard testified that he had worked as a carpenter for twenty-five years. Having testified that the corner board that broke was of pine, which was shown by his other testimony to mean native white pine, he was asked by the plaintiff whether \u201c boards of that character were ordinarily used for finish.\u201d Upon objection by the defendant, this question was excluded. The plaintiff also asked this witness the question, \u201c Was it necessary for Mr. McNulty [the plaintiff] to catch hold of the board in the manner in which he did in order to nail that piece of studding on the roof ? \u201d Upon objection by the defendant, the judge also excluded this question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-5\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the judge ruled that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, and ordered a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b343-6\"><em>D. I. Walsh, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b343-7\"><em>C.

The employer, the defendant, furnished a number of native pine boards exactly sufficient for finishing. During the plaintiff\u2019s temporary absence, his fellow employee, doing his work in his own way, used one of these boards for a corner board. It projected somewhat above the body of the building and broke by reason of a knot, while the plaintiff was supporting himself upon it in doing his work. If there was any negligence, it was that of his fellow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>servant in using for this place a knotty board of such character that it was likely to break. There is nothing to show that he might not have found a safe one, even though the total number supplied did not exceed the needs of construction. Upon familiar principles the plaintiff cannot recover under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">There was no error in the exclusion of evidence. The nature of native white pine wood was within the knowledge of the plaintiff, and the particular quality of that used on this building was before his eyes. Therefore, whether it was commonly used for finish was of no consequence. It was being so used in fact, and the plaintiff who had himself been a contracting builder made no objection to or criticism of it for this purpose. Whether it was necessary for the plaintiff to take hold of the board in doing his work was for the jury to determine as a matter of common sense, after all the attendant conditions were described to them. It was a subject as to which opinion testimony might properly be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
