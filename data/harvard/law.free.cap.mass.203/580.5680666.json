The fact that the \u201cwhite oak\u201d cross-piece \" 3i inches square \u201d into which the iron bars were run was so rotten on the morning after the accident (which was on February 1) that a witness \" could pick it to pieces,\u201d or, as the same witness described it, \" simple [simply] rotten,\u201d warranted a finding that it was rotten in the previous fall. The case comes within the class of cases collected in <em>Young </em>v. <em>Snell, </em>200 Mass. 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">2. Testimony was given by one of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses to the fact that the part of the frame which was rotten was underneath and there was nothing to contradict that; and we assume that the defendant was entitled to take the plaintiff\u2019s case as one where the defect was not apparent on the surface of the grating. The defendant\u2019s main contention is' that under these circumstances the case comes within <em>Rochefort </em>v. <em>Attleborough, </em>154 Mass. 140; <em>Stoddard </em>v. <em>Winchester, </em>154 Mass. 149; <em>Brummett </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>179 Mass. 26; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>North Adams, </em>182 Mass. 569. But we are of opinion that it does not come within the principle of those cases. What gave way in <em>Rochefort </em>v. <em>Attleborough </em>and in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>North Adams </em>was a culvert under a public way. In <em>Stoddard </em>v. <em>Winchester </em>a part of the public way in which a trench for a water pipe had been dug six months before gave way, and in <em>Brummett </em>v. <em>Boston </em>a sidewalk gave way. For limitations on this principle under the circumstances to which it was applied in the last two cases, see <em>Stoddard </em>v. <em>Winchester, </em>157 Mass. 567, and <em>Bingham </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>161 Mass. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-15\">What gave way in the case at bar was the grating over a 44 sewer drop.\u201d One Gaudette, an employee of the defendant city in its street department (called as a witness by the plaintiff), testified 44 that it was a part of his duty to inspect sewer drops ; that they were inspected and cleaned in the spring and fall; that he had inspected this sewer drop and the grating here in question in the fall before the accident just before the ground froze; that at that time he found this sewer drop and grating in good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>condition, and that it was then all right.\u201d In addition the city engineer of the defendant city testified \u201c that he had seen grates where the top would be in good condition and the wood work beneath would be rotten, and it would be natural for the wood work to decay underneath, because that was where the water would naturally set, and that the bottom part was the part that ought to be watched.\u201d The fact that the \u201c white oak \u201d frame was \u201csimply rotten\u201d on the first day of February warranted a finding that it would have been apparent if the inspection of the grating which the city made in the fall before the accident had been properly made. This warranted a finding that the defect here in question was one of which the defendant city by the exercise of proper care and diligence would have had notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><em>Exceptions </em>overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
