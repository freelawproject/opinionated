His report was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-6\">\u201cAt the hearing before me I found, upon the agreed oral statements of counsel, that the petitioners are the owners of tracts of land, with buildings thereon, situated on opposite sides of a public way known as Avon Street in the city of Boston. It further appeared that they filed an application, a copy of which is annexed to the respondents\u2019 answer, with the building commissioner, appointed under the statute, for permission to connect the buildings with a covered way located at a height of about thirty-two feet above the level of the street.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-7\">\u201c I further found that the object and purpose of this covered way is to afford a convenient means of communication between the buildings and also to provide an egress from one building to the other in case of fire.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-8\">\u201c The building commissioner denied the application, and the petitioners appealed to the respondents, by whom their petition was denied as matter of law, with an intimation that if the granting of it was discretionary the desired permission would be given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-9\">\u201c Upon these findings I ruled as matter of law that the petition could not be maintained, and ordered it dismissed with costs. At the request of the petitioners I now report the case to the full court. If the ruling was right the order is to be affirmed; otherwise a writ of mandamus is to issue.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-10\">The case was submitted on briefs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-11\"><em>S. M. </em>Child, for the petitioners.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-12\"><em>D. D.

This statute regulates the \u201c construction, alteration and maintenance of buildings in the city of Boston,\u201d both as respects the buildings themselves, and their relation to public streets and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>squares. The thirteenth section, so far as material to the present case, runs as follows: \u201c Ho part of any structure, except cornices, permanent awnings, string courses, window caps and sills, bay windows, under such terms, conditions, regulations and restrictions as may be required by the mayor and board of aider-men, and outside means of egress, as otherwise provided, . . . shall project over any public way or square.\u201d The phrase \u201cotherwise provided\u201d must refer to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7'12 and 17 of this act. Section 12 provides that \u201c every building shall have, with reference to its height, condition, construction, surroundings, character of occupation and number of occupants, reasonable means of egress in case of fire, satisfactory to the commissioner\u201d; and \u00a7 17 provides that \u201c Ho building used above the first floor for the storage or sale of merchandise shall have less than two means of egress from every story, one of which means may be ... an outside fire escape.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\">At the hearing before the board of appeal it \u201cappeared that sufficient means of egress satisfactory to the building commissioner had been provided in the building referred to in the petition without reference to the structure extending over and across Avon Street.\u201d The requirements of \u00a7\u00a712 and 17 having been met by means other than the proposed covered way, the way falls within the general prohibition of \u00a7 13. The ruling of the board of appeal was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
