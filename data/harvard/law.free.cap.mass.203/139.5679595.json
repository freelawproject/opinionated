Ten days after the execution of the deed creating this trust, the beneficiary made a will, and two years later she died, while still living apart from her husband. Her only near relation was a sister named J. Her will, after providing for the payment of her funeral expenses, for the return to her sister J. and to two friends of various articles which she had received as gifts from them respectively, and making gifts of personal articles to her cousin S. and to one of the friends, contained the following clauses : \u201c Seventh : After the payment of my just debts, expenses of funeral, cremation and burial and the administration of my estate and the delivery of the specific bequests hereinbefore given, the remainder of the money, securities or deposits belonging to my estate, I ask shall be held in trust by my said executrix during the lifetime of my said cousin S., and during the continuanee of said trust the net income received therefrom shall, from time to time, and at least semi-annually be paid to my said cousin for her own personal use and free from all interference or control of her husband. Upon the decease of my said cousin, S., said trust shall terminate, and said trust estate shall then revert to my general estate and be paid to my said sister J. as hereinafter provided. Eighth: All articles of personal property belonging to me at my decease, which are not herein specifically bequeathed or designated, to be held in trust, and all right, title and interest, if any, which I may have in any real estate at my decease, I give, devise and bequeath to my said sister, J., and upon the termination of said trust the net amount then remaining of said trust estate, shall also be delivered and paid to my said sister, who shall receive, hold, enjoy and dispose of the same as her own individual property, free from the control and interference of her husband, and shall hold the same to her, her heirs and assigns forever.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the seventh and eighth clauses, quoted above, formed together the residuary clause of the will, which executed the testamentory power under the deed of trust and was applicable to all the kinds of property named in each of the clauses; that, accordingly, the income of the fund created by the trust settlement was to be paid to the testatrix\u2019s cousin S. for her own personal use and free from all interference of her husband during her life, and that upon her death the fund was to be paid over to the testatrix\u2019s sister J., her \u25a0 heirs or assigns.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AZI\">Bill in equity, filed in the Supreme Judicial Court on January 18, 1909, by the executrix of the will of Mary E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Howland, late of New Bedford, who also was trustee thereunder, for instructions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-3\">The bill was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-4\">\u201c 1.

Howland, his wife, and William C. Parker and James L. Gillingham, trustees. The said husband and wife were then, and for some time previous thereto had been, living apart; and they continued to live apart thereafter up to the time of Mrs. Howland\u2019s decease. By the provisions of said instrument, a trust fund of $5,500 was created, from the principal of which and the interest thereon semiannual payments of $250 each were to be made to Mrs. Howland. And a general power of appointment of the trust fund by will was given to Mrs. Howland by the trust instrument as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-6\">\u201c 1 That in the event of the death of said Mary E.

Howland, and indorsed by said Barker C. Howland, was substituted for the cash payment of $5,500 provided for in the trust instrument.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-8\">\u201c 6. After the affirmance by this court of the decree of the Probate Court admitting said will to probate, an action at law was brought in the Superior Court, by the plaintiff as executrix of said will against the trustees named in the trust instrument to recover the fund, upon the ground that the will operated as an execution of said power of appointment, and therefore the exec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>utrix was entitled to the fund; and it was so held by this court on appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court in said action. <em>Howland </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>200 Mass. 204.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-5\">\u201cIt was said by the court, \u2018We are of opinion that the fund passes under the eighth clause if it does not pass under the seventh clause; \u2019 and also, \u2018 The question whether the fund passed under the seventh or eighth clause is a question which should be decided in a suit in which the legatees named in those two clauses are parties. Upon that question we express no opinion now.

It was said that in that action it was unnecessary to decide whether this execution was found in the seventh or eighth clause, since, if found in either the plaintiff in that action had made out a case; and it was further said that \u201c The question whether the trust fund passed under the seventh or eighth clause . . . should be decided in a suit in which the legatees named in those two clauses are parties,\u201d and the court declined at that time to express an opinion upon that question. This present suit calls for an adjudication upon the question thus left open in the preceding case.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>It becomes necessary to look into the whole will and the circumstances under which it was made. The case is before us upon certain agreed facts and evidence (so far as material), with the right in the court to draw all proper inferences of facts. The facts agreed and the proper inferences show that the circumstances were substantially as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The testatrix, Mary E. Howland, and her husband had not lived harmoniously together, and on or about February 25,1905, \u201c she voluntarily left his bed and board with the declared intention never to return thereto, although requested by him to do so,\u201d and on April 4,1905, she still living apart from her husband, the trust deed was duly executed. Ten days afterwards she exe\u00f3uted the will in question, and on March 25, 1907, she died. At the time she left her husband she had no money, securities or deposits, nor did she have any at the time of the execution of her will except $450 on deposit in a savings bank, which sum was part of the $500 paid to her under the second clause of the trust agreement at its date. She does not seem to have had any issue living at the time the will was made. Nor is it shown that at that time she had any near relative except her sister Jessie E. Corson named in the will. It does not appear that she had resumed marital relations with her husband. It fairly may be inferred that she had some real estate, but the value of it does not appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Thus comparatively alone in the world and apparently not possessing much property except her interest under the trust agreement, she proceeds within ten days after the date of the agreement to make her will. \u2022 She directs that the expenses of her funeral, cremation and burial shall be paid from her estate. In the second clause she gives to her sister Jessie as specific legacies \u201c the various articles which I have received from her as gifts and which shall be possessed by me at my decease,\u201d and by the third clause, her right in a burial lot. In the fourth clause she gives to her friend Helen D. Howland, as specific legacies, \u201c the various articles which I have received from her as gifts and which shall be possessed by me at my decease.\u201d In the fifth clause she gives to her cousin Susan A. Gilbert, \u201cas specific legacies, such articles of personal property belonging to me, not including money or articles of jewelry which may be upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>premises wherein she lives at my decease, and also my wearing apparel but not including articles of jewelry, wherever such apparel may be at my decease.\u201d In the sixth item she gives to her friend Lucy G. Booth as specific legacies, \u201c the various articles which I have received from her as gifts,\u201d and also one of the two diamond rings of the testatrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Up to this time she has provided for the payment of her just debts, funeral and burial expenses, and for the delivery to her friends of certain articles specifically named. Her mind comes now to the consideration of what shall be done with the rest of her estate. While the disposition is contained in clauses separately numbered as the seventh and eighth, we are of opinion that the residuary character is applicable to both, and that in substance and legal effect they form together the real residuary clause intended by the testator. She had finished the enumeration of specific articles. There was something more to be disposed of, consisting of the money in the bank and the money securities in the trust fund over which she had the power of appointment on the one hand and such articles of personal property as had not been specifically bequeathed or designated to be held in trust, together with some real estate, on the other. She proceeds to divide the residue into two parts, one of which, namely, the \u201c money securities and deposits,\u201d she puts in trust for the life of her cousin Susan, with remainder to her sister Jessie, and the other part, namely, the articles of personal property, with her real estate, she gives to her sister Jessie. The phrase \u201carticles of personal property,\u201d found in the eighth clause, is very inappropriate to designate the money in the bank and the trust fund, while the phrase \u201cthe remainder of the money securities or deposits,\u201d found in the seventh clause, describes the money in the bank and the trust property with substantial precision. In each clause the personal property therein bequeathed is described as belonging to the testator\u2019s estate. It already has been decided by this court that it sufficiently appears that the language of the will, considered in the light of the circumstances under which it was made, indicates the clear intention of the testatrix to execute her power under the trust deed. Upon further consideration of the case we think, as before stated, that both clauses are part of one and the same residuary clause, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>that, as thus construed, the residuary characteristic is as applicable to the particular kind of property named in the seventh as to that named in the eighth clause;- and that in each appears the intent of the testatrix to exercise the power given to her under the trust deed so far as- material to the kind of property therein described. It follows that- by the will the net income of the fund created by the trust agreement was to be paid to her cousin Susan A. Gilbert for her own personal use and free from all interference of her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">It appears that Susan\u2019s interest in the fund has been assigned to Barker C. Howland, who was the husband of the testatrix; and we do not understand that the validity of that assignment is contested. It follows that the plaintiff as executrix and trustee is to hold the fund in trust to pay the net income to Barker C. Howland, during the life- of Susan A. Gilbert, and upon the death of Susan to pay over the fund to the sister, Jessie E. Corson, her heirs, or assigns,</p>\n<p id=\"b168-18\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
