The evidence showed delay on the part of the complainant in informing her mother of the acts of the defendant. In the course of the complainant\u2019s examination, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>district attorney asked her what the defendant\u2019s wife said to her the next day after the crime was committed, in the absence of the defendant. The defendant objected. The judge over-the objection, and the defendant excepted. The complainant was allowed to testify that the defendant\u2019s wife said to her that if she did not keep still about what the defendant had done to her the defendant\u2019s wife would leave her place and would work no more for the complainant\u2019s mother.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AEVP\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AxN\">P. <em>J. </em>Moore, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ati\"><em>S.

While the conversation which took place between the defendant\u2019s wife and the complainant was not admissible as evidence of any fact, or even of the good faith of the wife in making the threat therein contained, yet it was admissible as tending to explain the delay of the complainant in making her complaint. This is too plain to require discussion or the citation of authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"A9G\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
