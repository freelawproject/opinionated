Apthorp died on March 4, 1908, and the defendant John V. Apthorp, her husband, survived her. The total net income of the trust (not deducting the amounts of interest on said mortgages) for the period beginning January 1,1908, and ending March 4,1908, was, approximately, $11,166, of which the proportionate share of said Mary S.. Apthorp would amount to approximately $6,987.60. The mortgage interest upon the sum of $122,500 amounted, for the period from December 8, 1907, to March 4, 1908, to the sum of $1,156.94. Of the $1,000 sinking fund, the proportionate amount to be charged against the period from January 1,1908, to March 4, 1908, the date of the decease of Mary S. Apthorp, if that charge was to be apportioned, was, approximately, $261.11.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-8\">The instructions asked for by the plaintiffs were: (a) whether the net income of the trust estate was to be apportioned as of March 4, 1908, the date of the decease of Mary S. Apthorp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>(5) upon, what interests was the amount of interest upon the mortgages of $122,500 up to March 4, 1908, the date of the decease of Mary S. Apthorp, to be charged, and in what proportions ; and <em>(e) </em>in the event that such income was to be apportioned as of March 4, 1908, what proportion, if any, of $1,000 to be set aside annually as a sinking fund was to be charged against the estate of Mary S. Apthorp.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-5\">Other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-6\">The case was heard by Sheldon, J., who ordered a decree to be entered, instructing the plaintiffs that that part of the net income of the trust estate which was payable to Mary S. Apthorp should be apportioned as of March 4, 1908, the date of her decease, and that the amount which was payable to her up to that time, after making the deductions provided for by the trust deed, ought to be paid to the administrator of her estate, proportionate to the period from January 1, 1908, to the date of her decease; and that the interest upon $122,500 and the charge of $1,000 for a sinking fund should be apportioned in the same way, and the amount of -these charges from January 1, 1908, to the time of her decease should be charged against and deducted from the amount of income payable to her as aforesaid ; and that the net balance remaining should be paid to the administrator of her estate. At the request of the defendant Lucy Alsop Thomas, the presiding justice reported the case for determination by the full court such decree to be entered as law and justice might require.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b274-7\"><em>I.

Apthorp, the beneficiary for life, either had received or were entitled to receive as due and payable although not yet collected a sum representing a quarter of the annual income from the estate. But, her death having occurred shortly before the day fixed by them for quarterly payments, the succeeding beneficiary contends that no part of this amount is payable to her administrator. We are of opinion that this position cannot be maintained. In the plan of distribution Mrs. Apthorp received nine fifteenths of the net income, but instead of absolutely fixing the times of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>payment, paragraph 29 provides, that payments \u201c shall be made quarterly or oftener at the convenience of the trustees.\u201d If it is also provided, that the quarter days for payment as established by them are to be considered as the dates of distribution in determining the persons who are entitled to the income, the periods would still be movable as they might decide, although they must pay from time to time during the year. If this paragraph is read in connection with paragraph 27, whereby one third of the entire net income is to be paid to her for life, it is reasonably plain that the principal purpose as to income was to provide for her maintenance, especially as she had contributed to the trust estate not only her title in fee acquired by inheritance from her deceased sons, but her right to dower in the premises. The necessity of support being manifestly implied, it was not intended that, if death intervened before the end of the period fixed by the trustees, she should lose the benefit conferred and be cut off from a means of subsistence, even if the allowance could not be anticipated by orders drawn on them, or whether it could have been reached by a creditor\u2019s bill in payment of her debts. It furthermore may be said, that the closing sentence of this clause was not intended to limit the rights of the beneficiaries for life as between themselves and the remaindermen but only, as between themselves and any persons who may claim under them upon orders or assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The defendant urges that the decision in <em>Hemenway </em>v. <em>Hemenway, </em>171 Mass. 42, is decisive against this view. But the cases are clearly distinguishable. In <em>Hemenway </em>v. <em>Hemenway, </em>the testator directed that the income should be paid in equal semiannual payments, \u201c the first payment thereof to be made at the end of six months next after my death ... to such of the said four persons, namely, my wife and three children, as may be living at the time of payment,\u201d and, the right given having been expressly made dependent upon the times of payment, it was held to have been limited to those in existence on the dates fixed. In the case at bar, the income as we have said was for the life of Mrs. Apthorp, and must be treated as accruing from day to day, although the trustees, who are authorized to pay it oftener, may for their own convenience make the payments quarterly. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>income having been earned, even if at her death the whole had not been actually collected, should be apportioned as of that date, and the amount then coming to her, less the proportionate deductions for interest on the mortgage, and charges for the sinking fund called for by the deed, are to be paid to the administrator of her estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\">\n<em>jDecree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
