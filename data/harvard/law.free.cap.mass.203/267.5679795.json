There was a finding for the plaintiff and the case is here on exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">The contention mainly insisted upon is that the finding was not warranted by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">The action was brought to collect the balance due for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>board of two of the defendant\u2019s horses for the months of May, June, July and August, 1907.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\">It appeared that the plaintiff was the proprietor of a boarding stable. His son testified that he kept the books and looked after the business ; that in December, 1906, he met the defendant, who said to him that; he (Felton) was coming up to see him \u201c about boarding his horses,\u201d that he was not satisfied with the way they were kept; and he wanted to know the best price at which he (the witness) would take them. The son answered $20 a month for each horse. The defendant said that he would look the matter up and if he decided to make a change he would send the horses to the plaintiff\u2019s stable. That \u201c at a later date \u201d the horses, with some wagons and sleighs bearing the defendant\u2019s name, were brought there. They remained there until August 31 or September 1,1907, when they were taken away without notice. The plaintiff\u2019s son also testified that he knew the bakery where the horses were used, and that there was a sign on it bearing the defendant\u2019s name ; that monthly bills were all made out to the defendant and handed to the driver of the team; that the driver took them away, later brought the money in payment, and then took away the receipted bills. The son also testified that when the driver brought the money for the first month\u2019s board he (the son) asked him who was running the bakery ; that the driver said he did not know, and the son answered that he would give him (the driver) a receipt for the defendant, \u201cas he made the contract with me for the horses.\u201d The son further testified that the price of board was advanced to $22 a month on March 1, and a letter to that effect was written to the defendant by him, and \u201cmailed to F. L. Felton, Worcester, Mass. \u201d; and that he (the witness) never received any answer. The plaintiff himself testified that \u201c he had written Mr. Felton a letter at the time of the second advance,\u201d in which he told him in substance that on account of the further advance in the price of hay and grain the price of board would be $23 a month. He also testified that \u201cright after\u201d the horses were taken away he went to the bakery \u201c and asked Felton\" to pay the bill and asked him why he took his horses away; that Felton said he had a private stable to keep them in; that he could not tell what he would do about that bill; that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>would have to think it over and see later; 6 that he would let me know in a few days about paying the bill \u2019; that Felton said something about Sanford was to have paid the bill; . . . that three or four days after the first conversation Felton told him that he had counselled [consulted] with his attorney and had decided not to pay the bill; 61 told Felton that we knew nobody else in the case but him; we have never held any one else responsible; that he held the contract with us for the keeping of the horses ; that we knew no one else; that all the bills were made to him and that the correspondence had been with him, and we should be obliged to collect the bill from him; I told him the horses were contracted in his name, sent there by his man and the bills made out to him; the money was paid as a credit to him and that I never looked at Sanford as anything but a manager of the bakery; Mr. Felton told me that he had let the place to Sanford and that Sanford was the man who should have paid all the bills for the board of the horses \u2019; that this was the first time he ever knew that Sanford was to pay for the board of the horses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\">The defendant\u2019s case was that in August, 1906, one Sanford bought from him the stock in trade of the bakery; that he let the store, machinery, fixtures, horses and wagons to Sanford; that he asked the plaintiff\u2019s son the price of board for the horses in behalf of Sanford and told him so at the time. The defendant introduced the testimony of the driver and of one Hull, who was the foreman of the plaintiff\u2019s stable until July of the year in question, that the plaintiff knew that Sanford was running the bakery and the horses as part of it when they came to the stable.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The case was a case of conflict in the evidence. The diffi-. culty with the defendant\u2019s argument is that he does not recognize the right of the judge to disbelieve all or any part of the defendant\u2019s testimony and to adopt one of two inconsistent statements testified to by the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The defendant asked the judge to rule: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> \u201c2. That if Hull, as the agent of the plaintiff, received the horses in the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>instance on the credit and for the account of Sanford, the plaintiff cannot recover unless Felton, after the horses were received by Doon, became legally responsible to pay for the board of the horses,\u201d and \u201c4. That the legal effect of the conversation between Doon, the son, and Felton at Clark\u2019s Block was not to constitute a contract between Doon, the plaintiff, and Felton, that would authorize Doon to charge the board of the horses to Felton, unless Felton actually sent the horses to Doon for board, or authorized them to be sent.\u201d It is stated in the judge\u2019s \u201c decision \u201d that he \u201c gave the defendant\u2019s second and fourth (law) requests, so far as they were applicable to the evidence.\u201d The defendant excepted \u201c to the modified ruling \u201d on the second and fourth requests and now asks that these exceptions be sustained, Doubtless what the judge meant by this modification was that he did not find the facts to be as stated in the requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The defendant asked the judge to rule: \u201c 3. That the act of the plaintiff in charging the board of the horses to Felton was unauthorized by Felton and cannot bind him.\u201d In the judge\u2019s decision it is stated: <em>\u201c </em>I excluded the books of the plaintiff on the question of the party liable, and did not consider them on that question. ... I denied the defendant\u2019s . . . third (law) request, unless it be held to ask for a ruling as above, in which case (or in any case) I gave the above ruling, viz.: that the entries in the plaintiff\u2019s books, made by the plaintiff, or under his authority, are not competent on the issue of the party liable.\u201d Again the judge without doubt meant that he recognized the correctness of the legal proposition contained in this request for a ruling, but he found as a fact that the act of the plaintiff in charging the board of the horses to the defendant was authorized by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The next exception argued by the defendant is to the introduction of the bills made against the defendant. This was admitted <em>de hene </em>on the statement of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel that he would offer evidence that they were \u201c brought home,\u201d by which we understand the judge to have meant that they were' sent to the defendant. The plaintiff failed to offer that evidence. The judge struck out the books in which the board had been charged to the defendant, although no motion to that effect seems to have been made. In his decision the judge states: \u201c I excluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>the books of the plaintiff on the question of the party liable, and did not consider them on that question.\u201d He doubtless would have struck out the bills also had he thought of them. It was proper for the judge to admit the evidence <em>de bene. </em>It was the duty of the defendant to ask to have it stricken out when the plaintiff failed to bring it home to the defendant. \u00a1Not having done so he has no ground of exception. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Johnson, 199 Mass. 55, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The defendant took an exception to the admission of evidence that during the time here in question the defendant\u2019s name was on the carts and sleighs and over the door of the bakery. When this evidence was offered the plaintiff disclaimed all attempt to hold the defendant on the ground that he was the person who was in fact carrying on this business. The fact that the defendant was holding himself out as the person carrying on the business was of importance in determining whether the plaintiff had a right to understand and did understand that the defendant was acting for himself in asking the price of board and whether the horses were sent to the plaintiff\u2019s stable by the defendant. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The defendant has argued that the letters as to the two advances made in the price of board were not admissible. But he did not object to them when they were offered in evidence. The fact that they might have been objected to is of no consequence. <em>Garfield &amp; Proctor Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Pennslyvania Coal &amp; Coke Co. </em>199 Mass. 22. <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Allyn, </em>200 Mass. 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">We have not discussed several other questions argued by the defendant, which were not raised by the exceptions taken at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-6\"> All of the requests of the defendant mentioned in the opinion were in writing under the heading \u201c Requests for Rulings of Law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
