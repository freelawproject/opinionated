The evidence of the defendant tended to show that the agent at no time asked the plaintiff to go to Canada to buy horses for the defendant. In his answer the defendant set up that the plaintiff\u2019s contract of service was illegal because it was made on the Lord\u2019s day. The presiding judge refused to rule that, if the services for which the plaintiff was seeking compensation were rendered in pursuance of an agreement made by the parties on the Lord\u2019s day, the plaintiff could not recover, and charged the jury on that question that they were to \u201c leave out all that took place on Sunday, because that does not bind anybody, and say whether there was enough done upon other days, week days, so as to show that this plaintiff was requested to . . . perform this service and requested under such circumstances that he was fairly entitled to receive pay.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that there was no error in the rulings or in the charge.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b65-9\">Under a statement in a bill of exceptions, \u201c To all of this portion of the charge the defendant duly excepted,\u201d referring to a portion of the charge to the jury covering five quarto pages, the contention that the tone of the portion of the charge referred to tended to influence the jury in favor of the plaintiff, is not open to the defendant.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-10\">Contract for services in purchasing horses for the defendant.

Jenckes replied, the defendant.\u201d Later, \u201c on a Tuesday,\u201d Jenckes asked the plaintiff to go \u201c about July 5th.\u201d The plaintiff went at once to Montreal and stayed there from a Tuesday night until the morning of the second Sunday following, devoting himself meanwhile to buying horses for the defendant. That he bought thirty-one horses in Montreal. That Jenckes arrived four' days after he did and went around with him somewhat. That Jenckes and the plaintiff agreed that it was no use buying the rest of the horses in Canada and that Jenckes told him to buy the rest in Boston. That in pursuance of that request he bought forty-five horses for the defendant at Harris\u2019s stable in Boston.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Jenckes testified that he never asked the plaintiff to go to Canada; that the plaintiff went there on his own account and that he happened to be in Montreal at the same time and went around with the plaintiff. That he never asked the plaintiff to buy horses for the defendant in Boston, but the plaintiff asked him (Jenckes) as a favor to him (the plaintiff) to buy at Harris\u2019s stable the horses he was buying for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">After the plaintiff\u2019s evidence was in, the defendant was allowed to amend its answer by adding that if a contract was made it was made on Sunday and was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The defendant asked for the following rulings;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">\u201c1. On all the evidence the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>\u201c 15. If the contract made by the defendant with the plaintiff was made on Sunday, the plaintiff cannot recover for any breach thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-3\">\u201c16. If an agreement was made between the plaintiff and Jenckes, representing the defendant, and assented to by both parties on Sunday, and the services, if any, later rendered by the plaintiff were all rendered under and in pursuance of this agreement made and assented to by both parties on Sunday, and there was no later agreement made or assented to by either party, the plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">The fifteenth and sixteenth rulings requested were correct as abstract propositions of law. But there was no evidence which called for their being given. Indeed it may be doubted whether it would have been proper to give them on the evidence in the case at bar. All that the plaintiff testified to as having happened on Sunday was that he told the defendant\u2019s agent that he could go to Canada and the plaintiff asked the defendant\u2019s agent who was to pay him. He did not testify that in this Sunday conversation he agreed to go to Canada. He testified that on a subsequent week day the defendant\u2019s agent asked him to go and he went. The presiding judge instructed the jury in accordance with <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Rea, </em>103 Mass. 188.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The only doubt is whether the instructions given were not more favorable to the defendant than the evidence called for.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The defendant also took an exception to that portion of the charge which dealt with the defens\u00e9 that the contract was made on Sunday. That portion of the charge covers nearly .five quarto pages. It is stated in the bill of exceptions that \u201c To all of this portion of the charge the defendant duly excepted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The defendant now undertakes to support that exception by contending that the tone of a portion of this charge tended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>influence the jury in favor of the plaintiff. But under a general exception that point is not open to the defendant. The case comes within cases like <em>Leverone </em>v. <em>Arancio, </em>179 Mass. 439; <em>Nestor </em>v. <em>Fall </em>River, 183 Mass. 265; <em>Savage </em>v. <em>Marlborough Street Railway, </em>186 Mass. 203; <em>Zamore </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>198 Mass. 594. If the defendant wished to object to the charge on that ground it should have so stated, as was in fact done by counsel for the excepting party in <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Kidd, </em>197 Mass. 256. We do not intimate that this portion of the charge was open to that objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b66-8\"> The bill of exceptions stated that the only ground on which it is proposed to argue that the first ruling requested should have been given was that the original contract, if any, was void because in violation of the statutes relating to the Lord\u2019s day and that all things for which recovery was sought were done under a contract illegal and void because in violation of the statutes relating to the Lord\u2019s day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b67-7\"> The judge\u2019s charge on this point was in part as follows: \u201c Now, leave out all that took place on Sunday, because that does not bind anybody, and say whether there was enough done upon other days, week days, so as to show that this plaintiff was requested to go up there and perform this service and requested under such circumstances that he was fairly entitled to receive pay; and if so, then he is entitled to receive a fair compensation, what is a reasonable sum for such services rendered by a man of his experience in the community for that kind of business. \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
