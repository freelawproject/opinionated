Hadnot claims that the district court erred in holding the arbitration provision of his employment contract valid and enforceable after striking the ban on the arbitrator\u2019s authority to award exemplary and punitive damages as applied to Hadnot\u2019s Title VII claim. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">\n<em>I. Facts and Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">Hadnot filed suit in the district court against Defendant-Appellee Bay, Ltd. (\u201cBay\u201d) and three of his former coworkers, alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress by all defendants and racial discrimination in violation of Title VII by Bay. Hadnot and Bay had entered into an employment agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) containing an arbitration provision. The district court compelled arbitration after invalidating a restriction in the arbitration provision that excludes punitive and exemplary damages from the kinds of damages that the arbitrator is authorized to award. Hadnot timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-13\">\n<em>II. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b496-14\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-15\">We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion to compel arbitration <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-16\">B. <em>Test for Enforceability of Arbitration Provision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-18\">Courts adjudicating a motion to compel arbitration engage in a two-step process. First, the court asks \u201cwhether the parties agreed to arbitrate [the] dispute.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If this question is answered in the affirmative, the court asks \u201cwhether legal constraints external to the parties\u2019 agreement foreclosed the arbitration\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the dispute. The district court concluded that the Agreement was enforceable \u2014 with the exception of its prohibition of the arbitrator\u2019s awarding exemplary and punitive damages \u2014 and that Hadnot\u2019s claims fell within its scope. We now turn to Hadnot\u2019s contentions on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-19\">C. <em>Consideration</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-20\">Hadnot asserts that, under Texas law, the Agreement is unsupported by valid consideration. He contends that the only possible consideration on the part of Bay is \u201cthe consideration of [Hadnot\u2019s] applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>tion for employment, the offer of at will employment, and the continuation of at will employment.\u201d Hadnot argues that two recent Texas Supreme Court cases, <em>Light v. Centel Cellular </em>Company<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and <em>In Re Halliburton Company and Brown &amp; Root Energy Services,</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>stand for the proposition that such factors cannot constitute consideration in an at-will employment context. The facts of <em>Light </em>and <em>In Re Halliburton </em>distinguish them from the instant case, hpwever; and we find the presence of valid Texas consideration on th\u00e9 part of Bay.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\"><em>Light, </em>dealt with a covenant not to compete. In its discussion of whether there was an \u201cotherwise enforceable agreement\u201d to which the covenant not to compete was ancillary, the Supreme Court of Texas noted that \u201c[Consideration for a promise, by either the employee or the employer in an at-will employment, cannot be dependent on a period of continued employment.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court reasoned that a promise \u201cthat depends on an additional period of employment is illusory because it is conditioned upon something that is exclusively within the control of the promisor.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In attempting to apply this reasoning to his own case, Hadnot urges that the Agreement\u2019s arbitration provision is likewise unsupported by valid consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The <em>Light </em>court, however, discussed invalidity of consideration in the context of a <em>\u201cperiod of continued </em>employment,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> using the promise of a raise to an at-will employee as an example (illusory because the promisor can terminate employment before giving the raise).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In contrast, the consideration here \u2014 the combination of Hadnot\u2019s application and Bay\u2019s responding offer of employment \u2014 is in no way dependent on a period of continued employment in the context of a covenant to arbitrate claims that arise from the period of actual employment, regardless of how long it might continue. Here, the application, offer, and acceptance all occurred at the \u201cfront end\u201d of the employment relationship. None is dependent on <em>continued </em>employment, and none is illusory, because any eventual arbitration will, of necessity, relate to conduct that occurred during the term of employment \u2014 even if only a day or so \u2014 unlike proscribed competition which by definition can occur only after employment terminates.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">This was exactly the distinction made by the court in <em>In Re Halliburton: </em>\u201c[In] contrast [to <em>Light</em>], the [Halliburton Dispute Resolution] Program is not <em>dependent </em>on continuing employment. Instead, it was <em>accepted </em>by the employee\u2019s continuing employment.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">The instant situation is analogous to <em>In Re Halliburton, </em>not <em>Light. </em>The Agreement was formed when Hadnot signed the document and began work. Even though Bay could terminate Hadnot at any time thereafter, the fact remains that Bay had already performed, viz., accepted Hadnot\u2019s job application, in exchange for Hadnot\u2019s agreement to arbitrate any claims arising out of any period of employment \u2014 even one day. The <em>In Re Halliburton </em>court\u2019s language accurately sums up the situation presently before us: \u201cEven if [the] employment had ended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>shortly thereafter, the promise to arbitrate would have been binding and enforceable.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">D. <em>Sequence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Hadnot also claims that he had been offered the job prior to signing the Agreement, so that Bay\u2019s acceptance of his job application and offer of employment can only be past consideration, if they are consideration at all.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The appropriate question, however, is whether Bay would have considered Hadnot\u2019s application and offered him employment had he refused to sign the Agreement, not whether Bay insisted that he sign the moment that he walked through the door. It is clear that Bay\u2019s offer of employment was contingent on Hadnot\u2019s signing the Agreement. Indeed, the Agreement itself specifies that Bay\u2019s acceptance of Hadnot\u2019s job application and any offer of employment is \u201c[i]n exchange for\u201d the willingness of the prospective employee to arbitrate all employment disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">E. <em>Severability of the Punitive Damages Clause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Hadnot also argues that the entire arbitration provision is void because the restriction of the arbitrator\u2019s power proscribing any award of exemplary and punitive damages \u2014 which is unlawful in the context of his Title VII claim<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u2014 is integral to the overall contract of employment and therefore cannot be severed. We disagree. The purpose of the arbitration provision is to settle any and all disputes arising out of the employment relationship in an arbitral forum rather than a court of law. Even with its unlawful limitation on the types or permissible damage awards lifted, so that the decision maker is free to address punitive damages, the arbitration clause remains capable of achieving this goal. In fact, the lifting of that illegal restriction enhances the ability of the arbitration provision to function fully and adequately under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">As a potential arbitrator in this case is now authorized to award punitive damages, as well as compensatory damages, Hadnot\u2019s rights under Title VII are fully protected. The severing of such a prohibition or restriction serves to expand the scope of arbitration rather than reduce or impair it, thereby freeing that provision to fulfill its intended function.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">\n<em>III. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b498-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s order voiding the prohibition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>awarding punitive damages and compelling arbitration is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-10\">. <em>See Webb v.

Hadnot argues for the first time in his reply brief that the Agreement was substantively unconscionable. As Hadnot failed to raise that argument in his initial appellate brief, we decline to consider it here. <em>See Cinel v. Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1345 (5th Cir.1994) (\"An appellant abandons all issues not raised and argued in its <em>initial </em>brief on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b497-7\">. 883 S.W.2d 642 (Tex.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b497-8\">. 80 S.W.3d 566 (Tex.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b497-9\">. <em>Light, </em>883 S.W.2d at 644.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b497-10\">. <em>Light, </em>883 S.W.2d at 645 n. 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b497-14\">. <em>Light, </em>883 S.W.2d at 644 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b497-15\">. <em>Light, </em>883 S.W.2d at 645 n. 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b497-16\">. <em>In Re Halliburton, </em>80 S.W.3d at 569.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b498-8\">. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b498-9\">. Although Hadnot claims he was \"told that [he] had the job before [signing] any papers,\u201d Bay asserts that Hadnot executed the Agreement on two occasions, both on submission of his application and after accepting the offer of employment. The record supports Bay: There are two signed copies of the Agreement in the record, respectively dated December 28th and 29th, 2000, placing both before Hadnot's employment start date, which he has indicated was \"[o]n or about January 2001.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b498-14\">. As the district court correctly noted, the Agreement's ban on punitive and exemplary damages is unenforceable in a Title VII case. The Supreme Court has held: \"By agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim, a party does not forego the substantive rights afforded by the statute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral, rather than a judicial, forum.\u201d <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 614, 628, 105 S.Ct. 3346, 87 L.Ed.2d 444 (1985). Because Title VII provides for statutory punitive damages, the district court found the ban on such damages unenforceable. We agree with that determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
