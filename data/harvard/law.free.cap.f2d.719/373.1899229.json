We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-23\">The Internal Revenue Service mailed two notices of deficiency to taxpayers Robert and Lillie Myles, plaintiffs in this action, on June 22, 1982, by certified mail. Plaintiffs responded by filing a petition with the tax court. Petitions must be filed or, if mailed, postmarked within ninety days of the mailing of the notice of deficiency, <em>see </em>26 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 6213; 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7502. This ninety-day limit was clearly indicated on the face of the deficiency notice. The ninetieth day after the mailing of the notice was Monday, September 20, 1982. Plaintiffs\u2019 petition was postmarked September 21, 1982, and was received and filed by the Tax Court on September 22, 1982. Thus, the taxpayers were one day late.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 contend that the Tax Court accepted jurisdiction by accepting the $60 filing fee which was paid by a money order dated September 17,1982. Although dated September 17, the money order was received with the petition. The postmark date is the earliest date which can be considered for timeliness purposes. The Tax Court correctly dismissed the petition. The only avenue open to taxpayers to contest the deficiency notice is to file suit for refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
