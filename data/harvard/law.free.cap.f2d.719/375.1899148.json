The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial, and appellant suggests three bases for reversal on appeal. First, because appellant\u2019s co-conspirators/co-defendants agreed \u201cto testify truthfully\u201d against defendant in exchange for more lenient treatment, appellant contends that the trial court erred in admitting the terms of the plea bargain agreement into evidence. Secondly, appellant contends that certain statements he made to a government agent during interrogation amounted to a confession, and that the trial court erred in failing to hold a voluntariness hearing before admitting the agent\u2019s testimony regarding those statements. Finally, because certain portions of tape-recorded testimony played back to the jury at its request during deliberation were inaudible, appellant argues that the trial judge abused his discretion in permitting the jury to rehear such testimony. The sole issue is whether any of these contentions constitute reversible error. Because we find that they do not, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b446-16\">A grand jury returned an indictment against defendant charging conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, \u00a7 2312, and \u00a7 2313, and two substantive violations under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2313, for his involvement with two co-defendants/eo-conspirators in the theft, transportation, concealment, and disposition of stolen motor vehicles. Both co-conspirators/co-defendants entered guilty pleas pursuant to plea bargain agreements. Under the terms of his agreement, co-defendant Liles agreed to testify against defendant. During the government\u2019s direct examination of Liles, defendant objected to the question, \u201cas a part of the agreement between the Government and yourself, were you also told that you had to testify truthfully and that you were still subject, to a perjury charge if you testified falsely?\u201d The trial court overruled the objection and the witness answered affirmatively. Liles testified that he and the defendant had entered a business arrangement whereby Liles stole motor vehicles in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and delivered them to Birmingham, Alabama. Several vehicles were delivered to Birmingham under this arrangement during late 1980 and early 1981, and defendant paid Liles $500 per vehicle. Jimmy Hightower, a co-defendant who received a probationary sentence in exchange for his guilty plea, testified that defendant paid Hightower $50 per vehicle to drive two Corvettes from Birmingham to Riverside, Alabama, where defendant received the stolen vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-17\">As additional proof of defendant\u2019s guilt, the government attempted to prove that a tape-recorded inculpatory phone call made by a government agent to a caller who had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>identified himself as \u201cSilver\u201d was actually made to the defendant. As part of the evidence introduced to prove that defendant Sims was \u201cSilver,\u201d the government attempted to link defendant to \u201cSilver\u2019s\u201d telephone number: 526-8746. The government established this link through the testimony of FBI Agent Roberts. Agent Roberts testified that Sims told him during a post-arrest interview that defendant\u2019s phone number was 526-8746.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Following Agent Roberts\u2019 testimony, and at the first opportunity to do so out of the jury\u2019s presence, defendant moved for a mistrial. Defendant contended that because information regarding defendant\u2019s telephone number was inculpatory, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3501 required the prosecution to afford the court an opportunity to determine the voluntariness of defendant\u2019s statement to Agent Roberts before presenting the agent\u2019s testimony to the jury. The defense, however, made no allegations that the statement was in fact involuntary, and the court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">All of the testimony presented in this case was electronically recorded pursuant to an experimental program directed by the Federal Judicial Center and authorized by Congress in the Federal Court Improvement Act of 1982 (FCIA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(b). During deliberations, the jury asked to hear the recorded testimony of co-defendants Liles and Hightower. As recorded, certain portions of co-defendant Liles\u2019 direct examination were inaudible. Specifically, the electronic equipment failed to record clearly the prosecutor\u2019s question concerning the terms of Liles\u2019 plea bargain agreement and Liles\u2019 response concerning both the agreement and his criminal record. Although the court expressed some concern about placing undue emphasis on the co-defendants\u2019 testimony, the trial judge, after listening to the testimony and finding that the recording was audible, replayed both the direct and cross-examination of the co-defendants to the jury. The jury returned a guilty verdict on Count Three, and the defendant moved for a new trial. The court denied the motion, and the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">THE MERITS</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">I. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">Appellant contends that by introducing the terms of Liles\u2019 plea bargain agreement, the government improperly vouched for the veracity of the government witness. Liles\u2019 credibility was an important element of the defendant\u2019s case. Hence, appellant suggests that the government attempted improperly to bolster Liles\u2019 credibility by revealing on direct examination that, as part of the plea bargain agreement, Liles agreed \u201cto testify truthfully and that [he was] still subject to a perjury charge if [he] testified falsely,\u201d and by referring to that agreement during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">\u201cAttempts to bolster a witness by vouching for his credibility are normally improper and error.\u201d <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>547 F.2d 863, 869 (5th Cir.1977). The test for improper vouching is whether the jury could reasonably believe that the prosecutor was indicating a personal belief in the witness\u2019 credibility. <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>618 F.2d 530, 537 (9th Cir.1980) (citing <em>Ellis, </em>supra). This test may be satisfied in two ways. First, the prosecution may place the prestige of the government behind the witness, by making explicit personal assurances of the witness\u2019 veracity. <em>See United States v. Lamerson, </em>457 F.2d 371, 372 (5th Cir.1972); <em>Gradsky </em>v. <em>United States, </em>373 F.2d 706, 709-10 (5th Cir.1967). Secondly, a prosecutor may implicitly vouch for the witness\u2019 veracity by indicating that information not presented to the jury supports the testimony. <em>See United States v. Brooklier, </em>685 F.2d 1208, 1218 (9th Cir.1982) (explaining <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>618 F.2d 530 (9th Cir.1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">In the instant case, nothing in the record indicates that the Assistant United States Attorney personally assured the veracity of Liles, as was the situation in <em>Lamerson, supra, </em>and <em>Gradsky, supra. </em>In fact, the prosecution suggested that Liles\u2019 testimony was very circumspect, and that the jury should examine it closely. Record at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>236. Therefore, the propriety of the prosecutor\u2019s conduct in this case depends upon whether the introduction and subsequent reference to Liles\u2019 immunity agreement constitutes an implied voucher.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Suggesting that the prosecutor impliedly vouched for Liles\u2019 veracity, the defendant argues that the introduction of the immunity agreement contains hearsay evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao4\">BY MR. JONES:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">Q. Mr. Liles, were you also \u2014 as part of the agreement between the Government and yourself, were you also told that you had to testify truthfully and that you were still subject to a perjury charge if you testified falsely?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">MR. CALLAHAN: I object, if it please the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">THE COURT: Overrule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">A. Yes, I was.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">T. 68. In his brief, defendant argues that this colloquy refers to matters not presented to the jury, saying: \u201cHere the error is further aggravated because the witness was not asked whether he had agreed to testify truthfully as a part of the plea bargain agreement but whether or not someone had told him that he had to do that.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 14-15. This argument is specious. It is clear that Liles agreed to testify truthfully, although the prosecutor\u2019s question is inartful. There is nothing here to support appellant\u2019s argument that the prosecutor was suggesting to the jury that he was aware of information not presented to the jury which would tend to support the truthfulness of Liles\u2019 testimony. <em>See Lamerson, supra, </em>457 F.2d at 372 (when prosecutor\u2019s statement could be construed by the jury as implying that he has additional reasons for knowing a witness\u2019 veracity, \u201cwhich reasons are not known to the jury, such comment is no longer mere indiscretion but constitutes reversible error\u201d). Nor was the prosecution\u2019s reference to the agreement during closing argument improper vouching. Certainly, the prosecutor\u2019s statement that Liles \u201chad to testify as to the truth\u201d was indiscreet. Record at 248. This indiscretion, however, is not reversible error. The prosecutor made the jury fully aware of the sole reason Liles had to testify truthfully: \u201che could still be prosecuted for perjury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the trial judge sufficiently dispelled any suggestion of vouching by instructing that \u201cthe jury should keep in mind that [testimony given pursuant to an immunity agreement] is always to be received with caution and weighed with great care.\u201d Record at 205. <em>See Brooklier, supra, </em>685 F.2d at 1219; <em>United States v. Patterson, </em>644 F.2d 890, 899 (1st Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">II. Voluntariness Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">Appellant asserts that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3501 required the trial court to hold a voluntariness hearing, outside the jury\u2019s presence, before admitting Agent Roberts\u2019 testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s address and telephone number furnished by the defendant in a post-arrest interview. The test to determine the admissibility of a confession is a two-part inquiry. First, the court considers whether the government has complied with the <em>Miranda </em>requirements. Upon finding compliance with <em>Miranda, </em>the court then rules on the confession\u2019s voluntariness. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Gresham, </em>585 F.2d 103, 108 (5th Cir.1978) (compliance with <em>Miranda </em>does not dispose of the question whether a separate voluntariness hearing should have been granted by the court); W. Ringel, 2 <em>Searches &amp; Seizures, Arrests and Confessions, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 24.5, 30.2 (2d ed. 1981). In this case, we need not reach the second level of inquiry. We have held that requesting \u201croutine\u201d information for booking purposes is not an interrogation under <em>Miranda, </em>even though that information turns out to be incriminating. <em>See United States v. Menichino, </em>497 F.2d 935, 941 n. 3 (5th Cir.1974). <em>See also United States ex rel. Hines v. LaVallee, </em>521 F.2d 1109, 1113 (2d Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 1090, 96 S.Ct. 884, 47 L.Ed.2d 101 (1976); <em>Varner v. State, </em>418 So.2d 961, 962 (Ala.Cr.App.1982); W. Ringel, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 27.4(b). Because a potential criminal defendant\u2019s protection from coerced confession under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3501 is no broader than that offered by the <em>Miranda </em>line of cases, <em>see United States v. White, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>417 F.2d 89, 92 (2d Cir.1969), we find that a government agent\u2019s eliciting biographical information, such as an address and telephone number, for the non-interrogative purpose of identification is not a confession under \u00a7 3501(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Parenthetically, we note that Agent Roberts testified that prior to his interview of Sims he had driven to his home and identified one of the stolen vehicles. Counsel did not object and moved to strike the evidence about the telephone, but later moved for a mistrial on the ground there was no voluntariness hearing. The court\u2019s failure to grant a mistrial could not be error under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">III. Replay of Experimental Tape Recording</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">As amended by the FCIA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(b) now provides that all court proceedings \u201cshall be recorded verbatim by shorthand, mechanical means, electronic sound recording, or any other method.... \u201d As permitted by \u00a7 753, the court in the instant case electronically recorded the testimony in accordance with an experiment developed by the Federal Judicial Center. The appellant\u2019s objections stem from the trial court\u2019s decision to replay certain portions of the electronically recorded testimony to the jury, upon its request, during deliberation. Resolution of the legal issues presented in this appeal, however, is not altered by the novel setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">A trial judge has broad discretion in responding to a jury request that certain evidence be reread. <em>United States v. Alfonso, </em>552 F.2d 605 (5th Cir.1977); <em>rehearing denied, </em>554 F.2d 1065 (5th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 857, 98 S.Ct. 179, 54 L.Ed.2d 129 (1977). We hold that the same degree of discretion applies to a judge\u2019s decision to replay tape-recorded testimony for two reasons. First, \u00a7 753(b) provides that all means of recording proceedings shall be \u201csubject to the discretion and approval of the judge,\u201d and does not differentiate based upon the type of recording method selected. Secondly, in <em>United States v. Zepeda-Santana, </em>569 F.2d 1386 (5th Cir.1978), this court, in deciding whether the trial judge had erred in replaying a tape-recorded confession to the jury, said \u201c[w]e see no difference between allowing a jury to take a written confession into the jury room with them, ... and allowing the jury to replay a tape that was already in evidence and which they had already heard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1391. Likewise, we see no difference in evaluating the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion in rereading the transcribed testimony or replaying tape-recorded proceedings to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">The only significant areas of the tape recordings that the court reporter considered inaudible concerned impeaching testimony elicited on direct examination. Both the terms of the immunity agreement and the witness\u2019 prior criminal record, however, were covered in detail on cross-examination. The cross-examination was also played for the jury. Therefore, the defendant has failed to show sufficient evidence to demonstrate the trial court\u2019s abuse of discretion in allowing the jury to hear the recorded testimony. <em>Cf. United States v. Mendoza, </em>574 F.2d 1373, 1378 (5th Cir.1978) (tape recordings that are partially inaudible are not inadmissible unless these portions \u201care so substantial as to render the recording as a whole untrustworthy,\u201d a determination that \u201cis left to the sound discretion of the trial judge\u201d). Appellant\u2019s final contentions that the replaying of the government witness\u2019 testimony to the jury unduly emphasized that evidence and that defendant was not afforded an opportunity to object to the electronic recording equipment are also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">The appellant\u2019s conviction on Count Three of the indictment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
