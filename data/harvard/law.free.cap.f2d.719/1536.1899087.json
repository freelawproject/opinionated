The order appealed from denies appellants\u2019 application, filed in both cases, for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b1607-18\">In April 1982, B. &amp; J. Music, Inc., and H. Dyke N. Spear, Jr. d/b/a Broadway Productions, filed an action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division. This action sought declaratory and injunctive relief preventing Hinson McAuliffe, Solicitor General of the State Court of Fulton County, from making any arrests or taking any actions to enforce any criminal laws of the State of Georgia with respect to performances of the theatrical production \u201cOh! Calcutta!\u201d At a hearing held on the motion for temporary restraining order Solicitor McAuliffe agreed not to make any arrest for performances in the play. Consequently, the motion for temporary restraining order was denied as moot and ruling upon the declaratory relief requested was deferred. However, Solicitor McAuliffe advised the district court that he would instead file a civil action seeking to have the play enjoined as a public nuisance under the laws of the State of Georgia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Later that same day, the suit was filed in the Superior Court of Fulton County seeking to have the play declared obscene and enjoined as a public nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1607-19\">This public nuisance action was removed to federal court in April 1982. At a hearing on the motion the district court denied McAuliffe\u2019s motion to remand the action to state court, finding that the producers had properly removed the case to federal court. The district court further denied McAuliffe\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order to enjoin further performances of the play on the grounds that the government had failed to demonstrate a substantial like<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1538\">*1538</page-number>lihood of success on the merits and that the public interest would best be served by permitting the play to be performed as scheduled. An order was entered accordingly. The 1982 Atlanta performances of \u201cOh! Calcutta!\u201d were completed without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1608-4\">In May 1982, the producers filed an amendment to their complaint in the federal injunction action alleging a claim for damages under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983. On the same day the producers filed an answer and counterclaim in the public nuisance action. The counterclaim alleged the same violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and the 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 claims that formed the basis for the producers\u2019 federal injunction action. Solicitor General McAuliffe subsequently moved to dismiss the producers\u2019 complaint in the federal injunction action and, also, to dismiss the producers\u2019 counterclaim in the public nuisance action. However, these motions were never ruled upon by the district court inasmuch as the parties agreed in open court in October 1982 to a voluntary dismissal of the complaint in the federal injunction action and the complaint and counterclaim in the public nuisance action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1608-5\">In October 1982, the producers filed their motion for award of attorney\u2019s fees and taxing of costs in both actions, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1988. The district court entered an order denying the motions. These appeals ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1608-6\">Section 1988 provides that \u201cin any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 of [Title 42] ... the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the cost.\u201d While the district court has discretion in determining whether a party should receive a fee award, the general rule is that attorney\u2019s fees should be awarded to prevailing parties absent special circumstances. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Busbee, </em>684 F.2d 1375, 1378 (11th Cir. 1982); <em>Deerfield Medical Center v. City of Deerfield Beach, </em>661 F.2d 328, 339 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Fees are typically awarded to prevailing defendants, however, only if they can demonstrate that the plaintiff\u2019s claim was \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Rowe, </em>449 U.S. 5, 14, 101 S.Ct. 173, 178, 66 L.Ed.2d 163 (1980), quoting <em>Christiansburg Garment Company v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, 700, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978). The issue presented then in this case is whether the producers are \u201cprevailing parties\u201d within the meaning of Section 1988 and are thereby entitled to the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs that they seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b1608-9\">The term \u201cprevailing party\u201d is a flexible one that is dependent on the relief sought and actually obtained in a particular case. The general guidelines for determining whether plaintiff has \u201cprevailed\u201d are well settled. It is not necessary that a plaintiff be successful in each and every claim asserted, or that the plaintiff have obtained all the relief requested. <em>Doe v. Busbee, supra, </em>684 F.2d at 1379. \u201cFor example, a party may be considered to be \u2018prevailing\u2019 if the litigation successfully terminates by a consent decree, an out-of-court settlement, a voluntary accessation of the unlawful practice by the defendant, or other mooting of the case where the plaintiff has vindicated his right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The producers acknowledge that they were never granted any formal relief by the district court. They nonetheless contend that they \u201cprevailed\u201d in this matter, because the Atlanta performances of \u201cOh! Calcutta!\u201d in April 1982 were not disturbed or interrupted by Solicitor McAuliffe seeking to criminally enforce the Georgia public indecency and nuisance statutes. As the district court observed, while not disagreeing with the producers\u2019 factual assertion that Solicitor McAuliffe did not arrest or prosecute anyone in connection with the \u201cOh! Calcutta!\u201d performances in question, that court was compelled to reject the producers\u2019 ultimate conclusion that they are entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs based on the events that occurred or did not occur in April 1982. We agree with the district court that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1539\">*1539</page-number>producers\u2019 theory is flawed. Although both the producers\u2019 original complaint and their counterclaim in the McAuliffe lawsuit were premised upon alleged violations of 42 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1983 and the First Amendment, the producers did not actually \u201cachieve significant relief to which [they were] entitled under the civil rights laws,\u201d and did not \u201cvindicate a civil right at issue in the litigation.\u201d <em>Doe v. Busbee, supra </em>at 1381. In fact, at no time during the pendency of these cases in the district court did the producers achieve any relief under existing civil rights laws. The producers\u2019 own request for injunctive and declaratory relief were denied, and no determination, judicial or otherwise, was ever made regarding the producers\u2019 Section 1983 counterclaim to McAuliffe\u2019s later motion for declaratory and injunctive relief. Even if the fact that \u201cOh! Calcutta!\u201d played for several nights in Atlanta could be considered a victory for the producers and a loss for McAuliffe, attorney\u2019s fees still cannot be awarded the producers merely because they ultimately achieved what they considered the desired result. As a matter of fact, the particular relief the producers sought was completely denied. The mere presence of potential \u201ccivil rights issues\u201d in a case does not mandate the characterization of a case as one which vindicates civil rights. Here there was at no time a judicial determination of the \u201csubstantial rights of the parties.\u201d <em>Hanrahan v. Hampton, </em>446 U.S. 754, 758, 100 S.Ct. 1987, 1989, 64 L.Ed.2d 670 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-5\">This Court is aware that a party may be deemed \u201cprevailing\u201d if \u201c \u2018their lawsuit was a significant, catalytic factor in achieving the primary relief sought through litigation despite failure to obtain formal judicial relief,\u2019 \u201d <em>Iranian Students Association v. Sawyer, </em>639 F.2d 1160, 1163 (5th Cir.1981) quoting <em>Robinson v. Kimbrough, </em>652 F.2d 458, 478 (5th Cir.1981), or \u201cif their lawsuit is a substantial factor or a significant catalyst in motivating the defendants to end their unconstitutional behavior.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Kimbrough, supra </em>at 466. Here, however, as the district court found, there was no evidence that either the producers\u2019 initial lawsuit or their later counterclaim had any bearing whatsoever on any actions taken by Solicitor McAuliffe. It is significant that Solicitor McAuliffe testified that he never had any intentions of arresting anyone in connection with the performances of \u201cOh! Calcutta!\u201d in 1982; and for that reason, the finding of the district court that the producers\u2019 motion to 'restrain McAuliffe from arresting anyone did not have any effect is not clearly erroneous. \u201cA civil rights plaintiff may not collect attorney\u2019s fees for demanding that a state officer do what he would have done in any case.\u201d <em>Coen v. Harrison County School Board, </em>638 F.2d 24, 26 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 938, 102 S.Ct. 1427, 71 L.Ed.2d 647 (1982). It is clear, therefore, that the district court was correct in denying attorney\u2019s fees because the producers cannot obtain fees and costs for demanding in court that McAuliffe and his agents refrain from action they did not intend to take in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b1609-7\">Therefore, we agree with the district court that the producers were not prevailing parties entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1988. Accordingly, the order and judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1607-20\">.
