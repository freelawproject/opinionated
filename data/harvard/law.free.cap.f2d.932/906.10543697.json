KS &amp; W Offshore Engineering, Inc., et al., </em>Case No. 89-98(S2)-Cr-J-16, for 9:00 a.m. on August 24,1990. Appellant represented one of the defendants, KS &amp; W Inc., in this suit brought by the Government. Appellant had reservations on a commuter flight that was scheduled to leave Miami at approximately 7:00 a.m. and arrive in Jacksonville sometime before 8:00 a.m. The flight, however, was delayed by 45 minutes and the plane did not arrive in Jacksonville until 8:45 a.m. Upon arrival, appellant immediately called to have the court informed of his position and of the probability that he would be delayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">When the court called the case at 9:00 a.m., the following discussion ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj0n\">THE MARSHAL: All rise. The Honorable John H. Moore, II, Judge of the United States District Court. Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye. United States District Court in and for the Middle District of Florida is now in session. All persons having business before this Court draw near, give attention, and you shall be heard. God save the United States and this Honorable Court. Please be seated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-7\">THE COURT: All right, We\u2019ve got some status conferences this morning and some change of plea hearings. First case is 89-98(S-2) CR-J-16, K S and W\u2014 United States versus K S and W Offshore Engineering, Inc., and Milton H. Morizumi. Mr. Storch representing the government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-8\">MR. STORCH: With Mr. Perez, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-11\">THE COURT: Mr. Lembcke representing Mr. Morizumi and Mr. Kaplan representing Mr. \u2014 or the KS &amp; W corporation. Counsel here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-12\">MR. LEMBCKE: Your Honor Charles Lembcke is here on behalf of Mr. Morizu-mi. I have just \u2014 your courtroom clerk indicated to me that he had just received a phone call from Mr. Kaplan at the airport, that his plane just arrived late and he\u2019s enroute at the moment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-13\">THE COURT: You mean you didn\u2019t tell him about Judge Moore?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-14\">MR. LEMBCKE: That\u2019s a rather ambiguous question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-15\">THE COURT: You didn\u2019t tell him what a mean so-and-so I am and that he should be here on time and I expect lawyers to be professional and be here on time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYae\">MR. LEMBCKE: Your Honor, I told him that you had expectations but I didn\u2019t tell him that you were mean and unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-16\">THE COURT: Well, I didn't say unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-17\">MR. LEMBCKE: I didn\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-18\">THE COURT: I expect lawyers to be professional and be here on time. His plane just landed at the airport, huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aoc3\">MR. LEMBCKE: I don\u2019t know; Mr. Courson conveyed a message to me. And his plane was due in at 8:15, I believe, or 8 o\u2019clock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-19\">THE COURT: What day? I\u2019m not giving you a hard time; I\u2019ll get to that later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIe\">MR. LEMBCKE: The 24th, today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-20\">THE COURT: All right, we\u2019ll defer that until Mr. Kaplan gets here, and then we\u2019ll have some fun.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b989-21\">The court recalled the case at 10:15 a.m. and questioned appellant about his tardiness.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-22\">THE MARSHAL: All rise. This Honorable Court is again in session. Be seated, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>THE COURT: All right. We\u2019re back to 89-98(S-2)CR-J-16, United States versus KS and W and Morizumi. Mr. Storch and Mr. Perez for the Government; Mr. Lembcke and Mr. Kaplan. Mr. Kaplan and Mr. Lembcke, respectively, for the defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-4\">Mr. Kaplan, before we start, it\u2019s time that I ask you why you were late this morning and why you shouldn\u2019t be held in contempt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-5\">MR. KAPLAN: May I approach the podium, Judge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-6\">THE COURT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-7\">MR. KAPLAN: Judge, I weeks ago made a reservation on US Air, Flight 214 to come up this morning. Flight 214 was scheduled to leave at 7:05 with an arrival time approximately one hour later. The \u2014 I arrived at Miami International Airport this morning about 6 o\u2019clock, so as to make sure that I was there. The plane did not leave till about a quarter of eight, arriving here about quarter of nine, and I got off the plane and I called Mr. Lembcke\u2019s office asking them to call your office to advise you that I was running a few minutes late. I didn\u2019t have your office\u2019s telephone number with me. Got in a cab and came here. Got here, according to Mr. Lembcke, about twelve after nine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-8\">I apologize to the Court. I thought \u2014 I had not had any problems making flights or with flights being late coming between South Florida airports and Jacksonville previously, and I \u2014 that\u2019s about it, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-9\">THE COURT: Counsel, when I was a circuit judge in Fort Lauderdale, \u2014 and I had a lot of Miami lawyers before me in Fort Lauderdale \u2014 I would suspect that 95 percent of them had flat tires on 1-95 and they were late getting to court. Since I have been a federal judge and I have Miami lawyers coming up here, every one of them tells me that the plane was late. And that\u2019s almost without exception. I assume they weren\u2019t flying yesterday because it was bad weather or the planes were all down or whatever. But in running this courtroom, I expect lawyers to be here, be professional, be here the night before, if necessary, and not wait until the last minute to catch a plane to get here and be here on time. Now is there any reason why I shouldn\u2019t hold you in contempt for not being here at nine o\u2019clock?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-11\">MR. KAPLAN: Judge, I can assure the Court that the plane was in fact late.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqmK\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t care whether the plane was late. It's your obligation to be here at nine o\u2019clock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-12\">MR. KAPLAN: I apologize for not being here, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-13\">THE COURT: Well, I will accept your apology, but I\u2019m still going to hold you in contempt. Now, do you have anything to say \u2014 which I hereby do \u2014 do you have anything to say as to why I should not proceed with sentencing?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b990-14\">The court thereafter entered a written order of contempt and imposed a $200 fine to be paid by the end of the day. Although the judge did not indicate whether the charge was criminal or civil in nature, we have uniformly regarded the imposition of a penalty against attorneys for a punitive purpose as a criminal contempt sanction. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>812 F.2d 1552, 1562-63 (11th Cir.1987); <em>United States v. Nunez, </em>801 F.2d 1260, 1263 n. 2 (11th Cir.1986); <em>Thyssen, Inc. v. S/S Chuen On, </em>693 F.2d 1171, 1173 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-15\">Appellant argues two points on appeal, both of which are correct. <em>First, </em>he maintains that the district court improperly employed the summary contempt procedures of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 42(a). Contempt sanctions for failure to appear or untimely appearance should be imposed under Rule 42(b), which deals with actions conducted outside the presence of the court. <em>Second, </em>appellant suggests that regardless of the procedure used, there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of criminal contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-16\">Although the Government raises a superficial challenge on the first point, it is fairly well settled in this Circuit that absent extraordinary circumstances, district courts are to proceed under Rule 42(b) in situations such as this. <em>Nunez, </em>801 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>at 1263-65 (attorney\u2019s failure to appear is generally not subject to summary contempt); <em>United States v. Baldwin, </em>770 F.2d 1550, 1555 (11th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied sub nom., Jackson v. United States, </em>475 U.S. 1120, 106 S.Ct. 1636, 90 L.Ed.2d 182 (1986); <em>In re Stewart, </em>571 F.2d 958, 964-65 (5th Cir.1978). Rule 42(a) is designed to address contumacious conduct which is committed fully within the presence of the court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such summary powers are essential for the maintenance of control within the courtroom. When an attorney fails to appear or makes a delayed appearance, however, the conduct which is subject to sanction is not the absence itself but the failure to provide sufficient justification for the absence or delay. <em>Nunez, </em>801 F.2d at 1264. Accordingly, as a general rule, attorneys charged with contempt for failure to appear should receive notice of the proceeding and an opportunity to obtain counsel and present evidence challenging the sanction under the procedures outlined in Rule 42(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\">Assuming, however, that this is one of those cases where the reasons for the late appearance are sufficiently known to the judge so that all the procedures of Rule 42(b) need not be followed, <em>Nunez, </em>801 F.2d at 1264; <em>Thyssen, Inc., </em>693 F.2d at 1175, there simply is not sufficient evidence to support the criminal contempt charge. The essential elements of criminal contempt are a lawful and reasonably specific order of the court and the willful violation of that order. <em>Turner, </em>812 F.2d at 1563. The attorney, therefore, must either intentionally violate the court\u2019s order or must exhibit conduct which constitutes reckless disregard for the orders of the court. <em>United States v. Burstyn, </em>878 F.2d 1322, 1324 (11th Cir.1989). Negligent, accidental, or inadvertent violation of an order is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">Absent some prior court order or announced policy, the decision to take a plane scheduled to arrive an hour before the start of the status conference does not exhibit a willful disregard for the administration of justice. Appellant stated that he had never had problems with late flights from Miami before. Whether it would be unreasonable for a court to require attorneys to bear the expense of arriving a day before a status conference is not an issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">There is nothing in the record to indicate that this attorney is habitually late or that he has ever been late for any proceeding in the past. Such evidence might suggest a generalized disregard for the court and for the necessity of punctuality warranting the imposition of sanctions. <em>See, e.g., In re Allis, </em>531 F.2d 1391 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 900, 97 S.Ct. 267, 50 L.Ed.2d 185 (1976). Absent a showing of either specific or general intent, however, a charge of criminal contempt cannot stand. <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>444 F.2d 928, 930 (D.C.Cir.1971) (attorney who simply forgot trial did not intentionally violate court order and could not be held in contempt).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">Appellant\u2019s action might \u201chave justified the imposition of a reprimand, warning or remedial sanction. However, the finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>that this single incident demonstrated reckless disregard of an order of the court sufficient to support an adjudication of criminal conduct and the imposition of a punitive fine is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>In re Adams, </em>505 F.2d 949, 950 (5th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b989-9\">.
