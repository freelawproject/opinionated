United States, </em>21 Cl.Ct. 214 (1990). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1465\">*1465</page-number>Claims Court held that the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201-19 (1988) (FLSA), two-year statute of limitations applied to the agents\u2019 back pay claims. This court reverses and remands.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">The plaintiffs-appellants are 580 present and former border patrol agents employed by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). The agents\u2019 duties customarily require overtime. The agents claimed that the Government did not pay them their customary salary, including overtime, while they were on leave. <em>Brooks v. Wein-berger, </em>No. 85-0016 (D.D.C. filed Jan. 3, 1985). Specifically, they claimed that the Government violated statutory obligations to pay employees full compensation under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 6322 (court leave), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 6323 (military leave), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 6307 (sick leave), and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 6303 (annual leave).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Meantime, several federal firefighters filed a similar action in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The Maryland district court denied the employees\u2019 claims to full compensation under Title 5 and the FLSA. <em>Lanehart v. De-vine, </em>615 F.Supp. 1300 (D.Md.1985). The <em>Lanehart </em>plaintiffs appealed to this court. Pending resolution of the <em>Lanehart </em>appeal, the INS agents and the Government jointly moved to stay the District of Columbia district court action. The district court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">On May 14, 1987, this court issued its decision in <em>Lanehart. Lanehart v. Hor-ner, </em>818 F.2d 1574 (Fed.Cir.1987). This court reversed the Maryland district court and held that the Title 5 leave-with-pay provisions prevent reductions in employees\u2019 regular and customary pay, including overtime. <em>Id. </em>at 1583. The Maryland district court later approved a settlement under which the <em>Lanehart </em>plaintiffs received back pay for a six-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">After <em>Lanehart, </em>the District of Columbia district court transferred this case to the Claims Court on March 29, 1989. The Claims Court set out to determine the quantum of back pay due to the agents. The applicable statute of limitations would provide the bounds of the recovery. The statute of limitations for FLSA actions is two years. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255(a) (1988). The statute of limitations for the Tucker Act claims under Title 5 is six years. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-11\">The parties filed cross motions for partial summary judgment on whether these back pay claims arose under the FLSA or Title 5. The Claims Court granted summary judgment for the Government, holding that the two-year FLSA statute of limitations applies. 21 Cl.Ct. at 214. The parties subsequently filed a Stipulation of Partial Dismissal which resolved all other issues in this case, thus making the Claims Court\u2019s decision appealable as a final judgment. This appeal deals only with the proper statute of limitations for this back pay case.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b882-13\">This court has jurisdiction over appeals from the Claims Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3). This court reviews <em>de novo </em>the Claims Court\u2019s legal conclusions, such as application of the proper statute of limitations. <em>See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. United States, </em>923 F.2d 830, 833 (Fed.Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-14\">In <em>Lanehart, </em>this court determined that FLSA overtime pay must include authorized leave time taken under the Title 5 leave-with-pay statutes. <em>Lanehart, </em>818 F.2d at 1582. Thus, FLSA overtime computations must include hours of paid leave under Title 5 as hours worked. \u201cHours of work\u201d now include \u201chours of leave.\u201d After <em>Lanehart, </em>the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) amended its regulations to count leave-with-pay periods as hours worked when computing FLSA overtime. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 551.401 (1990); <em>Acton, </em>21 Cl.Ct. at 217 n. 4. <em>Lanehart </em>did not, however, set the proper statute of limitations for back pay claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-15\">The Claims Court correctly recognized that the INS agents deserve \u201cto have their overtime pay computed under the Fair Labor Standards Act____\u201d <em>Acton, </em>21 Cl.Ct. at 215. The Claims Court, however, misread <em>Lanehart </em>as involving \u201cFLSA over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1466\">*1466</page-number>time pay claims [and] not ... Title 5 overtime claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222. <em>Lanehart </em>based the firefighters\u2019 entitlement to additional overtime hours on Title 5, not the FLSA. <em>Lanehart, </em>818 F.2d at 1578, 1583. As in <em>Lanehart, </em>the claims in this case arose under the Title 5 leave-with-pay provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">The Claims Court therefore erred when it used the statutory basis for calculating overtime, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207, to determine the statute of limitations applicable to this claim. Instead the Claims Court must use the statutory source of entitlement to the payment to determine the correct statute of limitations. In this case, Title 5 entitles the INS agents to additional overtime hours, and consequently, a recovery. This court in <em>Lanehart </em>based entitlement to additional overtime pay on the language of Title 5 \u00a7\u00a7 6303, 6307, 6322, and 6323.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">In this case, as in <em>Lanehart, </em>the Title 5 leave-with-pay provisions established the entitlement to additional overtime pay. Therefore, as in <em>Lanehart, </em>a six-year statute of limitations applies to these claims.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">This court reverses and remands the Claims Court\u2019s judgment for calculation of additional overtime pay based on a six-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b883-12\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-13\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b883-6\">In <em>Armitage v. United States, </em>22 Cl.Ct. 206 (1990), the Claims Court correctly applied a six-year statute of limitations to similar claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
