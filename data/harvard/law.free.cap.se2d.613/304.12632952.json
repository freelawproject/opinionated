Accordingly, defendant's conviction is reversed and we remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The evidence tended to show that defendant, a pilot and flight instructor, met the alleged victim when she took several flight lessons. Defendant and the victim became friends, and then became roommates when\n   defendant allowed the victim to live in his home during the summer of 2001 after the victim's mother would no longer allow her to live in the family residence. The victim had recently graduated from high school, and in August 2001, she moved to Illinois to attend college.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the weekend of 20 October 2001, the victim returned home for a visit. That Saturday evening she consumed eight malt liquor beverages and a glass of Jack Daniels whiskey while at a friend's home. On the same evening, defendant was celebrating a friend's birthday with a group of at least six individuals. After patronizing a local bar, the group returned to defendant's home to eat, socialize, and go to bed. The victim was not a part of this group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant and the victim each testified differently as to what occurred between them on Saturday evening and Sunday morning. The victim testified that defendant called her cell phone several times on Saturday evening and early Sunday morning to invite her over to his home for a cookout. She drove to defendant's home, knocked on the front door, and rang the doorbell. After defendant and his friend John opened the door, the victim entered the house, talked a few minutes in the foyer, and was informed that the party was over and that everyone had gone to bed. She indicated that she was too tired to drive home, so she went upstairs to go to sleep for a few hours in defendant's room. Defendant, his friend John, and the victim all slept in defendant's bed, with the victim in the middle. The victim testified that defendant began rubbing her arm and kissing her. She told him no and informed him that she was going to sleep. She went to sleep and then awoke with defendant on top of her. John was no longer in the room. Her pants and underwear had been removed, defendant had her hands pinned down above her head, and was having sexual intercourse with her. She told him to stop, but he continued. She then used her feet to push defendant off of her. Defendant left the room, and John returned and began touching her. She then told him to stop, he left the room, and the victim went back to sleep. She awoke at approximately 9:45 a.m. and left the residence. She testified that she had to pack and prepare to leave for the airport at 11:00 a.m. in order to return to Illinois. The victim did not inform anyone in North Carolina what had occurred; however, upon returning to her dormitory, she told two friends, sought medical treatment, and spoke to a college police officer a few days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant testified that he did not know the victim was in town visiting from college, and that he did not call the victim several times that evening. He testified that he was celebrating a friend's birthday with a group of friends, and that the group returned to his home to cookout and sit in the hot tub. The victim called his cell phone at 4:30 a.m. and left a message. He returned her phone call approximately twenty minutes later, and told her who was at his house, but that they were getting ready to go to bed. Approximately forty minutes later, the victim called defendant and told him she was on her way over. He told her that everyone was in bed. To corroborate his testimony, defendant provided his cell phone bill which indicated he only called the victim at 4:52 a.m., and not several times. He also called two witnesses who had been with him that evening who testified that they did not call the victim from their cell phones, nor had they mentioned calling the victim as they did not know she was in town.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant then testified that he did not know how she got into his home, and that he first encountered her when he got up to investigate a noise he had heard. Defendant called a witness who had been sleeping on defendant's couch downstairs that evening. This individual testified that he heard the kitchen door slam and heard someone bump into the trash can. He looked up and saw the victim in the kitchen. He watched her as she walked into the foyer and went upstairs. Defendant then testified that the victim got into his bed, and they began kissing. He indicated the kissing and touching was mutual and that the victim never went to sleep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In a telephone conversation that the victim recorded without defendant's knowledge, defendant stated that he thought the sexual intercourse was mutual because they had been kissing and touching. He stated that she had touched him in certain places and\n   that he decided to try and take it to another level. He indicated that because of the mutual kissing and touching, he felt she was aware of what was occurring and was awake. Defendant was very apologetic during the conversation, and he testified that he kept apologizing because the victim was a friend and was upset about what had happened between them. However, he reiterated that he felt the sexual intercourse was mutual and consensual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court instructed the jury on the elements of second degree rape. In the portion of the instruction regarding consent, the trial court stated: \"And third, that the victim did not consent and it was against her will. Force and lack of consent are implied in law if at the time of the vaginal intercourse the victim is sleeping or similarly incapacitated.\" Defendant was convicted of second degree rape, and was sentenced to a minimum of seventy-three and a maximum of ninety-seven months imprisonment. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant contends the trial court's instruction that \"[f]orce and lack of consent are implied in law if at the time of the vaginal intercourse the victim is sleeping or similarly incapacitated[]\" was erroneous. This instruction was based upon the Supreme Court of North Carolina's holding in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The defendant argued there was a fatal variance between this indictment and the proof presented at trial because the indictment alleged he utilized force to commit the rape, and the evidence presented at trial did not establish the use of force.\n   <em>\n    State v.

This Court determined there was a fatal variance between the indictment allegations and the proof because the indictment did not allege the victim was physically helpless.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 598,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=347%20S.E.2d%20857\">\n    347 S.E.2d at 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, this Court stated,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   we hold that the proper indictment for the rape of a person who is asleep is one alleging rape of a \"physically helpless\" person. In the present case, penetration and the initiation of sexual intercourse was achieved while the prosecutrix was asleep and unable to communicate an unwillingness to submit to the act. Thus, there is a fatal variance between the indictment's allegations that defendant carnally knew the prosecutrix by force and against her will and the proof the State presented at trial. The trial court should have granted the motion to dismiss the second degree rape charge, and the judgment as to that offense must be arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6202354\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/307/#p314\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Supreme Court of North Carolina reversed, and held that in the crime of rape, the elements of force and lack of consent are implied in law upon the showing of sexual intercourse with a person who was asleep, unconscious, or otherwise incapacitated and therefore unable to resist or give consent.\n   <em>\n    Moorman,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4731555\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/320/387/\">\n    320 N.C. at 391-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=358%20S.E.2d%20502\">\n    358 S.E.2d at 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Moorman\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court concluded there was not a fatal variance between the indictment and the evidence offered at trial, and affirmed the defendant's conviction for second degree rape.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 391-92,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=358%20S.E.2d%20502\">\n    358 S.E.2d at 505-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In this case, the trial court deviated from the pattern jury instructions and attempted to incorporate the holding in\n   <em>\n    Moorman\n   </em>\n   into\n   the jury instructions. In pertinent part, the pattern jury instructions provide:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendant has been charged with second degree rape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   For you to find the defendant guilty of this offense, the state must prove three ... things beyond a reasonable doubt:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    First,\n   </em>\n   that the defendant engaged in vaginal intercourse with the victim. Vaginal intercourse is penetration, however slight, of the female sex organ by the male sex organ. (The actual emission of semen is not necessary.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Second,\n   </em>\n   that the defendant used or threatened to use force sufficient to overcome any resistance the victim might make. (The force necessary to constitute rape need not be actual physical force. Fear or coercion may take the place of physical force.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    And Third,\n   </em>\n   that the victim did not consent and it was against her will. (Consent induced by fear is not consent in law.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   If you find from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that on or about the alleged date, the defendant engaged in vaginal intercourse with the victim and that he did so by force or threat of force and that this was sufficient to overcome any resistance which the victim might make, and that the victim did not consent and it was against her will ... it would be your duty to return a verdict of guilty. If you do not so find or if you have a reasonable doubt as to one or more of these things, it would be your duty to return a verdict of not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   1 N.C.P.I. - Crim. 207.20 (2002) (footnote omitted). After instructing on the third element, the trial court gave the following instruction based upon the holding in\n   <em>\n    Moorman:\n   </em>\n   \"Force and lack of consent are implied in law if at the time of the vaginal intercourse the victim is sleeping or similarly incapacitated.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Supreme Court of North Carolina did not discuss in\n   <em>\n    Moorman\n   </em>\n   how its holding could be properly incorporated into a jury instruction. Rather, the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Moorman\n   </em>\n   focused upon the indictment allegations and the proof required to prove the allegations. In North Carolina, there is a fatal variance between the indictment allegations and the proof where the evidence tends to show the commission of an offense not charged in the indictment.\n   <em>\n    State v. Williams,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8574100\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/303/507/#p510\">\n    303 N.C. 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 510,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=279%20S.E.2d%20592\">\n    279 S.E.2d 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 594 (1981). Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Moorman\n   </em>\n   , the appellate courts were reviewing the indictment and the evidence presented, not whether the jury was properly instructed on the law regarding second degree rape. In this case, defendant argues the trial court's instruction that \"[f]orce and lack of consent are implied in law if at the time of the vaginal intercourse the victim is sleeping or similarly incapacitated[,]\" impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to defendant and allowed the jury to presume force and lack of consent. Defendant's argument presents an issue of first impression before our appellate courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   First, under the facts of this case, we conclude the trial court could not instruct that force and lack of consent was implied in law as the evidence regarding whether the alleged victim was asleep was contradictory. By analogy, we consider cases involving the use of a dangerous or deadly weapon, as our appellate courts have discussed on several occasions the propriety of instructing that a particular instrument is a dangerous or deadly weapon as a matter of law. In the context of whether an instrument is a dangerous or deadly weapon:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   It has long been the law of this state that \"[w]here the alleged deadly weapon and the manner of its use\n   <em>\n    are of such character as to admit of but one conclusion, the question as to whether or not it is deadly ... is one of law, and the Court must take the responsibility of so declaring.\n   </em>\n   \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

In contrast, \"`where the instrument, according to the manner of its use or the part of the body at which the blow is aimed, may or may not be likely to produce such results, its allegedly deadly character is one of fact to be determined by the jury.'\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 120,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=340%20S.E.2d%20465\">\n    340 S.E.2d at 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moorman\n   </em>\n   . However, the facts of this case were in dispute with the alleged victim testifying she was asleep, and the defendant testifying she was awake. In the recorded phone conversation, the defendant stated that he initiated sexual contact because of the mutual kissing and touching and he decided to take \"it to one other level.\" Defendant also stated in the recorded conversation that he thought the alleged victim was awake and fully aware of what was occurring because of how the alleged victim was touching him. The facts of this case did not lead to only one conclusion regarding whether the alleged victim was asleep, and therefore the trial court could not determine force and lack of consent as a matter of law. As the trial court's instruction conclusively prejudged the existence of two of the elements of second degree rape, the instruction was unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    See State v.

Thus, the only elements to be resolved were force and against the victim's will. The State and defendant presented contradictory evidence on these elements. Whereas the victim testified that after she said no, the defendant engaged in sexual intercourse with her while she was asleep, the defendant testified that the sexual intercourse was consensual and that the victim was awake and aware of what was occurring because she and the defendant were engaged in mutual touching and kissing prior to the initiation of sexual intercourse. The recorded telephone conversation supports both versions of the events. Thus, there were issues of fact and credibility to be resolved by the jury. However, the trial court impermissibly instructed the jury that two elements - force and lack of consent - were established as a matter of law. Under the facts of this case, whether those elements had been established beyond a reasonable doubt was a jury question. Even assuming the trial court could instruct on the presumption, the trial court's jury instruction created a reasonable likelihood that the jury did not deliberate upon the contradictory evidence, but rather understood the trial court's instruction to mean force and lack of consent had been established. Moreover, there is a reasonable likelihood the jury concluded the victim was asleep by a standard less than beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, upon the introduction of rebutting evidence, the mandatory presumption disappeared and the jury could only have been given a permissive inference instruction. Accordingly, we conclude the erroneous jury instruction was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

Second, that the defendant used or threatened to use force sufficient to overcome any resistance the victim might make.\n   <strong>\n    (The force necessary to constitute rape need not be actual physical force.

This developed, not as a means to determine how to charge in a rape indictment, but to state as a matter of substantive law, that a sleeping victim does not consent. Therefore, the trial court's instructions were based on the law as it has developed in our jurisprudence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   As to the element or elemental issue of force and lack of consent, the jurors heard evidence from the victim that she was asleep, then woke up while defendant was sexually penetrating her and that she never gave him permission to do so. They also heard evidence from the defendant that the victim was awake and that she consented to the penetration. The jury could have believed the victim's testimony and found she was sleeping and therefore could not consent, and that upon awakening she struggled with defendant and still did not give consent. On the other hand, the jury could have believed the defendant's testimony that the victim was not asleep, did not resist and did indeed consent to the sexual intercourse. The trial court's instruction that \"force and lack of consent are implied in law\n   <strong>\n    if\n   </strong>\n   at the time of sexual intercourse the victim is sleeping ...\" is no more impermissible and prejudicial than the portion of the Pattern Jury Instruction - \"consent induced by fear is not consent in law\" - that was substituted. Neither of these instructions impermissibly shift the burden to defendant. Under either version, the jury would have to make credibility findings (e.g. was the victim asleep; was the victim afraid) in order to determine whether there was force and lack of consent. Defendant was not required to come forth with any more evidence and therefore I would find there was no constitutional violation based on the court's instructions. If the trial court's instruction on force and lack of consent which was given pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Moorman\n   </em>\n   can be considered a presumption, it should be considered permissive, not mandatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Moreover, on appeal, it is defendant's burden to show, under the reasonable likelihood test of\n   <em>\n    Boyde v.
