We find no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff worked as a senior vice president in the \"Structured Products Group\" for First Union from 3 June 1996 to 9 February 2001. Plaintiff's initial compensation was $90,000.00 per year in salary plus a \"guaranteed minimum incentive payment of $90,000.00.\" After\n   starting employment, plaintiff and Brian Simpson (\"Simpson\"), manager of the Structured Products Group, orally agreed plaintiff would be paid twenty percent of all net income he earned for First Union. The formula to compute the bonus was not discussed. In 1996, 1997, and 1998, plaintiff was paid twenty percent of the income he generated for First Union.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 1998, First Union decided to change its bonus formula to a more \"subjective\" determination. Despite this change, plaintiff's bonus for year 1999 remained at twenty percent of the net income he produced for First Union. However, plaintiff's bonus for year 2000 fell to roughly ten percent, half of the usual amount. Simpson contended the decrease was due to a financial loss First Union suffered on a project upon which plaintiff was working on, and his poor ratings in \"teamwork ... leadership... [and] inability to work well with others.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff contacted Deidre Bradshaw (\"Bradshaw\") in First Union's Human Resources Department, to discuss the decrease in his compensation. When it became apparent that First Union would not pay plaintiff according to the prior bonus structure, plaintiff informed Bradshaw that he would seek \"appropriate remedies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff filed a complaint against defendants on 12 March 2002 for: (1) breach of contract; (2) violation of the North Carolina Wage and Hour Act (\"NCWHA\"); and (3) fraud. Defendants answered on 28 May 2002 and simultaneously filed a motion to dismiss the claim for fraud. Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed without prejudice his fraud claim. Throughout the discovery process, Bradshaw \"represented the company\" as the person on \"point\" and assisted defendants' counsel in responding to discovery requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The case was tried by jury from 22 to 26 September 2003 and 29 September to 1 October 2003. The jury found: (1) plaintiff and First Union entered into a contract where First Union would pay plaintiff an annual bonus; (2) First Union modified plaintiff's bonus formula without his consent; (3) First Union breached its contract with plaintiff concerning payment of his bonus compensation; (4) First Union failed to give plaintiff notice of the change in the bonus formula; and (5) Wachovia owes plaintiff $837,243.40 plus interest and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff moved the trial court for liquidated damages, attorneys' fees, costs, and interest. Defendants moved the trial court for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or new trial. The trial court ordered: (1) \"Wachovia shall pay to Plaintiff the amount of $837,243.40 in liquidated damages;\" (2) \"Plaintiff shall recover interest on the amount awarded by jury in its verdict at the rate of 8%\n   <em>\n    per annum\n   </em>\n   from February 15, 2001, until the Judgment is satisfied;\" and (3) \"Wachovia shall pay to Plaintiff the amount of $5,377.31 in costs.\" The trial court denied plaintiff's motion for attorneys' fees and defendants' motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or new trial. Defendants appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    II. Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants argue the trial court erred in: (1) denying defendants' motion for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict or new trial; (2) its instructions to the jury; and (3) abusing its discretion in awarding plaintiff liquidated damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    III. Directed Verdict and Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants argue the trial court erred in denying its motions for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict after plaintiff failed to offer sufficient evidence to establish: (1) an enforceable contract or subsequent breach; and (2) a violation of the NCWHA.

Defendants also argue that if a contract existed between plaintiff and Simpson, it expired at the end of 1997 and was not perpetual.

Existence of a Contract\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The trial court instructed and presented to the jury the following query: \"Did the plaintiff, Donald Arndt and the defendant, First Union National Bank enter into a contract by which First Union National Bank agreed to pay plaintiff an annual bonus, for 1997 and succeeding years, based on 20 percent of the annual net income, of the tax related securities group?\" The court's instruction continued by detailing the elements of a contract that plaintiff must prove by a greater weight of the evidence. We have already held that plaintiff proffered sufficient evidence to show a contract existed between himself and defendants concerning an annual bonus to survive defendants' motions for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict. This portion of defendants' assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    C. Acquiescence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The second instruction to the jury concerned plaintiff's alleged acquiescence to the changed bonus structure. Defendants assert the trial court \"erroneously ignored [plaintiff]'s status as an at-will employee and [defendants'] right to modify the incentive programs affecting its at-will employees at any time.\" Our review of the transcript indicates the trial court properly instructed the jury on plaintiff's at-will employment with defendants and its legal effect to changes in compensation:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The parties to this action have agreed that the plaintiff is an employee at will.\n   <em>\n    [An] employee at will is an employee whose employment can be determined, at any time, by the employee [or] the employer.\n   </em>\n   There is no definite length of employment. The employment relationship continues until it is terminated by either party. The terms of the employment remain in effect until they are modified, by either - either agreement of the parties or by the employer, unilaterally. The employer, in an at will relationship, can modify, unilaterally the future compensation to be paid to an employee. If the employer modifies the terms of an employed, at will; and, the employee knows of the change, the employee is deemed to have\n   <em>\n    acquiesced\n   </em>\n   to the modified terms, if he continues in the employment relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (Emphasis supplied). The trial court properly charged the jury on the issues of plaintiff's at will employment and his possible acquiescence to changes defendants alleged concerning his compensation package. This portion of defendants' assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    D. Estoppel\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The trial court denied defendants' request for an instruction on estoppel. Specifically, defendants argued plaintiff was estopped from asserting that the generic ICP plan did not apply to him after acceptance of the benefits of the ICP plan, his annual bonuses. The trial court's instructions to the jury, when viewed \"in their entirety,\" sufficiently present defendants' arguments to the jury whether: (1) the generic ICP plan applied to plaintiff; and (2) the bonuses he received after 1997 were provided in accordance with that generic ICP plan. Defendants do not argue and our review of the transcript does not show how the trial court's decision to not instruct the jury on estoppel was error, and in light of the entire charge, likely to mislead the jury.\n   <em>\n    See Estate of Hendrickson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9079659\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/151/139/#p150\">\n    151 N.C.App. at 150-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=565%20S.E.2d%20254\">\n    565 S.E.2d at 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This portion of defendants' assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    E. Spoliation of the Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendants argue plaintiff's evidence did not support an instruction to the jury on spoliation of evidence and that they were unfairly prejudiced by the instruction. The basis for the instruction concerned plaintiff's discovery request of: (1) 1999 and 2000 profit and loss statements; and (2) the text of two emails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The trial court provided the following instruction to the jury:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Evidence has been received that tends to show that certain profit and loss statements and E-mails were in the exclusive possession of the defendant, First Union; and, [sic] have not been produced for inspection,\n   by the plaintiff or his counsel, even though defendant, First Union, was aware of the plaintiff's claim. From this, you may infer, though you are not compelled to do so, that the profit and loss statements and the E-mails would be damaging to the defendant. You may give this inference such force and effect as you think it should have, under all the facts and circumstances. You are permitted this inference, even if there is no evidence that the defendant acted intentionally, negligently or in bad faith. However, you should not make this inference, if you find that there a[sic] fair frank and satisfactory explanation for the defendant's failure to produce the documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Yarborough v. Hughes,\n   </em>\n   our Supreme Court considered spoliation of evidence and held, \"where a party fails to introduce in evidence documents that are relevant to the matter in question and within his control ... there is a presumption or at least an inference that the evidence withheld, if forthcoming, would injure his case.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8652379\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/139/199/#p209\">\n    139 N.C. 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 209,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20S.E.%20904\">\n    51 S.E. 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 907-08 (1905).

Notice\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiff presented evidence that Bradshaw, First Union's human resources partner, was on notice and had detailed knowledge of plaintiff's claims. Bradshaw testified she was on \"point\" for defendants with this matter and was \"representing the company\" during these proceedings. She was \"the person who has been relied upon to provide documents and to verify answers in the discovery requests\" and \"signed all the verifications that had to go with the discovery requests.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Having shown Bradshaw was very familiar with the case, plaintiff specifically addressed defendants' notice of his claims. Bradshaw testified that she handled plaintiff's questions concerning his compensation during his employment. When questions arose over plaintiff's compensation, he contacted her. Plaintiff introduced two emails addressed to Bradshaw concerning issues and nonpayment of his compensation. The first email inquired of defendants' proper procedure to contest and appeal nonpayment of his compensation. The second email was sent to Bradshaw after plaintiff determined a favorable resolution was not forthcoming. It asserted that if his compensation was not addressed \"in an expedient and professional manner[, plaintiff would have] ... no recourse but to seek appropriate remedies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Bradshaw testified that she knew in February 2001 plaintiff was terminating his employment with defendants due to nonpayment\n   of compensation he claimed. As the person on \"point,\" Bradshaw acknowledged receiving a letter from plaintiff's counsel in March 2001 concerning an impending claim. Given Bradshaw's in-depth knowledge of the issues, this evidence shows defendants were on notice early on of plaintiff's intent to file a claim.\n   <em>\n    See McLain,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11092650\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/137/179/\">\n    137 N.C.App. at 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=527%20S.E.2d%20712\">\n    527 S.E.2d at 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"we believe the evidence that ...

Pertinent and Supportive Information\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The information plaintiff sought discovery of included: (1) an email plaintiff sent to Simpson in 2000 concerning distribution and payment of plaintiff's 1999 bonus; (2) an email from David Yorker (\"Yorker\") to Simpson in which Yorker documented a conversation in which Simpson agreed that the general ICP plan did not apply to plaintiff; and (3) 1999 and 2000 annual profit and loss financial statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Plaintiff sought the emails as evidence of his 1999 compensation and the non-application of the general ICP plan to him. Both documents were central to the issues at bar. Their importance is shown by the trial court's permission for plaintiff to testify about the emails despite their physical absence. The two financial statements requested were intended to support plaintiff's argument that he had a contract separate from defendants' general ICP plan. Plaintiff asserts that the 1999 profit and loss statements would show defendants acted in compliance with the oral contract during that year of his employment, as well as in prior years; a fact contested by defendants. The 2000 statements were relevant to plaintiff's damages. The information plaintiff sought is pertinent to the issues in dispute and supportive of his claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    3.

Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The trial court properly denied defendants' motions for directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict. Plaintiff proffered sufficient evidence to support and the trial court did not err in determining and providing the jury instructions on: (1) existence of a contract; (2) acquiescence; and (3) spoliation of evidence. The trial court did not err in denying defendants' request for jury instructions on estoppel. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding plaintiff liquidated damages pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 95-25.22. We find no error in the jury's verdict in plaintiff's favor and the judgment entered thereon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   No error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Judges McGEE and GEER concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
