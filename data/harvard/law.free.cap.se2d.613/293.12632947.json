The motion to amend complaint was heard and granted on 16 February 2004. Defendant-appellees, Nathaniel M. Stewart (\"Stewart\") and Stewart Financial Group, Inc. (\"Stewart Financial\") (collectively \"defendants\") responded to plaintiff's First Amended Complaint with a Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. In their Motion to Dismiss, defendants argued that plaintiff's claims were preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201144\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , (ERISA) and therefore the state courts did not have jurisdiction over the claims. In opposition to defendants' Motion to Dismiss, plaintiff argued that his claims were traditional state law claims and should not be preempted. Plaintiff contended that since the terms of the disability policy itself were not disputed and neither the plan nor any of the plan administrators were named as parties to the action the claims should not be preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The trial court issued an order granting defendants' Motion to Dismiss with prejudice as to further state court proceedings on the claims on 19 March 2004. In its order the trial court held plaintiff's claims were \"relate[d] to\" an \"employee welfare benefit plan\" and were therefore preempted by ERISA. The trial court also held concurrent jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) was not proper as that section allows concurrent state court jurisdiction in the \"limited circumstance of a participant or beneficiary seeking `to recover benefits due him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.'\" (emphasis in original omitted) The trial court also noted in its order that plaintiff did not seek to recover under the terms of the plan and had not sued the plan, the plan's administrator, the plan's trustee, or the employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The basis of plaintiff's claim was a letter he received from Stewart on behalf of Stewart Financial informing him that his employer had made changes to his benefits package. These changes included adding a company paid long term disability policy. The letter also informed plaintiff that the new disability policy would pay him sixty-six and two thirds percent (66 2/3%) of his income in the event he became disabled. This information was confirmed to plaintiff verbally by defendants on several occasions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff subsequently was disabled. His actual benefits paid under the long term disability policy were only sixty percent (60%) of his income. The difference in benefits between the amount stated by defendants in the letter and the amount actually paid under the policy during plaintiff's disability was $48,572.48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff only filed suit against Stewart, who had acted as a financial advisor, and Stewart Financial and not against plaintiff's employer; the plan administrator; the plan trustee; nor the plan itself. His initial complaint was based on the grounds that: (1) the letter and subsequent conversations with defendants were sufficient to constitute a contract between the parties and defendants breached that contract; (2) that defendants were negligent in sending the misleading letter to plaintiff and in failing to correct their misstatements; and (3) that plaintiff relied on the statements in the letter to his detriment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff's amended complaint added claims for breach of contract based on defendants contract with plaintiff's employer, negligent misrepresentation and unfair or deceptive trade practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On defendants' motion, the trial court dismissed plaintiff's claims on the ground that they were preempted by ERISA. Plaintiff timely appealed. Plaintiff assigns as error: (1) the trial court's granting of defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiff's claims on the basis that they were related to a welfare benefits policy and therefore preempted by Federal Law and (2) the trial court's conclusion that state courts do not have concurrent jurisdiction over plaintiff's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ERISA contains an express preemption clause which provides that ERISA supercedes \"any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan\" covered by ERISA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201144\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

The Supreme Court has instructed that, in applying ERISA's preemption clause, courts should \"look . . . to the objectives of the ERISA statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that Congress understood would survive.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339053\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/645/#p654\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339053\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/645/#p654\">\n    at 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1339053\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/645/#p654\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If the state law in question \"acts immediately and exclusively upon ERISA plans\" or if \"the existence of ERISA plans is essential to the law's operation\" then the law \"refers to\" ERISA plans and is preempted.\n   <em>\n    Cal.
