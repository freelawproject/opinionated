Morrisette alleges he was entitled to an additional peremptory strike and that his due process rights were violated.

Furthermore, as Morrisette concedes, he did not make this specific argument at trial when he challenged the 19-year pre-indictment delay. Therefore, he would have been procedurally barred from raising the argument on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 5:25.

Failure to Object to Jury Pool Size and Failure to Demand an Additional Peremptory Strike\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The trial court seated a panel of 14 jurors, including two alternate jurors, from a qualified panel of 22 venirepersons. Under Code \u00a7 19.2-262(B), a panel of 20 qualified members is required in order to seat a jury of 12 persons. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-360, when a court desires to seat \"two or more additional jurors ... there shall be drawn twice as many venireman as the number of additional jurors desired. The ...

Failure to Present Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In claim IV, Morrisette alleges he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because counsel failed to present evidence that Morrisette and the victim, Dorothy White, had been having \"an affair.\" Relying on affidavits by Patricia Walton, Morrisette's ex-wife; and Randy Rodgers, Morrisette's former employer; Morrisette alleges that counsel should have presented testimony from Walton and Rodgers to show that Morrisette and White had consensual sex at the time of the murder. Despite his defense that he did not commit the murder, Morrisette asserts that, if counsel had presented the testimony of both Walton and Rodgers, the jury would have either acquitted him or convicted him of first-degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In the affidavits presented by Morrisette, Walton states that Morrisette's mother was afraid that Bill Anthony, who had a relationship with White, was going to hurt Morrisette because Morrisette was also involved in a sexual relationship with White. Walton also states that she saw Morrisette and White together. Rodgers asserts that he could have corroborated the fact that Morrisette had an affair with White because Rodgers had seen Morrisette and White together and because Morrisette told Rodgers that he had slept with White. Rodgers further stated that Morrisette was afraid of Bill Anthony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Morrisette argues that, if the jury believed he and White had engaged in consensual sex, it would not have convicted Morrisette of capital murder, even if the jury believed he killed her. Morrisette further argues that, if the jury had heard evidence of Bill Anthony's motive to commit the murder, Morrisette would have been acquitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Not only do these affidavits contain inadmissible, hearsay testimony, they present evidence that is inconsistent with Morrisette's defense at trial. A few days after the crime was committed, Morrisette told the police he only knew White because he once went to her house with Bill Anthony. Morrisette also gave the police a false alibi for the night of the murder. However, in his 1999 interview with the police, Morrisette denied knowing White and denied having sexual intercourse with her. Thus, it would have been unreasonable for counsel to attempt to assert a defense that Morrisette and White had consensual sexual intercourse because Morrisette asserted an alibi defense and previously stated that he did not know White. A defense based on the affidavits would emphasize that Morrisette lied twice to the police in order to conceal his guilt. Therefore, Morrisette has failed to demonstrate that counsel's performance was deficient or that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's alleged error, the outcome of the proceeding would have been different.\n   <em>\n    See Strickland,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   5. Failure to Request a Jury Instruction on First-Degree Murder\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In claim V(B), Morrisette alleges he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because counsel failed to request an instruction on the lesser-included offense of first-degree murder. Morrisette alleges he was prejudiced by counsel's failure because the jury could have found that the evidence was either insufficient to prove Morrisette's sexual\n   intercourse with White was nonconsensual or insufficient to prove that the act of sexual intercourse was contemporaneous with the killing of White. Morrisette bases this argument on the evidence that there was no injury to the victim's external genitalia coupled with the presence of his semen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The defense's theory at trial was that Morrisette did not murder White. Counsel argued during trial that Morrisette \"was not involved in the murder\" and that \"[n]othing in any evidence shows that William Morrisette did the murder.\" Counsel could not have reasonably argued that Morrisette committed first-degree murder without destroying the stronger argument that Morrisette did not commit the murder. Therefore, Morrisette has failed to demonstrate that counsel's performance was deficient or that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's alleged error, the outcome of the proceeding would have been different.\n   <em>\n    See Strickland,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   6. Cumulative Nature of Counsel's Errors\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In claim VIII, Morrisette asserts the cumulative effect of trial counsel's deficient performance prejudiced him.

In his amended petition, Morrisette added a claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to make this argument. Morrisette filed the amended petition on March 5, 2004, after the applicable statute of limitations had expired. Thus, the added claim is barred pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-654.1.

That instruction stated:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    You have convicted the defendant of an offense which may be punishable by death. You must decide whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death or to imprisonment for life and a fine of a specific amount, but not more than $100,000.00. Before the penalty can be fixed at death, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt at least one of the following aggravating circumstances:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    (1) That, after consideration of his history and background, there is a probability that he would commit criminal acts of\n    violence that would constitute a continuing serious threat to society; or\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    (2) That his conduct in committing the offense was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman, in that it involved torture, depravity of mind or aggravated battery to the victim beyond the minimum necessary to accomplish the act of murder.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    If you find from the evidence that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt either of these circumstances, then you may fix the punishment of the defendant at death. But if you nevertheless believe from all the evidence, including evidence in mitigation, that the death penalty is not justified, then you shall fix the punishment of the defendant at:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    (1) Imprisonment for life; or\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    (2) Imprisonment for life and a fine of a specific amount, but not more than $100,000.00.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    If the Commonwealth has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt at least one of these circumstances, then you shall fix the punishment at:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    (1) Imprisonment for life; or\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    (2) Imprisonment for life and a fine of a specific amount, but not more than $100,000.00.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Any decision you make regarding punishment must be unanimous.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Armed with this correct statement of law along with the penalty phase verdict form, a reasonable jury could not have misunderstood its sentencing options.\n    <em>\n     See Francis v.

In other words, there is not a reasonable probability that the jury would have voted to impose a life sentence or a life sentence with a fine after finding both aggravating factors but failed to do so because the verdict form did not expressly set out an option with that particular language. The jury was clearly instructed that, if it found the Commonwealth had proven either of the aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, it \"may\" fix punishment at death; but that, if it nevertheless believed from all the evidence, including evidence in mitigation, the death penalty was not justified, it \"shall fix\" punishment at life imprisonment or life imprisonment and a fine. This language juxtaposed with the verdict form that expressly, in a separate paragraph, provided the option of fixing punishment at life imprisonment or life imprisonment and a fine \"after having considered all of the evidence in aggravation and mitigation\" was not confusing. Nor was there a conflict between the verdict form and the trial court's instructions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    In short, the jury was instructed that, even if it found one or both aggravating factors, it could sentence Morrisette to life imprisonment or life imprisonment and a fine if it believed, after considering all the evidence including mitigation evidence, that the death penalty was not justified. The final two paragraphs of the verdict form provided the jury with the means to effect such a finding, but the jury instead chose to fix Morrisette's sentence at death.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Thus, I conclude that Morrisette has not carried his burden of demonstrating that counsel's alleged error was \"so serious as to deprive [him] of a fair trial.\"\n    <em>\n     Strickland,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n     466 U.S. at 687\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n     104 S.Ct. 2052\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     cf.
