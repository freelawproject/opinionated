For the reasons discussed below, we will\n   affirm the judgment of the trial court in both cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I. Facts and Proceedings Below\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Shivaee v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 1996, Shivaee was convicted of four counts of aggravated sexual battery, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3, and one count of indecent liberties, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1. His victims were three girls, each less than 13 years old. He was sentenced to serve seven years of incarceration on each of the four aggravated sexual battery charges, with five years on each charge suspended, and two years on the indecent liberties charge, with one year suspended. In 1997, Shivaee was convicted of one count of forcible sodomy, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.1, based on an incident that occurred prior to his 1996 conviction. His victim was a boy less than 13 years old. He was sentenced to ten years of incarceration, with eight years suspended. Pursuant to the SVPA, the Attorney General (\"Commonwealth\") filed a petition seeking Shivaee's civil commitment in lieu of his release on September 17, 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Pursuant to Code \u00a7 37.1-70.7, the trial court found probable cause existed that Shivaee is a sexually violent predator as defined in the SVPA and set the matter for trial. Prior to trial, Shivaee filed a motion to dismiss the petition for civil commitment on the grounds that the SVPA violates both the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and Article I, section 11 of the Constitution of Virginia. The trial court denied his motion. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 37.1-70.9(B), Shivaee was tried without a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At trial, Sherry Lawrence testified that Shivaee was the father of her sister's child, who was conceived when Shivaee was 57 years old and Lawrence's sister was 14 years old. Robert H. Steele, III, Shivaee's social worker in the Sex Offender Residential Treatment (\"SORT\") Program while Shivaee was incarcerated, testified that Shivaee did not complete the SORT Program, only \"admitted to some inappropriate touching,\" and remained in denial as to most of his illegal interactions with children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Evan S. Nelson, Ph.D. (\"Dr.Nelson\"), testified as an expert witness on behalf of the Commonwealth. Dr. Nelson stated that Shivaee has a pattern of deviant interest in children, based on four female victims - including the teenage girl he statutorily raped and impregnated - and one male victim, and diagnosed Shivaee with the mental abnormality of pedophilia. Dr. Nelson testified that the mental abnormality of pedophilia creates a risk to re-offend, and opined that inpatient treatment was more suitable for Shivaee than outpatient treatment, especially in light of Shivaee's lack of progress in the SORT program. Dr. Nelson testified that inpatient treatment was \"the right venue to help Mr. Shivaee as well as to protect the public.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Shivaee called one witness on his behalf, John A. Hunter, Jr., Ph.D. (\"Dr.Hunter\"). Dr. Hunter agreed that Shivaee suffered from pedophilia and that there is a risk of recidivism with all pedophiles. However, Dr. Hunter testified that Shivaee would be able to control his behavior with outpatient treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Upon consideration of the evidence, the trial court found by clear and convincing evidence that Shivaee was a sexually violent predator and ordered his civil commitment. Shivaee filed a timely petition for appeal, which we granted. He assigns three errors to the judgment of the trial court: (1) that the SVPA violates both the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and Article I, Sections 8, 9, and 11 of the Constitution of Virginia; (2) that the trial court erred in ordering his civil commitment absent proof that he \"had serious difficulty controlling his behavior\"; and (3) that the evidence failed to satisfy the \"clear and convincing\" evidentiary standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Butler v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Orlando Lawarren Butler (\"Butler\") was convicted of aggravated sexual battery on April 12, 2001 and was sentenced by the Circuit Court of the City of Chesapeake to serve ten years of incarceration with seven years suspended. Pursuant to the SVPA, the Attorney General filed a petition seeking Butler's civil commitment in lieu of his release on August 22, 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Pursuant to Code \u00a7 37.1-70.7, the trial court found probable cause existed that Butler is a sexually violent predator under the SVPA and set the matter for trial before a jury. Prior to trial, Butler filed a motion to dismiss the case on the grounds that the SVPA violates both the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and Article I, Section 11 of the Constitution of Virginia. The trial court denied Butler's motion to dismiss and Butler properly noted his objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 11, 2004, a jury unanimously found by clear and convincing evidence that Butler was a sexually violent predator. On April 6, the trial court held a hearing to determine whether Butler should be civilly committed or conditionally released, and, on May 21, entered its final order that Butler be civilly committed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Butler filed a timely petition for appeal, which we granted. Butler's only assignment of error is that the SVPA is unconstitutional. Butler advances four arguments in support of this contention: (1) the SVPA \"fails to require an independent finding of a serious difficulty in controlling behavior and thus violates substantive due process\"; (2) the SVPA \"fails to meet the threshold standard required for the minimum degree of difficulty required by substantive due process with respect to lack of control as [a] symptom of the mental abnormality or personality disorder for which the subject individual is diagnosed\"; (3) the SVPA \"is not definite and precise in its meaning and can be interpreted and applied in different ways and therefore it is void for vagueness\"; and (4) the SVPA \"fails to comport with the notions of due process as it does not meet the requirements of [\n   <em>\n    Kansas v.

Under the SVPA, a finding that a person is a sexually violent predator includes the finding that the person has a mental abnormality or personality disorder, which is further defined as \"a congenital or acquired condition that affects a person's emotional or volitional capacity and renders the person so likely to commit sexually violent offenses that\n   <em>\n    he constitutes a menace to the health and safety of others.\n   </em>\n   \" Code \u00a7 37.1-70.1 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, proof of dangerousness and lack of control is linked to the condition of the person.

The object of the definitions and proof requirements is \"to distinguish the dangerous sexual offender whose serious mental illness, abnormality, or disorder subjects him to civil commitment from the dangerous but typical recidivist convicted in an ordinary criminal case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9108278\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/534/407/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We are convinced that the SVPA in its definitions and proof requirements accomplishes this objective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In addition to the arguments discussed above, Butler advances the argument that the SVPA is \"void for vagueness.\" He maintains that the language is indefinite and that people of \"ordinary intelligence\" must guess at its meaning. His argument is predicated upon a strained attempt to find multiple meanings in the portion of the definition of a sexually violent predator that recites \"because of a mental abnormality or personality disorder, finds it difficult to control his predatory behavior which makes him likely to engage in sexually violent acts.\" Apparently Butler finds multiple interpretations of this language, primarily because he focuses only on the text of that portion of the definition and fails to consider the language in context of other definitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The definition of sexually violent predator in Code \u00a7 37.1-70.1 makes specific reference to \"mental abnormality\" or \"personality disorder,\" a term also defined in that section. When the language is considered in context, its meaning is quite clear. A \"mental abnormality\" or \"personality disorder\" is defined as \"a congenital or acquired condition that affects a person's emotional or volitional capacity and renders the person so likely to commit sexually violent offenses that he constitutes a menace to the health and safety of others.\" Such a definition includes a causal link between the condition and the potential consequences of the condition, namely, lack of control and dangerousness. Importantly, the definition is personalized because it focuses upon \"the person\" whose commitment is at issue. Because a finding that the person is a sexually violent predator includes the predicate finding of a \"mental abnormality\" or \"personality disorder,\" a fortiori, the determination requires, first, the finding of a condition affecting emotional or volitional capacity and, second, the finding that the particular person subject to commitment is rendered by that condition \"so likely to commit sexually violent offenses\" that he is dangerous. While the additional language in the definition of sexually violent predator (\"finds it difficult to control his predatory behavior which makes him likely to engage in sexually violent acts\") may be redundant, its meaning in context of other definitions in the SVPA is not unclear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Significantly, even under the multiple and strained interpretations Butler tries to give the statute, he does not argue that his conduct fails to be reached. As such, Butler argues hypothetically. In\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Sufficiency of Evidence in Shivaee Case\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Shivaee was found to be a sexually violent predator at the conclusion of a bench trial. In accordance with established principles of appellate review, we view the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party below. We also accord the Commonwealth the benefit of all inferences fairly deducible from the evidence.\n   <em>\n    Stanley v.

Shivaee argues there was not sufficient evidence that he suffered from a mental abnormality as defined by the SVPA and that there was no evidence he was likely to engage in sexually violent acts. A review of the evidence adduced at trial refutes his contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Shivaee was convicted of four sexually violent offenses against four separate victims, three girls and one boy, in less than a five-year period. Shivaee also statutorily raped and impregnated another girl and attempted to hide this information from the SORT Program, Dr. Nelson, and Dr. Hunter. Shivaee continued to deny or minimize his offenses despite treatment in the SORT Program, and he never completed the SORT Program. Shivaee offended against both sexes, was not related to any of his victims, and planned the enticement and seduction of each of his victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In light of this evidence, both experts agreed that Shivaee is a pedophile and is a risk to re-offend. Dr. Nelson stated, \"The diagnosis of which I can express professional certainty is that he meets criteria for pedophilia.\" He stated that Shivaee's behavior \"is indicative of a more predatory pattern of sex offender,\" and that Shivaee \"has a likelihood of having another sex offense, specifically a sexually violent offense as defined here.\" In summarizing his testimony regarding Shivaee's diagnosis of pedophilia and related predatory behavior, the following exchange occurred between the attorney for the Commonwealth and Dr. Nelson:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Q. And, again, to a reasonable degree of psychological certainty do you hold an opinion as to whether [Shivaee] has difficulty controlling that [predatory] behavior?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Q. And what is your opinion?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   A. He absolutely has difficulty in my opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Dr. Hunter also diagnosed Shivaee as a pedophile, but opined that Shivaee \"is not likely to commit a new sexual offense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The experts disagreed as to the course of treatment. Dr. Nelson said Shivaee \"is not going to make, in my opinion, adequate progress on an outpatient basis. Look how little progress he has made in two years of being in an inpatient program thus far.\" Because of his diagnosis as a pedophile, and his lack of progress in the SORT Program, Dr. Nelson recommended inpatient treatment based on his belief that Shivaee is a threat to the public. Dr. Hunter stated that Shivaee \"is amenable to community-based [outpatient] treatment.\" He based this conclusion on his belief that Shivaee could control his behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In light of this evidence, we cannot say that the judgment of the trial court was plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. Shivaee did not dispute that he was incarcerated upon a conviction for a sexually violent offense. Shivaee was clearly diagnosed with the mental abnormality of pedophilia by both experts and there was clear and convincing evidence that because of this mental abnormality Shivaee \"finds it difficult to control his predatory behavior, which makes it likely that he will engage in sexually violent acts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   III. Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   We hold that the SVPA comports with all constitutional requirements of due process and is not unconstitutional. The judgment of the trial court concerning the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to Shivaee was not plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. The judgment of the trial court will be affirmed in both\n   <em>\n    Shivaee v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Butler v. Commonwealth.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Record No. 041954 -\n   <em>\n    Affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Record No. 041945 -\n   <em>\n    Affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
