Branson of the Greensboro, North Carolina Police Department, transported plaintiff (John Clayton) from plaintiff's home in Greensboro to the city magistrate's office. On 19 December 1997 plaintiff filed suit against Branson, both individually and in his official capacity, and against defendants Greensboro Police Department and City of Greensboro (\"the city\"). Plaintiff's complaint was voluntarily dismissed in 1999, but later refiled on 28 April 2000. The complaint alleged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   that: (1) when plaintiff was taken to the magistrate's office, Branson placed him in the back seat of a patrol car equipped with a metal safety screen between the front and back seats; (2) the screen made the back seat too cramped for plaintiff to use a seat belt; (3) on the drive downtown Branson drove 60-70 miles per hour in a 35 mph zone; (4) when another driver stopped on the road in front of them, Branson \"slammed on his brakes and jerked his patrol vehicle to the right and then to the left in order to avoid a collision\"; (5) Branson's maneuvers to avoid a collision \"propelled [plaintiff] forward into the metal screen. . . with great force and violence\"; and (6) as a result of this incident, he \"[had] undergone three surgeries on his back and continue[d] to suffer excruciating and intractable pain to this day.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On the basis of these and other factual allegations, plaintiff brought claims against (1) Branson in his individual and official capacity for negligence, gross negligence, and willful and wanton misconduct; and (2) the Greensboro Police Department and the City of Greensboro on the theory of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior,\n   </em>\n   and for negligent construction and installation of the metal screen in the patrol car. Plaintiff later amended his complaint to add a third claim against the city (the constitutional claim), seeking damages under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for violation of his rights to \"substantive due process and equal protection of the laws\" under the North Carolina and U.S. constitutions. The defendants denied the material allegations of plaintiff's complaint, and raised the defense of governmental immunity. Defendants also moved for summary judgment, which the trial court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants appealed from the denial of their summary judgment motion, and on 15 October 2002 this Court issued its opinion in\n   <em>\n    Clayton v. Branson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9250527\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/153/488/\">\n    153 N.C.App. 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=570%20S.E.2d%20253\">\n    570 S.E.2d 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002) (\"\n   <em>\n    Clayton I\n   </em>\n   \"). The Court held that governmental immunity precluded plaintiff's negligence claims against Branson, the Greensboro Police Department, and the city of Greensboro, and reversed the trial court's denial of summary judgment on these claims. The Court also held that governmental immunity did not bar plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    gross negligence\n   </em>\n   claim against Branson individually, and upheld the court's denial of summary judgment on that claim. Finally, the Court upheld the trial court's denial of summary judgment on plaintiff's \u00a7 1983 constitutional\n   claim, on the basis that \"defendants have no defense of governmental immunity against the \u00a7 1983 claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Clayton I,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9250527\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/153/488/\">\n    153 N.C.App. at 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=570%20S.E.2d%20253\">\n    570 S.E.2d at 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff's surviving claims, against Branson for gross negligence, and against the city for violating his constitutional rights, were tried before a jury in September, 2003. After presentation of evidence, four issues were submitted to the jury:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   1. Was the plaintiff, John A. Clayton, III, injured by the willful or wanton negligence of the defendant T.H. Branson? Answer: Yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   2. What amount is the plaintiff, John A. Clayton, III, entitled to recover for personal injury from the defendant T.H. Branson individually? Answer: $100.00\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   3. Did the City of Greensboro, acting under color of law, violate the plaintiff's Constitutional rights to equal protection of the law and due process of law by asserting the defense of governmental immunity in order to deny the plaintiff the right to seek compensation for his damages? Answer: Yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   4. What amount is the plaintiff, John A. Clayton, III, entitled to recover from the defendant City of Greensboro for deprivation of a Constitutional right? Answer: $1,500,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The verdicts were returned on 26 September 2003, and the trial court entered judgment accordingly on 13 October 2003. On 23 October 2003 defendants filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), or in the alternative for a new trial, remittitur, or an order denying plaintiff prejudgment interest. On 12 February 2004 the trial court entered an order denying defendants' motion for JNOV, and awarding defendants a new trial. The order stated, in pertinent part that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [T]he Court finds that the verdict returned by the jury is internally irreconcilable, inconsistent and inexplicable, that the award of $1,500,000.00 is excessive and against the greater weight of the evidence, and . . . is inconsistent with the evidence presented[.] . . . A new trial is warranted on all issues, pursuant to [N.C.G.S. \u00a7 1A-1,] Rule 59. . . . The Court DENIES defendants' Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict . . . [The Court] orders that the defendants' Motion for New Trial . . . [be] GRANTED . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The parties have appealed from this order; plaintiff appeals the award of a new trial, and defendants cross-appeal the denial of their motions for directed verdict and JNOV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We note initially that the trial court's award of a new trial, as well as its denial of JNOV, are both properly before this Court for appellate review. \"When a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is joined with a motion for a new trial, it is the duty of the trial court to rule on both motions.\"\n   <em>\n    Graves v.

Thus, the trial court correctly entered an order with respect to both of defendants' motions.

However, there was no evidence that, for example, Branson wove across lanes of travel, lost control of the vehicle, or struck any object or person with the patrol car. There was no evidence that Branson was intoxicated, or was racing another vehicle. Although he drove above the legal speed limit, Branson successfully avoided a collision without leaving the roadway or causing other vehicles to collide. Also, there was no evidence of unusual weather or road conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff's claim essentially rests upon evidence that Branson drove 30 or 35 miles above the legal speed limit although he knew plaintiff was not wearing a seat belt, and that he had to brake suddenly and swerve the car to avoid a collision. This evidence is sufficient to establish simple negligence.\n   <em>\n    See Bray v. N.C. Dep't of Crime Control &amp; Pub.

We also note that in the order on appeal, the trial court explained that it had been \"inclined to find as a matter of law that Officer Branson's conduct could not amount to willful and wanton negligence\" but nevertheless declined to do so. And, during a pretrial hearing, plaintiff's attorney acknowledged that \"most people are going to think, well, big deal, so he went fast and he swerved. So what?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We conclude that the evidence, although sufficient to establish negligence, falls far short of the threshold of gross negligence.

We therefore consider whether plaintiff produced evidence that the city arbitrarily treated him differently from \"similarly situated\" claimants by offering monetary settlements to other claimants whose cases were \"in all relevant respects\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   the same as plaintiff's, but not offering a settlement to plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   To support his claim, plaintiff submitted a list of more than 400 incidents occurring in the city between 1992 and 1995. All of these involved a claim for damages caused by a city employee who, at the time of the incident, was operating a vehicle owned by the city and was engaged in a governmental function. For each incident, the list identifies only: (1) the department involved,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   \"City Sanitation truck\" or \"Greensboro police officer\"; (2) the general nature of the incident,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   \"allegedly struck claimant's parked vehicle\" or \"allegedly damaged claimant's mailbox\"; and (3) the outcome,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   \"settled without a lawsuit for X amount\" or \"claim was denied as there was no negligence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Plaintiff's claim essentially suggests that any two claimants are \"similarly situated\" as long as their claims both involve damage caused by a city employee's operation of a city vehicle. But plaintiff offers no support for the premise that the city, or any other party, would ever make decisions about the proper response to a claim based only on bare-bones information such as \"a garbage truck allegedly struck a parked car.\" Indeed, the city's own list of factors for making such determinations is far more nuanced and detailed than that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Moreover, plaintiff's list provides no information about,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,:\n   </em>\n   the claimants' specific factual allegations; the results of any investigation or physical tests that were performed; the availability of credible witnesses for either the claimants or the city employees; whether the claimants were able to document their damages; personal data that could be relevant in equal protection discrimination claims, such as the claimants' age, race, or religion; the availability of defenses such as contributory negligence; the city investigator's subjective opinion on the credibility of the claimants or the city employees; the violations of traffic or criminal laws by either the city employees or the claimants; settlement demands or offers between the parties; or any other factors that might have played a part in the city's decision about whether to offer to settle with the claimants. Without this type of information, no court or jury can possibly determine whether two claimants were \"similarly situated\" with respect to all relevant factors in a settlement decision, or whether the city used an invidious classification scheme in its decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Furthermore, discretionary decisions such as whether to make a settlement offer necessarily implicate a host of subjective factors rightfully reserved for city administrators and elected officials, and it is almost inevitable that any two claimants will be dissimilar as regards one or more factors relevant to settlement offers. Thus, as a practical matter, it would be exceedingly difficult for a plaintiff to show disparate treatment of \"similarly situated\" claimants absent evidence of reliance on an \"inherently suspect criteria.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   We conclude that the plaintiff did not present evidence of either (1) the existence of any \"similarly situated\" claimants who were treated differently from him, or (2) treatment by the city that was arbitrary or irrational. Accordingly, we conclude that plaintiff failed to produce evidence that his right to equal protection was violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, we conclude the plaintiff failed to produce evidence that the city's policies or practices for settling with tort claimants violated his constitutional rights to either substantive or procedural due process or to equal protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   We note that this conclusion does not contradict the holding of\n   <em>\n    Dobrowolska v.

Regarding procedural due process,\n   <em>\n    Dobrowolska\n   </em>\n   correctly noted that \"`[o]nly after finding the deprivation of a protected interest do we look to see if the State's procedures comport with due process.'\"\n   <em>\n    Dobrowolska,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11078355\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/138/1/\">\n    138 N.C.App. at 11-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=530%20S.E.2d%20590\">\n    530 S.E.2d at 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. v. Sullivan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11132829\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/40/#p59\">\n    526 U.S. 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 59,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11132829\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/40/#p59\">\n    119 S.Ct. 977\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11132829\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/40/#p59\">\n    143 L.Ed.2d 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 149 (1999)). The Court cited several rights whose source can easily be identified in the relevant enabling legislation (\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   the right of a qualified applicant to welfare benefits, or the right of a criminal defendant to appeal from conviction). The Court also observed that the generalized right \"implicated\" by the case was the right \"to recover damages,\" which is, of course, true of\n   <strong>\n    all\n   </strong>\n   tort\n   claims. The\n   <em>\n    Dobrowolska\n   </em>\n   Court further held that,\n   <strong>\n    if\n   </strong>\n   plaintiff were able to show a constitutionally protected property right to recover damages from a municipality, the city's enumerated factors would not provide the structure and predictability required for procedural due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Significantly, however,\n   <em>\n    Dobrowolska\n   </em>\n   does not consider, analyze, or determine whether the plaintiff (1) had produced evidence of a constitutionally protected right to recover damages from a North Carolina municipality; (2) had identified a statutory or other legal source of such a right; or (3) had offered evidence of an entitlement, as opposed to a \"unilateral expectation,\" of a settlement offer from the city.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Nor did\n   <em>\n    Dobrowolska\n   </em>\n   hold that the policies and factors that the city used to make settlement determinations were inherently irrational, that they had no relationship to a valid governmental goal, or that they otherwise violated plaintiff's right to substantive due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Finally, as regards the right to equal protection, we note that the list of other claims that plaintiff submitted in the instant case was also a part of the evidence offered by the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Dobrowolska.\n   </em>\n   However, the\n   <em>\n    Dobrowolska\n   </em>\n   Court did not hold that this list, without more, automatically constituted\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence that plaintiff's right to equal protection had been violated. Further, in\n   <em>\n    Dobrowolska,\n   </em>\n   the Court reviewed a different evidentiary record and assessed it in relation to a different claimant. The evidence found in this record does not demonstrate that this plaintiff was treated differently from similarly situated claimants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Given that a city can assert governmental immunity as an affirmative defense to tort claims, cities admittedly have greater bargaining power than claimants when negotiating a settlement. However, it is axiomatic that any change to the law in this area must come from the legislature, not the courts. \"The plaintiff asks us either to abolish governmental immunity or to change the way it is applied.... [A]ny change in this doctrine should come from the General Assembly.\"\n   <em>\n    Blackwelder,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2503328\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/332/319/#p324\">\n    332 N.C. at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=420%20S.E.2d%20432\">\n    420 S.E.2d at 435-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   We conclude that the trial court erred by denying defendants' motion for JNOV, on both the claim of gross negligence and also the constitutional claim.
