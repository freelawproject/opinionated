Workman (\"plaintiff\") total disability compensation. We affirm in part and remand for further findings of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff was employed by REMC as a first-class lineman. His job included repairing damaged electrical power lines, which\n   required him to climb utility poles. On 21 February 1997, plaintiff was injured during the course and scope of his employment when an electrical utility pole fell and landed across his abdominal area. Plaintiff suffered injuries to various parts of his body during the accident, which REMC immediately accepted as compensable. Defendant promptly began paying plaintiff temporary total disability benefits pursuant to Form 60 at the weekly rate of $512.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff underwent two surgeries for internal injuries and digestive complications. In August 1997, he underwent surgery to remove a parathyroid gland. In November 1998, his gall bladder was removed and a hiatal hernia was repaired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 7 January 1998, plaintiff returned to work for REMC as an assistant staking technician earning an average weekly wage of $220.70. Due to the salary reduction, defendant paid plaintiff temporary partial disability benefits pursuant to Form 62 at varying rates depending on the number of hours plaintiff worked. Plaintiff was assigned physically demanding and difficult tasks. His job description, as written by REMC and submitted to plaintiff's doctors for approval, did not include the strenuous physical tasks that plaintiff was actually assigned to do, which included chopping right-of-ways with a bush axe and moving large quantities of dirt with a shovel. These physically demanding tasks aggravated plaintiff's medical condition and caused him to accumulate blood in his urine. As a result, plaintiff was hospitalized and diagnosed with recurrent gross hematuria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After plaintiff was released, he returned to work and was assigned similar work duties. Plaintiff requested less strenuous jobs and was told none were available. On 9 September 1999, Dr. Leon Dickerson (\"Dr. Dickerson\") restricted plaintiff's employment to lifting no greater than thirty pounds occasionally, no prolonged bending, stooping, squatting, or climbing on ladders and no working on rough terrain. On 7 January 2000, Dr. Dickerson continued these work restrictions. Plaintiff was never assigned to light-duty work. According to Dr. Anthony H. Wheeler (\"Dr. Wheeler\"), plaintiff's treating physician, if plaintiff continued to perform on-the-job tasks, such as using a shovel and a bush axe, he would \"eventually become unemployable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff became frustrated with the status of his employment and contacted Sean C. Cobourn, Esquire (\"Cobourn\"), a South Carolina attorney, regarding legal representation. Plaintiff testified Coburn told him a \"joke\" during a telephone conversation:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I asked the lawyer if there was anything that he could do with workmen's comp because they wasn't paying my doctor bills, they wasn't paying me - they was behind paying me and I was behind on my house payment and everything else. I said, \"I need somebody to do something now.\" He [the attorney] laughed and he said, \"Well,\" he said, \"the only thing I know you can do is whip his ass and it will cost you five hundred dollars to do that.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Both plaintiff and Coburn laughed at this remark, and testified it was a \"joke.\" Plaintiff's wife recalled plaintiff retelling the lawyer's \"joke\" to others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During plaintiff's return to work, he became increasingly frustrated with his treatment by defendant. He expressed his discontent regarding medical treatment being denied, receipt of numerous medical collection letters, and difficult working conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In response to plaintiff's increasing frustration, nurse caseworker, Kay Galvin (\"Nurse Galvin\"), submitted a request to the adjuster to approve psychological treatment for plaintiff on 18 January 2000. On 1 February 2000, plaintiff and Nurse Galvin were present at a doctor's office waiting for an appointment when plaintiff repeated the lawyer's \"joke.\" Nurse Galvin reported plaintiff's remarks to REMC. On 7 February 2000, REMC terminated plaintiff for \"workplace violence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On 18 December 2000, plaintiff requested a hearing on claims of a changed medical condition, an inability to agree on the amount of benefits due, defendant's denial of certain medical treatment, and improper termination. After a hearing on 11 April 2003, the Commission entered its opinion and award on 18 November 2003 that: (1) awarded plaintiff\n   total disability compensation \"at the rate of $512.00 per week from 8 February 2000 and continuing until plaintiff returns to work or until further order of the Commission; (2) ordered defendant to pay for medical expenses incurred as a result of the compensable injury as may reasonably be required to [provide treatment for] . . . right knee condition, [ ] impotence, blood in urine, and problems with urination . . . and [ ] depression;\" and (3) ordered defendant to provide plaintiff with vocational rehabilitation services.

Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal from the Commission in a workers' compensation claim, our standard of review requires us to consider: whether there is any competent evidence in the record to support the Commission's findings of fact and whether these findings support the Commission's conclusions of law. The findings of fact made by the Commission are conclusive upon appeal when supported by competent evidence, even when there is evidence to support a finding to the contrary. In weighing the evidence the Commission is the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony and may reject a witness' testimony entirely if warranted by disbelief of that witness. Where no exception is taken to a finding of fact. . ., the finding is presumed to be supported by competent evidence and is binding on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Bass v.

In disputes like the one at bar, the critical area of inquiry into the circumstances of an injured employee's termination is to determine from the evidence whether the employee's failure to perform is due to an\n   <em>\n    inability\n   </em>\n   to perform or an\n   <em>\n    unwillingness\n   </em>\n   to perform.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 494,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=597%20S.E.2d%20695\">\n    597 S.E.2d at 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Our Supreme Court further noted\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   the pertinent inquiry under\n   <em>\n    Seagraves\n   </em>\n   is not focused on determining whether an employer may fire an injured employee for misconduct unrelated to his injuries; it is clear that an employer may do so.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   N.C.G.S. \u00a7 95-241(b) (2003). Rather, the relevant question is determining whether, upon firing an injured employee for such misconduct, an employer can nevertheless be held responsible for continuing to pay injury benefits to the terminated employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 494,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=597%20S.E.2d%20695\">\n    597 S.E.2d at 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendant contends the Commission erred by finding, \"Defendant has presented no evidence that a worker who said what plaintiff did would have been terminated as plaintiff was. The case presented regarding the fired worker who committed assault presents a completely different factual paradigm.\" Competent evidence in the record supports this finding. The only evidence defendant presented regarding termination of an employee for workplace violence was testimony that a right-of-way crew foreman with REMC was fired for engaging in \"a fight at a store on company time.\" That employee was not a workers' compensation claimant at the time of his termination and was subsequently rehired by employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Commission distinguished the instance wherein that employee engaged in actual physical violence. If plaintiff had engaged in physical violence on the job, the result here may well have been different. According to defendant, plaintiff was fired for making \"threats\" towards other employees. However, no evidence was presented to show that an employee who made \"threats\" similar to the statements made by plaintiff would have been terminated.\n   <em>\n    See id.; see also Frazier v.
