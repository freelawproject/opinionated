Plaintiffs alleged that, in contravention of Wal-Mart policies and unwritten contracts with Plaintiffs, Wal-Mart engaged in widespread wage and hour abuses, including failing to record and pay for all of the time employees were required to work and failing to permit employees to take or complete lunch and rest breaks.

Lopez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9375669\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/93/548/\">\n    93 S.W.3d 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex.App.2002), the plaintiffs brought a class action on behalf of Wal-Mart employees forced to work off the clock and denied rest and meal breaks. The Court of Appeals of Texas, Fourteenth District, held:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [I]ndividual issues regarding the formation of 350,000 contracts in this case will predominate over any common issues. Appellees claim Wal-Mart made express [and implied] contractual offers of rest and meal breaks during the orientation process. Because each orientation session was conducted by different Wal-Mart personnel at different stores, proof of an oral contract with each class member will require a determination of the terms of the contract through offer and acceptance. Any determination concerning a \"meeting of the minds\" necessarily requires an individual inquiry into what each class member, as well as the Wal-Mart employee who allegedly made the offer, said and did. A determination must also be made as to the\n   authority of each Wal-Mart manager who allegedly made such an offer and each employee's belief regarding whether that manager had or lacked authority to make the offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Even if appellees establish Wal-Mart had 350,000 oral contracts to provide rest and meal breaks, individual issues regarding the alleged breach of each contract will also predominate over common issues. Affidavits of current and former Wal-Mart employees submitted by appellees raise individual issues. For example, a number of employees state they missed rest and meal breaks, but offer no explanation for why they missed their breaks,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   whether store management required the employee to work through the break or whether the employee voluntarily chose not to take a break for personal reasons, or why no time adjustment request form was submitted to reflect the hours worked so the employee could be appropriately compensated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9375669\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/93/548/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9375669\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/93/548/\">\n    at 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Here, with regard to contract formation, Plaintiffs concede that \"[c]lass members did not have written contracts with Wal-Mart....\" Moreover, \"Plaintiffs do not contend that the [employee] Handbook [containing Wal-Mart's policies] is a contract.\" Plaintiffs instead allege that unwritten, unilateral contracts existed between themselves and Wal-Mart. The trial court held that individual issues predominate as to the formation and terms of Plaintiffs' contracts, stating,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   \"that the evidence on how the alleged contract[s were] formed will vary from associate-to-associate [sic][,]\" that \"a determination of the particular terms of each class member's oral, implied or unilateral agreement is going to turn on the individual accounts of conversations and representations made by countless numbers of present and former hourly Personnel Managers[,]\" and that \"deposition testimony establishes that putative class members have no uniform understanding with respect to the alleged contracts with Wal-Mart.\" These findings and conclusions are supported by competent evidence, including depositions and affidavits indicating, for example, that: (1) some putative class members learned of the opportunity to take rest and meal breaks prior to employment while others learned of the opportunity to take rest and meal breaks after accepting employment; (2) some putative class members understood their rest breaks to be paid while others understood the breaks to be unpaid; and (3) some putative class members believed they were entitled to meal breaks after eight hours of work while others believed they were entitled to such breaks after six or seven hours of work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   With regard to alleged breaches, the trial court stated \"each member of the putative class will be required to show that there was a breach of his or her purported contract.\" The trial court found that Wal-Mart's Time Clock Archive Reports would not be a reliable source for showing breach, as \"[a]ssociates, including named Plaintiff Harrison, admitted that they did not always swipe the time clock when they took their breaks or meal periods.\" The trial court concluded that, to determine whether a breach occurred, it would need to examine,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   why an associate missed his/her breaks. The trial court found that putative class members testified that they missed breaks voluntarily,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   in order to leave work early.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We hold that the trial court's findings, which are supported by competent evidence, and conclusions, supported by (strikingly similar) persuasive authority from another jurisdiction, are neither manifestly unsupported by reason nor so arbitrary that they could not have been the result of a reasoned decision. We thus conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that individual issues would predominate with regard to Plaintiffs' breach of contract claims.\n   <em>\n    Am. Sec. Life Assurance Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8525895\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/109/530/#p538\">\n    109 N.C.App. at 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=428%20S.E.2d%20200\">\n    428 S.E.2d at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiffs also pled unjust enrichment and quantum meruit. The trial court concluded that those claims:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   will require a person-by-person examination of the circumstances of every missed rest break or meal period to determine whether Wal-Mart was unjustly enriched. Indeed, a person-by-person and event-by-event inquiry will be necessary to determine whether a putative class member even claims unjust enrichment since many\n   putative class members testified that they experienced none of the alleged problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   While Plaintiffs excepted to this conclusion in their twenty-sixth assignment of error, contending that the trial court \"erroneously determined that the plaintiffs' claims for unjust enrichment and quantum meruit would require a person-by-person or event-by-event inquiry[,]\" they failed to cite and argue this assignment of error in their appellate briefing. This assignment of error is therefore deemed abandoned. N.C. R.App. P. 28(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs pled violations of North Carolina's Wage and Hour Act, which states that \"[a]ny employer who violates the provisions of ... G.S. 95-25.6 through 95-25.12 (Wage Payment) shall be liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of their unpaid ... wages.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 95-25.22(a) (2004). With regard to the wage and hour claim, the trial court found that the requisite proof \"will involve an analysis of time records for each putative class member and investigation into any unique issues that may have been present in each particular store at the time of the alleged violations.\" Plaintiffs assign error to this conclusion, contending the trial court erred \"in determining that individual issues predominate over the plaintiffs' common claim that Wal-Mart violated the N.C. Wage and Hour Act by depriving class members rest breaks, failing to compensate class members for rest breaks, and failing to compensate class members for off-the-clock work.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Similar to the breach of contract claims discussed above, the Wage and Hour Act claims would require individual determinations, including which putative class members were subject to the alleged violations and why those putative class members who worked off-the-clock did so,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   whether they, for example, missed breaks in order to leave work early. Moreover, in the strikingly similar\n   <em>\n    Lopez,\n   </em>\n   the court noted that the plaintiffs' statutory wage and hour argument, which was not preserved, would require individual inquiries. We find the trial court's conclusion here that individual rather than common issues predominate regarding Plaintiffs' statutory claim to be neither manifestly unsupported by reason nor so arbitrary that they could not have been the product of a reasoned decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In sum, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that individual rather than common issues predominate Plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   C. Existence of Conflicts of Interest\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The trial court also determined that the named plaintiffs in the instant case would not adequately represent the class. Plaintiffs argue that this determination was in error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As previously stated, to bring a class action \"the named representatives must establish that they will fairly and adequately represent the interests of all members of the class\" and \"there must be no conflict of interest between the named representatives and members of the class....\"\n   <em>\n    Faulkenbury,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"53926\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/345/683/#p699\">\n    345 N.C. at 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=483%20S.E.2d%20422\">\n    483 S.E.2d at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"This prerequisite is a requirement of due process.

The findings support the court's conclusion that it could not \"certify a class in which some putative class members assert that other putative class members caused or contributed to the wrongs asserted and the latter deny the assertion. This puts class members who acted as supervisors in direct conflict with the class members they supervised.\" We find this conclusion to be neither manifestly\n   unsupported by reason nor so arbitrary that it could not have been the product of a reasoned decision.
