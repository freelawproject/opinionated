He argues that the district court erred and abused its discretion by denying his motion because he would not be considered a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 if he were resentenced now because his prior conviction for delivery of a controlled substance is no longer considered a predicate felony under \u00a7 4B1.1. He asserts that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), should apply in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, allowing the district court to recalculate the guidelines range and to determine an appropriate sentence based upon the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Black acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed, but he raises it to preserve it for further review. He also argues that he is eligible for relief because, in the determination that he should be sentenced as a career offender, the offense level under \u00a7 4B1.1 was compared to the offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, and therefore his sentence is based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered within the meaning of \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-21\">Black may not use a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to relitigate whether he is a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995). As he acknowledges, his assertion that <em>Booker </em>should apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings is foreclosed. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number><em>States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). Further, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying relief because \u201c[t]he crack cocaine guideline amendments do not apply to prisoners sentenced as career offenders.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b387-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
