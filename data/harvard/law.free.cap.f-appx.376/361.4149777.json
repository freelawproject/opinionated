The Government moves for summary affirmance, arguing that Mallory was ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because he was sentenced not under the crack cocaine Guideline but as a career offender, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Because Mallory\u2019s guidelines imprisonment range was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense, but rather from his career offender status, the district court was correct in concluding that a sentencing reduction was not permitted. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790-91 (5th Cir.2009). Mallory argues that, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court should have the authority pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his term of imprisonment notwithstanding his status as a career offender. This argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). Mallory concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Doublin </em>but seeks to preserve the argument for possible Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time in which to file a brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
