Chavarry contends his original conviction of money laundering should be vacated because the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>United States v. Santos, </em>553 U.S. 507, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008), and <em>Regalado Cuellar v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 550, 128 S.Ct. 1994, 170 L.Ed.2d 942 (2008), subsequently redefined the elements of money laundering such that he was convicted based upon conduct that is no longer defined as criminal. He further contends his original guilty plea has thus been rendered involuntary by these cases. Broadly construing his pro se brief, Cha-varry contends the district court erred by failing to grant a writ of <em>audita querela </em>or a writ of <em>coram nobis </em>to vacate his conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the question of whether a prisoner may challenge his sentence by filing a motion for a writ of <em>audita querela.\u201d United States v. Holt, </em>417 F.3d 1172, 1174 (11th Cir.2005). We review \u201ca denial of <em>coram nobis </em>relief for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Alikhani v. United States, </em>200 F.3d 732, 734 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">The All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a), grants federal courts the power to issue \u201call writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201d The Act, however, \u201cdoes not authorize [courts] to issue ad hoc writs whenever compliance with statutory procedures appears inconvenient or less appropriate.\u201d <em>Pa. Bureau of Corr. v. U.S. Marshals Serv., </em>474 U.S. 34, 106 S.Ct. 355, 361, 88 L.Ed.2d 189 (1985). In <em>Holt, </em>we held that a writ of <em>audita querela, </em>\u201can ancient writ used to attack the enforcement of a judgment after it was rendered,\u201d can be granted only when relief is not \u201ccognizable under \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Holt, </em>417 F.3d at 1174-75. Similarly, in <em>Alikhani, </em>we held that a writ of <em>coram nobis, </em>another post-conviction writ, may only be issued when: (1) \u201cthere is and was no other available avenue of relief\u2019; and (2) \u201cthe error involves a matter of fact of the most fundamental character which has not been put in issue or passed upon and which renders the proceeding itself irregular and invalid.\u201d <em>Alikhani, </em>200 F.3d at 734 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">We conclude that the district court did not err in denying Chavarry\u2019s petition. At the time he filed his petition, Chavarry was in custody and thus could have collaterally attacked his conviction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In fact, Chavarry did raise identical claims in a prior \u00a7 2255 petition. Because Chavarry was able to seek relief under \u00a7 2255, the district court did not err by holding that the writs of <em>audita querela </em>and <em>coram nobis </em>were unavailable. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b952-8\">. We do not treat Chavarry's petition as a motion filed pursuant to \u00a7 2255 because any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>such motion would be successive and Chavar-ry has not sought leave to file a successive petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>181 F.3d 1274, 1275 (11th Cir.1999) (deciding not to treat appellant\u2019s petition for a writ of <em>coram nobis </em>as a motion pursuant to \u00a7 2255 when such motion would be considered successive).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b953-7\">. Although Chavarry was serving a sentence for an unrelated drug conviction, he also faced a consecutive sentence of 15 months\u2019 imprisonment for revocation of his supervised release relating to his money laundering offense. For purposes of \u00a7 2255, Chavarry is considered in custody for both offenses. <em>See Garlotte v. Fordice, </em>515 U.S. 39, 115 S.Ct. 1948, 1949-50, 132 L.Ed.2d 36 (1995) (holding that a prisoner serving consecutive sentences is considered in custody under each sentence); <em>United States v. Woods, </em>127 F.3d 990, 992-93 (11th Cir.1997) (holding that a sentence imposed for revocation of supervised release \u201cconstitutes part of a defendant\u2019s original sentence\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
