Finding no error, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-13\">Appellants seek declaratory relief, in-junctive relief, compensatory damages, and punitive damages for the assessment of Mississippi state taxes. Appellants claim the tax laws are being administered in a fraudulent and racially discriminatory manner. Specifically, Appellants allege that state tax assessors are over-valuing black farmers\u2019 homes and farms (including theirs) while under-valuing white farmers\u2019 homes and farms. Appellants also argue that the relevant state tax laws do not allow a sufficient period of time to appeal any tax assessment of their property. Appellants claim that the laws and the state officials\u2019 actions violate the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution. Appellants bring their claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985 and 2000d.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-18\">In dismissing the case, the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction to review Appellants\u2019 claims. Specifically, the court based its decision on the jurisdictional language of the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, which prohibits district courts from \u201cenjoin[ing], suspending] or restraining] the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.\u201d <em>See also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-19\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a case based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo. <em>See Home Builders Ass\u2019n of Miss., Inc. v. City of Madison, Miss., </em>143 F.3d 1006, 1010 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-20\">Appellants argue that the district court erred by applying the Tax Injunction Act to bar Appellants\u2019 claims. However, Appellants\u2019 claims are precisely the type of claims foreclosed by the Act, as demonstrated by our precedents. <em>See, e.g., Home Builders, </em>143 F.3d at 1012-13; <em>Bland v. McHann, </em>463 F.2d 21, 24 (5th Cir.1972). For example, in <em>Home Builders, </em>the plaintiffs filed suit against the city pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 regarding a $700 impact fee that the city imposed as a condition to obtaining a building permit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number><em>See Home Builders, </em>143 F.3d at 1009. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, in-junctive relief, and a refund of the impact fees. <em>See id. </em>The plaintiffs argued that the impact fees were \u201c \u2018nothing more than an improper, unlawful and unconstitutional form of taxation or general tax.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>After discussing what constituted a \u201ctax\u201d under the Act, we affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal, holding that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by the Act. <em>See id. </em>at 1012-13. Specifically, we found that Mississippi state law provided a \u201cplain, speedy and efficient remedy\u201d for challenging the state\u2019s tax laws. <em>See id. </em>at 1012. Thus, the federal courts had no jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Similarly, in <em>Bland, </em>the plaintiffs brought a civil rights claim of racial discrimination pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against municipal officials for what the plaintiffs alleged were discriminatory ad valorem tax assessments. See <em>Bland, </em>463 F.2d at 23. The plaintiffs sought both injunctive relief and a refund of past taxes paid. <em>See id. </em>at 23 n. 2. After a trial, the district court dismissed the case, holding that the Tax Injunction Act barred relief. <em>See id. </em>at 23-24. Specifically, the court held that there were adequate remedies for the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in Mississippi state courts. <em>See id. </em>On appeal, we upheld the case\u2019s dismissal pursuant to the Act but faulted the district court for allowing the case to first go to trial. <em>See id. </em>at 24. In describing the breadth of claims prohibited by the Act, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">We are convinced that both longstanding judicial policy and congressional restriction of federal jurisdiction in cases involving state tax administration make it the duty of federal courts to withhold relief when a state legislature has provided an adequate scheme whereby a taxpayer may maintain a suit to challenge a state tax.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">Because Mississippi state law provided adequate relief for the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, we held that the district court should have dismissed the case before reaching the merits. <em>See id. </em>at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">As in the cases above, Appellants seek declaratory relief, injunctive relief and damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for taxes that they claim are unconstitutional and that are allegedly administered in a discriminatory fashion. Neither party disputes the district court\u2019s holding that the taxes in question are of the type contemplated under the Tax Injunction Act. In addition, we have already held Mississippi law to provide an adequate remedy for such claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants\u2019 claims are therefore indistinguishable for jurisdictional purposes from those brought in <em>Home Builders </em>and <em>Bland. </em>Accordingly, the district court correctly dismissed them as barred by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">Appellants further argue that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hibbs v. Winn </em>\u201ccleared the way\u201d for Appellants to bring their suit in federal court. <em>See Hibbs, </em>542 U.S. 88, 124 S.Ct. 2276, 159 L.Ed.2d 172 (2004). However, <em>Hibbs </em>is readily distinguishable from the instant case. In <em>Hibbs, </em>the plaintiff taxpayers challenged the constitutionality of a state statute that provided tax <em>credits </em>to third parties attending private religious schools. <em>See Hibbs, </em>542 U.S. at 92, 124 S.Ct. at 2281. The Court noted at the outset that \u201cPlaintiffs-respondents do not contest their own tax liability. Nor do they seek to impede Arizona\u2019s receipt of tax revenues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based on these facts, the Court held that the Tax Injunction Act did not bar the plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>claims. <em>See id. </em>at 111-12, 124 S.Ct. at 2292. We have therefore interpreted <em>Hibbs </em>to allow challenges to state tax laws in federal court \u201conly where (1) a third party (not the taxpayer) files suit, and (2) the suit\u2019s success will enrich, not deplete, the government entity\u2019s coffers.\u201d <em>Henderson v. Stalder, </em>407 F.3d 351, 359 (5th Cir.2005) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">In the instant case, Appellants are the alleged taxpayers, and they expressly seek relief from state tax laws as applied to them. Moreover, any consequent relief this court could fashion based on the alleged facts would involve the \u201cdisruption of \u2018state tax administration\u2019 ... specifically in relation to \u2018the collection of revenue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hibbs, </em>542 U.S. at 105, 124 S.Ct. at 2288 (quoting <em>Cal. v. Grace Brethren Church, </em>457 U.S. 393, 410, 102 S.Ct. 2498, 73 L.Ed.2d 93 (1982) (additional cite omitted)). Accordingly, Appellants\u2019 suit violates both prongs of the <em>Hibbs </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Finally, we note that Appellants focus much of their appellate arguments on seeking relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d rather than pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, although both statutes are cited in their complaint. As the language of the Tax Injunction Act makes clear, the bar to federal jurisdiction does not depend on the federal statute or constitutional provision that the tax law allegedly violates; rather, jurisdiction depends on whether the relief sought requires the federal court to \u201cenjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law[.]\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341; <em>see also Hibbs, </em>542 U.S. at 99, 124 S.Ct. at 2284 (\u201cTo determine whether this litigation falls within [the Act\u2019s] prohibition, it is appropriate, first, to identify the relief sought.\u201d). As stated above, Appellants expressly seek declaratory and injunctive relief from the application of Mississippi state tax law, as well as compensatory and punitive damages for past improper tax assessments. These are precisely the kinds of relief barred by the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Home Builders, </em>143 F.3d at 1012-13; <em>Bland, </em>463 F.2d at 24. Accordingly, we do not reach the question of whether Appellants could otherwise state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b446-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b447-6\">. The relevant state laws governing tax remedies in state court have not changed since <em>Home Builders. See Home Builders, </em>143 F.3d at 1009; Miss.Code Ann \u00a7 11-13-11 (West 2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b448-6\">. Indeed, it is unclear what relief Appellants could seek based on the alleged facts that does not fall under the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b448-9\">. Were we to reach the merits of this claim, however, we would note that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d bars unlawful \"discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d Appellants have pointed to no case law or precedent that regards state tax collection as a \"program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d Therefore, it is unclear how \u00a7 2000d would even apply in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
