The district court sentenced Lopez-Martinez to 60 months imprisonment. He challenges the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">\u201cWe review sentencing decisions only for abuse of discretion, and we use a two-step process.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence&amp;emdash;including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). If we find the sentence to be proeedurally sound, the second step is to review the \u201csubstantive reasonableness\u201d of the sentence, taking into account the totality of the circumstances, \u201cincluding the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-13\">Lopez-Martinez contends that the district court committed procedural error by faffing to consider all the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We disagree. The district court discussed several of them on the record and before imposing a sentence it stated that it had \u201cconsider[ed] the advisory guidelines and all the factors identified in Title 18 of the United States Code, Section 3553(a)l through 7.\u201d The district court\u2019s acknowledgment that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u201calone is sufficient in post-Booker sentences.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-14\">Despite that acknowledgment, Lopez-Martinez contends that the district court did not consider \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D): \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed ... to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D). At sentencing, the district court stated: \u201cI don\u2019t find anything with regard to providing him with needed educational or vocational training, medical care or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner. That factor doesn\u2019t play into my assessment here nor do the other ones.\u201d Based on that statement, Lopez-Martinez asserts the district court expressly refused to consider \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D). A careful review of the record makes clear that the district court considered \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D) but concluded that Lopez-Martinez\u2019s sentence should not be adjusted on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>Lopez-Martinez also contends that the district court procedurally erred by considering his earlier convictions for illegally reentering the United States in applying the \u00a7 3558(a) factors. Because those convictions were already taken into account in calculating his advisory guidelines range, he argues that the district court impermis-sibly \u201cdoubt-counted\u201d those convictions. We rejected a similar argument in <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823 (11th Cir.2007). As in <em>Amedeo, </em>Lopez-Martinez \u201cpoints to no authority that deems it impermissible for [a] district court to ... have considered [conduct already accounted for in a Guidelines enhancement] in imposing a variance in light of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 833-34. We conclude that no procedural error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Lopez-Martinez also challenges the substantive reasonableness of his 60-month sentence. He argues that his sentence is greater than necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing because it is five times longer than the longest sentence he has received in the past \u2014 a sentence of 1 year and 1 day. We cannot say that Lopez-Martinez\u2019s 60-month sentence \u2014 a sentence half the statutory maximum \u2014 is substantively unreasonable. Although he has been deported four times, Lopez-Martinez continues to violate the United States\u2019 immigration laws by illegally reentering this country. The mere fact that Lopez-Martinez has received more lenient sentences in the past does not make his sentence substantively unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
