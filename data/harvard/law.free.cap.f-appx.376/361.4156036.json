He argues that, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court was authorized to reduce his sentence based on the new advisory guidelines range and after consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. He further contends that his career offender status did not preclude the court from reducing his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-21\">Penn concedes that these issues are foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent, but raises the issues in order to preserve them for further review. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790-91 (5th Cir.2009), and <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
