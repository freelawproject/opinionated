On appeal, he contends his sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Specifically, he asserts the district court failed to \u201cenumerate which of the [\u00a7 3553(a) ] factors mattered most in its decision\u201d and failed to adequately consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including his personal history and characteristics as well as his medical history.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-20\">We review the reasonableness of a district court\u2019s sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We first review whether the district court committed a procedural error, such as improperly calculating the Guidelines range, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, or inadequately explaining the chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 597. When explaining the sentence, however, the court is not required to \u201cstate on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, the court\u2019s acknowledgment that it has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors together with the parties\u2019 arguments is sufficient. <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-21\">Once we determine a sentence is procedurally sound, we must examine whether the sentence is substantively reasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). The factors presented in \u00a7 3553(a) include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 786 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). \u201c[W]hen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788. \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing a within Guidelines sentence of 46 months\u2019 imprisonment. There were no procedural errors in Sanchez-Guerrero\u2019s sentence because the district court properly calculated the Guidelines range, based the sentence on undisputed facts set forth in the PSI, treated the Guidelines as advisory, and expressly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court\u2019s sentence is also substantively reasonable. Although Sanchez-Guerrero claims the district court should have given more weight to certain other factors, the court did not abuse its discretion by finding that, given his criminal record, a 46-month sentence was appropriate to promote the goals of punishment and deterrence. Moreover, the court\u2019s sentence represents the lowest end of the applicable Guidelines range and is also well below the 20-year statutory maximum penalty. We therefore conclude that the sentence imposed is both procedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
