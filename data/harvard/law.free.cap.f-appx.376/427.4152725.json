We withdraw our previous opinion, <em>Koroma v. Holder, </em>No. 09-60233, 2010 WL 597404 (5th Cir. Feb. 12, 2010) (per cu-riam), and substitute the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b451-18\">* * :|:</p>\n<p id=\"b451-19\">Mambu Jusu Koroma, a citizen of Sierra Leone, petitioned for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) March 5, 2009 order, dismissing his appeal of the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) June 7, 2006 decision denying Koroma\u2019s motion to terminate removal proceedings and ordering him removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-23\">Koroma separately filed a motion to reopen with the BIA, and on December 7, 2009, the BIA granted the motion. The BIA remanded the case to an IJ for further proceedings. Counsel did not inform the Court of these developments in Koro-ma\u2019s case and we proceeded to the merits of Koroma\u2019s petition for review of the March 5th BIA order.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-24\">The BIA\u2019s decision to reopen Koroma\u2019s removal proceedings deprives us of jurisdiction over his petition. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) (limiting this Court\u2019s jurisdiction to \u201cfinal order[s] of removal\u201d); <em>see also Moreira v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 709, 712-14 (5th Cir.2007) (declining to \u201cconstrue[ ] [the alien\u2019s petition] as requesting review of the BIA\u2019s eventual dismissal of his appeal\u201d and dismissing the petition absent a final order of removal). Therefore, we DISMISS Koroma\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-25\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b451-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
