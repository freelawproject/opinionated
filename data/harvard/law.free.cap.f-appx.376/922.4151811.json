Wiggins relies on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2008) and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), to support his claim that carrying a concealed weapon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>does not constitute a crime of violence for sentencing purposes. As such, he argues that he did not qualify for the career offender enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and thus his sentence should be reduced under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions regarding the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). Although a district court generally cannot modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed, an exception lies in \u00a7 3582(c)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The policy statements provide that \u00a7 3582 encompasses challenges to the application of only those Guidelines that have been retroactively amended; the district court must leave all other Guideline decisions unaffected. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l); <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201c[A]ll original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">Here, Wiggins has not alleged a cognizable claim under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because his request for a reduced sentence relies on case decisions, not a retroactive Guideline amendment. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220-21 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that because Booker<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is a Supreme Court decision rather than a retroactive Guideline amendment, it does not provide an independent basis for a motion that is otherwise not cognizable under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)); <em>see also Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 782 (holding that \u201c[e]xtraneous resentenc-ing issues\u201d are not cognizable in \u00a7 3582 motions, and must be brought as \u00a7 2255 collateral attacks to the sentence). Therefore, Wiggins is not entitled to \u00a7 3582 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b947-23\">. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b947-7\">. Section 3582(c)(2) states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKQk\">[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)] to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
