Ramsey argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized from his vehicle. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">Ramsey argues that the search of his vehicle was invalid under state law and rendered the search unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, but this argument fails. The failure of law enforcement officers to comply with the demands of state law regarding the search and seizure of property does not affect the admissibility of evidence in federal court. <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>942 F.2d 1537, 1541 (11th Cir.1991). Evidence is admissible so long as it was not \u201cobtained by state officers during a search which, if conducted by federal officers, would have violated the defendant\u2019s immunity from unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth Amendment,\u201d <em>Elkins v. United States, </em>364 U.S. 206, 223-24, 80 S.Ct. 1437, 1447, 4 L.Ed.2d 1669 (1960), and Ramsey does not argue that the search or seizure otherwise violated the Fourth Amendment. The district court did not err by admitting at trial the evidence seized from Ramsey\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">Ramsey\u2019s convictions are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
