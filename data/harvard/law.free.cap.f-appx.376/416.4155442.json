The IJ determined, <em>inter alia, </em>that Mireles-Ontiveros was ineligible for cancellation of removal because his conviction for failure to stop and render aid was a crime involving moral turpitude. The IJ also decided that Mireles-Ontiveros was not eligible for voluntary departure, because he had been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude and thus had failed to establish good moral character during the previous five years. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-23\">Mireles-Ontiveros argues that the Texas state court had deferred adjudication of the prior offense, so the conviction had not become final, nor did it qualify as a \u201cconviction\u201d for immigration purposes. Because, however, Mireles-Ontiveros pleaded guilty to failure to stop and render aid and was required, as part of his probation, <em>inter alia </em>to perform 200 hours of community service and attend anger management classes, the deferred adjudication constituted a conviction for immigration purposes. <em>See Moosa v. I.N.S., </em>171 F.3d 994, 1005-06 (5th Cir.1999). Furthermore, there is no requirement of finality in the statutory definition of \u201cconviction,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A). <em>See id. </em>at 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-24\">Mireles-Ontiveros contends that his removal based on commission of a crime violated the Double Jeopardy Clause, because the removal constituted a second punishment for the same offense. To the contrary, \u201cdeportation proceedings are not criminal prosecutions.\u201d <em>See Brown v. I.N.S., </em>856 F.2d 728, 731 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Mireles-Ontiveros also briefly asserts that \u00a7 440(d) of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act and \u00a7 348(a) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act violate his equal protection and due process rights. He has failed to brief those issues and thus has abandoned them. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Beasley v. McCotter, </em>798 F.2d 116, 118 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b440-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
