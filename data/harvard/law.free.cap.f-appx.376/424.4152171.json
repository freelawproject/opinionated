The district court ordered McCastle to pay an initial partial filing fee of $0.17. When McCastle did not pay the fee within the specified time, the district court, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b), dismissed his complaint for failure to prosecute and failure to obey a court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">McCastle has not provided, in this court or in the district court, the reason for his nonpayment of the partial filing fee. Nor has he indicated that he has or will pay the partial filing fee. McCastle has therefore waived the issue presented by this appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993); <em>see also, Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b449-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
