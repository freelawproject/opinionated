Gonzalez asserts that the BIA erred in reversing the IJ\u2019s decision because the BIA failed to engage in a substantive review of the facts as the IJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>had done. He also maintains, however, that the BIA reviewed the facts de novo but failed to consider many positive factors that weighed in favor of granting relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">To the extent that Gonzalez challenges the BIA\u2019s discretionary denial of relief, we lack jurisdiction to consider this contention. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B); <em>Delgado-Reynua v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 596, 599-600 (5th Cir.2006). Gonzalez attempts to circumvent this jurisdictional limitation by arguing that his claim concerning the BIA\u2019s method of analysis presents a legal question. This argument is unavailing. <em>See Delgado-Reynua, </em>450 F.3d at 599-600; <em>see also Sung v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 372, 377 (5th Cir.2007) (holding that the court lacked jurisdiction over a claim that the agency failed to consider all relevant factors in denying cancellation of removal). Gonzalez\u2019s petition for review is thus DISMISSED for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
