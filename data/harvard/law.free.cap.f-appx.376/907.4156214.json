We granted a certificate of appealability to determine \u201c[wjhether, the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) <em>(en </em>banc) by failing to address Crutchley5 s claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal.\u201d Crutchley argues on appeal that the district court\u2019s failure to address his claim that his counsel was ineffective for refusing to file a notice of appeal on Crutchley\u2019s behalf constituted a violation of Clisby\u2019s rule that a district court must address all claims, including ineffective assistance claims, set forth in a \u00a7 2255 motion. After careful review, we vacate and remand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">When reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law <em>de novo. Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">Expressing our \u201cdeep concern over the piecemeal litigation of federal habeas petitions,\u201d in <em>Clisby </em>we exercised our supervisory authority and instructed the district courts to resolve all claims for relief raised in a petition for habeas corpus, regardless of whether habeas relief is granted or denied. <em>Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 935-36 (involving a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition filed by a state prisoner); <em>see Rhode v. United States, </em>583 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2009) (holding that <em>Clisby </em>applies to \u00a7 2255 motions). When a district court fails to address all of the claims presented in a habeas petition, we \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims.\u201d <em>Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-14\">A \u201cclaim for relief\u2019 is defined as \u201cany allegation of a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 936. In determining whether a claim was adequately raised, we have held that <em>\u201c[p]ro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998). Ineffective assistance of counsel constitutes a violation of a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights, and thus is a claim of a constitutional violation. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 684-96, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-15\">Under the less stringent standard employed for <em>pro se </em>litigants, Crutchley properly raised his claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal in his \u00a7 2255 motion, in his memorandum in support of that motion, and in reply to the government\u2019s answer. <em>See Tannenbaum, </em>148 F.3d at 1263. Because the district court failed to address this claim, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice, and remand to the district court solely for consideration of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-16\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b932-10\">. However, Appellant's motion, filed pursuant to Fed.R.App.P. 23(a), in which he requests to be transferred to the custody of a federal prison within the territorial jurisdiction of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, is DENIED.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
