The court held that the police had probable cause and, alternatively, conducted the search pursuant to a valid inventorying. We affirm the probable cause finding and do not reach the inventory question.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\u201cWhen considering the denial of a motion to suppress, this court reviews the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its Fourth Amendment conclusions de novo.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The record shows the district court did not clearly err in finding these facts: Two police officers observed an illegally parked car with four people inside. The occupants were holding up sheets in front of the windows to conceal their activities. Upon noticing the police, the four occupants exited and scattered. The police approached and quickly apprehended the suspects, one of whom was Payne. Patting him down, one officer found a pill, which Payne said was hydro-codone; Payne confessed that he had no prescription. The officer arrested him and read him his rights. Searching Payne incident to arrest, the officer found a syringe which Payne said he used for injecting methamphetamine. Payne admitted he owned the illegally parked car and that he did drugs in it. The other suspects \u2014 one of whom had thrown meth into the bushes while fleeing \u2014 also admitted to using the car to do drugs. The police determined they had probable cause to search the car. They found no contraband in the passenger compartment, but opened the trunk to find Payne\u2019s pipe bomb.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-15\">\u201cIt is well settled that warrantless searches of automobiles are permitted by the Fourth Amendment if the officers have probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains contraband or other evidence of a crime.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Payne argues that even if the police had probable cause to search the passenger compartment, after coming up empty there, they had no reason to look in the trunk. We disagree. The Supreme Court has held that \u201c[i]f probable cause justifies the search of a lawfully stopped vehicle, it justifies the search of every part of the vehicle and its contents that may conceal the object of the search.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We have commented that if \u201cofficers have probable cause to believe that contraband is located somewhere in a car, but they don\u2019t know exactly where, then they can search the entire vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, the police had probable cause to believe they would find evidence of drug crime somewhere in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b488-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
