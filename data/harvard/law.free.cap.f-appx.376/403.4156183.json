In its lawsuit, Motharam sought recovery from Scottsdale in an amount greater than it had already paid on Motharam\u2019s claim. After a two-day trial, the jury rejected Motharam\u2019s demands, and the district court entered judgment dismissing Moth-aram\u2019s action with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Thereafter, the district court entered an order denying Motharam\u2019s motions for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) (which Motharam had waived by failing to file a motion therefor at the close of the evidence) and, alternatively, for a new trial under Rules 59(a) and 60. In so doing, the district court patiently and exhaustively laid out the factual and legal bases for its denials. Then, after Mothar-am filed a motion to reconsider that order, the district court again set forth in detail the factual and legal bases for denying reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">We have now examined the extensive record on appeal and the relevant facts and applicable law as set forth in the briefs of the parties and as supplemented by our independent research. As a result, we are convinced that the correctly conducted jury trial and the verdict reached by the jury are fully sustainable and free of reversible error, that the motions for judgment as a matter of law, new trial, and reconsideration filed by Motharam were correctly rejected by the district court for the cogent reasons set forth in its orders of August 27 and September 24, 2009, and that the judgment of the district court must be, and hereby is, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b428-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
