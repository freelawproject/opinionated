In 2006, Lee, a <em>pro se </em>federal prisoner, filed this civil action alleging claims under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), and the Privacy Act (\u201cPA\u201d). Lee\u2019s claims focused on the defendants\u2019 failure to respond to his FOIA and PA requests with documents relating to his criminal prosecution. In 2007, the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants, and, in 2008, this Court affirmed. <em>See Lee v. U.S. Att\u2019y for the S. Dist. of Fla., </em>289 Fed.Appx. 377 (11th Cir.2008). This Court concluded that summary judgment was proper because \u201cLee failed to show a genuine issue of material fact as to the reasonableness of the search for responsive records or defendants\u2019 good faith in conducting the search and providing responsive records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-17\">In 2009, Lee filed a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(3) and (b)(6) to reopen his case. Lee\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion again requested the documents related to his criminal prosecution and asserted that the defendants did not comply in good faith with his FOIA and PA requests. The district court denied Lee\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion, noting'that he had not made a sufficient showing that the case should be reopened.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-18\">Lee filed this appeal, making essentially the same argument he made in his first appeal \u2014 that the evidence presented in the district court before his first appeal shows that the defendants acted in bad faith in responding to his FOIA and PA requests. We, like the district court before us, are bound by the law of the case doctrine and may not revisit the issues Lee raised in his first appeal. <em>See United States v. Stinson, </em>97 F.3d 466, 469 (11th Cir.1996) (explaining that under the law of the case doctrine, both the appeals court and the district court are bound by the findings of fact and conclusions of law made in the prior appeal unless certain exceptions apply). Lee has not identified any applicable exception to the law of the case. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Lee\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-15\">. We generally review the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Burke v. Smith, </em>252 F.3d 1260, 1263 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
