The district court sentenced Starnes to 88 months imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently. At the sentence hearing, the court pronounced that \u201c[u]pon release from im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>prisonment the defendant shall be placed on supervised release for a term of 3 years.\u201d The court\u2019s judgment and commitment order reiterated that Starnes\u2019 imprisonment would be followed by supervised release for \u201ca term\u201d of three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Starnes was released from prison in 2006. Starnes admits that in 2007 he violated the conditions of his supervised release. He failed to submit reports to his probation officer, left the halfway house where he was living, and committed new state crimes \u2014 felony obstruction of an officer and terroristic threats. After holding a hearing, the district court revoked his supervised release and sentenced him to 30 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Starnes contends that we should vacate his sentence because it exceeds the statutory maximum. He argues that the district court had imposed only a single term of supervised release with a maximum revocation sentence of 24 months. The government argues that the district court actually had imposed, or meant to impose, two concurrent terms of supervised release. According to the government, the statutory maximum is 48 months because the district court was allowed to \u201cstack\u201d two 24-month revocation sentences consecutively. We agree with Starnes that his revocation sentence exceeds the statutory maximum.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">We normally review <em>de novo </em>the legality of a sentence imposed pursuant to revocation of a term of supervised release. <em>United States v. Mazarky, </em>499 F.3d 1246, 1248 (11th Cir.2007). However, when a party raises a sentencing challenge for the first time on appeal, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 842 (11th Cir.2009). To establish plain error, Starnes must show that: (1) there is an error; (2) the error is plain or obvious; (3) the error affects his substantial rights; and (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of a judicial proceeding. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">Upon finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant has violated a condition of his supervised release, a district court may revoke the term of supervised release and impose a prison sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3583(e), 3553(a); <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1107 (11th Cir.2006). Though the district court has discretion in sentencing, \u00a7 3583(e)(3) limits the length of each term of imprisonment that may be imposed upon revocation of supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). The applicable statutory maximum is determined by the grade of the felony offense that resulted in the supervised release term that is revoked. <em>See id. </em>When the underlying offense was a Class C felony \u2014 such as bank robbery, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2113(a), 3559(a)(3) \u2014 the maximum sentence for revocation of that supervised release term is 24 months imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3583(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-11\">Section 3583(e)(3) \u201climit[s] only the length of each <em>term, </em>not the length of <em>overall punishment.\u201d United States v. Deutsch, </em>403 F.3d 915 (7th Cir.2005). Thus, where more than one individual term of supervised release is revoked, a district court has discretion to stack revocation sentences consecutively. <em>See United States v. Quinones, </em>136 F.3d 1293, 1294-95 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201c[The defendant] had two such terms [of supervised release], and the district court could therefore revoke both and sentence [him] to a term of imprisonment for each violation.\u201d); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a). That discretion allows for consecutive revocation sentences \u2014 even though district courts may impose only concurrent, not consecutive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>terms of supervised release, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3624(e); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2 cmt. (1999);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>see also United States v. Danser, </em>270 F.3d 451, 454 (7th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">In the present case, Starnes received a 30-month revocation sentence. The key question presented is whether the district court initially imposed, and later revoked, one term of supervised release or two. If there was only one term, the revocation sentence would exceed the 24-month statutory maximum. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). If there were actually two terms of supervised release, the district court had discretion to revoke both terms, impose up to 24 months of imprisonment for each term, and stack the sentences consecutively. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3583(e)(3), 3584(a); <em>Quinones, </em>136 F.3d at 1294-95. In that case the maximum revocation sentence would be 48 months, and Starnes\u2019 30-month sentence would fit under the statutory cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">As we have already mentioned, the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement of Starnes\u2019 original sentence, and its written judgment and commitment order, both refer to \u201ca term\u201d of supervised release. The use of the singular \u201ca term\u201d plainly refers to only one term of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Eskridge, </em>445 F.3d 930, 935 (7th Cir.2006) (holding that the district court could not impose consecutive revocation sentences because the underlying judgment had established \u201ca term\u201d of supervised release). If the district court had meant to impose two concurrent terms of supervised release, it would have said so. But it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">The government fights against the plain meaning of Starnes\u2019 original sentence by arguing that he actually received two terms of supervised release. It asserts that the district court\u2019s use of the singular \u201ca term\u201d is explained by the legal backdrop behind Starnes\u2019 original sentence, which was imposed in 1999. That legal backdrop included: the <em>pre-Booker </em>world where the sentencing guidelines were mandatory, <em>see United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); a provision of the guidelines that required a term of supervised release on each count for which a defendant received more than one year in prison, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(a) (1999); and the statutory command that multiple terms of supervised release would run concurrently, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(e). The government argues that the district court was required to impose two concurrent terms, but had no reason to mention multiple terms because they would run concurrently regardless of what the court actually said.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">We find the government\u2019s argument unpersuasive. To begin with, the district court <em>was </em>not required to impose a term of supervised release on each bank robbery count. Section 5D1.1 of the sentencing guidelines states that \u201c[t]he court shall order a term of supervised release to follow imprisonment when a sentence of imprisonment of more than one year is imposed, or when required by statute.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(a). That provision, however, contains an important exception. The commentary to \u00a7 5D1.1 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-11\">The court may depart from this guideline and not impose a term of supervised release if it determines that supervised release is neither required by statute nor required for any of the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>reasons: (1) to protect the public welfare; (2) to enforce a financial condition; (8) to provide drug or alcohol treatment or testing; (4) to assist the reintegration of the defendant into the community; or (5) to accomplish any other sentencing purpose authorized by statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b970-4\"><em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 1. Thus, even before <em>Booker, </em>the district court retained discretion to decide that two terms of supervised release were unnecessary. The supervised release part of Starnes\u2019 original sentence is unambiguous, and the legal backdrop against which it was imposed does not alter the plain meaning of the district court\u2019s language.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">The government also argues, in the alternative, that the district court\u2019s reference to \u201ca term\u201d of supervised release in the underlying judgment was a clerical error that can be corrected pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36. Rule 36 provides: \u201cAfter giving any notiee it considers appropriate, the court may at any time correct a clerical error in a judgment, order, or other part of the record, or correct an error in the record arising from oversight or omission.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 36; <em>see United States v. Portillo, </em>363 F.3d 1161, 1164-65 (11th Cir.2004). We have recognized, however, that Rule 36 may not be used \u201cto make a substantive alteration to a criminal sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Pease, </em>331 F.3d 809, 816 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also Portillo, </em>363 F.3d at 1164 (\u201c[A] district court has no jurisdiction to correct a defendant\u2019s sentence where the corrections are aimed at remedying errors of law rather than mere transcription\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">Rule 36 does not apply under these circumstances. This is not a case where the district court\u2019s written judgment must be corrected because it differs from the sentence that was orally pronounced. <em>Cf United States v. Bates, </em>213 F.3d 1336, 1340 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cWhen a sentence pronounced orally and unambiguously conflicts with the written order of judgment, the oral pronouncement governs.\u201d). Instead, the written judgment and the sentence announced from the bench both refer to \u201ca term\u201d of supervised release. There is no evidence of a \u201cclerical error\u201d that may be corrected under Rule 36. <em>See Portillo, </em>363 F.3d at 1164; <em>Pease, </em>331 F.3d at 816. As the Seventh Circuit has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-8\">[I]f the order accurately reflects the judge\u2019s decision, however mistaken, to impose just a single term [of supervised release], it cannot be corrected because none of the statutory provisions authorizing the sentencing judge to modify a sentence that he has imposed is applicable to such a ease. A district judge may still correct a final judgment in a criminal case to reflect the sentence he actually imposed but he cannot change the sentence he did impose even if the sentence was erroneous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b970-9\"><em>Eskridge, </em>445 F.3d at 934. Besides, the district court did not even attempt to apply Rule 36 in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">Because Starnes was originally sentenced to only one term of supervised release for his bank robbery convictions, his maximum revocation sentence was 24 months imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). The district court\u2019s 30-month sentence therefore exceeds the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-11\">The sole remaining issue is whether Starnes has demonstrated plain error. <em>See Beckles, </em>565 F.3d at 842. We conclude that he has. His revocation sentence is plainly erroneous because the language of the underlying judgment is unambiguous and the revocation sentence exceeds the statutory maximum. <em>See United States v. Eldick, </em>393 F.3d 1354, 1354 n. 1 (11th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Cobbs, </em>967 F.2d 1555, 1558 (11th Cir.1992). The plain error affected his substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>rights because it \u201caffected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1778, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). To deprive Starnes of his liberty for six months beyond what the law allows would seriously call into question the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of his judicial proceeding. <em>See id.; United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1351 n. 18 (11th Cir.1993) (\u201cIt is both axiomatic and jurisdictional that a court of the United States may not impose a penalty for a crime beyond that which is authorized by statute.\u201d). The judgment must therefore be vacated and the case remanded for resen-tencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b968-7\">. Because we resolve the statutory maximum issue in Starnes' favor, we need not address his other contentions challenging his sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b969-8\">. We will refer to the 1999 version of the Sentencing Guidelines when discussing Starnes' original sentence, which was imposed on December 2, 1999. <em>See United States v. Simon, </em>168 F.3d 1271, 1272 (11th Cir.1999) (\"We apply the version of the Sentencing Guidelines and commentary in effect on the date of sentencing unless a more lenient punishment would result under the Guidelines version in effect on the date the offense was committed.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
