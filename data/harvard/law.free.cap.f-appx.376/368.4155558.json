Jones contends that the district court abused its discretion by not granting a reduction to the low end of the recalculated guidelines range. He also contends that in light of \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u2019s requirement that district courts consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a), the district court\u2019s failure to give reasons for the sentence imposed constitutes a significant procedural error or, alternatively, an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to reduce a sentence for an abuse of discretion and its interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition far cert. filed </em>(Jan. 28, 2010) (No. 09-8939). In <em>Evans, </em>this court noted that because the district court was under no obligation to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence at all, it was under no obligation to reduce the sentence even further within the recalculated range. <em>Id. </em>at 673. Further, the district court was not required to give reasons for its granting the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion but not selecting \u201ca satisfactorily low enough sentence within the recalculated range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 674. Accordingly, Jones\u2019s contentions are foreclosed by <em>Evans, </em>and the district court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 672-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-35\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
