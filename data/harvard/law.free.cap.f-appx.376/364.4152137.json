Chappell argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion because he would not be considered a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 if he were resentenced now because his prior conviction for delivery of a controlled substance is no longer considered a predicate felony under \u00a7 4B1.1. He maintains that the failure of the district court to acknowledge the current state of the law in the present \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding continued the unconstitutional effect of the mandatory guidelines under which he was sentenced. He asserts that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), should apply in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, allowing the district court to recalculate the guidelines sentence range and then determine an appropriate sentence based upon the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Chappell acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed, but he raises it to preserve it for further review. As an alternative to his contention that he would no longer be considered a career offender, Chappell contends that he is eligible for relief because, even as a career offender, the offense level under \u00a7 4B1.1 was compared to the offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 that has been lowered by the crack cocaine amendments, and therefore his sentence, in the language of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), is \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered.\u201d Chappell acknowledges that this argument is also foreclosed, and he raises it to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">Chappell may not use a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to relitigate whether he is a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995). As Chappell acknowledges, his assertion that <em>Booker </em>should apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). Further, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying relief because \u201c[t]he crack cocaine guideline amendments do not apply to prisoners sentenced as career offenders.\u201d <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 791 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
