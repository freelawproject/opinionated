On appeal, Magana argues his 120-month sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-23\">Magana first contends that the district court incorrectly calculated his guideline range because the court found that his guideline range was 7 years (84 months) to life imprisonment when the proper guideline range was only 7 years. Magana also contends that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 factors supported a sentence of 84 months\u2019 imprisonment but did not support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>his ultimate 120-month sentence. Magana concedes that the presentence investigation report \u201cpainted a rough picture\u201d of him. However, Magana argues that at resentencing he was a changed person based on his post-sentence conduct. Ma-gana contends that the district court\u2019s consideration of his criminal history, the seriousness of his offense, and his disrespect for the law did not \u201cprotect\u201d the three-year upward variance. Magana argues that a reasonable sentence was the guideline sentence of 84 months\u2019 imprisonment. Magana notes that during his original sentencing hearing, the district court found that \u201ca sentence within the guideline range is sufficient to punish the [defendant, protect the public, and is a deterrent to crime.\u201d Therefore, Magana contends that the district court should not have exceeded the guidelines during his resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">We review a final sentence for reasonableness according to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) factors. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). When reviewing a sentence, we must first determine that the \u201cdistrict court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If we conclude that the district court made no procedural errors, \u201c[we] should then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">There is a \u201crange of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe review for substantive unreasonableness involves examining the totality of the circumstances, including an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2848, 174 L.Ed.2d 568 (2009). \u201c[W]e may not apply a presumption of unreasonableness where a sentence is outside of the Guidelines range, and we must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1090 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted). However, in its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court does not need to discuss or state each factor explicitly. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). The weight accorded to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is left to the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Under \u00a7 3553(a), the district court must impose a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to comply with the purposes set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(2). <em>Id. </em>In <em>United States v. Lorenzo, </em>471 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2006), we held that, at resentencing, a district court could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>consider post-sentencing rehabilitation because consideration of such evidence would contravene two of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by: (1) creating sentencing disparities with defendants who do not get the opportunity to be resentenced; and (2) violating the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement that post-sentence rehabilitative conduct is not an appropriate basis for a downward departure at a resentencing hearing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">Magana cannot show that his upward variance 120-month sentence was procedurally unreasonable. A violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii), carries a mandatory minimum seven-year sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii). \u201c[T]he guideline sentence [for 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii) ] is the minimum term of imprisonment required by the statute.\u201d U.S.S.G \u00a7 2K2.4(b). \u201cEvery conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) carries with it a statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment, regardless of what subsection the defendant is sentenced under.\u201d <em>United States v. Pounds, </em>230 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2000). The district court stated, during the resentencing, that \u201cthe range of sentence is seven years to life statutorily,\u201d demonstrating that it understood the guidelines and properly calculated them.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Additionally, Magana cannot show that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because the district court correctly considered the applicable factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and imposed a sentence that was supported by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court noted that Magana\u2019s crimes were particularly violent and that they involved dangerous weapons. Further, Magana had engaged in three prior violent offenses and those previous convictions demonstrated a lack of respect for the law. Thus, the court properly supported the sentence it chose and did not abuse its discretion. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
