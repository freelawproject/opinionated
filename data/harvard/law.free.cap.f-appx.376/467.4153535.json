He argues that the indictment was flawed: that the lack of a signature violated his constitutional rights, that it was duplicitous, and that the facts did not support the allegations. He also takes issue with the rearraignment at which he pleaded guilty, urging that the district court failed in multiple ways to comply with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-19\">First, as to the alleged problems with the indictment, the grand jury\u2019s foreperson did sign it. Villarreal\u2019s guilty plea waived his right to challenge the indictment as duplicitous.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By pleading guilty, he also waived his right to challenge any factual defects in the indictment,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, in any event, a review of the record shows the argument to have no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-20\">Second, because Villarreal did not before the district court raise his challenges to the guilty plea hearing, we review for plain error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To secure a reversal for an unpre-served Rule 11 failing, Villarreal must \u201cshow a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After reviewing the record, we are not persuaded that Villarreal has made the necessary showing, and the facts support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b491-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
