(\u201cDillard\u2019s\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s decision to vacate an arbitration award for fraud under the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d). Dillard\u2019s argues that the district court erred in vacating the arbitration award. We agree. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-14\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b420-15\">Dillard\u2019s is a department store chain with locations throughout the United States, including Houma, Louisiana. Ap-pellee Trinidad Suyapa Barahona was a salesperson in Dillard\u2019s Houma store until she was terminated by Patrick Broussard, who was the Houma store manager. Ms. Barahona believed that she was terminated in violation of Title VII, and she brought this suit against Dillard\u2019s, alleging that she was terminated either because of her race or in retaliation for her complaints of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-16\">Ms. Barahona\u2019s employment contract with Dillard\u2019s contained an arbitration agreement, so the district court, with the parties\u2019 consent, stayed her case to allow the parties to arbitrate her claims. Dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ing the arbitration proceedings, the parties conducted discovery, which included depositions and document requests, and the parties participated in a three-day arbitration hearing where they were given the opportunity to present their evidence and arguments. On the third day of the hearing, Mr. Broussard appeared and testified as a witness. Ms. Barahona\u2019s counsel questioned Mr. Broussard on a number of matters, including whether he ever communicated via e-mail with any Dillard\u2019s employee regarding Ms. Barahona. Mr. Broussard answered, \u2018Tes.\u201d Dillard\u2019s, however, had not produced Mr. Broussard\u2019s emails during the discovery phase of the arbitration. The reason for Dillard\u2019s failure to produce the e-mails was never elucidated, as neither party elicited any testimony as to why the e-mails were either overlooked or intentionally not produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">In response to Mr. Broussard\u2019s testimony, Dillard\u2019s counsel moved to continue the arbitration proceeding so that Dillard\u2019s could produce the e-mails. Ms. Baraho-na\u2019s counsel refused to consent to Dillard\u2019s motion, stating that he was objecting to the continuance \u201cabout as much as anybody can\u201d and that he would \u201chave to appeal if this thing was adjourned.\u201d The arbitrator denied Dillard\u2019s motion to continue. The arbitrator penalized Dillard\u2019s by drawing an adverse inference against Dillard\u2019s for its failure to produce Mr. Broussard\u2019s e-mails. The parties then completed the hearing and submitted the case to the arbitrator for his determination. Despite the adverse inference, the arbitrator ruled in favor of Dillard\u2019s, finding that Ms. Barahona did not carry her burden of proof on her discrimination and retaliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">After the arbitrator announced his findings, Ms. Barahona moved the district court to vacate the arbitration award due to Dillard\u2019s failure to produce Mr. Brous-sard\u2019s e-mails. After Ms. Barahona moved to vacate, Dillard\u2019s produced Mr. Brous-sard\u2019s e-mails and argued that the contents of the e-mails showed that a vacatur was unwarranted. Dillard\u2019s also moved to have the arbitration award confirmed. The district court initially chose not to vacate the arbitration award and instead remanded the case back to the arbitrator for reconsideration in light of the newly produced e-mails. The arbitrator refused to reconsider the arbitration award, finding that he lacked jurisdiction to reconsider it. After the arbitrator refused to reconsider the award, the district court granted Ms. Barahona\u2019s motion, denied Dillard\u2019s motion to confirm, and vacated the arbitration award, finding that the award was procured by fraud as a result of Dillard\u2019s failure to produce Mr. Brous-sard\u2019s e-mails. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to vacate an arbitration award de novo, \u201cdeferring greatly to the [arbitrator\u2019s] decision.\u201d <em>Downer v. Siegel, </em>489 F.3d 623, 626 (5th Cir.2007). Pursuant to the FAA, the district court\u2019s ability to vacate an arbitration award is limited to the four grounds enumerated in 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a). <em>Id. </em>Only one of those grounds is at issue here. The district court vacated the arbitrator\u2019s award under \u00a7 10(a)(1), which permits a district court to vacate an award \u201cwhere the award was procured by ... fraud.\u201d Dillard\u2019s argues that the district court\u2019s decision was erroneous. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">Under the FAA, a party who alleges that an arbitration award was procured by fraud must demonstrate: (1) that the fraud occurred by clear and convincing evidence; (2) that the fraud was not discoverable by due diligence before or during the arbitration hearing; and (3) the fraud materially related to an issue in the arbitration. <em>Karaha Bodas Co. v. Perusahaan Pertambangan Minyak Dan Gas </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number><em>Bumi Negara, </em>364 F.3d 274, 306 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Trans Chem. Ltd. v. China Nat\u2019l Mach. Imp. &amp; Exp. Corp., </em>978 F.Supp. 266, 304-06 (S.D.Tex.1997), <em>aff'd and adopted by, </em>161 F.3d 314 (5th Cir.1998) (\u201cWe agree with the district court\u2019s analysis of these issues and therefore adopt Parts I-V of its careful and comprehensive opinion.\u201d). A party, however, cannot meet its burden of proof \u201c[w]here the grounds for fraud \u2018... is not only discoverable, but discovered and brought to the attention of the arbitrators;\u2019 \u201d in such a case, courts will not give \u201c \u2018a disappointed party ... a second bite at the apple.\u2019 \u201d <em>Trans Chem., </em>978 F.Supp. at 306 (quoting <em>A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons, Inc. v. McCollough, </em>967 F.2d 1401, 1404 (9th Cir.1992)). Here, Dillard\u2019s allegedly fraudulent conduct was discovered during the arbitration hearing and brought to the attention of the arbitrator, who addressed it by drawing an adverse inference against Dillard\u2019s.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a consequence, Ms. Barahona cannot meet her burden of proof under the FAA on this prong.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Trans Chem., </em>978 F.Supp. at 306; <em>Sprewell v. Golden State Warriors, </em>266 F.3d 979, 988 (9th Cir.) (rejecting a plaintiffs motion to vacate an arbitration award when \u201cthe fraud claim was presented in its entirety to, and ruled upon by, the arbitrator\u201d), <em>modified on other grounds, 275 </em>F.3d 1187, 1188 (9th Cir.2001). Accordingly, we find that the district court erred in vacating Dillard\u2019s arbitration award. Because the facts concerning whether or not the al~ leged \u201cnon-production fraud\u201d was discovered during the arbitration hearing are undisputed, further development of the record would not alter the result. Thus, it is appropriate to direct the district court to grant the motion to confirm rather than ordering further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s order vacating the arbitration award is REVERSED, and the case is REMANDED with instructions to enter an order confirming the arbitration award.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b420-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-4\">. Although Ms. Barahona discovered Dillard\u2019s alleged fraud during the arbitration proceeding and presented it to the arbitrator, the district court found that Ms. Barahona was entitled to a vacatur because she could not have discovered the extent of Dillard's fraud until Dillard's produced the e-mails at issue. Ms. Barahona, however, had an opportunity to discover the e-mails during the arbitration proceeding and chose not to do so. By refusing to seek discovery of the e-mails, Ms. Bara-hona cannot now complain about Dillard's failure to produce the e-mails. <em>See Trans Chem., </em>978 F.Supp. at 306 (finding that an arbitration award could not be vacated for fraud when the party moving to vacate the award discovered the fraud, brought it to the attention of the arbitrator, and had an opportunity to discover the extent of the fraud but chose not to do so).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b422-21\">. As a result, we need not reach the other prongs. We note, however, the lack of any proof that the non-production was intentional or otherwise \"fraudulent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
