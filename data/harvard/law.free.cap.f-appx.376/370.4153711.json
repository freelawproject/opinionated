Bennett\u2019s appeal waiver does not bar this appeal. <em>See United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 296-97 (5th Cir.2009). Although he argues that he was eligible for such a reduction, when a defendant such as Bennett is \u201csubject to a statutory minimum sentence above the upper end of his guideline range, even if the district court departs downwardly from that minimum under a statutory exception, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) provides no authority to the district court to later modify the sentence based on amendments to the guideline range.\u201d <em>United States v.
