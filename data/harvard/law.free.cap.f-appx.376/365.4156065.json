Lomas argues that the district court abused its discretion when it denied an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction to his sentence because the district court failed to provide case-specific reasons based upon 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the policy statements of the Guidelines. He also argues that the district court improperly considered his post-incarceration conduct. The Government has moved for summary affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Lomas\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion by failing to discuss the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the Guidelines is unavailing. In <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 671-74 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(Jan. 28, 2010) (No. 09-8939), this court emphasized that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings are not full resen-tencings, and a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion may be disposed of summarily, without case-specific reasons. Similarly, Lomas\u2019s argument that the district court improperly considered his post-incarceration conduct is unavailing, as this circuit has recently made clear that post-incarceration conduct may be considered in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>595 F.3d 1322, 1323 (5th Cir.2010); <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Lomas\u2019s arguments thus fail to demonstrate that the district court\u2019s decision was an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affir-mance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b390-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
