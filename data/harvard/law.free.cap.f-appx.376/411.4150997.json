He pled guilty to possession of an unregistered firearm, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d). Taylor challenges his sentence imposed following his plea, contending the district court erred by denying an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction under Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 3E1.1. This denial was based primarily on the inconsistency between Taylor\u2019s claimed intention to explode the devices like firecrackers and the presen-tence investigation report\u2019s (PSR) stating the devices were \u201cintended to hurt, maim, and kill\u201d. (Because this provided a sufficient basis upon which to deny the reduction, we do not address whether Taylor\u2019s statements regarding a related counterfeiting offense also would support such denial.)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-17\">A defendant may receive such an offense-level reduction if he \u201cclearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense\u201d. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a). In other words, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating the reduction is warranted. <em>United States v. Flucas, </em>99 F.3d 177, 180 (5th Cir.1996) (per curiam). The district court\u2019s decision not to award a reduction will be affirmed \u201cunless it is without foundation, a standard of review more deferential than the clearly erroneous standard\u201d. <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 211 (5th Cir.) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>553 U.S. 1043, 128 S.Ct. 2452, 171 L.Ed.2d 248 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-18\">Taylor first contends the district court erred by finding he made false statements about his intended use for the explosive devices. \u201cAs a general rule, information in the [PSR] is presumed reliable and may be adopted by the district court without further inquiry if the defendant fails to demonstrate by competent rebuttal evidence that the information is materially untrue, inaccurate or unreliable.\u201d <em>United States v. Carbajal, </em>290 F.3d 277, 287 (5th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>omitted). Taylor presented no evidence to rebut the PSR\u2019s finding that these devices were intended \u201cto hurt, maim, and kill\u201d. Therefore, a foundation existed for the district court\u2019s finding Taylor\u2019s statement inconsistent and false.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Taylor also contends any inconsistency is not a basis for denying the acceptance-of-responsibility reduction because his intended use for the devices was not relevant to the statute of conviction or the guidelines calculations. An acceptance-of-responsibility reduction requires, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ca showing of sincere contrition on the defendant\u2019s behalf\u2019. <em>United States v. Medina-Anicacio, </em>325 F.3d 638, 648 (5th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Nguyen, </em>190 F.3d 656, 658 (5th Cir.1999)). In evaluating a defendant\u2019s sincerity, a sentencing court \u201cmay consider a defendant\u2019s refusal to elaborate on the circumstances surrounding his offense to the probation officer\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Nevarez-Arreola, </em>885 F.2d 243, 244, 246 (5th Cir.1989)). There is evidence Taylor falsely described his intended use of the devices, which was part of the \u201ccircumstances surrounding his offense\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">In sum, Taylor has not shown the denial of the reduction for acceptance of responsibility was without foundation. <em>See Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
