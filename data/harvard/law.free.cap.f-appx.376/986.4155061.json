The Schultzes claimed that their property was damaged as a result of SESH\u2019s construction of a pipeline across their property in Mobile County, Alabama.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">SESH filed a motion for summary judgment based upon the Advance Damage Release (Release) executed by the Schultzes with SESH for $10,900.00. The Release was executed \u201cin full payment and settlement of all claims and damages of every kind whatsoever, present and future, to interests of [the Schultzes] arising from or related to the surveying, preparation, laying and construction of a pipeline and appurtenances under, upon, and across [the Schultzes\u2019] land.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-10\">The district court granted SESH\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding that, under Alabama law, the Release unambiguously included \u201call\u201d \u201cpresent and future\u201d damages resulting from the construction of SESH\u2019s natural gas pipeline across the Schultzes\u2019 land. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-11\">We have thoroughly reviewed the record in this case and the well-reasoned opinion of the district court. Finding no error, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
