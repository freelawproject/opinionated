He contends that the district court erred in applying an eight-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). He argues that his successive drug convictions were not punishable as a felony under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a), and consequently did not qualify as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), because (1) the Government failed to prove that the offenses underlying those convictions were committed after one of his prior drug convictions had become final and (2) the Government failed to prove that those convictions were secured in compliance with notice and procedural requirements that were commensurate to those in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-15\">Because Rangel-Ibarra preserved these arguments in the district court, the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) is reviewed de novo, and the district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error. Section 2L1.2 adopts the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d contained in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.3(A)). Under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), \u201caggravated felony\u201d means \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of Title 21), including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of Title 18).\u201d Under \u00a7 924(c)(2), the definition of \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d includes \u201cany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\u201d (CSA). Simple possession of a controlled substance may be punishable as a felony under the CSA only if it is committed after a prior conviction for a controlled substance violation has become final. \u00a7 844(a); <em>Smith v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 272, 277 (5th Cir.2006). According to the Government, Rangel-Ibarra satisfied the \u201caggravated felony\u201d definition under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) and \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) because at least one of his simple drug-possession offenses was committed after one of his prior drug convictions had become final.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-16\">A conviction is final if it is no longer subject to challenge on direct appeal or discretionary review by any court. <em>United States v. Andrade-Aguilar, </em>570 F.3d 213, 218 (5th Cir.2009). Because the Government sought the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) enhancement, the Government bore the burden of proving finality by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 217. To establish that Rangel-Ibarra had at least one drug conviction that was final when he commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>ted a later drug-possession offense, the Government introduced into evidence the judgments for two of Rangel-Ibarra\u2019s pri- or convictions: his November 1996 Florida conviction for trafficking cannabis and his 2004 Texas conviction for possession of marijuana. According to the 2004 judgment, Rangel-Ibarra committed the offense underlying the 2004 conviction on January 1, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"AKVz\">The Government\u2019s burden of showing finality for \u00a7 844(a) purposes may be satisfied in some cases by the passage of a substantial amount of time without a direct appeal or discretionary review. <em>Andrade-Aguilar, </em>570 F.3d at 218 &amp; n. 6. Under Florida law, Rangel-Ibarra\u2019s window for filing a direct appeal of his 1996 conviction was 30 days. <em>See </em>Fla. R.App. P. 9.140(b)(3). Rangel-Ibarra has not asserted that he appealed the 1996 conviction, much less that he sought discretionary review of the conviction. The passage of about seven years between his 1996 conviction and the commission of his 2004 offense would make it extremely unlikely that the 1996 conviction had not become final by January 2004. <em>See Andrade-Aguilar, </em>570 F.3d at 218 n. 6. The Government\u2019s introduction of the judgments for Rangel-Ibarra\u2019s 1996 and 2004 drug convictions satisfied its burden of proof regarding finality. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ALB\">Rangel-Ibarra\u2019s argument concerning \u00a7 851 is also unavailing. Although he indicates that his argument concerning \u00a7 851 is \u201capparently\u201d foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d 333, 335-36 (5th Cir.2008), he also contends that his argument differs from the one rejected in <em>Cepeda-Rios. </em>Specifically, he argues that his later possession convictions do not qualify as aggravated felonies because there has been no showing that a state prosecutor prosecuting those cases invoked procedures equivalent to those set out in \u00a7 851. As we noted in <em>Cepeda-Rios, </em>\u201cthe relevant inquiry under the sentencing guidelines is whether the crime is <em>punishable </em>under \u00a7 844(a).\u201d 530 F.3d at 336 n. 11 (emphasis in original). The Government satisfied its burden of proof in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"A8X8\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b480-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
