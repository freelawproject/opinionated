The judgment was based upon injuries Leontyne Woodson, plaintiff, sustained while on a school playground. The board contends that the default judgment was entered without proper notice, that the existence of the judgment was fraudulently concealed and that the judgment was void in that it was based upon a complaint which failed to state a cause of action. Additionally, the board contends that the $75,000 judgment was in excess of the amount requested, included punitive damages, and that the doctrine of laches prevents plaintiff from enforcing the judgment.</p> <p id=\"b402-5\" pgmap=\"402\">This appeal arises from the following procedural facts:</p> <blockquote id=\"b402-6\" pgmap=\"402\">December 3, 1983 \u2014 plaintiff injured on school playground.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b402-8\" pgmap=\"402\">December 31, 1986 \u2014 complaint filed against the Chicago board of education claiming damages in excess of $15,000.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b402-10\" pgmap=\"402\">January 16, 1987 \u2014 board served with summons, but failed to appear.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b402-12\" pgmap=\"402\">May 13, 1987 \u2014 plaintiff wrote the board a letter stating that if the board did not respond within 10 days plaintiff would move for a default judgment.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b402-14\" pgmap=\"402(8) 403(2)\">July 2, 1987 \u2014 order of default entered against board.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b403-4\" pgmap=\"403\">December 14, 1987 \u2014 plaintiff proved up damages to trial judge.

the findings and conclusions contained in the unpublished order of the appellate court (Nos. 1 \u2014 90\u20141411, 1 \u2014 91\u20140204 cons, (unpublished order under Supreme Court Rule 23)), we nonetheless affirm the dismissal of the appeal for the following reasons. The trial court order of May 8, 1990, was a final order. When the appeal of that order was dismissed for want of prosecution on September 27, 1990, and a petition for rehearing was not filed within 21 days, the dismissal order became final and the appellate court lost jurisdiction to consider additional arguments stemming from the May 8, 1990, order. The trial court order of June 19, 1990, on the other hand, was an interlocutory order which lacked the specific findings required under supreme court rules so as to render it appealable. Hence, the appellate court lacked jurisdiction to consider the appeal of that order. The same was true of the trial court order of December 11, 1990. People v. Mallett (1970), 45 Ill. 2d 388, 397-98; Waitcus v. Village of Gilberts (1989), 185 Ill. App. 3d 248, 250-51; 134 Ill. 2d Rules 304(a), 367(b).</p> <p id=\"b407-8\" pgmap=\"407\">Accordingly, the judgment of the appellate court, dismissing the appeal, is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b407-9\" pgmap=\"407\">Affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b407-10\" pgmap=\"407\">JUSTICE McMORROW took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
