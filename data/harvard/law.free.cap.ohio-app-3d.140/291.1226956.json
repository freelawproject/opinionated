Rangel now appeals, asserting two assignments of error, neither of which is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The evidence at trial established that Rangel, a citizen of Mexico, wanted to obtain a driver\u2019s license, so he went to an Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles (\u201cBMV\u201d) branch and presented to the clerk, Rae Jean Whitaker, a Social Security card and a resident-alien card, known as a \u201cgreen card,\u201d as evidence of his identification. Whitaker testified that she thought that the cards were fraudulent and notified her supervisor, Sandra Scott. Scott examined Rangel\u2019s Social Security card and green card. Scott testified that Rangel\u2019s picture on the green card did not cover the entire seal, which indicated to her that the card was fraudulent. Additionally, she testified that Rangel\u2019s Social Security card appeared to be fraudulent because it did not have raised pillars, ink dots, or a perforated edge. Scott stated that, based on her observations, she called the local police for assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Officer Daniel Carter responded and took Rangel to the police district to fill out a suspect investigation report. While filling out the report, Officer Carter asked Rangel to state his date of birth. According to Officer Carter, Rangel replied that March 15, 1979, was his date of birth. Officer Carter further testified that the green card identified Rangel\u2019s date of birth as March 15, 1974. Rangel testified at trial that his date of birth was March 15, 1979. Rangel also testified that he had obtained the Social Security card and the green card from an unknown person at a shopping mall, but he denied that the cards were fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">In his first assignment of error, Rangel asserts that the trial court erred in allowing expert testimony as to the authenticity of the Social Security card and the green card, because Whitaker and Scott were not qualified as experts. Under Evid.R. 702, three requirements must be met for expert testimony to be admissible. First, the testimony must relate to matters beyond the knowledge or experience of lay persons or dispel a misconception common among lay persons.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Second, the witness must be \u201cqualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And, third, the testimony must be \u201cbased on reliable scientific, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>technical, or other specialized information.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A trial court\u2019s admission of expert testimony will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The state never proffered Whitaker or Scott as an expert witness at trial, and it is unclear whether the court accepted them as experts. Regardless, the state argues that Evid.R. 702 is inapplicable because the authenticity of the Social Security card and the green card could have been established by lay opinion testimony. We disagree. A determination of whether a Social Security card or a green card is authentic does not fall within the common knowledge of a lay person. Further, the Social Security card and the green card in this case do not appear on their face to be fraudulent. Under the first prong of Evid.R. 702, expert testimony was required here. While it is preferable for the trial court to explicitly find that a witness qualifies as an expert, because the testimony of Whitaker and Scott related to knowledge beyond the scope of a lay person, we can infer from the record that the trial court considered them to be experts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, the question before us is whether Whitaker and Scott were properly qualified as expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The standards in Ohio relating to the admissibility of the opinion of an expert are relatively lenient as to a determination of who is an expert but relatively strict in governing the admissibility of the expert testimony. To qualify a witness as an expert under the second prong of Evid.R. 702, the court should consider the witness\u2019s knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education. An expert must only possess knowledge that will aid the trier of fact in assessing the evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And the expert need not possess special education, certification, or complete knowledge of the field in question.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When applying the third prong of Evid.R. 702, the court must act as a \u201cgatekeeper\u201d to ensure that the proffered scientific, technical, or other specialized information is sufficiently reliable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>While the relevant evidence must satisfy a threshold reliability standard, the credibility afforded to the expert\u2019s opinion still remains for the trier of fact.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">First, we examine whether Scott properly qualified as an expert under the second prong of Evid.R. 702. Scott was a deputy registrar in charge of a branch of the BMV and had worked there since 1983. Through her employment at the BMV, Scott had received extensive training on how to identify fraudulent documents in yearly regional meetings and at office training sessions. These credentials qualified Scott as an expert. Next, we consider whether Scott\u2019s testimony was based on reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information and whether her testimony was sufficiently reliable under the third prong of Evid.R. 702. Scott testified that certain characteristics help to identify whether a document is authentic. For instance, Scott testified that, to determine whether a green card was authentic, the holder\u2019s picture had to completely cover the seal. Additionally, Scott testified that, when determining whether a Social Security card was authentic, the pillars on the card had to be raised, ink dots had to appear on the card, and the edges of the card had to be perforated. Moreover, she testified that, under a \u201cblack light,\u201d the seal on the Social Security card had to glow in the dark, and the words \u201cSocial Security Administration\u201d or \u201cSocial Security Office\u201d had to appear on the signature line. Finally, she testified that she used reference books to determine whether documents were authentic. Based upon Scott\u2019s knowledge and experience, we hold that Scott\u2019s opinion related to specialized information and was sufficiently reliable. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Scott\u2019s testimony relating to the authenticity of Rangel\u2019s documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Conversely, we hold that Whitaker did not qualify as an expert. Even with the lenient standards set forth in the second prong of Evid.R. 702, Whitaker was not qualified to determine whether Rangel\u2019s documents were authentic, because she had only received one two-hour training session on how to identify false documents in the course of her employment with the BMV. This was not sufficient. Although the admission of her testimony relating to the authenticity of Rangel\u2019s Social Security card and green card was erroneous, we hold that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because Whitaker\u2019s testimony was similar to that of Scott, who properly qualified as an expert.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, we overrule Rangel\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">In his second assignment of error, Rangel alleges that, after he expressed his desire to appeal, the trial court erroneously enhanced his sentence. There was no objection to the sentence at trial. Thus, Rangel has waived all but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>plain error.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rangel\u2019s sentence does not rise to the level of plain error because his sentence falls -within the conf\u00ednes of R.C. 2929.21(B)(1), which states that, for a misdemeanor of the first degree, a term of imprisonment up to six months maybe imposed. Further, while the record reflects that the court did correct Rangel\u2019s sentence at the sentencing hearing, a trial court speaks only through its journal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The journal here reveals that Rangel was sentenced only once to a six-month term in prison. Under these circumstances, we are unpersuaded that the trial court improperly enhanced Rangel\u2019s sentence, and we overrule his second assignment of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b339-6\">Gorman, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b339-7\">Painter, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b336-8\">.

Although Rangel strenuously objected to their qualifications to testify regarding the authenticity of the documents, the judge allowed the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">Expert testimony is governed by Evid.R. 702. The rule outlines three requirements necessary for expert testimony to be admissible. First, the testimony must either \u201c[relate] to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons or [dispel] a misconception common among lay persons.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Second, the witness must be \u201cqualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Third, the testimony must be \u201cbased on reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Under the third prong, the United States Supreme Court has held that trial courts must act as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d to ensure that expert testimony is reliable.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Ohio courts have adopted this thresh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>old duty.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In determining a witness\u2019s reliability, \u201c[r]elevant evidence based on valid principles will satisfy the threshold reliability standard.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Here, the state argues that Evid.R. 702 does not apply because the falsity of Rangel\u2019s Social Security card and green card could have been established by lay testimony. The state claims that the court did not even qualify Whitaker and Scott as expert witnesses. While the state may be correct that the court never qualified Whitaker or Scott to testify as experts (the record is unclear), I agree with the majority that the trial court must have considered their testimony as expert opinion, because it would not have been admissible or relevant for any other purpose. And I agree with the majority that expert testimony was necessary. Lay people are not normally familiar with determining the authenticity of Social Security cards and green cards. Here, a casual inspection of the Social Security card and the green card, which were admitted into evidence, would not reveal that they were fraudulent. Though a case can be posited where expert testimony would be unnecessary \u2014 if the picture on the green card was of Mickey Mouse, or the words \u201cSocial Security\u201d were spelled incorrectly on that card \u2014 this case required an expert to determine the validity of the cards. Thus, under the first prong of Evid.R. 702, expert testimony was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Neither witness satisfied either the second or the third prong of Evid.R. 702. Whitaker, as the majority concludes, did not even reach the third prong. She did not have sufficient knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education to qualify as an expert. The record reveals that the only training Whitaker received in identifying false documents was one training seminar that was under three hours long. Such minimal training did not establish sufficient expertise. I agree that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing her to testify as to the authenticity of the Social Security card and the green, card.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">As for Scott, she also lacked proper experience and training. She testified that, in addition to her experience working at the BMV, her training in identifying false documents consisted of yearly training meetings and \u201clittle sessions\u201d at regional meetings. But her testimony was vague. She did not explain exactly what the training sessions taught her, or even how much time was spent on learning to identify false documents. Based on the record before us, she did not have sufficient expertise to qualify as an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Further, her testimony was not reliable. Her testimony regarding the falsity of Rangel\u2019s documents consisted of general indicators that the documents were false. These indicators included that the color of Rangel\u2019s Social Security card <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>was darker than normal, that its print was too fine, that its edges were not perforated, and that a black-light analysis revealed that the Social Security card and the green card lacked various security features. But cross-examination revealed that Scott\u2019s knowledge came from a \u201creference book\u201d that she had looked at when Rangel presented the documents. It is apparent from the record that, without the reference book, which was not admitted into evidence, Scott knew little about the documents she inspected. Also, she was unable to identify the last time that green cards were changed. And there was no testimony at all about the efficacy of the \u201cblack-light\u201d analysis. Though a \u201cblack light\u201d may be a proper scientific tool, there was no evidence whatever of the scientific theory or underpinnings of that technology, much less its application to these cards. Under <em>Daubert </em>and <em>Kumho Tire, </em>the trial court failed to exercise any \u201cgate-keeping\u201d role. Scott could not have been an expert witness, and her testimony should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">I would reverse Rangel\u2019s conviction. Because the state produced no admissible evidence against him, the conviction is based on insufficient evidence, and Rangel is entitled to be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">As to Rangel\u2019s second assignment of error, if we discharged him, the argument would be moot. But because the majority holds that the conviction is proper, we need to address the assignment, which alleges that the trial court\u2019s changing of Rangel\u2019s sentence after he stated his intention to appeal was presumptively vindictive and, therefore, violated the Due Process Clause.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">In <em>North Carolina v. </em>Pearce,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court held that due process is violated when a penalty is imposed on a defendant for successfully pursuing an appeal. The court concluded that vindictiveness cannot play a part in a sentence after a new trial, and that because \u201cfear of such vindictiveness may unconstitutionally deter a defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to appeal * * *, due process also requires that a defendant be freed of apprehension of such a retaliatory motivation on the part of the sentencing judge.\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> As a prophylactic measure, the court determined that a rebuttable presumption of vindictiveness exists when a harsher sentence is imposed following retrial unless \u201cidentifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original ' sentencing proceeding\u201d is demonstrated so as to justify the harsher sentence.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>The presumption of vindictiveness established in <em>Pearce </em>has been somewhat narrowed by later decisions of the United States Supreme Court and other courts.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> For example, the presumption has not been applied when the facts do not warrant its application, such as when new criminal conduct by the defendant supports a greater sentence<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> or when retrial is on additional counts.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Under the facts of this case, however, where the trial court increased Rangel\u2019s sentence immediately after he asserted his right to appeal, I believe that the presumption applies with more force even than in <em>Pearce. </em>As succinctly stated by a Texas appellate court, \u201c[W]e believe that if courts are prohibited from exercising vindictiveness on a retrial because of an accused\u2019s successful appellate attack, they are likewise prohibited from exercising vindictiveness because of a convicted felon\u2019s intention to appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The majority contends that the imposition of a harsher sentence after Rangel expressed his desire to appeal is not plain error. I do not believe that the defendant must object to a patently illegal sentence. But the imposition of an illegal sentence is plain error \u2014 obviously the outcome of the case would have been different but for the error. The transcript reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: It\u2019s the sentence of this Court that you be confined for a period of 180 days. CR, he\u2019s indigent. Suspend 150 of the days. I\u2019m placing him on one year\u2019s probation. The terms of probation are he\u2019s to enter school to learn English; he\u2019s to follow the proper steps to obtain valid alien status and a Social Security card; he\u2019s to follow all orders of his probation officer and conditions of probation. Commit 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">\u201cMR. NAMEI: Your Honor, may we have an extension on that? He has come to court every day, and also because we would like to appeal that <em>Daubert </em>issue. The 30 days, and he could come back after Christmas.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Can he post the bond?</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">\u201cMR. NAMEI: Yes, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Five thousand dollars?</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">\u201cMR. NAMEI: Yes, your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: Okay, Scratch the suspend 150 days. Commit 180 days. Stay January 13th in this room, 9:00 a.m.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">So, according to the record, before Rangel expressed his intention to appeal, he was to serve 30 days, but, after he asserted his intention to appeal, his sentence became 180 days. Most cases deal with greater sentences being imposed <em>after </em>an appeal.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Here, the trial court did not even wait that long \u2014 it imposed a greater sentence for the <em>intention </em>to appeal.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The record fails to provide an alternative reason for the harsher sentence. Thus, on its face, the sentence is vindictive and violates due process by penalizing Rangel for exercising his right to appeal. This court, in failing to recognize what is clear on the record, is abdicating its duty by upholding this blatantly unconstitutional sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b339-13\">.
