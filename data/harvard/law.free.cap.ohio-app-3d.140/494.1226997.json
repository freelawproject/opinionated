The plaintiffs are seven siblings and the mother of Lois Butler, who died on August 7, 1994, as the result of a head-on collision. The defendants are two lawyers and a law firm that represented Butler\u2019s estate, and also represented Butler\u2019s three surviving children, Karen, Jim, and Scott Butler. Lois Butler additionally had an eighth sibling, who is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">For purposes of summary judgment, the defendants assumed that the facts in the complaint were true. According to the complaint, the Butler children retained Jon Doughty, James Doughty, and Doughty &amp; Doughty as attorneys for Butler\u2019s estate on September 26, 1994. The attorneys were also retained to pursue claims for Lois Butler\u2019s wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Subsequently, Karen Butler was appointed administrator of her mother\u2019s estate. On October 12, 1994, the probate court approved the retention of Doughty &amp; Doughty. Thereafter, the Doughtys negotiated a $100,000 settlement with Motorists Mutual (the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance carrier). This settlement was based on an assumption that the tortfeasor\u2019s policy limits would be exhausted by the $100,000 payment. However, about $110,000 more in proceeds was still potentially available from the policy. A further settlement of $195,000 was later obtained from Nationwide (Mrs. Butler\u2019s underinsurance carrier).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">On April 10,1995, the probate court approved the Motorists Mutual settlement. Likewise, the probate court approved the Nationwide settlement on June 5, 1995. The settlement amounts were distributed to the three Butler children and to the defendants for their legal services. Although the defendants knew that Lois Butler was survived by a mother and several siblings, the mother and siblings were not listed as next of kin on the application to approve the partial wrongful death settlement. Further, defendants did not try to obtain any settlement or recovery for any next of kin other than the Butler children. The plaintiffs were not notified of the settlements, hearings, or approvals. In fact, they did not learn about the probate court proceedings until August 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">On June 27, 1997, plaintiffs filed a legal malpractice action against Jon Doughty, James Doughty, and Doughty &amp; Doughty. In the complaint, plaintiffs alleged that the defendants refused and failed to fulfill their professional duty to adequately represent all beneficiaries and next of kin. After discovery was conducted, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">On November 19, 1999, the trial court issued a decision granting summary judgment to the defendants. In the decision, the trial court noted that legal malpractice liability to third parties arises only where the third party is in privity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>with the attorney\u2019s client or where the attorney acts maliciously. Concerning the first point, the court found that the interests of the decedent\u2019s mother and siblings were not vested but were subject to a contingency. Accordingly, the court concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 interests were only potential and that the plaintiffs were not in privity with the fiduciary for the estate. This being the case, the attorneys for the fiduciary owed no duty to plaintiffs. The court also found that defendants had not acted maliciously.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Seven of the eight siblings who originally filed the complaint, and Mrs. Butler\u2019s mother, Cordia Brinkman, now appeal from the summary judgment decision. In a single assignment of error, the plaintiffs assert that the trial court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment. The specific issue presented for review is whether defendants owed a professional duty as attorneys to adequately represent the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Before addressing this point, we note that our review of summary judgment decisions is <em>de novo, ie., </em>we apply the standards used by the trial court. <em>Long v. Tokai Bank of California </em>(1996), 114 Ohio App.3d 116, 119, 682 N.E.2d 1052, 1054-1055. Under established standards, \u201csummary judgment is appropriate when (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party, said party being entitled to have the evidence construed most strongly in his favor.\u201d <em>Zivich v. Mentor Soccer Club, Inc. </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 367, 369-370, 696 N.E.2d 201, 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">In the present case, there is nothing to construe in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, since defendants accepted the facts in the complaint as true. Furthermore, the general law regarding an attorney\u2019s liability to third parties is not disputed. Specifically:</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">\u201cAn attorney is immune from liability to third persons arising from his performance as an attorney in good faith on behalf of, and with the knowledge of his client, unless such third person is in privity with the client or the attorney acts maliciously.\u201d <em>Scholler v. Scholler </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 98, 10 OBR 426, 462 N.E.2d 158, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Given these facts, the only pertinent question is whether the trial court was legally correct when it found a lack of privity between the wrongful death beneficiaries and the administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">As we mentioned, the trial court concluded that the beneficiaries had a \u201ccontingent,\u201d rather than a \u201cvested\u201d interest. Plaintiffs contend that this is incorrect, because the wrongful death statute (R.C. 2125.02) fixes the status of beneficiaries as of the decedent\u2019s death. According to plaintiffs, wrongful death beneficiaries are the \u201creal parties in interest,\u201d and the administrator is merely a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>nominal party. Further, because the administrator owes a fiduciary duty to each statutory beneficiary, the attorneys she retains owe the beneficiaries a corresponding duty of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">In response, defendants claim that the siblings\u2019 interests are merely contingent because the wrongful death statute does not presume that they have suffered damages. Notably, defendants make no similar assertion about Cordia Brink-man, the decedent\u2019s mother, who was within the class of persons \u201crebuttably presumed\u201d to have suffered damages as a result of Lois Butler\u2019s death. See R.C. 2125.02(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">In <em>Simon v. Zipperstein </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 74, 76-77, 512 N.E.2d 636, 637-639, the Ohio Supreme Court held that a potential beneficiary of an estate had no vested interest in the estate. Accordingly, the court held that the beneficiary lacked privity and could not sue the estate\u2019s attorney for negligently failing to comply with the decedent\u2019s testamentary intent. Subsequently, in <em>Elam v. Hyatt Legal Serv., Inc. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 175, 541 N.E.2d 616, the Ohio Supreme Court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">\u201cA beneficiary whose interest in an estate is vested is in privity with the fiduciary of the estate, and where such privity exists the attorney for the fiduciary is not immune from liability to the vested beneficiary for damages arising from the attorney\u2019s negligent performance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">In particular, the court stressed:</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">\u201cIt is the duty of the fiduciary of an estate to serve as the representative of the entire estate. Such fiduciary, in the administration of an estate,- owes a duty to beneficiaries to act in a manner which protects the beneficiaries\u2019 interests. We believe this duty places the beneficiaries in privity with the executor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176, 541 N.E.2d at 616, 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">Significantly, the court commented that \u201cat first blush,\u201d its holding appeared to contradict <em>Zipperstein. </em>However, the court distinguished <em>Zipperstein </em>by pointing to the lack of doubt about the status of the beneficiaries in its current case. Specifically, the beneficiaries were remaindermen who had been deprived, at least temporarily, of their interest in the decedent\u2019s property due to an attorney\u2019s negligent preparation of a deed. (The deed conveyed the property in fee simple and ignored the remaindermen\u2019s interest.) As was noted, the court observed that the remaindermen clearly had a vested interest. <em>Id. </em>at 177, 541 N.E.2d at 618. Ironically, the court then said in a footnote:</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">\u201cWe note without comment that, while the holding in <em>Zipperstein, supra, </em>was based largely on the fact that the person in question was only a potential beneficiary, a review of the facts seems to indicate that the person\u2019s interest was vested.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 177, 541 N.E.2d at 618, fn. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number><em>Zipperstein </em>involved a malpractice action against an attorney who had drafted both an antenuptial agreement and a will for a divorced father. <em>Zipperstein, </em>32 Ohio St.3d at 74-75, 512 N.E.2d at 636-637. Although the antenuptial agreement limited the survivorship interest of the decedent\u2019s new wife, the will (which was drafted later) did not mention the agreement. As a result, the wife obtained more property than the decedent appeared to have intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">After the father died, his son, who was a beneficiary under the will, filed a malpractice action against the attorney. <em>Id. </em>Under these circumstances, the Ohio Supreme Court held that the son was only a potential beneficiary and had no vested interest in the estate. The court\u2019s later observations in <em>Elam, </em>of course, cast doubt on this holding, since the son\u2019s interest appears to be as \u201cvested\u201d as that of the remaindermen in <em>Elam.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Subsequently, the Ohio Supreme Court appeared to expand <em>Elam </em>and to disregard the notion that an interest must be \u201cvested.\u201d In this regard, the court indicated that privity arises as a result of the fiduciary relationship itself. Specifically, the court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\"><em>\u201cElam </em>therefore recognizes that an attorney retained by a fiduciary owes a similar duty to those with whom the client has a fiduciary relationship. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\"><em>\u201cA fortiori </em>those persons to whom a fiduciary duty is owed are in privity with the fiduciary such that an attorney-client relationship established with the fiduciary extends to those in privity therewith regarding matters to which the fiduciary duty relates.\u201d <em>Arpadi v. First MSP Corp. </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 453, 458, 628 N.E.2d 1335, 1339.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\"><em>Zipperstein, Elam, </em>and <em>Arpadi </em>did not involve wrongful death beneficiaries, but <em>Elam </em>and <em>Arpadi </em>did deal with fiduciary relationships between the direct client of the attorney and the party bringing the malpractice action. Given the Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in these cases, Karen Butler\u2019s attorney-client relationship with the defendants extended to the statutory beneficiaries. Like the fiduciaries in <em>Arpadi </em>and <em>Elam, </em>Karen Butler owed a fiduciary duty to all statutory beneficiaries, and they were, therefore, in privity with her for purposes of her attorney-client relationship with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">We note that we reached a similar result in <em>DePugh v. Sladoje </em>(1996), 111 Ohio App.3d 675, 676 N.E.2d 1231, although in a slightly different factual situation, <em>ie., </em>in <em>DePugh, </em>an estate\u2019s <em>administrator </em>was allowed to bring suit against an attorney who had individually represented a wrongful death beneficiary. In <em>DePugh, </em>the decedent\u2019s father was appointed administrator, and he then filed a wrongful death action. One group of attorneys represented the father as the administrator and as a beneficiary, and another attorney represented the decedent\u2019s common-law wife. After a dispute arose, the father agreed to resign as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>administrator. His attorneys also dismissed the wrongful death action in the mistaken belief that the savings statute applied and would provide an additional year for filing suit. However, the savings statute did not apply because the statute of limitations had not yet elapsed when the suit was dismissed. <em>Id. </em>at 678-679, 676 N.E.2d at 1233-1234.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">By the time the wife was appointed to administer the estate, the statute of limitations had expired but the attorneys did not realize it. Instead, they filed new actions on behalf of the administrator and the father. Subsequently, the father\u2019s suit was dismissed because of the expiration of the limitations period, and the estate\u2019s suit was settled for a nominal sum, allegedly due to the attorneys\u2019 belated realization that the statute of limitations had expired. <em>Id. </em>at 679, 676 N.E.2d at 1234.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Ultimately, the father was again appointed administrator. He then filed a malpractice action against his own attorneys as well as the wife\u2019s attorneys. These latter attorneys did not represent the estate before the limitations period expired; rather, they represented the wife in her personal capacity. Citing <em>Elam, </em>the father argued that he was in privity with the wife as a vested beneficiary of the estate and could, therefore, assert a claim against her attorneys. <em>Id. </em>at 682, 676 N.E.2d at 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">In considering this claim, we noted that it was the reverse of the one presented in <em>Elam. </em>Specifically, <em>Elam </em>involved a beneficiary\u2019s claim against the attorney, while <em>DePugh </em>involved the administrator\u2019s malpractice claim on behalf of a beneficiary of the estate. <em>Id. </em>at 682-683, 676 N.E.2d at 1236-1237. Nonetheless, we concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">\u201c[T]he rationale by which the Supreme Court held in <em>Elam </em>that privity exists between the beneficiary of an estate and the fiduciary so as to support the beneficiary\u2019s legal malpractice action against the fiduciary\u2019s attorney is equally persuasive under the facts in this case. To the extent that * * * [the attorneys\u2019] representation of * * * [the wife] as a beneficiary of the estate compromised the estate\u2019s wrongful death claim * * *, we hold that the estate may have a malpractice action against them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 683, 676 N.E.2d at 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">In <em>DePugh, </em>we did not discuss the status of the beneficiaries under the wrongful death statute. Moreover, unlike the present case, <em>DePugh </em>did not involve \u201cother next of kin.\u201d Instead, the father and common-law wife were persons, like Cordia Brinkman, who were rebuttably presumed under R.C. 2125.02 to have suffered damages. However, these distinctions are insignificant. As we noted, the Ohio Supreme Court has held that if a fiduciary relationship exists, the attorney-client relationship extends to those parties included in the fiduciary relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Furthermore, even if the Supreme Court had adhered to its distinction between \u201cvested\u201d and \u201ccontingent\u201d interests, all the statutory wrongful death beneficiaries had a vested interest. Specifically, under R.C. 2125.02(A)(1), the personal representative of the decedent is required to bring a wrongful death action in the name of the decedent for the exclusive benefit of the surviving spouse, children, parents, and other next of kin. R.C. 2125.02(A)(3)(a) additionally indicates that the decedent\u2019s date of death fixes the status of all beneficiaries of an action for wrongful death for purposes of determining the damages suffered. In this respect, wrongful death cases are like actions involving the contents of wills, <em>i.e., </em>the legal right to recovery arises or is fixed at the time of death. In our opinion, this is sufficient to give the beneficiaries a vested interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Defendants contend that the siblings\u2019 right to recover was not vested because they must prove damages to recover. According to the Ohio Supreme Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">\u201cThe word \u2018vested\u2019 has a double meaning. The word \u2018vest\u2019 is defined in Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary (3 Rev.) as \u2018to give an immediate fixed right of present or future enjoyment. An estate is vested in possession when there exists a right of present enjoyment; and an estate is vested in interest when there is a present fixed right of future enjoyment.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">\u201cThe word \u2018vested,\u2019 standing alone, includes both present and future enjoyment so long as the right to such present or future enjoyment is presently fixed.\u201d <em>Brown v. Buyer\u2019s Corp. </em>(1973), 35 Ohio St.2d 191, 195-196, 64 O.O.2d 126, 128-129, 299 N.E.2d 279, 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">By contrast, \u201ca contingent claim is one, the liability upon which is dependent upon some uncertain future event which may or may not occur. It is this element of dependency upon an uncertainty which renders a claim contingent.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">\u201cA liability on an unliquidated claim for , damages arising out of a tort does not depend for its creation upon the occurrence of some uncertain event in the future. On the contrary, such claim is, as of necessity it must be, based on the theory that the event, the tort, giving rise to liability, has already occurred, and that a cause of action has already accrued and is in existence. A claim thus grounded cannot be said to be contingent.\u201d <em>Pierce v. Johnson </em>(1939), 136 Ohio St. 95, 98-99, 16 O.O. 34, 36, 23 N.E.2d 993, 995.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">Consequently, because the tort giving rise to the claim for Butler\u2019s wrongful death had already occurred, the interest of Butler\u2019s statutory beneficiaries was vested, not contingent. The fact that the beneficiaries had to prove their damages did not make their interest contingent. Indeed, if this were the case, all tort claims would be \u201ccontingent,\u201d since proof of damages is always required as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>basis for recovery. As was noted, the Ohio Supreme Court has used a different analysis for deciding whether claims are contingent.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">As an alternate basis for the trial court\u2019s decision, defendants contend that privity is lacking with regard to all beneficiaries because all plaintiffs disclaimed any interest in the proceeds of the settlement from Lois Butler\u2019s wrongful death. However, these facts were not stipulated in the trial court, nor was this argument addressed below. Accordingly, we decline to consider it. See, <em>e.g., Dayton Monetary Assoc. v. Becker </em>(1998), 126 Ohio App.3d 527, 539, 710 N.E.2d 1151, 1159-1160 (appellate court will not consider materials that were not presented to the trial court). If necessary, the trial court can address this issue on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Defendants\u2019 final argument is that recognizing attorney liability in this type of situation opens \u201cPandora\u2019s Box,\u201d and will make attorneys hesitant to settle cases before trial or appeal. As authority for this theory, defendants cite the dissenting opinion in <em>DePugh, supra. </em>In the dissent, Judge Young observed that lawyers will be reluctant to settle cases if their judgment can later be questioned by potential beneficiaries of the settlement. 111 Ohio App.3d at 689-690, 676 N.E.2d at 1240-1241. However, we declined to adopt that position in <em>DePugh, </em>and do not need to further address it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">In light of the preceding discussion, the plaintiffs\u2019 single assignment of error is sustained. The decision of the trial court is reversed, and this case is hereby remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b544-9\">Wolff and Frederick N.
