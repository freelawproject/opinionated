On appeal, Chen argues that the IJ denied him his due process rights to a full and fair hearing by not providing required oral advice and that the IJ abused his discretion by denying Chen\u2019s motion for change of venue. In addition, Chen argues that the evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility findings, and that there was substantial evidence from which to find that Chen was eligible for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT. We deny his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Chen claims that the IJ failed to satisfy the procedural requirements of his immigration proceedings by not giving him certain oral advice. This is essentially a due process claim. We review constitutional claims <em>de novo. Lonyem v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1341 (11th Cir.2003) (reviewing an alien\u2019s motion to reopen his <em>in absentia </em>removal hearing). We held in <em>Lonyem </em>that \u201c[t]o establish due process violations in removal proceedings, aliens must show that they were deprived of liberty without due process of law, and that the asserted errors caused them substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1341-42; <em>see also Gonzalez-Oropeza v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1333 (11th Cir.2003). To establish substantial prejudice a claimant is required to show that the result would have been different. <em>See Patel v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>334 F.3d 1259, 1263 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Ibrahim v. INS, </em>821 F.2d 1547, 1550 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Chen has failed to show that he was substantially prejudiced as a result of any error. The IJ did inform Chen as to the removability charges against him in non-technical language at his first appearance. Chen also argues that the IJ did not ask for his plea, but Chen conceded that he was removable in his motion for change of venue. As to other advice, Chen was represented by counsel, who did not object to the failure to give it. More importantly, Chen does not argue that the outcome of his removal hearing would have been different if the advice had been given. Therefore, Chen has not shown that he was substantially prejudiced, and his due process claim fails. <em>See Patel, </em>334 F.3d at 1263.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">Chen also argues that the IJ abused his discretion in denying his motion to change venue. An immigration judge may change venue for \u201cgood cause\u201d upon motion by one of the parties. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.20(b). \u201cIn determining whether to grant [a change of venue] motion, an immigration judge usually considers such factors as, inter alia, administrative convenience, expeditious treatment of the case, the location of the witnesses, and the costs of transporting witnesses or evidence to a new situs.\u201d <em>Matter of Velasquez, </em>19 I &amp; N Dec. 377, 382-83 (BIA 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">Chen\u2019s only statements to support his motion were that he was living in New York and that he and the witnesses would suffer undue hardship if the hearing was held in Miami. He never explained what witnesses he had or what testimony they might give. Chen was also able to obtain local counsel in Florida. The IJ found that Chen had presented no evidence to overcome the district director\u2019s choice of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">Because Chen has failed to show that there was good cause for a change in venue, the IJ did not abuse his discretion when he denied Chen\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-13\">Chen argues that the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>supported by the evidence and that he established eligibility for asylum based on past persecution because of his wife\u2019s forced sterilization and a well-founded fear of persecution because of his Falun Gong membership. When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, \u201cexcept to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the Board adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, [this Court] reviewfs] the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision with regard to the denial of Chen\u2019s claims for asylum, withholding of removal under the INA, and protection under the CAT. Accordingly, we have considered the IJ\u2019s decision as well as the BIA\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">To the extent that the decisions of the BIA and IJ were based on a legal determination, we review <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). We review factual determinations under the substantial evidence test and \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s [and IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84 (quotation omitted). A finding of fact will be reversed \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">An alien who arrives in, or is present in, the United States may apply for asylum. INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-11\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant has the burden of proving \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-14\">To establish asylum eligibility, the petitioner must, with specific and credible evidence, demonstrate (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 <em>C.F.R. \u00a7 </em>208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. \u201cThe testimony of the applicant, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). The IJ is entitled to require corroboration where he provides cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding, and that finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-15\">A credibility determination,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> like other factual findings, is reviewed under the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>stantial evidence test. <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818. An adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application, so long as the IJ offers \u201cspecific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding\u201d and does not overlook other evidence produced by the asylum applicant. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">The IJ noted several inconsistencies in Chen\u2019s statements: (1) he failed to mention the forced sterilization at both his initial interview and credible fear hearing, (2) he did not provide testimony about his participation in Falun Gong, and (3) he did not know the countries through which he traveled on his way to the United States. Chen\u2019s response to the IJ\u2019s findings regarding his failures to mention the forced sterilization and to provide testimony about his participation in Falun Gong is that he was not asked the right questions. Chen also notes his lack of education and the fact that he was extremely nervous when answering the questions. Chen\u2019s explanations do not satisfy his burden of producing specific and credible evidence to show that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">In response to this adverse credibility determination, Chen was unable to offer sufficient corroborative evidence to demonstrate that he is a refugee. Chen\u2019s only testimony concerning Falun Gong was that \u201cFalun Gong teach us Jing, Xu, Ru. Translate, Jing [ ] means truthfulness. Xu means kindness, Ru means tireless.\u201d The only document supplied regarding Falun Gong was provided by the government. Chen\u2019s only evidence of his wife\u2019s forced sterilization was a certificate showing that his wife had \u201cfemale sterilization surgery.\u201d There was no indication on the certificate that it was forced or mandated by the government. Accordingly, Chen has not met his burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The IJ presented specific, cogent reasons for his adverse credibility finding and these reasons are supported by substantial evidence in the record. Chen has not responded with sufficient corroborative evidence to prove that he is a refugee. Therefore, because Chen failed to provide specific and credible evidence demonstrating past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s conclusion that Chen failed to meet his burden of proof to establish his eligibility for asylum. Nothing in the record compels us to reverse this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">Chen also argues that he is eligible for withholding of removal and CAT relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The burden of proof for an applicant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>for withholding of removal under the INA and CAT relief is higher than the burden imposed on an asylum applicant. <em>Al Najjar, 257 </em>F.3d at 1292-93, 1303-04; <em>see also Forgue v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1288 n. 4 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, because we affirm the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Chen failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution in order to be entitled to asylum, we also affirm the denial of withholding of removal and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-8\">. Amendments to this section by \u00a7 101(a)(3) of the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, 303, do not apply to this petition because the final order in this case was entered on March 1, 2005, before \u00a7 101(a)(3) took effect in May 2005. <em>See </em>The REAL ID Act \u00a7 101(h)(2), 119 Stat. at 305.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-16\">. The REAL ID Act of 2005 amended the law regarding credibility determinations by adding INA \u00a7\u00a7 208(b)(3)(B)(iii), 240(c)(4)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(3)(B)(iii), 1229a(c)(4)(C). Section 101(a)(3) and (d), Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, 303, 304-05. The Act states, however, that these provisions \u201cshall apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>applications for asylum, withholding, or other relief from removal made on or after\u201d the date of enactment of the act, May 11, 2005. Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. at 305. Therefore, because Chen's application for asylum was filed before May 11, 2005, these provisions do not apply in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b98-6\">. The government argues that this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider the CAT claim because Chen did not raise this issue on appeal to the BIA and, therefore, did not exhaust his administrative remedies. Although Chen failed to raise the issue in his notice of appeal to the BIA, Chen stated in his brief in support of appeal that the \"IJ erred in the January 15, 2004 decision denying his claim for political asylum, for withholding of removal under Section 241(b)(3) of the [INA] and relief under the Convention against Torture.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
