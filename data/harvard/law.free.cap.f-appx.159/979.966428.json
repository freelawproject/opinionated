Thomas argues that the district court (1) erroneously denied his motion to suppress evidence found in his home because the warrant was not sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>ported by probable cause, (2) erroneously denied his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and (3) abused its discretion by denying his motion to remove counsel. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">In August 2005, Detective Aaron Zawistowski met a confidential informant who said he could purchase drugs from Thomas\u2019s apartment located at 1555 14th Avenue, Apartment 109, Vero Beach, Florida. On August 7, officers met the informant, searched the informant for contraband, and provided the informant with marked currency to purchase drugs from the apartment. The informant entered the apartment and emerged about five minutes later with cocaine and ecstasy pills. On August 12, the officers conducted a similar procedure, and the informant purchased a small amount of cocaine. On both occasions, although the officers did not see the events in the apartment, the officers heard conversations through an electronic listening device on the informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">On August 16, Zawistowski submitted to a Florida judge an affidavit in support of a warrant to search Thomas\u2019s residence. The warrant was issued. The next day, detectives executed the warrant and found drugs on Thomas and in his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">Thomas was indicted on four counts of possession with the intent to distribute. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). On January 11, 2005, the day of the trial, Thomas made two motions. Thomas first moved for new counsel based on his appointed counsel\u2019s refusal to file a motion to suppress. Thomas\u2019s counsel stated that he refused to file the motion because he determined that there were no grounds to challenge the warrant or the evidence. After it considered the validity of the search warrant and the proffer of evidence by the government, the district court denied Thomas\u2019s motion for new counsel as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-10\">Thomas also moved to suppress the evidence of drugs and argued that the warrant was not valid. During a hearing to determine whether probable cause supported the warrant, Zawistowski testified about his meetings with the informant and the investigation that resulted in the warrant application. The district court denied Thomas\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-11\">Thomas then volunteered to enter a guilty plea, but reserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress. Thomas stated that he had discussed the indictment with his attorney and was competent to plead guilty. Although the court asked Thomas whether his counsel was forcing him to plead guilty, Thomas stated that he was \u201cpleading guilty of [his] own volition.\u201d Thomas also acknowledged that his plea would waive his rights to a trial by jury at which the government would have to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. After the court informed Thomas of the maximum and minimum charges for each count he faced, Thomas stated that he understood the consequences of his plea. The court accepted Thomas\u2019s conditional guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-12\">On February 23, Thomas moved to withdraw his guilty plea. Thomas argued that his counsel was ineffective at the suppression hearing and Zawistowski had made false statements in the search warrant affidavit. The district court considered the factors in <em>United States v. Buckles, </em>843 F.2d 469, 471 (11th Cir.1988), and denied Thomas\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea because the plea was voluntary and Thomas had failed to show a reason to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-13\">The court sentenced Thomas to 292 months of imprisonment for the first three counts of the indictment and 190 months of imprisonment for the last count.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a warrant affidavit established probable cause. <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2000). We review findings of fact in a denial of a motion to suppress for clear error and construe those facts in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>231 F.3d 750, 754 (11th Cir.2000); <em>Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d at 1248. The decision to allow a defendant to withdraw his guilty plea is \u201cleft to the sound discretion of the trial court,\u201d and we reverse only if the denial was \u201carbitrary or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Buckles, </em>843 F.2d at 471. We review the denial of a motion for new counsel for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1327 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">Thomas raises three arguments on appeal. Thomas argues that the district court erroneously denied his motions to suppress evidence, withdraw his guilty plea, and appoint new counsel. We discuss each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">A <em>The District Court Did Not Err by Denying Thomas\u2019s Motion to Suppress.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-8\">Thomas argues that the district court erred when it denied his motion to suppress evidence because the affidavit by Zawistowski in support of the search warrant did not establish probable cause. The Fourth Amendment states, \u201cno [wjarrants shall issue, but upon probable cause.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV. To establish probable cause, \u201ca warrant affidavit must show that there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found at the particular place to be searched.\u201d <em>Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d at 1247. \u201c[T]he affidavit must establish a connection between the defendant and the residence to be searched and a link between the residence and any criminal activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>297 F.3d 1308, 1314 (11th Cir.2002). A warrant will not issue on an affidavit that is \u201cso lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1313. A defendant has the burden to make a \u201csubstantial preliminary showing\u201d to attack the veracity of an affidavit in support of a search warrant. <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 155-56, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 2676, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-10\">Thomas failed to satisfy his burden. In the affidavit, Zawistowski testified that an informant had told him cocaine and ecstasy could be purchased from an apartment \u201coccupied by or under the control of Phillip Thomas,\u201d and the informant\u2019s statements were corroborated by two controlled purchases from the apartment that yielded cocaine and ecstasy. Zawistowski\u2019s affidavit established a link between Thomas, the apartment to be searched, and the likelihood of illegal drugs in the apartment. Thomas provided no evidentiary support for his argument that Zawistowski made false statements at the suppression hearing. He likewise provides no authority for his assertion that the four days between the second controlled drug purchase and the application of the search warrant reduced the probability of criminal activity in the apartment. The district court did not err when it denied Thomas\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-11\">\n<em>B. The District Court Did Not Arbitrarily or Unreasonably Deny Thomas\u2019s Motion to Withdraw His Guilty Plea.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-12\">Thomas contends that the district court erred when it denied his motion to withdraw the guilty plea because Thomas did not have effective legal representation. \u201c[T]he defendant has the burden of showing a fair and just reason for withdrawal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>his plea.\u201d <em>Buckles, </em>843 F.2d at 471; Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(e). To determine whether the defendant has met his burden, we consider the totality of the circumstances including \u201c(1) whether close assistance of counsel was available; (2) whether the plea was knowing and voluntary; (3) whether judicial resources would be conserved; and (4) whether the government would be prejudiced if the defendant were allowed to withdraw his plea.\u201d <em>Buckles, </em>843 F.2d at 471-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">Thomas has failed to establish a \u201cfair and just reason for withdrawal of his plea.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 471. The district made factual findings for each <em>Buckles </em>factor: (1) Thomas was represented by counsel; (2) at the plea colloquy, Thomas stated that he was \u201cpleading guilty of [his] own volition,\u201d was competent to understand the indictment, and acknowledged that he was waiving his rights to a jury trial; (3) to reselect a jury for Thomas\u2019s trial would be a waste of judicial resources; and (4) the government would be prejudiced by a withdrawal of the guilty plea because witnesses may not be available. Although the district court informed Thomas that it would consider the <em>Buckles </em>factors, Thomas failed to offer any arguments or evidence to bolster his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">Thomas argues that his plea was not voluntary because his counsel led him to believe that he would receive a life sentence if he did not plead guilty, but this argument fails for at least two reasons. First, the court informed Thomas of the mandatory minimum and maximum sentences for each charge he faced. This negated any alleged misinformation Thomas received from his counsel, and Thomas had the opportunity to reconsider his decision before he entered the guilty plea. Second, the record belies Thomas\u2019s assertion that his plea was not voluntary. The court specifically asked Thomas if his plea was coerced and informed Thomas of the consequences of his plea. Thomas personally volunteered to plead guilty after his motion to suppress was denied. The denial of Thomas\u2019s motion to withdraw the guilty plea was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-10\">\n<em>C. Thomas Waived His Right to Appeal the Denial of His Motion to Remove Counsel.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-12\">Thomas next argues that the district court abused its discretion when it denied his motion to remove counsel. A defendant who voluntarily enters a conditional guilty plea waives all non-jurisdictional issues other than the specific issue reserved for appeal. <em>See United States v. Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir.1998). Thomas waived his right to appeal the denial of his motion to remove counsel. Because Thomas\u2019s plea was voluntary, and he did not reserve the right to appeal the denial of his motion to appoint new counsel, we will not consider his argument that the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-13\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-14\">Thomas\u2019s conviction for possession with the intent to distribute is</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
