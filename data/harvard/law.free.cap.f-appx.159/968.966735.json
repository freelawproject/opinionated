Holmes also argues that the district court erred in denying his request for a mitigating role reduction, pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3B1.2(a), because he was plainly the least culpable of the group of co-conspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">As will be discussed below, we only need reach Holmes\u2019s first argument because his second one is moot. We have jurisdiction to review Holmes\u2019s first issue under <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>106 F.3d 1553, 1556-57 (11th Cir.1997). When an appellant raises a claim of error not objected to before the district court we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. de</em>nied, \u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). We \u201cmay not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">A defendant has the burden of proving his eligibility for relief under the safety-valve provision. <em>Cruz, </em>106 F.3d at 1557. To be eligible for the safety-valve provision, a defendant must satisfy five conditions, the first of which is that he cannot have more than one criminal history point. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f); <em>United States v. Orozco, </em>121 F.3d 628, 630 (11th Cir.1997) (per curiam); U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5C1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">We conclude that Holmes did not qualify for a safety-valve reduction because he had more than one criminal history point. We need not address Holmes\u2019s second issue because Holmes was sentenced according to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence. Even if Holmes were entitled to a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a) \u201crole reduction,\u201d his sentence would be the same because the statutory minimum without a safety-valve reduction exceeds the guideline recommendation. <em>See Cruz, </em>106 F.3d at 1555 n. 3. Accordingly, we affirm Holmes\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
