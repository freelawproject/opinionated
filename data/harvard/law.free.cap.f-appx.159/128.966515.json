Clarke asserts the district court erred in its (1) interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b) when it denied Clarke\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, (2) refusal to instruct the jury on the defense of entrapment by estoppel, and (3) limitation of Clarke\u2019s opening statement and prohibition of expert psychiatric testimony. The district court did not err, and we affirm Clarke\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-16\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b157-17\">A. <em>Statutory interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 224.2(b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-19\">Clarke asserts his conviction for persuading a minor to engage in prostitution \u201ccannot stand,\u201d as he was neither charged with, nor could he have been convicted of, \u201cengaging] in any sexual activity (including prostitution) for which any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>person can be charged with a crime.\u201d According to Clarke, \u00a7 2422(b), as written, only makes it a crime to induce a minor to engage in any sexual activity if that sexual activity is criminal. Clarke claims the statutory construction, specifically, the lack of a comma following the word \u201cprostitution,\u201d means the phrase \u201cfor which any person can be charged with a criminal offense\u201d must be read to modify the prior phrase \u201cprostitution or any sexual activity.\u201d Clarke further asserts based upon this statutory construction of \u00a7 2422(b) that Congress only intended to punish a person for engaging in \u201cillegal prostitution\u201d overseas, but \u201cnot all forms of prostitution.\u201d Moreover, Clarke argues, although Congress has the power to criminalize the conduct' of a U.S. citizen who engages in conduct in a foreign country that is deemed legal in that country, Congress only criminalized \u201cengaging in underage prostitution <em>as defined and proscribed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the act of prostitution occurs.\u201d </em>Accordingly, Clarke argues, the prosecution was required to, but did not, present evidence the type of prostitution in which he intended to engage was \u201cthe sort of prostitution for which any person can be charged with a crime in Costa Rica.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">\u201cThe interpretation of a statute is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>United States v. Murrell, </em>368 F.3d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 439, 160 L.Ed.2d 324 (2004) (citation omitted). Subsection (b) of \u00a7 2422 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">Whoever, using the mail or any facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce ... knowingly persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any individual who has not attained the age of 18 years, to engage in prostitution or any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense, or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than 5 years and not more than 30 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Clarke cites no authority to support his contention the phrase \u201cfor which any person can be charged with a criminal offense\u201d must be read to modify both \u201cprostitution\u201d and \u201cany sexual activity.\u201d Moreover, prostitution is a form of sexual activity, and Clarke\u2019s reading results in the term \u201cprostitution\u201d being superfluous, which must be avoided. <em>United States v. Ballinger, </em>395 F.3d 1218, 1236 (11th Cir.) (en banc) (noting it is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute must be construed such that no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 368, 163 L.Ed.2d 77 (2005). Finally, even if Clarke were correct that the Government was required to show the prostitution in question is illegal in Costa Rica, both Agent Patterson and Detective Love testified it is illegal to engage in prostitution with a minor in Costa Rica. Accordingly, the district court did not err in its interpretation of \u00a7 2422(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-13\">B. <em>Jury instruction on entrapment by estoppel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-14\">Clarke next contends the district court erred by failing to give an entrapment by estoppel instruction to the jury, as he provided sufficient evidence for the matter to go to the jury. Clarke contends whether he knew Detective Richard Love was acting on behalf of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is irrelevant, as the defense of entrapment by estoppel focuses on the conduct of government officials, rather than on the defendant\u2019s state of mind. Clarke explains \u201claw enforcement may not benefit from its own wrongful act,\u201d whereby a citizen is prosecuted for engaging in criminal conduct that law enforcement counseled him to undertake. Clarke asserts his reliance on Detective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Love was reasonable, especially since Detective Love held himself out to be \u201ca very experienced, qualified, law-abiding purvey- or of sex tourism.\u201d Moreover, Clarke argues, he was assured by Detective Love the prostitutes were required to be tested for diseases once a month, and Detective Love \u201cacknowledged that the logical and ordinary inference from his representation ... was that it was the government of Costa Rica that imposed such a requirement.\u201d Clarke further argues both Detective Love and the website assured him the sexual activities being offered were \u201csafe\u201d and \u201csecure.\u201d According to Clarke, the representations of Detective Love and the website \u201ctold a single, consistent, coherent story: the sex tourism being offered to [him] was legal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The denial of a requested jury instruction is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Trujillo, </em>146 F.3d 838, 846 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cThe trial court has authority to refuse to instruct the jury on a defense where the evidence used to support it, if believed, fails to establish a legally cognizable defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Billue, </em>994 F.2d 1562, 1568 (11th. Cir. 1993). To assert the defense of entrapment by estoppel, a defendant must \u201c \u2018actually rely on a point of law misrepresented by an official of the state; and such reliance must be objectively reasonable\u2014 given the identity of the official, the point of law represented, and the substance of the misrepresentation.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Eaton, </em>179 F.3d 1328, 1332 (11th Cir.1999) (citation omitted). \u201cThe defense \u2018focuses on the conduct of the Government officials, not on the state of mind of the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Clarke does not allege Detective Love ever identified himself to Clarke as a law enforcement officer. Clarke knew Detective Love as his alias, Richard Baxter, the owner of CRTV, who provided a travel service whereby clients were connected with prostitutes in Costa Rica. Accordingly, Clarke\u2019s reliance on statements made by Detective Love, in the guise of Richard Baxter, was objectively unreasonable, as a reasonable person would not rely upon a pimp for legal guidance. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, Clarke points to no statements in the record where he either asked Detective Love about the legality of the services provided by CRTV or Detective Love volunteered that CRTV\u2019s services were legal. On the contrary, Detective Love instructed Clarke what Clarke was doing was not \u201ckosher,\u201d and Clarke responded he \u201cknew that\u201d and figured as much. Contrary to Clarke\u2019s contentions, the terms \u201csecure\u201d and \u201csafe\u201d are not synonymous with \u201clegal.\u201d Moreover, Detective Love\u2019s statements he occasionally had sex with the prostitutes does not indicate such behavior was legal. Furthermore, as the district court noted, the only \u201caffirmative statement\u201d made by Detective Love, that the prostitutes were required to be tested monthly for disease, was subsequently followed in the conversation by Detective Love\u2019s statement to Clarke that the conduct in which he intended to engage was not kosher. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to instruct the jury regarding the defense of entrapment by estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">C. <em>Fair trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Finally, Clarke asserts the \u201ccumulative effect of adverse evidentiary and procedural rulings by the trial court deprived [him] of a fair trial under the 5th and 6th Amendments.\u201d According to Clarke, the district court \u201cunfairly limited\u201d his opening statement by (1) excluding the board he intended to use a visual aid, and (2) sustaining objections by the Government when he stated the evidence would show he had not taken any \u201csubstantial steps\u201d and law enforcement officers led him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>believe the Costa Rican government tested the prostitutes for diseases. Clarke contends as a result he was prevented from \u201claying two essential building blocks\u201d of his defense, that the evidence would show (1) he had not taken the \u201csubstantial step\u201d to distinguish his \u201cnon-criminal\u201d conduct from criminal attempt, and (2) law enforcement officers led him to believe the conduct he was planning was \u201cnot proscribed by criminal sanctions.\u201d Clarke further contends he was prevented from presenting testimony, which supported his defense, by Dr. Haber, who would have testified Clarke (1) was not a pedophile, (2) was not sexually aroused by or attracted to prepubescent females, and (3) suffers from clinical depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">We review for an abuse of discretion Clarke\u2019s claim the district court improperly limited his opening statement. <em>See United States v. Burns, </em>298 F.3d 523, 543 (6th Cir.2002) (stating a district judge\u2019s conduct of a trial, including opening statements, is reviewed for an abuse of discretion). \u201cA district court\u2019s decision regarding the admissibility of psychiatric evidence is generally subject to the abuse of discretion standard of review.\u201d <em>United States v. Westcott, </em>83 F.3d 1354, 1357 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">An opening statement gives counsel the opportunity to state what evidence will be presented in order to make it easier for the jurors to understand what is to follow, and is not an occasion for argument. <em>See United States v. Zielie, </em>734 F.2d 1447, 1455 (11th Cir.1984), <em>abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Chestang, </em>849 F.2d 528, 531 (11th Cir.1988). \u201cThe scope and extent of the defendant\u2019s opening statement rests largely in the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>United States v. Freeman, </em>514 F.2d 1184, 1192 (10th Cir.1975). The court \u201ccan exclude irrelevant facts and stop argument if it occurs.\u201d <em>Zielie, </em>734 F.2d at 1455.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The Insanity Defense Reform Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution under any Federal statute that, at the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the defendant, as a result of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his acts. Mental disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 17(a). When evaluating the admissibility of psychiatric evidence, courts should consider the following principles: (1) \u201c[pjsychiatric evidence of impaired volitional control or inability to reflect on the ultimate consequences of one\u2019s conduct is inadmissible whether offered to support an insanity defense or for any other purpose;\u201d (2) \u201cCongress intended to insure that the insanity defense is not improperly resurrected in the guise of showing some other <em>affirmative defense </em>such as that the defendant had a \u2018diminished responsibility or some similarly asserted state of mind which would serve to <em>excuse </em>the offense;\u201d and (3) \u201cCongress was concerned about the danger that expert psychiatric testimony regarding inherently malleable psychological concepts can be misused at trial to mislead or confuse the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Cameron, </em>907 F.2d 1051, 1061-62 (11th Cir.1990) (internal quotation and citation omitted) (emphasis in original). \u201cEvidence offered as \u2018psychiatric evidence to negate specific intent\u2019 is admissible, however, when such evidence focuses on the defendant\u2019s specific state of mind at the time of the charged offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1067. \u201cBecause psychiatric evidence (1) will only rarely negate specific intent, (2) presents an inherent danger that it will distract the jury[] from focusing on the actual presence or absence of <em>mens rea, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>and (3) may easily slide into wider usage that opens up the jury to theories of defense more akin to justification, district courts must examine such psychiatric evidence carefully to ascertain whether it would, if believed, support a legally acceptable theory of lack of <em>mens rea.\u201d Id. </em>(internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">As an initial matter, Clarke failed to include the board he intended to use as a visual aid in the record on appeal, as required by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 10(b)(2). <em>See Fernandez v. United States, </em>941 F.2d 1488, 1493 (11th Cir.1991) (holding the appellant is responsible for ensuring all documents buttressing his claims appear in the record). Consequently, we are unable to determine whether the district court abused its discretion by determining Clarke could display only the left-hand side during his opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Prior to Clarke\u2019s opening statement, the court ruled he was prohibited from making legal argument in his opening statement. Clarke, however, repeatedly disregarded the court\u2019s ruling regarding the use of legal terms such as \u201csubstantial steps,\u201d using such language and forcing the Government to object at each instance. In addition, rather than merely stating the evidence that would come out at trial regarding Detective Love\u2019s telling him the prostitutes were required to be tested, Clarke argued he was led to believe the Costa Rican government tested the prostitutes for diseases. Contrary to Clarke\u2019s contentions, he did not have a right to make legal arguments in his opening statement. <em>See Zielie, </em>734 F.2d at 1455. Moreover, a court is permitted to stop a party from arguing during its opening statement, as occurred in the present case. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by prohibiting Clarke from making legal arguments during his opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Clarke also claims the district court abused its discretion by prohibiting expert psychiatric testimony. At the hearing, Dr. Haber testified Clarke intended to take the actions necessary to travel to Costa Rica, and knew what he was \u201csigning up for was not legal.\u201d Dr. Haber also testified Clarke was conscious of his actions, had the capacity for self-reflection over the course of the telephone conversations, and had \u201ca requisite understanding of his actions and their consequences.\u201d Dr. Haber described her assessment of Clarke\u2019s depression as an explanation that provided insight into the motivations behind his actions, but was not an excuse for those actions. Accordingly, even if believed, Dr. Haber\u2019s testimony failed to support a legally acceptable theory demonstrating a lack of <em>mens rea, </em>but, on the contrary, as she stated, only served to explain Clarke\u2019s actions, rather than negate either the knowledge or intent behind those actions. <em>See Cameron, </em>907 F.2d at 1067. Consequently, the district court did not abuse its discretion in prohibiting Clarke from presenting expert psychiatric testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">The district court did not err in its interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b). Additionally, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to instruct the jury on the defense of entrapment by estoppel or by limiting Clarke\u2019s opening statement and prohibiting expert psychiatric testimony. We affirm Clarke\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
