Guzman appeals an order of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas affirming the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security Benefits, Jo Anne B. Barn-hart, that Guzman was not entitled to disability benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act. Finding the Commissioner\u2019s decision supported by substantial evidence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-16\">/</p>\n<p id=\"b607-17\">Porfiro S. Guzman filed for disability insurance benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act on July 11, 2002, alleging disability due to back pain, knee pain, and diabetes. At the time of his hearing, Guzman was 47-years old. Although he only attended school through the third grade, he is English literate and is able to speak conversational English. Guzman worked as a forklift operator for 24 years at a rubber plan in Odessa, Texas until the plant closed in May 2002. Because he worked successfully at the same job for over 24 years, the ALJ described him as an \u201cideal employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-18\">A hearing was held on April 15, 2003 in front of an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). After Guzman testified to the above facts, the ALJ remarked that the case looked more like an unemployment case than a disability case. The ALJ then requested that Guzman undergo a consultative evaluation, which he did. Dr. Pandya found that Guzman\u2019s knee and back pain forced him to retire. In addition, Dr. Pandya found that Guzman was unable to lift weight or stay in one position. Dr. Pandya\u2019s handwritten notes indicate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Guzman \u201ccan sit in one place for upto 2 hours.\u201d On the assessment form, Dr. Pandya checked a box indicating that Guzman can sit \u201cless than 6 hours in an 8 hour workday.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Subsequently, the ALJ sent a letter and Dr. Pandya\u2019s assessment to Guzman and his nonlawyer representative. The letter stated that Guzman could submit additional statements, records, law, or written questions, as well as request a supplemental hearing. The letter indicated that if the ALJ did not receive a response within ten days of the date Guzman received notice, the ALJ would assume that Guzman did not wish to submit additional materials or request a supplemental hearing. Guzman did not submit a response to the ALJ\u2019s letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">On August 20, 2003, the ALJ found that Guzman was not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act. The ALJ concluded that Guzman was not entitled to disability insurance benefits. Guzman\u2019s timely appeal to the Appeals Council was denied, and he subsequently petitioned for judicial review. The magistrate judge held that the ALJ followed the proper legal standards and used legally sufficient evidence in the record to support his finding that Guzman retained the ability to perform a full range of sedentary work. Guzman timely appealed to this Court. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">\n<em>II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b608-14\">Our review of the Commissioner\u2019s denial of disability benefits is limited to determining whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the decision and whether proper legal standard were used in evaluating the evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance, and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support the conclusion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We do not reweigh the evidence; rather, we only scrutinize the entire record to determine whether it contains substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A finding of no substantial evidence is appropriate only if no credible evidentiary choices or medical findings exist to support the decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Conflicts in the evidence are for the Commission, and not this Court, to resolve.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-15\">An individual is disabled if he is \u201cunable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At step five of the evaluation process, the Commissioner\u2019s burden may be satisfied by the use of the Medical-Vocational Guidelines if there are no nonexertional limitations that significantly affect the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The term \u201cresidual functional capacity\u201d is defined as the claimant\u2019s maximum remaining ability to do sustained work activity in an ordinary work setting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>\u201con a regular and continuing basis.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Guzman contends that the record does not contain substantial evidence that he can do a full range of sedentary work. Although we note some inconsistencies in the record, we conclude that the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. Although sedentary work \u201cinvolves sitting, a certain amount of walking and standing is often necessary in carrying out job duties. Jobs are sedentary if walking and standing are required occasionally and other sedentary criteria are met.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Social Security Administration further elaborated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">In order to perform a full range of sedentary work, an individual must be able to remain in a seated position for approximately 6 hours of an 8-hour workday, with a morning break, a lunch period, and an afternoon break at approximately 2-hour intervals. If an individual is unable to sit for a total of 6 hours in an 8-hour work day, the unskilled sedentary occupational base will be eroded.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Here, there is evidence in the record that Guzman could sit for two hours at a time and for a total of six hours in a work day. First, Dr. Naidu, Guzman\u2019s treating physician, indicated that Guzman could sit for two-to-three hours before his legs went numb. Second, Dr. Pandya\u2019s notes from the consultative examination ordered by the ALJ indicate that Guzman can sit for up to two hours at a time. Third, although Guzman complained of greater pain, Dr. Pandya indicated that Guzman \u201cdoes not appear to be in ... as much [pain] as he alleges.\u201d Finally, Dr. Pandya checked a box indicating that Guzman can sit for less than six hours in an eight-hour day. Although this somewhat contradicts the handwritten notes on Dr. Pandya\u2019s assessment form, it is for the ALJ, not this Court, to resolve such inconsistencies.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Based on the substantial evidence supporting a finding that Guzman could perform a full range of sedentary work, the ALJ resolved the inconsistency in favor of the Commissioner, and neither the record nor the law requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">\n<em>Ill</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b609-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the Commissioner\u2019s final decision denying Guzman\u2019s claim for benefits under the Social Security Act is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b607-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
