He was sentenced to 120 months imprisonment. Bobbitt appeals, challenging the district court\u2019s ruling refusing to allow Bobbitt and his wife to testify about a statement made to them by Allen Willis concerning the firearm. We affirm the district court\u2019s ruling and therefore affirm Bobbitt\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Prior to his arrest, Bobbitt was seen wearing a certain jacket. When arrested, Bobbitt had just exited a vehicle and was not wearing a jacket. However, a jacket matching the description of the one he wore earlier was on the seat Bobbitt vacated when he exited the vehicle. A firearm was found in a pocket of that jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">During his trial on the charge of unlawful possession of the firearm, Bobbitt sought to introduce a statement made to him and his wife by Allen Willis, Bobbitt\u2019s close friend. Bobbitt and his wife sought to testify that Willis said that the police found his gun in his jacket, presumably claiming ownership of the firearm with which Bobbitt was charged. The district court determined that this was inadmissible hearsay and disallowed the testimony. We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, the joint appendix, and the district court\u2019s order. We conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit the proffered evidence. <em>See United States v. Lowe, </em>65 F.3d 1137, 1145 (4th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Bumpass, </em>60 F.3d 1099, 1102 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Accordingly, we affirm Bobbitt\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
