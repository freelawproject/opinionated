Sanchez argues two issues on appeal, namely, that (1) the district court clearly erred in denying Sanchez a minimal or minor role reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b); and (2) the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence of 135 months was unreasonable because the district court only considered one of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, entitling Sanchez to re-sentencing under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-17\">Sanchez first argues that the district court erred in denying him a minor role adjustment because it improperly ruled that the large amount of cocaine involved in the offense precluded a minor role adjustment. Sanchez contends he should have been granted a minor role adjustment because he was only a crew member, he had no ownership interest in the cocaine, he was paid little compared to the cocaine\u2019s value, and there were more people involved in this offense than those caught on the boat.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>We have held that a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a finding of fact to be reviewed only for clear error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 934 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en bane). </em>The Guidelines allow a court to decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by four points if the court finds the defendant was a minimal participant or by two points if the court finds the defendant was a minor participant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a) and (b). A defendant is a minimal participant if he is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n. 4). A defendant is a minor participant if he \u201cis less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n. 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">The party seeking the downward adjustment bears the burden of establishing the defendant\u2019s role was minor by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939. In determining whether a mitigating role reduction is warranted, a district court examines: (1) the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which he was held accountable, and (2) the defendant\u2019s role in comparison to the other participants. <em>Id. </em>at 940. When the relevant conduct attributed to a defendant is identical to his actual conduct, he cannot prove that he is entitled to a minor-role adjustment simply by pointing to some broader criminal scheme for which he was not held accountable. <em>Id. </em>at 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s denial of a minor role adjustment is supported by the record under the applicable two-pronged analysis established in <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d 930. Accordingly, the district court did not err in determining that Sanchez did not qualify for a minor role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">Sanchez also argues that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court did not adequately consider, elaborate on, or discuss all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as required by the holding in <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621. According to Sanchez, the district court only considered one factor, sentence disparity, and did not consider other \u00a7 3553 factors in determining Sanchez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-12\">Under <em>Booker, </em>we review a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence for \u201cunreasonableness.\u201d 543 U.S. at-, 125 S.Ct. at 765. Specifically, the United States Supreme Court has directed sentencing courts to consider the following factors in imposing sentences under the advisory Guidelines\u2019s scheme:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abl\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed \u2014 (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established ... [from the Guidelines]; and (5) any pertinent policy statement ...; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>duct; and (7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 765-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">We clarified that we first evaluate, using <em>pre-Booker </em>precedent, whether the district court correctly interpreted and applied the Guidelines to determine the appropriate advisory Guideline range. <em>Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1178-79. As we noted, \u201cthe district court remains obliged to \u2018consult\u2019 and \u2018take into account\u2019 the Guidelines in sentencing [the defendant],\u201d and the \u201creasonableness\u201d standard applies to the ultimate sentence imposed. <em>Id. </em>We have held that, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324 (11th Cir.2005). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors serve as guides for the district and appellate courts in determining whether a sentence is reasonable. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). However, we have declined to hold sentences within the Guideline range <em>per se </em>reasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">We conclude that Sanchez\u2019s 135-month sentence is reasonable. As noted above, Sanchez\u2019s sentence was within the Guidelines range, one of the explicit \u00a7 3553(a) factors. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2553(a)(4). Further, the record shows the district court consulted the Guidelines and made an accurate computation of the Guidelines range. The district court also considered the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors and nothing in the record convinces us that the sentence was unreasonable in light of these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">Because we conclude that Sanchez\u2019s ultimate sentence was reasonable, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b938-6\">. This standard of review survives <em>Booker. See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005) (\"We agree with the Fifth Circuit that <em>Booker </em>does not alter our review of the application of the Guidelines.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
