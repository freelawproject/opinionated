Brown, a Florida prisoner, appeals the dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim. Because Brown\u2019s complaint states a claim for a violation of the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-27\">\u201cA complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that Plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Omar ex rel. Cannon v. Lindsey, </em>334 F.3d 1246, 1247 (11th Cir.2003). Brown\u2019s complaint alleges that several officers on the staff of the Okeechobee Correctional Institution, where Brown was incarcerated, used excessive force against him with malicious and sadistic intent to harm him. Brown alleges that the officers repeatedly stunned Brown with a stun gun to prod him to obey orders, although the officers knew that Brown was unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>comply with their orders. Because \u201cunder the Eighth Amendment, force is deemed legitimate in a custodial setting [only] as long as it is applied in a good faith effort to maintain or restore discipline [and not] maliciously and sadistically to cause harm[,]\u201d <em>Skrtich v. Thornton, </em>280 F.3d 1295, 1300 (11th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), Brown\u2019s allegations of malicious use of excessive force against him are sufficient to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The dismissal of Brown\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim is</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
