We review the Board\u2019s denial of a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>to reopen for abuse of discretion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2005); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Yanez-Popp v. INS, </em>998 F.2d 231, 234 (4th Cir.1993). A denial of a motion to reopen must be reviewed with extreme deference, since immigration statutes do not contemplate reopening and the applicable regulations disfavor motions to reopen. <em>M.A. v. INS, </em>899 F.2d 304, 308 (4th Cir.1990) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">We note the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen as untimely or barred by the numerical limitation. In addition, we find the Board did not abuse its discretion in finding Woldetsadik did not support her claim of changed circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
