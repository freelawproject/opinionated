The Board\u2019s order was entered on May 20, 2005. Monroy Clavijo\u2019s petition for review was filed with this court on June 22, 2005, thirty-two days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-23\">Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (2000), Monroy Clavijo had thirty days from the date of the Board\u2019s final order, or until June 20, 2005, to file a timely petition for review. This time period is \u201cjurisdictional in nature and must be construed with strict fidelity to [its] terms.\u201d <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). It is \u201cnot subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As Monroy Clavijo\u2019s petition for review was not timely filed, we lack jurisdiction to review his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-24\">Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
