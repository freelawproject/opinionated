In 1999, Smith was charged by information with one count each of robbery with a deadly weapon, armed burglary of a dwelling, and attempted felony murder. In March 2000, a jury acquitted Smith of robbery, found him guilty of armed burglary, and could not reach a verdict on the attempted felony murder count. Following a re-trial on the attempted felony murder charge, a jury convicted Smith of the lesser included offense of second degree attempted felony murder. The state court sentenced Smith to 30 years\u2019 imprisonment for the armed burglary conviction and 15 years\u2019 imprisonment for the attempted felony murder conviction, to run consecutively, and the state appellate court affirmed both convictions without a written opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">In each of the two trials, the prosecutor, in his closing arguments, referred to the state\u2019s case as \u201cunrebutted,\u201d and Smith\u2019s counsel failed to lodge an objection. In his state post-conviction proceedings, Smith argued, in relevant part, ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to these failures to object. The state court denied this claim, finding the claim procedurally barred from collateral attack under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-13\">In the present \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, Smith again contended that his counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments in the two trials that the state\u2019s evidence was unrebutted. Smith argued that such comments were improper because (1) they drew attention to his decision not to testify and thereby violated his right to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment, and, (2) under Florida case law, it was improper for the prosecution to refer to defense\u2019s failure to call witnesses or to present testimony to rebut the state\u2019s case. Smith asserted that these comments encouraged the jury to infer his guilt through his silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-14\">The district court denied the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, finding that the claim was procedurally defaulted from federal review. The court reasoned that, because the state court expressly imposed a procedural bar on this claim, the court was barred from considering the claim absent certain unmet conditions. We granted a certificate of appealability as to the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-15\">Whether the district court improperly denied Smith\u2019s claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to, and thus preserve a challenge to, the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks that the state\u2019s case was \u201cunrebutted,\u201d that there was no testimonial evidence to support the defense, and regarding Smith\u2019s silence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-16\">On appeal, Smith argues that the district court improperly denied Smith\u2019s claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>to object to, and thus preserve a challenge to, the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks that the state\u2019s case was \u201cunrebutted.\u201d Smith contends that the district court\u2019s finding that the claim was procedurally barred was erroneous, in that (1) the state of Florida waived the procedural default by failing to raise it in district court, (2) the claim was not independent of federal law, and (3) the state court addressing this claim did not clearly state that the claim was procedurally barred. Smith also argues that (1) his counsel was ineffective in that counsel failed to object to improper statements made by the prosecutor indicating his personal belief that Smith was guilty of the offenses, and, (2) in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), his sentence was improperly enhanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">We conclude that Smith\u2019s claim of ineffective counsel is not procedurally barred but that his conviction should remain undisturbed because of the absence of harmful error.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">I. Are Smith\u2019s Claims Procedurally Barred?</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>See Sims v. Singletary, </em>155 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.1998). Factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Under the doctrine of procedural default, \u201c[i]n all cases in which a state prisoner has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law, or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 750, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 2565, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991) (internal quotations omitted). We have set forth a three-part test to determine whether a state court\u2019s procedural ruling constitutes an independent and adequate state rule of decision:</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">First, the last state court rendering a judgment in the case must clearly and expressly state that it is relying on state procedural rules to resolve the federal claim without reaching the merits of that claim. Second, the state court\u2019s decision must rest solidly on state law grounds and may not be intertwined with an interpretation of federal law. Third, the state procedural rule must be adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\"><em>Judd v. Haley, </em>250 F.3d 1308, 1313 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotations and citations omitted). The adequacy requirement has been interpreted to mean that the rule must be \u201cfirmly established and regularly followed,\u201d that is, not applied in an arbitrary or unprecedented fashion. <em>Ford v. Georgia, </em>498 U.S. 411, 423-25, 111 S.Ct. 850, 857-58, 112 L.Ed.2d 935 (1991); <em>Judd, </em>250 F.3d at 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">The Florida Supreme Court has held that claims that could have been raised on direct appeal are procedurally barred from collateral review, and couching such claims in terms of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to preserve or raise them cannot be used to circumvent that rule. <em>Cherry v. State, </em>659 So.2d 1069, 1072 (Fla.1995). However, a Florida appellate court has held that the rule stated in <em>Cherry </em>does not apply to certain ineffective-assistance claims, such as counsel\u2019s \u201csilence in the face of an objectionable comment by the prosecutor,\u201d that could not have been raised on direct appeal. <em>Knight v. State, </em>710 So.2d 648, 649 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1998). Additionally, the Florida Supreme Court has held that the rule in <em>Cherry </em>does not apply where the underlying claims were raised and rejected on direct appeal because they had not been preserved for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>review. <em>Pietri v. State, </em>885 So.2d 245, 256 (Fla.2004). In both <em>Knight </em>and <em>Pietri, </em>however, the lower court\u2019s judgment was nevertheless affirmed because the defendants failed to demonstrate prejudice. <em>Knight, </em>710 So.2d at 649; <em>Pietri, </em>885 So.2d at 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Here, the last state court to render judgment applying the state procedural default in Cherry was the court that decided Smith\u2019s post-conviction motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, if the default described in Cherry is \u201cfirmly established and regularly followed,\u201d federal review is precluded. <em>See Ford, </em>498 U.S. at 423-25, 111 S.Ct. at 857-58. It appears here that the state court\u2019s application of a procedural bar to Smith\u2019s claims, that counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments on the unrebutted nature of the state\u2019s evidence, was incorrect under the clarifications in subsequent Florida law. <em>Cherry </em>does not apply to ineffective assistance of counsel claims respecting underlying claims that were rejected because they had not been preserved for review. <em>See Pietri, </em>885 So.2d at 256. It is probable that Smith\u2019s claims respecting prosecutorial misconduct were rejected on direct appeal because they had not been preserved for review; Smith raised these claims on direct appeal acknowledging the absence of objection at trial but arguing fundamental error. The state had explicitly argued the absence of objection and the appellate court affirmed without opinion. Moreover, a Florida appellate court has held that <em>Cherry </em>does not apply to ineffective-assistance claims that could not have been raised on appeal, such as the one presented here, i.e. counsel\u2019s \u201csilence in the face of an objectionable comment by the prosecutor.\u201d <em>See Knight, </em>710 So.2d at 649. Because the state court\u2019s procedural default ruling did not rest on adequate state grounds, the district court\u2019s finding of procedural default with respect to this claim is also erroneous. <em>See Harris, </em>489 U.S. at 262, 109 S.Ct. at 1043. In other words, the district court should have reached and resolved the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">Because the procedural default issue is resolved on this basis in Smith\u2019s favor, we need not address Smith\u2019s arguments that the state waived the default argument, the claim was not independent of federal law, and the state court did not clearly state the claim was procedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">II. Did Smith Suffer Prejudice at Trial as a Result of Ineffective Counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">Smith has failed to establish that his counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments on the unrebutted nature of the state\u2019s case prejudiced his defense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To make a showing of ineffective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment, a prisoner must show that the counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and must establish that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To prove prejudice, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Smith argues that the comments were unconstitutional in that they infringed on his right to remain silent and improperly referred to his failure to call witnesses or present witnesses to rebut the state\u2019s case. With respect to prejudice, Smith asserts only that these comments resulted in the State encouraging the jury to infer his guilt from his silence. This is insufficient in this case to show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s error, the result of the proceeding would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">At the two trials, three witnesses gave consistent eye-witness testimony as to Smith\u2019s involvement in the offenses of conviction. The witnesses generally testified to the following: (1) Smith asked two people known to Smith for a ride in their car, for both himself and an unidentified individual; (2) the driver of the car consented; (8) once in the car, the unidentified individual pulled a gun on the driver, and Smith demanded money; (4) Smith asked the driver of the car to pull over; (5) after pulling over the car, the driver fled into a nearby house; (6) Smith and the unidentified individual chased the driver into the house; (7) a shot was fired (apparently by the unidentified individual) inside the house, and (8) a resident of the house, not the driver, was hit by a bullet and injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The entirety of Smith\u2019s case in the first trial consisted of the alibi testimony of Smith\u2019s sister, who testified that Smith was fishing with her during the time the offense was committed. In the second trial, the defense offered no witnesses or evidence. Had Smith\u2019s counsel objected to the offending comments and curative instructions resulted, the weight of the evidence against Smith makes it impossible to conclude that as a consequence Smith would have fared better in the two proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">Because Smith has failed to establish that his counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments on the unrebutted nature of the state\u2019s case prejudiced his defense, we affirm the denial of his \u00a7 2254 claim. As to Smith\u2019s appellate claims that (1) the prosecutor made improper statements indicating his personal belief that Smith was guilty of the offenses, and, (2) in light of <em>Booker, </em>his sentence was improperly enhanced, these claims exceed the scope of Smith\u2019s certificate of appealability and, therefore, we are precluded from reviewing them. <em>See McIntyre v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>Williams, </em>216 F.3d 1254, 1256 n. 2 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-6\">. It appears that Smith failed to fully exhaust his ineffective assistance of counsel claim in Florida state court, as the record on appeal does not include a request for certification for appeal to the Florida Supreme Court of the Florida appellate court decision affirming the denial of his post-conviction claims. However, Smith\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is without merit, as discussed below, and \u00a7 2254(b)(2) provides that an application for a writ of habeas corpus may be denied on the merits, notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to exhaust his state remedies. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b107-12\">. We may address the merits of Smith\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, notwithstanding the fact that the state court and the district court failed to reach the merits of this claim. First, \u00a7 2254(a) provides that this Court \"shall entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court only on the ground that he is in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2254(a). Smith\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is a claim that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. Next, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>prohibition contained in \u00a7 2254(d) against granting an application for a writ of habeas corpus with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court proceedings, except in certain specified circumstances, is not applicable here because the state court did not adjudicate this ineffective assistance of counsel claim on its merits \u2014 it imposed a state procedural bar. 28 U.S.C. 2254(d); <em>Wright v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>278 F.3d 1245, 1254-55 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that the state court is required to reject a claim on the merits for \u00a7 2254(d)(1) to apply and a decision that does <em>not </em>rest on procedural grounds alone is an adjudication on the merits). Last, we may affirm a decision of the district court \"on any adequate ground, even if it is other than the one on which the court actually relied.\u201d <em>Parks </em>v. <em>City of Warner Robins, </em>43 F.3d 609, 613 (11th Cir.1995) (holding such in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
