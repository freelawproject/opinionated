Elongo contends on appeal that his evidence was sufficient to support his applications for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-23\">To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for asylum, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Elongo fails to show that the evidence compels a result contrary to the immigration judge\u2019s ruling, as affirmed by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-24\">Nor can Elongo show that he was entitled to withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) (2000). \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, 378 </em>F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Additionally, we find that substantial evidence supports the finding that Elongo fails to meet the standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2005). We conclude that Elongo failed to make the requisite showing below.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Therefore, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
