Walker appeals his conviction and sentence for one count of robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a) (2000), and one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e) (2000). Walker\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in his opinion, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Although concluding that such allegations lack merit, counsel asserts that the district court erred in failing to inform Walker of his right to plead not guilty in compliance with the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. Walker filed a pro se supplemental brief alleging that his plea was not valid because he was mentally incompetent and his sentence was improperly enhanced based on a criminal history that was not alleged in the indictment or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Finding no reversible erroi', we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-16\">Because these claims are raised for the first time on appeal, they are subject to review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 541 (4th Cir.2005). As set forth in <em>United States v. Olano, </em>the plain error mandate is satisfied if: (1) there was error; (2) it was plain; and (3) it affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). If these conditions are met, we may then exercise our discretion to notice the error, but only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). We find no evidence that Walker\u2019s substantial rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-17\">First, Walker had knowledge of his right to plead not guilty from his earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>plea. He further affirmed that his attorney had explained all of his rights to him and expressed satisfaction with counsel\u2019s representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Next, we find no evidence that Walker was incompetent to plead guilty. He had received medical treatment and the hospital reported that he was competent. Further, Walker\u2019s counsel stipulated without reservation that Walker was competent to plead and even had him evaluated independently prior to the plea proceeding. Finally, the court discussed Walker\u2019s mental status with Walker at length and concluded without reservation that Walker was competent to plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Further, we note that to demonstrate that his substantial rights were affected, Walker must show that he would not have pled guilty had he received more information. <em>See United States v. Goins, </em>51 F.3d 400, 402 (4th Cir.1995). Walker fails to do so, particularly considering that he was facing a statutory minimum of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment and a maximum sentence of life in prison and through his plea agreement received the minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Finally, pursuant to <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), (finding that a defendant\u2019s sentence may still be enhanced based upon a prior conviction even if the prior conviction is not found by a jury or admitted by the defendant), we find no merit in Walker\u2019s claims that his sentence was improperly enhanced based on his criminal history. We therefore conclude that there is no evidence Walker would not have plead guilty but for the alleged errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Walker\u2019s conviction and sentence. We deny Walker\u2019s motion to have counsel relieved. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
