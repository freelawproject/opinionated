After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-13\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b189-14\">On May 15, 2004, the United States Coast Guard observed a Columbian fishing vessel, the <em>Estrella del Sur, </em>pull up along side a \u201cgo-fast\u201d boat near Costa Rica to supply it with fuel and food. Upon seeing the Coast Guard, both the go-fast boat and the <em>Estrella del Sur </em>fled. As the boats fled, the Coast Guard observed the \u201cgo-fast\u201d crew drop approximately 30 bales of cocaine into the ocean.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the Coast Guard apprehended the <em>Estrella del Sur, </em>the 8-man crew, including Defendant Arboleda, were arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-15\">At sentencing the district court concluded, over the defendant\u2019s objection, that the defendant was responsible for at least 150 kilograms of cocaine. With a criminal history category I and an adjusted offense level of 33, the applicable guidelines range was 135-168 months\u2019 imprisonment. After explicitly stating that the guidelines were advisory under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court sentenced Arboleda to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment, stating that \u201cthe sentence imposed is sufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-16\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b189-17\">After <em>Booker, </em>and even under an advisory guidelines scheme, district courts must still correctly calculate the guidelines range when determining a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that, after <em>Booker, </em>district courts must consult the Guidelines and \u201c[t]his consultation requirement, at a minimum, obliges the district court to calculate <em>correctly </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>sentencing range prescribed by the Guidelines\u201d). Defendant Arboleda\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s factual finding that he was responsible for at least 150 kilograms of cocaine is without merit. The Coast Guard observed the crew of the go-fast boat dumping approximately 30 bales of cocaine into the ocean. The Coast Guard recovered one of these bales and determined that it contained 20 kilograms of cocaine. As the district court determined, the government was likely \u201cconservative in their estimate of how much cocaine was involved here.\u201d Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s calculation of Defendant\u2019s guidelines range as 135-168 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The defendant also argues that the district court erred by treating the guidelines range as mandatory even after <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>However, as noted above, the district court explicitly stated that the guidelines were advisory under <em>Booker. </em>Furthermore, in sentencing Arboleda to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment, the district court stated that \u201cthe sentence imposed is sufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing.\u201d Given the record in this case, we cannot conclude that the district court applied the guidelines in a mandatory fashion. Consequently, we affirm Arboleda\u2019s 135-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-11\">. The Coast Guard recovered one of the bales of cocaine and determined that it contained approximately 20 kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b190-5\">. During the sentencing hearing, the district court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">there remains great confusion about all of this <em>[Booker </em>changes to the Sentencing Guidelines]. I am waiting for the people who have the power to finally make up their minds what are we doing. I was around in 1984 when all of this started with the minimum mandatories and then the guidelines in '86. I just work here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">I am just trying to follow whatever it is people at higher pay grades are telling me to do. And I don\u2019t think we need to add to the confusion. I say that respectfully to all my brothers and sisters that are going off in other different directions here. But we are going to have enough cases coming back now, and we do need to have stability and predictability, so that lawyers can advise their clients.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-21\">We don\u2019t need guessmanship. So I understand your argument. Please understand what I am trying to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-22\">It would have been improper for a district court to adopt a <em>post-Booker </em>rule that, in order to establish predictability and stability, sentences would still be within the guidelines range in its particular courtroom. Although the district court\u2019s statements arguably provide some support for defendant\u2019s contentions, we do not read the district court\u2019s statements in this case as creating any such <em>per se </em>rule. Rather, the district court expressly acknowledged that the guidelines were advisory and that \"the sentence imposed is sufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
