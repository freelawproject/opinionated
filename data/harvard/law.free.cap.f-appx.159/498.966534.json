Trivette appeals the 120-month concurrent sentences imposed after he pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine (Count 1), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (2000), and to being a felon in possession of a firearm (Count 3), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Trivette\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising two issues but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Trivette was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-18\">Counsel questions the reasonableness of Trivette\u2019s sentence in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Although the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court \u201cmust consult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court). The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2005), and then impose a sentence. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005) (applying <em>Booker </em>on plain error review). The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-19\">In sentencing Trivette to a 120-month sentence, a sentence one month below the properly calculated Sentencing Guidelines range of 121 to 151 months of imprisonment, the district court considered that range and all of the factors in \u00a7 3553(a), taking into account the ten-year mandatory minimum statutory sentence on Count 1, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (West 1999 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2005), and the ten-year statutory maximum sentence on Count 3, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2) (2000). Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>district court adequately explained its reason for sentencing Trivette below the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range. We therefore find that the sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Counsel also questions whether the Government engaged in prosecutorial misconduct when it failed to file a motion for a downward departure under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1, p.s. (2004), based upon Trivette\u2019s substantial assistance. The Government did not promise to make such a motion, and there is no evidence that it refused to make the motion based upon an improper motive. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). We therefore find nothing improper regarding the Government\u2019s failure to make the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm Trivette\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and Trivette\u2019s motion to substitute counsel and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b527-13\"> Trivette also pled guilty to using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005), and re ceived a sixty-month consecutive sentence. He does not challenge this portion of his sentence in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
