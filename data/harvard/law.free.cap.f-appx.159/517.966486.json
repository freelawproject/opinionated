We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in upholding the denial of Rafiq\u2019s motion on the ground that it was untimely filed. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1) (2005) (establishing a ninety-day time limitation for filing a motion to reopen); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992) (setting forth standard of review).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-23\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b545-18\"> We find that Rafiq has failed to demonstrate sufficient grounds to invoke the doctrine of equitable tolling. <em>See Harris v.
