Higdon, </em>122 Fed.Appx. 985 (11th Cir.2004). Later, we denied rehearing en banc. <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>418 F.Sd 1136 (11th Cir.2005). The Supreme Court has vacated our prior judgment and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of <em>Booker v. United States, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Having reconsidered our decision pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s instructions, we reinstate our judgment affirming conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">In our opinion accompanying our denial of rehearing en banc, we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-11\">At no time in the district court or in his initial brief on appeal did Higdon challenge the constitutionality of any extra-verdict sentencing enhancement or assert that the district court lacked the authority to impose the enhancements under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard. Instead, approximately three months after briefing was completed in the case, Higdon filed a motion to file a supplemental brief raising a <em>Blakely </em>issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Af\">418 F.3d at 1137. Following the well-established rule in this circuit, <em>see United States v. Levy, </em>379 F.3d 1241, 1242 (11th Cir.2004), <em>reh\u2019g en banc denied, </em>391 F.3d 1327 (11th Cir.2004), issues that are not timely raised in the briefs are deemed abandoned. In <em>United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989, 990 (11th Cir.2001), we applied this rule to a case remanded from the Supreme Court in light of <em>Apprendi. </em>Recently, we applied <em>Ardley </em>to a <em>post-Booker </em>remand and found that the defendant had abandoned his <em>Booker </em>claim because he failed to raise it at the district court or in his initial brief. <em>United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-14\">Our opinion affirming the conviction and sentence in this case is accordingly REINSTATED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-12\">. The motion to withdraw as appointed counsel for appellant, filed by attorney Michael J. Peterson, is granted. Attorney Maryanne Melko Prince is hereby appointed to represent appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
