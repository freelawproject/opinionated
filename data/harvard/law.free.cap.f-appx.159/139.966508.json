On appeal, Cruz argues that the district court\u2019s imposition of a 168-month prison sentence was unreasonable, in light of sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and in light of the holding in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). According to Cruz, <em>post-Booker, </em>federal district courts must consider the factors provided in \u00a7 3553(a), starting with the minimum sentence permissible, and only adding to the sentence so as to comply with the punitive, protective, and rehabilitative purposes of \u00a7 3553(a). Cruz suggests that reasonable people would agree that 140 months is enough incarceration to reflect the seriousness of the crime while also providing Cruz with some education and training.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Under <em>Booker, </em>we review a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence for \u201cunreasonableness.\u201d 543 U.S. at-, 125 S.Ct. at 765. Specifically, the United States Supreme Court has directed sentencing courts to consider the following factors in imposing sentences under the advisory Guidelines\u2019s scheme:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHC\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed \u2014 (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established ... [from the Guidelines]; and (5) any pertinent policy statement ... issued by the Sentencing Commission....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 765-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">We have held that, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324 (11th Cir.2005). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors serve as guides for the district and appellate courts in determining whether a sentence is reasonable. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). However, we have declined to hold sentences within the Guidelines\u2019s range <em>per se </em>reasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">In this case, the record reflects that the district court consulted the Guidelines and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Because we conclude that Cruz\u2019s ultimate sentence was reasonable in light of <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621, and \u00a7 3553, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
