Court appointed counsel, Charles E. Lykes, Jr., has moved to withdraw from further representation of the appellant and has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Poteet was given notice of counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and the <em>Anders </em>brief, but has not filed a response. The motion to withdraw is granted, and Poteet\u2019s conviction and sentence are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-14\">In his written guilty plea to a one count indictment, Poteet waived the right to appeal his sentence \u201cdirectly or collaterally, on the ground that the sentencing guidelines are in any respect unconstitutional, on the grounds that any fact found by the Court for sentencing was not alleged in the indictment, was not admitted by the defendant, was not found by a jury, was not found beyond a reasonable doubt, or was found based upon evidence not admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, and on any other ground, including the applicability of the \u2018safety valve\u2019 provisions contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, except in the following situations: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>(a) an upward departure by the sentencing judge; (b) a sentence above the statutory m\u00e1ximum; or (c) a sentence in violation of other law apart from the sentencing guidelines.\u201d The plea agreement contained a factual basis that stated that Poteet was going to sell a half-kilogram of cocaine to a confidential informant for $13,600.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">At the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure Rule 11 guilty plea hearing before a magistrate judge, Poteet stated that he was satisfied with his representation. The record supports the district court\u2019s finding that the plea was knowing and voluntary. Poteet objected to (1) his criminal history category, arguing that it significantly overrepresented the seriousness of his past criminal conduct and requested a downward departure to a criminal history category of I, and (2) the failure to include a downward departure due to his family responsibilities pursuant to \u00a7 5H1.6. The district court recognized it had the authority to depart downward for over-representation of criminal history, but found, however, that Poteet\u2019s criminal history was not over-represented such as to require a criminal history of I. As to Poteet\u2019s argument for a downward departure based on family responsibilities and \u00a7 5H1.6, the district court found that Poteet created the danger to his family by engaging in drug dealing activities, \u00a7 5H1.6 did not apply, and, even if it did apply, it would not allow Poteet to be sentenced below the statutory minimum, and the court therefore denied the downward departure. The district court sentenced Poteet to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment and four years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The <em>Anders </em>brief properly indicates there are no arguable issues. Any argument that Poteet\u2019s sentence violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is foreclosed by the appeal waiver provision of Poteet\u2019s plea agreement. This issue has no arguable merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">This Court has held that broad sentence-appeal waiver provision language, such as the provision appearing in Poteet\u2019s plea agreement, is enforceable so long as the defendant enters into the agreement knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. <em>See United States v. Grinard-Henry, </em>399 F.3d 1294, 1296 (11th Cir.2005). Broad waiver language also \u201ccovers\u201d <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Booker </em>grounds. <em>United States v. Frye, </em>402 F.3d 1123, 1129 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Grinard-Henry, </em>399 F.3d 1294, 1296(11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Rubbo, </em>396 F.3d 1330, 1335 (11th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Poteet pled guilty to violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), which carries a statutory minimum sentence of five years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). Neither of the exceptions to the statutory minimum apply in this case: (1) the government did not file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, as Poteet had stopped cooperating with the government; and (2) Poteet cannot meet the requirements of the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision, as he has more than one criminal history point. Therefore, the district court had no discretion to depart below the statutory minimum of five years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Simpson, </em>228 F.3d 1294, 1303(11th Cir.2000)(noting that district court has \u201cno discretion to depart downward from the relevant statutory mandatory minimum sentences\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">An independent review of the entire record shows that the magistrate judge covered all the required disclosures in Rule 11 and addressed each of the \u201ccore concerns\u201d before accepting Poteet\u2019s plea by determining that he was not coerced into pleading guilty, by explaining the charges, and by explaining the rights he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>relinquished by pleading guilty. <em>United States v. Monroe, </em>353 F.3d 1346, 1354 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201cThis Court has upheld plea colloquies that fail to address an item expressly required by Rule 11 so long as the overall plea colloquy adequately addresses these three core concerns.\u201d); <em>United States v. Bell, </em>776 F.2d 965, 968 (11th Cir.1985) (addressing the three \u201ccore concerns\u201d of a guilty plea: (1) the guilty plea is voluntary; (2) the defendant understands the nature of the charges; and (3) the defendant understands the consequences of his plea.). Independent review reveals no jurisdictional errors that might have occurred prior to the entry of the plea. <em>See United States v. Yunis, </em>723 F.2d 795, 796 (11th Cir.1984) (noting that the entry of a guilty plea waives objection to all non-jurisdietional errors).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Since there is no arguably meritorious basis for challenging Poteet\u2019s conviction or sentence, counsel\u2019s MOTION TO WITHDRAW IS GRANTED and Poteet\u2019s CONVICTION AND SENTENCE ARE AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
