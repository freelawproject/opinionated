He appeals the district court\u2019s summary judgment dismissing his race discrimination lawsuit. We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-14\">Michael Moore, an African-American male, was hired by Bendix/AUied Signal, an affiliate of defendant Honeywell International Incorporated, as a truck driver in 1990. In 1997, Honeywell terminated Moore\u2019s employment because he was late on a delivery. Moore does not allege any discriminatory reasons for the termination of his employment. Five years after his termination, Moore reapplied to be a truck driver for Honeywell. Honeywell made a conditional offer of employment to Moore subject to favorable results of a background investigation. However, upon conducting a background investigation, Honeywell found a discrepancy between Moore\u2019s employment history and what Moore stated in his employment application. Honeywell rescinded its offer to Moore, purportedly as a result of the discrepancy in Moore\u2019s application. After his offer of employment was rescinded, Moore again applied to Honeywell. Honeywell rejected his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-15\">Moore sued Honeywell, alleging that Honeywell discriminated against him by failing to rehire him on the basis of his race, in violation of Title VII. Honeywell moved for summary judgment. The district court granted Honeywell\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed Moore\u2019s claims with prejudice. Moore appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-16\">We review the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Summary judgment is proper when the record, viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, demonstrates no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A4O\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits an employer from \u201cdiscriminating against any individual ... because of such individual\u2019s race.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the district court, Moore attempted to prove that Honeywell intentionally discriminated against him because of his race by utilizing the familiar burden-shifting framework of <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under this framework, Moore was first required to establish a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that (1) he is a member of a protected class, (2) he sought and was qualified for an available employment position, (3) he was rejected for that position, and (4) the employer continued to seek applicants with his qualifications.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court held that Moore met this initial burden, but concluded that Moore provided no evidence to support his position that race was a determinative factor in Honeywell\u2019s decision to deny him employment. We agree that Moore has produced no evidence that his race was even a motivating factor in Honeywell\u2019s decision not to rehire him. Therefore, we do not address Honeywell\u2019s argument that Moore failed to present a prima facie case of discrimination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">A plaintiffs prima facie case \u201ccreates a rebuttable presumption that the employer unlawfully discriminated against the plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The burden of production then shifts to the defendant to proffer a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its employment decision.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Here, Honeywell set forth an adequate, non-discriminatory reason for its decision not to rehire Moore; specifically, that Moore overstated his pri- or experience in his employment application. To survive the motion for summary judgment, Moore was therefore required to produce evidence creating at least a genuine issue of material fact that Honeywell\u2019s stated reason was merely a pretext for discrimination.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-14\">Moore has offered no evidence that Honeywell\u2019s reason for not rehiring him was mere pretext and its true reason for its decision was Moore\u2019s race. There is also no evidence that Moore\u2019s race was even a \u201cmotivating factor\u201d in Honeywell\u2019s decision not to rehire Moore.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Additionally, contrary to Moore\u2019s arguments, the evidence is insufficient to find that Honeywell\u2019s asserted justification is false.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moore stated on his employment applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>tion that he had worked for a previous employer seventeen months longer than he in fact worked for that employer, and signed a statement attesting to the truthfulness of the information he provided on his application. Moore admitted in his deposition that he provided inaccurate information on his employment application. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to find that Honeywell\u2019s asserted justification is false. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b595-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
