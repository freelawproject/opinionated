Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning and briefly articulated its reasons for doing so. Thus, we should review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u201cAn asylum application must be \u2018filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 956 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B)). An untimely application \u201cmay be considered ... if the alien demonstrates ... extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(D); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). The determination of whether an alien can apply for asylum, however, is left exclusively to the Attorney General as \u201c[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General under paragraph (2).\u201d INA \u00a7 208(a)(3); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>see also Mendoza v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (noting that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) \u201cdivests our Court of jurisdiction to review a decision regarding whether an alien complied with the one-year time limit or established extraordinary circumstances that would excuse his untimely filing\u201d); <em>accord Chacon-Botero, </em>427 F.3d at 957.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Accordingly, we conclude from the record that we lack jurisdiction and dismiss the petition for review to the extent that it seeks review of the denial of the Ingkiriwang\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">II. <em>Eligibility for Withholding of Removal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Ingkiriwang argues that he provided credible testimony to support his withholding of removal and CAT relief claims because the IJ allegedly questioned him in a biased manner, used overly restrictive criteria to measure his credibility, and did not consider Ingkiriwang\u2019s answers that would have supported finding him credible, such as his ability to define \u201cbaptism,\u201d \u201ccommunion,\u201d and \u201cEaster.\u201d He also argues that the IJ improperly considered his father\u2019s return to Indonesia as safe because his father did not return to Indonesia voluntarily, but was instead deported.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">To the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, we review the decision <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). We review the BIA\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence test, and \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84 (quotation omitted). \u201c[W]e cannot engage in fact-finding on appeal, nor may we weigh evidence that was not previously considered below.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1278. Therefore, we will reverse a finding of fact \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal....\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir. 2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (\u201c[T]he administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary ... \u201d). We also review a credibility determination under the substantial evidence test, and \u201cmay not substitute [our own] judgment for that of the BIA with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">An alien is entitled to withholding of removal under the INA if he can show that his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287; <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). \u201cAn alien bears the burden of demonstrating that he more-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tortured upon his return to the country in question.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. Although the INA does not expressly define \u201cpersecution,\u201d we have stated that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations omitted). In order to establish the necessary causal connection between the protected ground and the feared persecution, the alien must present \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be singled out for persecution on account of such [protected group status].\u201d <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The alien can meet his burden by showing either (1) past persecution in his country based on a protected ground, in which case a rebuttable presumption is created that his life or freedom would be threatened if he returned to his country; or (2) a future threat to his life or freedom on a protected ground in his country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1). To establish a future threat to life or freedom, the alien need not show that he would be singled out individually for persecution; rather, he may sustain the burden of proof by showing a pattern or practice of persecution of a group similarly situated to the applicant in which he is included or with which he may be identified. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">If credible,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the alien\u2019s testimony \u201cmay be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)). Indications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishment as the applicant repeatedly recounts his story. <em>See In re B-, </em>21 I &amp; N Dec. 66, 70, 1995 WL 326740 (BIA 1995); <em>see also Dailide v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>387 F.3d 1335, 1343 (11th Cir.2004) (affirming the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination, which was based upon its finding that the alien\u2019s testimony conflicted with his answers to interrogatories, affidavit, deposition, and other documentary evidence). \u201c[A]n adverse credibility determination does not alleviate the [BIA\u2019s] duty to consider other evidence produced by an asylum applicant.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). If the alien produces evidence beyond his own testimony, \u201cit is not sufficient for the [BIA] to rely solely on an adverse credibility determination in those instances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s findings that Ingkiriwang had failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal because he did not prove past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. There is no substantial evidence to compel reversing the IJ\u2019s credibility finding where Ingkiriwang was ignorant of certain religious terms and stated, \u201cI\u2019m not too big on Christianity but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>I just come to church to be thankful to God and to receive the teaching about (indiscernible),\u201d he presented a baptismal certificate that listed his date of birth incorrectly and lacked a specific date of issuance, and, even though his family lived unharmed as practicing Christians in Indonesia, he was unable to corroborate his testimony with medical records. <em>See Adefemi, 3</em>86 F.3d at 1027; <em>Dailide, </em>387 F.3d at 1343.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Additionally, even if Ingkiriwang had been found credible, he failed to prove that the acts of which he complained rose to the level of past persecution, or an \u201cextreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotations omitted). Likewise, his testimony that his family lived unharmed in Indonesia for several years undermines any claim that there is a pattern or practice of persecuting similarly situated individuals in Indonesia. <em>Cf. </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2). Thus, Ingkiriwang\u2019s claim for withholding of removal must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">III. <em>Eligibility for CAT Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">As previously stated, we review the BIA\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo, </em>and its factual determinations for substantial evidence. <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 at 817; <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84. We will reverse a finding of fact \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal....\u201d <em>Adefemi, </em>386 F.3d at 1027; <em>see also 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). We also review a credibility determination under the substantial evidence test. <em>D-Muhmned, </em>388 F.3d at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">To qualify for withholding of removal under Article 3 of the CAT, the applicant must show that it is more likely than not that she will be tortured if returned to the country of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). Torture is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-10\">any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession, punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). CAT relief carries a higher legal standard than asylum, and is thus very difficult to meet. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303. \u201c[F]or an act to constitute \u2018torture\u2019 under CAT, it must be: (1) an act causing severe physical or mental pain or suffering; (2) intentionally inflicted; (3) for an illicit or proscribed purpose; (4) by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official who has custody or physical control of the victim; and (5) not arising from lawful sanctions.\u201d <em>Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1181 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">Ingkiriwang has not made any arguments to support his request for CAT relief. Instead, he has simply entitled a section of his appellate brief, \u201cAppellant\u2019s asylum eligibility under the Torture Convention.\u201d Therefore, he has failed to demonstrate that substantial evidence compels reversing the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s conclusion that he had failed to demonstrate that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured with the consent or acquiescence of the Indonesian government, in a manner not pursuant to lawful sanctions. <em>Adefemi, </em>386 F.3d at 1027; <em>Cadet, </em>377 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>1181.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, Ingkiriwang\u2019s claim for CAT relief must also fail. Based on the foregoing, we dismiss the petition in part and deny it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b198-5\">. The REAL ID Act of 2005 amended the law regarding credibility determinations by adding INA \u00a7\u00a7 208(b)(3)(B)(iii), 1229a(c)(4)(C). Section 101(a)(3) and (d), Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 321, 303, 304-305. The Act states, however, that these provisions \u201cshall apply to applications for asylum, withholding, or other relief from removal made on or after\u201d the date of enactment of the Act, May 11, 2005. Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. at 305. Therefore, because Ingkiriwang\u2019s application for asylum was filed before May 11, 2005, these provisions do not apply in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b200-25\">. Although Ingkiriwang argues in his appellate brief for stay of removal pending disposition of this appeal, alleging that he has met the \"clear and convincing evidence\u201d standard under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(f)(2), we previously denied Ingkiriwang's motion for stay of removal, noting that he had failed to meet 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(f)(2)\u2019s \u201cclear and convincing evidence\" standard, or the traditional test for injunctive relief. Ingkiriwang has not shown good reason why this issue should be reconsidered, and thus we do not consider his second request for stay of removal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
