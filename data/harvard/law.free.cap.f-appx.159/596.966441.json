Vega challenges the constitutionality of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>felony and aggravated felony provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), and the district court\u2019s order that he cooperate with the probation officer in the collection of DNA as a condition of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Although, in a written plea agreement, Vega waived the right to appeal his sentence except for upward departures and a sentence exceeding the statutory maximum, the waiver does not bar his appeal. To the extent that Vega\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b) is construed as a challenge to his conviction, it is not precluded by the terms of the appeal waiver. As to his DNA claims, Vega\u2019s waiver was rendered not knowing and voluntary when the magistrate judge advised him at his rearraignment hearing that he could appeal an illegal sentence. <em>See, e.g., United, States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517-18 (5th Cir.1999) (discussing requirements for validity of an appeal waiver).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Vega\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Vega contends that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Vega properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">With respect to Vega\u2019s contention that the district court erred in ordering, as a condition of supervised release, that he cooperate with the probation officer in the collection of DNA, his claim is not ripe for judicial review in light of our holding in <em>United States v. Carmichael, </em>343 F.3d 756, 758 (5th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1136, 124 S.Ct. 1116, 157 L.Ed.2d 943 (2004). We reject Vega\u2019s contention that <em>Carmichael </em>is distinguishable. <em>See United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1102 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we dismiss this portion of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b625-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
