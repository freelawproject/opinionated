Pointer argues that the warrantless search of the vehicle he was driving violated his Fourth Amendment rights because he was detained beyond the scope of the initial traffic stop and, additionally, his consent to search the vehicle was involuntary. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Cantu, </em>230 F.3d 148, 150 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Sgt. Greg Fountain\u2019s questioning of Pointer regarding facts unrelated to the initial traffic stop prior to initiation of the computer check of Pointer\u2019s license was not a per se Fourth Amendment violation. <em>See United States v. Brigham, </em>382 F.3d 500, 507-08 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc). Moreover, Fountain\u2019s discovery during the legitimate questioning of Pointer and his passenger, Pechoka Sanders, of specific facts that supported a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity rendered the length of the detention reasonable under the circumstances to resolve such suspicion. <em>See id. </em>at 511-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">With regard to Pointer\u2019s consent to the search of the vehicle, the district court\u2019s finding that Pointer\u2019s consent was voluntarily was not clearly erroneous in light of the record as a whole. <em>United States v. Zucco, </em>71 F.3d 188, 191 (5th Cir.1995). Even if it is assumed arguendo that the district court erred in finding that Pointer\u2019s custodial status weighed in favor of a finding of voluntariness, no one factor is determinative, and the district court\u2019s findings that an absence of coercive police tactics, Pointer\u2019s cooperation, and his education and intelligence weighed in favor of a finding of voluntariness were not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Dortch, </em>199 F.3d 193, 201 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b594-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
