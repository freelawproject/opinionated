Following our judgment, Hickman filed a petition for certiorari, in which she challenged for the first time the constitutionality of the Sentencing Guidelines as applied to her. The Supreme Court granted Hickman\u2019s petition for certiorari, vacated our judgment, and remanded the case to this court for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We now reconsider the matter in light of <em>Booker </em>and decide to reinstate our previous judgment affirming Hickman\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-14\">Because Hickman did not raise any Booker-related challenges to her sentence until her petition for certiorari, we will not review her claim absent extraordinary circumstances. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>409 F.3d 675, 676 (5th Cir.2005). Orneases make it clear that an argument not raised in appellant\u2019s original brief as required by Fed. R.App. P. 28 is waived.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant argues that based on remarks made by the trial judge at sentencing, she can satisfy the plain-error test discussed in <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-22 (5th Cir.2005). Even if appellant can satisfy the plain error test, she has not met the even more exacting test required to show the presence of extraordinary circumstances, which requires appellant to show a \u201cpossibility of injustice so grave as to warrant disregard of usual procedural rules.\u201d <em>McGee v. Estelle, </em>722 F.2d 1206, 1213 (5th Cir.1984) (footnote omitted). For the reasons stated above, our prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>disposition remains in effect, and we REINSTATE OUR EARLIER JUDGMENT affirming Hickman\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b582-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
