On appeal, he raises one issue: whether the district court erred by failing to use his proposed jury instruction regarding the \u00a7 924(c) charge. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">We do not find that the district court abused its discretion by declining to use Burney\u2019s proposed jury instruction. <em>See United States v. Russell, </em>971 F.2d 1098, 1107 (4th Cir.1992) (giving review standard). Burney has failed to show that the court committed reversible error by not giving the contested instruction. <em>See United States v. Lewis, </em>53 F.3d 29, 32-33 (4th Cir.1995) (stating standard). We have held that a \u201cdistrict court is not required to give defendant\u2019s particular form of instruction, as long as the instruction the court gives fairly covers a theory that the defense offers.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>44 F.3d 1259, 1270-71 (4th Cir.1995) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
