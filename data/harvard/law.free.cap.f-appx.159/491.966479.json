For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Berry\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but suggesting the district court erred in subjecting Berry to an enhanced sentence based on his prior felony drug conviction, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Although notified of his right to do so, Berry has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">Before turning to the argument suggested by counsel, we note that our review of the record reveals that the district court may have failed to comply with the requirements of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(b) (2000) in subjecting Berry to an enhanced sentence based on his prior felony drug conviction. Because Berry failed to challenge the \u00a7 851 enhancement on this ground in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-15\">In <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>326 F.3d 593 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 907, 124 S.Ct. 204, 157 L.Ed.2d 194 (2003), the defendant challenged the district court\u2019s failure to conduct a \u00a7 851(b) colloquy. The government notified the defendant that it was seeking an enhanced sentence based on prior convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 596. The presentence report also advised the defendant of the aggravating effect of the prior convictions. The defendant did not object to that portion of the presentence report and acknowledged the aggravating effect of the prior convictions at the sentencing hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 599. We concluded that the district court\u2019s failure to comply with the notification requirement of \u00a7 851(b) was plain error. <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, we held that, because the defendant apparently was on notice of the enhancement and failed to object to it, the error did not affect his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>(applying plain error analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-16\">Similarly, in this case, Berry received \u00a7 851 notice that adequately notified him of the prior felony drug offense upon which the government sought to enhance his sentence. The prior felony drug offense was included in the presentence report in the discussion of Berry\u2019s criminal history, yet Berry made no objection to the validity of this conviction.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The presentence report also clearly explained the impact of the prior felony drug offense on Berry\u2019s sentence. Finally, the court made clear at sentencing that Berry faced a statutory mandatory minimum sentence and gave Berry an opportunity to speak before pronouncing sentence. Even so, Berry did not object to the use of his prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>conviction to enhance his sentence. Because Berry \u201ccould not plausibly argue that he would have done anything different had the district court [complied with \u00a7 851(b)],\u201d <em>id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted), we find that the court\u2019s failure to comply with the \u00a7 851(b) requirements did not affect Berry\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">In the <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel argues that the application of the \u00a7 851 enhancement in Berry\u2019s case may violate his Sixth Amendment rights under <em>Booker. </em>In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory manner in which the federal sentencing guidelines required courts to impose sentencing enhancements based on facts found by the court, by a preponderance of the evidence, violated the Sixth Amendment. 125 S.Ct. at 746, 750 (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court). The Court remedied the constitutional violation by severing two statutory provisions, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (West Supp.2005) (requiring sentencing courts to impose a sentence within the applicable guideline range), and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005) (setting forth appellate standards of review for guideline issues), thereby making the guidelines advisory. <em>Id. </em>at 756-57 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court). Berry\u2019s sentence did not violate <em>Booker </em>because he was sentenced to the statutory minimum for his offense. As we recently made clear in <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>404 F.3d 850, 862 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 288, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2005), <em>\u201cBooker </em>did nothing to alter the rule that judges cannot depart below a statutorily provided minimum sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Berry\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b520-11\"> Although Berry initially argued that the conviction did not constitute a felony under North Carolina law, he later withdrew this objection after the Supreme Court of North Carolina issued a decision rejecting this precise argument. <em>See State v. Jones, </em>358 N.C. 473, 598 S.E.2d 125, 127-33 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
