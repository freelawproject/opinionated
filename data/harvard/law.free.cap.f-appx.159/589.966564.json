Castillo argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Castillo\u2019s argument concerning the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is, as he concedes, foreclosed. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 277-78 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 253, 163 L.Ed.2d 231 (2005) (No. 05-5469). To the extent that Castillo relies on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), to support this argument, nothing in the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>decision affected the validity of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) and <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Castillo also argues that the district court erred by imposing a sentence pursuant to the mandatory federal sentencing guideline system that was held unconstitutional in <em>Booker. </em>Castillo argues that, because he argued in the district court that <em>Blakely </em>applied to the Guidelines, this court reviews his <em>Booker </em>argument de novo. The Government agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">This court, not the parties, determines the proper standard of review. <em>See United States v. Vontsteen, </em>950 F.2d 1086, 1091 (5th Cir.1992). We need not decide here whether Castillo\u2019s objection preserved the claim for review because Castillo has shown plain error. Because the district court erred in sentencing Castillo pursuant to a mandatory guidelines scheme, he meets the first two requirements for relief under a plain-error analysis. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005) (No. 05-5556). Castillo has also shown that the error affected his substantial rights by \u201cpointing] to statements in the record by the sentencing judge demonstrating a likelihood that the judge sentencing under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory one would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d <em>United States v. Pennell, </em>409 F.3d 240, 245 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 517-18, 521 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-17\">Accordingly, Castillo\u2019s conviction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 is AFFIRMED; his sentence, however, is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-18\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b618-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
