On appeal he argues that (1) the district court erred by finding that his motion was time-barred; (2) he was entitled to equitable tolling; and (3) the application of \u00a7 983, enacted after the forfeiture proceedings in this case were completed, violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-20\">On September 22, 2004, Capote filed a <em>pro se </em>motion for return of property pursuant to Rule 41(e) (now Rule 41(g)). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>it, Capote stated that, on September 7, 1990, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) seized $39,390 of U.S. currency and jewelry from him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Capote then argued that the government had violated his Fifth Amendment due process rights because it failed to notify him that the aforementioned property would be forfeited and, thus, deprived him an opportunity for a hearing. Included with the motion was Capote\u2019s personal affidavit describing various pieces of jewelry seized by the FBI and DEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">The government responded that the FBI had processed the jewelry and money in question and initiated administrative forfeiture proceedings. In connection with the money, in April 1992, the FBI mailed two notices to Capote, one to his last known address, and another in care of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) because, at that time, Capote was in USMS custody. With respect to the jewelry, the FBI mailed three notices, one in May 1992 to Capote\u2019s last known address, one in May 1992 in care of the USMS in Fort Worth because Capote was in its custody, and one in August 1992 in care of the Federal Corrections Institution where Capote was incarcerated. The notices outlined the procedure for contesting the administrative forfeiture. A notice of the seizures and forfeitures was also published in the Atlanta Journal <em>&amp; </em>Constitution, a newspaper with general circulation. With respect to the currency, publication was made on May 4, 11, and 18, 1992, and with respect to the jewelry, publication was made on May 25, June 1, and June 8, 1992. After receiving no claims for the currency or the jewelry, the FBI administratively forfeited the currency on July 27, 1992, and the jewelry on November 16, 1992.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">The government first argued that the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain Capote\u2019s motion under Rule 41(g) because the exclusive remedy available to Capote was found at \u00a7 983(e). However, the government argued that Capote\u2019s motion was filed beyond the \u00a7 983(e)(3)\u2019s five-year statute of limitations. The government argued in the alternative that even if 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a)\u2019s six-year statute of limitations applied to Capote\u2019s motion, it was time-barred because it was filed 14 years after the seizure and 12 years after the forfeiture. The government further noted that, in October 1992, Capote filed a motion to suppress all of the evidence seized from his apartment and, therefore, was aware of the seizure of the currency and jewelry. Thus, the government argued that Capote\u2019s claim was barred by the doctrine of laches because he offered no excuse for his delay in challenging the forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">In reply, Capote argued that the district court had equitable jurisdiction to hear his motion for return of property and request<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>ed that his <em>pro se </em>pleadings be liberally construed. He further alleged that, because his motion asserted a Fifth Amendment violation, the court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. Next, Capote argued that his claim did not accrue until a fellow inmate informed him that any seizure of property had to be preceded by notice under the Fifth Amendment. Thus, he argued that his motion was not time-barred because he had never been notified of the forfeiture, and, therefore, his claim did not accrue until he received the government\u2019s response and examined the exhibits submitted. Capote further responded that his claim was not barred by laches because the government was responsible for any delay as a result of its constitutionally deficient notice. Capote argued that the record in this case failed to show when he received any mail while in detention at Johnson County Jail and that the methods for mail delivery at both Johnson County and the FCI in Fort Worth were sufficient. Finally, Capote argued that he was entitled to equitable tolling because any delay in filing was due solely to the government\u2019s inadequate notice, and he had exercised diligence upon learning that the government had violated his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The district court denied Capote\u2019s motion, finding that Capote was not entitled to relief under Rule 41(g) because his exclusive remedy for challenging the forfeiture on grounds of improper notice was under \u00a7 983(e). The court then found that Capote\u2019s motion was time-barred under \u00a7 983(e)(3)\u2019s five-year statute of limitations because Capote filed his motion more than 12 years after the government forfeited its final notice of forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">On appeal, Capote argues that the district court erred by applying the five-year statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 983(e)(3) when denying his motion as time-barred. Instead, he argues that the six-year statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 2401(a) applies, and because his cause of action accrued when he discovered or had reason to discover that his property had been forfeited without sufficient notice, his claim could not have accrued until after he had filed his motion and the government had filed its response. Capote also argues that his motion was not barred by laches because his delay in filing the motion was due to the government\u2019s insufficient notice. Capote also asserts he was entitled to equitable tolling of the statute of limitations for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute of limitations <em>de novo. See United States v. Carrell, </em>252 F.3d 1193, 1198 (11th Cir.2001) (reviewing applicability of the five-year statute of limitations in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621 for civil forfeitures of proceeds traceable to narcotics activity under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881). We note at the outset that the district court construed Capote\u2019s Rule 41(e) motion for a return of property as an \u00a7 983(e) motion to set aside a forfeiture, thus triggering the five-year statute of limitations in \u00a7 983(e)(3). We decline to address whether this was correct because even if the six-year statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 2401(a) applied, Capote\u2019s motion would still be time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">Assuming without deciding that the district correctly construed Capote\u2019s motion as one to set aside the forfeitures, section 983(e), which took effect on August 23, 2000, provides \u201cthe exclusive remedy for seeking to set aside a declaration of forfeiture under a civil forfeiture statute.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983(e)(5). A motion to set aside a forfeiture under \u00a7 983(e) \u201cmay be filed not later than 5 years after the date of final publication of notice of the seizure of the property.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983(e)(3). Here, Capote filed his motion 12 years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>after the final notices of publication of the seizure of both the currency and jewelry, and his motion, therefore, was time-barred under \u00a7 983.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">In the alternative, Capote argues that the forfeiture occurred in 1992, prior to \u00a7 983\u2019s passage, and, therefore, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a)\u2019s six-year \u201ccatch-all\u201d statute of limitations should apply. Assuming without deciding that Capote is correct, \u00a7 2401(a) provides that \u201cevery civil action commenced against the United States shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a). The core issue under \u00a7 2401(a) is when Capote\u2019s claim accrued. To date, this Court has not addressed the question of when a claim accrues under \u00a7 2401(a). Capote urges this Court to apply the test set forth by the Second Circuit in <em>Polanco v. United States Drug Enforcement Admin., </em>158 F.3d 647 (2d Cir.1998), and the government has not objected to the use of this test.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The Second Circuit has held that a claim accrues under \u00a7 2401 when the plaintiff \u201cdiscovered or had reason to discover that his property had been forfeited without sufficient notice.\u201d <em>Polanco, </em>158 F.3d at 654. In that case, the record did not reflect whether or when the defendant had his property forfeited, but the Second Circuit ruled that the defendant\u2019s claim would have begun to accrue at the earlier of two possible dates: (1) at the close of forfeiture proceedings, or (2) if no forfeiture proceedings had begun, when the five-year statute of limitations for the government to initiate forfeiture proceedings concluded. <em>Id. </em>As Capote\u2019s suit was filed more than 12 years after the forfeitures in this case had concluded, even following the <em>Polanco </em>rule, his present motion would be untimely under \u00a7 2401(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Moreover, taking a broader stance than the Second Circuit, the Fourth Circuit has held that a claimant\u2019s cause of action for inadequate notice of forfeiture accrues under \u00a7 2401 at the earlier of two dates: \u201cwhen he first became aware that the government had declared the [property] forfeited, or when an inquiry that he could reasonably have been expected to make would have made him aware of the forfeiture.\u201d <em>United States v. Minor, </em>228 F.3d 352, 359 (4th Cir.2000); <em>see also United States v. Rodriguez-Aguirre, </em>264 F.3d 1195, 1214 (10th Cir.2001) (holding that a claimant\u2019s cause of action accrues at the earlier of two dates: \u201c(1) the date on which the claimant discovered that the property was forfeited, or (2) the date on which the claimant could reasonably be expected to have made an inquiry that would have made him aware of the forfeiture.\u201d). Capote argues he did not become aware of the forfeiture until 2004. However, Capote could reasonably have inquired about his property 12 years earlier, when he knew it had been seized, as evidenced by his filing a motion to suppress on October 6, 1992. Therefore, even applying the Fourth Circuit\u2019s rule, his motion is time-barred. Accordingly, giving Capote the full benefit of his argument that \u00a7 2401(a) applies, we still conclude that Capote\u2019s motion was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">As to Capote\u2019s equitable tolling argument, we have not, to date, applied the equitable tolling doctrine to \u00a7 983 or \u00a7 2401(a) cases. However, we have held that, absent Congressional intent to the contrary, principles of equitable tolling are read into every federal statute of limitation. <em>Cook v. Deltona Corp., </em>753 F.2d 1552, 1562 (1985). Assuming that \u00a7 983(e)(3)\u2019s statute of limitations may be equitably tolled, the doctrine of \u201cequitable tolling\u201d is an extraordinary remedy that we apply \u201csparingly.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Drew v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number><em>Dep't of Corrs., </em>297 F.3d 1278, 1286 (11th Cir.2002) (noting that equitable tolling is available to toll the statute of limitations for filing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petitions). \u201c[I]t is \u2018appropriate when a movant untimely files because of extraordinary circumstances that are both beyond his control <em>and </em>unavoidable even with diligence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted and emphasis in original). The burden of establishing entitlement to this \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d is clearly with Capote. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">While Capote argues that his failure to file an earlier motion was due to the government\u2019s negligence in failing to provide him notice, this argument is meritless. Capote became aware of the forfeiture at the latest in October 1992, when he filed a motion to suppress all evidence seized from his residence. Despite that knowledge, Capote never filed a motion to have his property returned, but instead waited more than 12 years to challenge the forfeiture, and, therefore, faded to exercise any diligence. Accordingly, Capote was not entitled to equitable tolling of either statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Lastly, to the extent that Capote argues that the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 983(e)\u2019s five-year statute of limitations caused an <em>ex post facto </em>violation, he did not raise this challenge in the district court, and we will review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Miranda, </em>197 F.3d 1357, 1358-59 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cAn appellate court may not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005) (quotation and citation omitted). \u201cIf all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">The Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution provides that \u201cNo Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed.\u201d U.S. Const. Art. I \u00a7 9, cl. 3. \u201cThe Ex Post Facto Clause operates not to protect an individual\u2019s right to less punishment, but rather as a means of assuring that an individual will receive fair warning of criminal statutes and the punishments they carry.\u201d <em>United States v. Bordon, </em>421 F.3d 1202, 1207 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[I]n order to prevail on an <em>ex post facto </em>claim, a defendant \u2018must show both that the law he challenges operates retroactively (that it applies to conduct completed before its enactment) and that it raises the penalty from whatever the law provided when he acted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Assuming that \u00a7 983 applies retroactively to forfeitures occurring before the date of its passage, nothing in \u00a7 983 operates to raise the penalty for a crime that Capote committed. <em>See also Dufresne v. Baer, </em>744 F.2d 1543, 1546 (11th Cir.1984) (\u201c[a] law which is merely procedural and does not add to the quantum of punishment, however, cannot violate the <em>ex post facto </em>clause even if it is applied retrospectively.\u201d). Thus, we conclude that there was no <em>ex post facto </em>violation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">Based on the foregoing discussion, we conclude that Capote\u2019s motion was time-barred under either \u00a7 983\u2019s five-year statute of limitations or \u00a7 2401(a)\u2019s six-year statute of limitations, and that application of \u00a7 983(e)(3) did not result in an <em>ex post facto </em>violation. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not commit any reversible error by denying Capote\u2019s motion. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-5\">.
