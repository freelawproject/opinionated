Rodriguez argues that the sentencing provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Rodriguez correctly acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review. <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Rodriguez also contends that the district court erred in imposing a sentence pursuant to a belief that the Sentencing Guidelines were mandatory, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 259-60, 125 S.Ct. 738, 764-65, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In the district court, Rodriguez argued that his sentence was improperly enhanced on the basis of his prior conviction for a crime of violence, in contravention of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) . This court need not decide whether this objection preserved a mandatory-sentencing-guideline argument for appeal, as his claims would succeed even under plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Under a plain-error standard, the defendant bears the burden of \u201cestablish[ing] that the error affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005) ; <em>see also United States v. Cruz, </em>418 F.3d 481, 485 (5th Cir.2005). In the instant case, the district court opined.that in the absence of the Sentencing Guidelines, it would have imposed a lesser sentence than that called for under the Guidelines. Rodriguez has shown that this error had a substantial effect on his sentence. As a result, Rodriguez\u2019s sentence is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings. <em>See Cruz, </em>418 F.3d at 485.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b585-30\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
