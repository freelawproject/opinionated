She appeals her 42-month sentence, arguing that it violates her due process rights, as informed by ex post facto principles. She also asserts that the sentence imposed was not reasonable. Finding no merit to Dotson\u2019s claims, we affirm her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-20\">Dotson first contends that her due process rights, as informed by ex post facto principles, are violated by the imposition of a sentence under the Supreme Court\u2019s remedial decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (referring to the Court\u2019s opinion expressed through Justice Breyer, which makes the guidelines advisory rather than mandatory), rather than under the mandatory guidelines applicable at the time of her offense. We find that this claim is without merit. <em>See United States v. Dupas, </em>419 F.3d 916 (9th Cir.2005) (rejecting ex post facto claim); <em>United States v. Jamison, </em>416 F.3d 538 (7th Cir.2005) (same); <em>United States v. Lata, </em>415 F.3d 107 (1st Cir.2005) (same); <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>411 F.3d 572, 576 (5th Cir.2005) (same); <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297 (11th Cir.) (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 432, \u2014 L.Ed.2d- (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-22\">Dotson also challenges the reasonableness of her sentence. She asserts that the 42-month sentence imposed is greater than necessary to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, and provide her with drug treatment and rehabilitation. We have carefully reviewed the record and Dotson\u2019s contentions and find that the sentence imposed by the district court is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005) (noting after <em>Booker </em>sentencing courts should determine the sentencing range under the guidelines, consider the other factors under \u00a7 3553(a), and impose a reasonable sentence within the statutory maximum).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm Dotson\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
