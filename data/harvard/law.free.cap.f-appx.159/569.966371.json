Her application was denied. Hunt then requested and received a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). The ALJ determined that Hunt was not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act at any time before December 31, 2001, the date her disability insured status<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> expired. Hunt appealed the ALJ\u2019s decision to the Social Security Administration Appeals Council. The Appeals Council denied Hunt\u2019s request for benefits and held that the ALJ\u2019s decision was the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security (Commissioner).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-17\">Hunt filed suit in district court seeking review of the final administrative decision denying her disability claim. Hunt also filed a motion to remand the case to the ALJ, arguing that her medical condition had worsened since the hearing and new medical evidence should be considered by the ALJ. A federal magistrate judge recommended that (1) Hunt\u2019s appeal be denied and dismissed with prejudice and (2) Hunt\u2019s motion to remand be denied. The district judge adopted the magistrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>judge\u2019s recommendation. Hunt appeals the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny her application for disability benefits and motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">We review the Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny benefits to determine whether that decision is supported by substantial evidence and whether the proper legal standards are applied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cA finding of no substantial evidence is appropriate only if no credible evidentiary choices or medical findings support the decision.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This court must affirm the Commissioner\u2019s determination unless this court finds that 1) the ALJ applied an incorrect legal standard, or 2) that the ALJ\u2019s determination is not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Hunt only asserts that the decision is not supported by substantial evidence. We affirm the ALJ\u2019s decision denying Hunt\u2019s claim for disability insurance benefits for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">1. There is substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Hunt was not disabled due to depression (under Listing 12.04 of 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpart P, App. 1) on or before December 31, 2001, the date her disability insured status expired. Hunt\u2019s claim of depression was not supported by any specialized mental health care diagnosis or treatment. Additionally, Dr. William Bergmann, a psychologist, expressly stated in a July 2001 residual functional capacity assessment that Hunt\u2019s mental status would not prevent her from successfully adapting to work.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-11\">2. There is substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s determination that Hunt was not disabled due to a combination of impairments. The ALJ properly considered the disabling effect of each of Hunt\u2019s alleged impairments as well as the combined effect of such impairments in making the non-disability determination. Dr. Robert Po, a physician who conducted an orthopaedic examination of Hunt in February 2001, concluded that she was able to: 1) occasionally lift twenty-five pounds and frequently carry and lift ten pounds; 2) sit two hours continuously up to six hours in a workday; and 3) stand and walk fifteen minutes continuously up to four hours in a workday. A vocational expert testified that despite Hunt\u2019s impairments, she was capable of making a successful adjustment to work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-12\">3. There is substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Hunt could perform light and sedentary level jobs. \u201cLight work involves lifting no more than 20 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 10 pounds.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cSedentary work involves lifting no more than 10 pounds at a time and occasionally lifting or carrying articles like docket files, ledgers, small tools.... Jobs are sedentary if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>walking and standing are required occasionally and other sedentary criteria are met.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The ALJ concluded that Hunt was capable of performing light and sedentary work, consisting of lifting and carrying twenty pounds occasionally and ten pounds frequently, standing and walking fifteen minutes at a time up to four hours in a workday, and sitting for six hours in a workday. The ALJ\u2019s conclusion was in accord with Dr. Robert Po\u2019s opinion that Hunt was capable of doing such work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">We also affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Hunt\u2019s motion to remand. \u201c[T]o justify a remand [based on new evidence], the evidence must be (1) new, (2) material, and (3) good cause must be shown for the failure to incorporate the evidence into the record in a prior proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cIt is \u2018implicit in the materiality requirement\u2019 that \u2018the new evidence relate to the time period for which benefits were denied, and that it not concern evidence of a later-acquired disability or of the subsequent deterioration of the previously non-disabling condition.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Hunt\u2019s disability insured status expired on December 31, 2001. Consequently, to prove that she is entitled to disability benefits, Hunt must prove that she was disabled on or before December 31, 2001.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The medical reports that Hunt seeks to have the ALJ review on remand, however, relate to Hunt\u2019s condition after December 31, 2001. Because the evidence does not pertain to the time period for which benefits were denied, the evidence fails to meet the materiality requirement for remand. Therefore, the district court did not err in denying Hunt\u2019s motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b598-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
