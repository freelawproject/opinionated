Anthony appeals the 188-month sentence imposed upon his conviction for (i) conspiracy to import a detectable quantity of MDMA, and (n) the importation of a detectable quantity of MDMA, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952(a), 960(b)(3), 963, apd 851. Defendant contends that the district court\u2019s application of the federal sentencing guidelines in fashioning his sentence constituted a violation of his constitutional rights under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s constitutional claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>were raised timely in the district court and, as such, preserved for our review. We vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Defendant argued at sentencing and argues again on appeal that his constitutional rights were violated when the sentencing court (i) enhanced his sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 based on prior convictions; (ii) held him responsible for 1004.3 grams of MDMA when the indictment referenced only a detectable amount; and (in) applied the career offender provisions of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 based on two prior felony convictions that were not admitted by him, charged in the indictment or found by a jury. Defendant also argues that the sentencing judge \u2014 who did depart downward horizontally \u2014 erred when he refused his request to depart downward vertically; Defendant maintains that his sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">We see no constitutional <em>Booker </em>error. About the sentencing court\u2019s career offender and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 enhancements based on prior convictions, we have decided <em>post-Booker </em>that a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights are \u201cnot implicated when a defendant\u2019s sentence is enhanced based on a prior conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 223, 163 L.Ed.2d 191 (2005). As we noted in <em>Orduno-Mireles, </em>the rationale for excepting prior convictions from restraints on judicial factfinding is clear: \u201c \u2018a prior conviction must itself have been established through procedures satisfying the fair notice, reasonable doubt, and jury trial guarantees.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 962, <em>(quoting Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 1227, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">Defendant\u2019s argument that his constitutional rights were violated when he was sentenced based on a quantity of MDMA that was not alleged in the indictment also is without merit. Defendant failed to object to the facts concerning drug quantity set out in the PSI. A defendant\u2019s failure to dispute drug-quantity facts contained in the PSI operates as an admission of those facts for <em>Booker </em>purposes. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that sentence enhancement based on drug quantity not violative of <em>Booker </em>where defendant failed to dispute facts in the PSI). Sentencing enhancement based on admitted facts states no Sixth Amendment violation under <em>Booker. Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756 (reaffirming that facts used to enhance a sentence, other than a prior conviction, must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by the defendant); <em>Skelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">Although we conclude that the sentencing court committed no constitutional <em>Booker </em>error, two kinds of sentencing error may be claimed under <em>Booker: </em>constitutional and statutory. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[Cjonstitutional error is the use of extra-verdict enhancements to reach a guidelines result that is binding on the sentencing judge.\u201d <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1331 (quoting <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1301 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005)). Statutory <em>Booker </em>error occurs when the district court misapplies the guidelines by considering them as binding \u201ceven in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.\u201d <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>We apply preserved error review to a statutory <em>Booker </em>claim if defendant preserved a constitutional claim by \u201ccitation to <em>Apprendi </em>or to other cases in that line of cases.\u201d <em>United States v. Dowling, </em>403 F.3d 1242, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). And two harmless error standards exist for review of <em>Booker </em>error. <em>Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1291-92 (11th Cir.2005). Constitutional error requires reversal unless \u201cthe government can show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1291. Statutory <em>Booker </em>error \u2014 unlike constitutional <em>Booker </em>error \u2014 requires reversal \u201conly if [the error] resulted in actual prejudice because it had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the [result].\u201d <em>United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2005), <em>quoting United States v. Guzman, </em>167 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.1999). The government bears the burden to show the absence of effect of the statutory error on the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1292. A sentence is due to be affirmed if it can be said \u201c \u2018with fair assurance ... that the [sentence] was not substantially swayed by the error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Hornaday, </em>392 F.3d 1306, 1315-16 (11th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 2951, 162 L.Ed.2d 877 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The Government concedes that it can not meet the burden of proving that the sentencing court\u2019s application of the guidelines as mandatory was harmless. At sentencing, the court noted that Defendant\u2019s sentence was about five times greater than the sentence imposed on his co-defendant. The sentencing judge also queried the government asking \u201c[d]on\u2019t you find this an exceptionally harsh sentence that the Court has to impose?\u201d We cannot say with fair assurance that Defendant\u2019s sentence was not substantially impacted by the statutory <em>Booker </em>error. What sentence the district court would have imposed had it considered the guidelines advisory is impossible to tell. Accordingly, we vacate Defendant\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b191-13\">. <em>Booker </em>was decided by the Supreme Court after Defendant was sentenced. At sentencing, Defendant raised his constitutional claims based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Because the <em>Booker </em>decision applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>to all cases then pending on direct review, we apply <em>Booker </em>to this appeal. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 769.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b193-20\">. Because we remand for resentencing, we do not address Anthony\u2019s other sentencing arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
