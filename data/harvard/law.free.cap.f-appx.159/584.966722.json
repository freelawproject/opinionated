Molin contends that the defendants used excessive force against him on numerous occasions and were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">On appeal, Molin summarily reiterates his allegations that he was assaulted by Deputy Lewis on March 26, 2003, and by \u201cofficers\u201d in May and August 2003. Molin alleges that, despite his requests for medical treatment, defendants failed to provide treatment for over two weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Molin provides no analysis of the district court\u2019s reasoning or citations to any authority in support of his bare assertions that the court erred in dismissing his claims; he merely disagrees with the court\u2019s conclusions related to his deliberate indifference claims. Essentially, Molin\u2019s brief does little more than state that he was given the wrong or delayed treatment and was repeatedly assaulted, though he admits he cannot prove the assaults.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">Although <em>pro se </em>briefs are liberally construed, even <em>pro se </em>litigants must brief arguments to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir. 1993). Molin\u2019s brief fails to satisfy the requirements of Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9), which requires an argument, with \u201ccontentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies\u201d and \u201cfor each issue, a concise statement of the applicable standard of review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-15\">General arguments giving only broad standards of review and not citing to specific errors are insufficient to preserve issues for appeal. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Moreover, when an appellant fails to identify error in the district court\u2019s decision, it is as if he had not appealed that judgment. <em>Id. </em>This court \u201cwill not raise and discuss legal issues that ... [Molin] has failed to assert.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-16\">Under the standard set forth in <em>Brinkmann </em>and <em>Yohey, </em>Molin has not adequately briefed any issue for this court\u2019s review. His appeal has no arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). It is therefore DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-17\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-88 (5th Cir. 1996). Molin is CAUTIONED that if he accumulates three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-18\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b613-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
