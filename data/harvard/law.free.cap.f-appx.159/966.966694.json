Hernandez was sentenced based on an offense level that was increased because he had previously been deported because of a felony assault conviction, and he challenges that increase. Hernandez claims that (1) as his prior conviction was not specifically mentioned in the indictment, the district court violated his constitutional rights when it enhanced his sentence; (2) <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), is no longer good law; and (3) his sentence violates the Sixth Amendment following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531,159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">We review the district court\u2019s application of law to the facts and constitutional challenges to a sentence <em>de novo. United States v. Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d 1142, 1144-45 (11th Cir.2005). Although <em>Blakely </em>does not apply to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, <em>see Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 305 n. 9, 124 S.Ct. at 2538 n. 9, the Supreme Court held in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), that the federal sentencing guidelines are subject to the jury trial requirements of the Sixth Amendment. 125 S.Ct. at 752-55. Thus, the <em>Booker </em>court held that \u201cthe Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated where <em>under a mandatory guidelines system </em>a sentence is increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the judge that were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005) (emphasis in original). A defendant who fails to object to the facts in the PSI has admitted them. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005). The holdings in <em>Blakely/Booker </em>do not apply to the use of prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 223, 163 L.Ed.2d 191 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-11\">Title 8, section 1326 sets the criminal penalties for removed aliens who reenter the United States. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. Section 1326(b)(2) states that an alien \u201cwhose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony, such alien shall be fined under such Title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). An aggravated felony is defined as a crime of violence, as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16, for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). A crime of violence is one that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-12\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the Supreme Court held that (1) 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is an enhancement to the crime described in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), not a separate crime; and consequently (2) neither the Constitution nor the statute require the federal government to charge that a defendant was convicted of an aggravated felony in the indictment. <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 230-31, 243-44, 118 S.Ct. at 1224-25, 1230-31. Thus far, no Supreme Court decision has disturbed the conclusion reached in <em>Almendarez-Torres. Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d at 1147. Accordingly, \u201ca district court does not err by relying on prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence,\u201d and those prior convictions need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-13\">After reviewing the record and both parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error. Hernandez was sentenced after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>was released, and the record shows that the district court was aware the guidelines were advisory. Further, Hernandez admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>the fact of his assault conviction during the plea colloquy, and did not object to its description in the PSI. Thus, even if the holdings in <em>Blakely/Booker </em>did apply to the use of prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence, there would be no error as Hernandez admitted that he had been convicted of a crime, an element of which was the use of force against another. <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. However, as we have repeatedly held that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains good law, the government was not required to allege that Hernandez had been convicted of an aggravated felony in order to increase his sentence. <em>See Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d at 1146-47. Moreover, the indictment did allege that Hernandez had violated 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), so he had notice of the increased sentence. The district court did not err in relying on prior convictions to enhance Hernandez\u2019s sentence. <em>See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1329. For the above-stated reasons, we affirm Hernandez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
