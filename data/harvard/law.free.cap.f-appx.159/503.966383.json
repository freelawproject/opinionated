See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b531-21\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b531-22\">Antjuane Glento Dilworth pled guilty to possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a felony offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000); and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (2000). The district court sentenced him to a total of 262 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-23\">Dilworth maintains that he was erroneously sentenced as a career offender because one of his predicate offenses was not punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 4B1.2(a) (2004) (defining \u201ccrime of violence\u201d). Specifically, Dilworth asserts that the district court erred in finding a 1996 breaking and entering conviction applied as a predicate \u201ccrime of violence\u201d conviction. While the maximum aggravated punishment for this Class H conviction was thirty months\u2019 imprisonment, Dilworth notes that, based on his criminal history, and in the absence of aggravating factors, the maximum sentence he could have received was twelve months. Dilworth thus maintains that his sentence could not have exceeded a year, and that this conviction does not qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for career offender purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-24\">We conclude that the district court did not err. <em>See United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242, 246-47 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that <em>United States v. Jones, </em>195 F.3d 205 (4th Cir.1999), is still viable after <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and reaffirm<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>ing that \u201ca prior North Carolina conviction was for \u2018a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u2019 if <em>any </em>defendant charged with that crime could receive a sentence of more than one year.\u201d (internal citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
