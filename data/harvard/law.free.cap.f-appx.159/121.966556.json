Vilchez argues on appeal that the use of the prior convictions to enhance his sentence violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights and that the use of an unproven and unadmitted prior conviction to enhance his sentence under the advisory Sentencing Guidelines violates the Ex Post Facto and Due Process Clauses. After review, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">According to the facts stipulated to at the plea hearing, Vilchez is a Peruvian citizen who was previously deported from the United States in 1996. In April 2004, he was incarcerated in a Dade County Jail, charged with false imprisonment, stalking, battery, threatening to tamper with a witness, driving under the influence, and driving without a license. The government charged him with illegal reentry after deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(1). Under \u00a7 1326(b)(1), Vilchez\u2019s prior felony drug convictions increased the statutory maximum sentence from two years, under \u00a7 1326(a), to ten years. The district court sentenced Vilchez to 41 months imprisonment, which is above the two-year maximum under \u00a7 1326(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The central issue raised' in this case involves the appellant\u2019s claim that the government is obligated to prove his prior drug convictions in the guilt determination phase of his case in order to use them at the sentencing hearing. Vilchez makes a half-hearted attempt to distinguish binding circuit precedent but admits that his main purpose is to preserve the issue for petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Vilchez objected to the government\u2019s failure to allege in the indictment his prior convictions, which resulted in a increased statutory maximum sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1), and to the enhancement of his offense level under the Guidelines in the district court. We review these claims <em>de novo </em>on appeal, and reverse the later only for harmful error. <em>United States v. Candelario, </em>240 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">The Supreme Court established in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States </em>that a defendant\u2019s prior conviction, in the context of the increased-penalty provision of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), is merely a sentencing factor that does not have to be submitted to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. 523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1232-33, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). The Court held that the use of a prior conviction as a sentencing factor does not violate the Due Process Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 239-41, 247, 118 S.Ct. at 1229, 1233. The Court later held in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>that \u201c[ojther than a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362-63, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The Court also stated that \u201cwe need not revisit <em>[AlmendarezTorres </em>] for purposes of our decision today to treat the case as a narrow exception to the general rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">In <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>the Supreme Court, in examining the state of Washington\u2019s sentencing guidelines, held that the imposition of a sentencing enhancement must be supported by facts that were either admitted by the defendant or found beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury. 542 U.S. 296, 303-04, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 2537-38, 159 L.Ed.2d 403. In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>the Supreme Court extended the reasoning of <em>Blakely </em>to the federal Sentencing Guidelines, concluding that the mandatory nature of the Sentencing Guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to the right to a jury trial. 543 U.S. at-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 749-51, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The Court excised several sections of the Guidelines, making the Guidelines advisory, not mandatory. <em>Id. </em>at-, 125 S.Ct. at 756-57. In extending its holding in <em>Blakely </em>to the Federal Guidelines, the Court, in <em>Booker, </em>explicitly reaffirmed its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>rationale in <em>Apprendi </em>that a fact, other than a prior conviction, that supports a sentence exceeding the statutory maximum must be admitted by the defendant or submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at-, 125 S.Ct. at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">In <em>United States v. Marseille, </em>we declined to interpret the Supreme Court\u2019s rationale in <em>Apprendi </em>as overruling the prior Supreme Court holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>that the government \u201cneed not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence.\u201d 377 F.3d 1249, 1257 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 637, 160 L.Ed.2d 480 (2004). We later clarified that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>\u201cwas left undisturbed by <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker.\u201d United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Vilchez presents two arguments on this appeal. First, he argues that a prior conviction that was not listed in the indictment, proven beyond a reasonable doubt, or admitted cannot be used to increase his statutory maximum from two years to ten years under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1). Second, he contends that the sentencing court violated his constitutional rights at sentencing by enhancing his offence level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) (2004). We address these in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">A. <em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">There is a two-year maximum sentence for aliens who illegally attempt to reenter the United States after being deported. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). However, if an alien\u2019s initial deportation was subsequent to that person\u2019s conviction for the commission of three or more misdemeanors involving drugs or a felony, the statutory maximum increases to ten years. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-14\">In this case, the district court correctly relied on Vilchez\u2019s -prior convictions to sentence him in accordance with the increased penalty provision of \u00a7 1326(b)(1). <em>See Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 247, 118 S.Ct. at 1232-33. For the Sixth Amendment, <em>Booker </em>made clear that prior convictions need not be admitted to by a defendant or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 543 U.S. at-, 125 S.Ct. at 756. Therefore, because <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains good law, we reject Vilchez\u2019s claim that the increase in his statutory maximum sentence from two years to ten years under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) violated his Fifth or Sixth Amendment rights. <em>See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-17\">B. <em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.2(b)(l)(A)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-18\">Vilchez\u2019s offense level was increased from 8 to 24, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). That section provides for a 16-level increase to a defendant\u2019s base offense level if the defendant was previously deported or unlawfully remained in the United States after, <em>inter alia, </em>a conviction for a felony that is a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"AR_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>In <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>we held that, <em>post-Booker, </em>when a defendant was sentenced to the statutory maximum for offenses committed <em>pre-Booker, </em>that defendant had \u201csufficient warning\u201d to satisfy due process and ex post facto concerns. 400 F.3d 1297, 1308 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 432, 163 L.Ed.2d 329 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">In this case, Vilchez knew at the time the offense was committed that the Guidelines allowed the judge to engage in judicial fact-finding and that ten years\u2019 imprisonment was a potential consequence of his actions. Therefore, there was no ex post facto or due process violation. <em>See Duncan, </em>400 F.3d at 1307. As to Vilchez\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s enhancement of his sentence under the Guidelines violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial, the Supreme Court, in <em>Booker, </em>held that it was the mandatory nature of the Sentencing Guidelines that implicated the Sixth Amendment. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at-, 125 S.Ct. at 750. Here, the district court acknowledged that it was applying the Guidelines as advisory. Therefore, under <em>Booker, </em>Vilchez\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were not violated. Furthermore, because <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains good law, there is no Sixth Amendment violation by applying a Guidelines sentencing enhancement based on prior convictions. <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1315-16 (11th Cir.) (per curiam), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 457, 163 L.Ed.2d 347 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">Vilchez appealed the determination of his sentence following a guilty plea. We find no error. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-12\">. Furthermore, Vilchez did not object to the truth of the facts of his prior convictions. His objection was to the use of those convictions at sentencing without first listing them in the indictment or proving them beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, for <em>Booker </em>purposes, Vilchez admits the facts of his past convictions, and their use at sentencing was not improper. <em>See United States v. Burge, </em>407 F.3d 1183, 1191 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 551, 163 L.Ed.2d 467 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
