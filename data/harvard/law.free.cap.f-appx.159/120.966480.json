The district court construed her complaint as a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 hostile work environment action. On May 27, 2005, the district court dismissed the complaint as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). Williams appeals from that order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">To establish a hostile work environment claim, Williams must show that: (1) she belongs to a protected group; (2) she has been subject to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based on a protected characteristic of the employee; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment and create a discriminatorily abusive working environment; and (5) the employer is responsible for the environment under either a theory of vicarious or direct liability. <em>See Miller v. Kenworth of Dothan, Inc., </em>277 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The district court had authority to dismiss Williams\u2019 case if it determined that her action was frivolous. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). A case is frivolous if the factual allegations are clearly baseless or if it is based on a \u201cindisputably merit-less legal theory.\u201d <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 1833, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). We review the district\u2019s court dismissal of Williams\u2019 claim for frivolity only for an abuse of discretion. <em>Bilal v. Driver, </em>251 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Williams\u2019 case as frivolous. Williams\u2019 allegations are insufficient to meet the third prong of a hostile work environment claim. She alleged that her co-workers\u2019 conduct was annoying and unprofessional but failed to allege that it was attributable to her membership in a protected category. For this reason, Williams does not have a legally cognizable hostile work environment claim under \u00a7 1983. Her claim is based on an indisputably meritless legal theory. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Williams\u2019 claim as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b149-8\">. Williams also submitted a separate <em>pro se </em>complaint against the Alabama Medicaid Agency, Deborah Poe, and Wency McMeans. The district court treated this complaint together with the complaint against Alabama Public Health and Stephens. Williams only appeals the order of dismissal as to her complaint against Alabama Public Health and Stephens.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
