The government contends that we lack jurisdiction to hear Zapata\u2019s claims for asylum because the IJ determined that his application was untimely and no extraordinary circumstances justified the untimely filing. The government also contends that we lack jurisdiction to hear Zapata\u2019s CAT relief and withholding of removal claims because Zapata failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-19\">We review subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003). As we explained in <em>Balogun v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>425 F.3d 1356 (11th Cir. 2005), the REAL ID Act broadened the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals when we review final orders of removal that involve constitutional claims or questions of law. <em>Id. </em>at 1359 \u2014 60; <em>see also </em>Real ID Act \u00a7 106(a)(l)(A)(iii), codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). We have also recognized, however, that \u201c[t]he timeliness of an asylum application is not a constitutional claim or question of law covered by the Real ID Act\u2019s changes.\u201d <em>Chacon-Botero v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>427 F.3d 954, 957 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>Because the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s decision, we review only the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Chacon-Botero, </em>427 F.3d at 956 (\u201cWhen the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent that the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision.\u201d) (quoting <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001)) (quotation marks omitted). The IJ determined that Zapata\u2019s asylum application was untimely, and so we have no jurisdiction to review that decision. <em>See id. </em>at 957.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">An alien has timely filed for asylum if he \u201cdemonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). An application filed after one year also may be considered despite its untimeliness \u201cif the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the period specified....\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Nevertheless, section 1158(a)(3) provides, \u201cNo court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General under paragraph (2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>see also Chacon-Botero, </em>427 F.3d at 954; <em>Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1217-18 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">The IJ made a factual determination that Zapata\u2019s application was untimely and determined that he had failed to establish changed or extraordinary circumstances that excused the untimely application. These determinations did not involve any constitutional claims or questions of law. Therefore, we have no jurisdiction to hear Zapata\u2019s asylum claim and dismiss his petition in this respect. <em>See Chacon-Botero, </em>427 F.3d at 954.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">We may review a final order of removal only if an alien has exhausted all available administrative remedies. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Sundar v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cWe have interpreted that requirement to be jurisdictional, so we lack jurisdiction to consider claims that have not been raised before the BIA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">We conclude that we have no jurisdiction to hear Zapata\u2019s CAT relief claim, but we do have jurisdiction to consider his withholding of removal claim. Zapata made no reference to CAT relief in his brief before the BIA. Therefore, he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to CAT relief. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to hear his CAT relief claims on appeal, and dismiss his petition in that regard. <em>See Bayro v. Reno, </em>142 F.3d 1377, 1379 (11th Cir.1998) (holding that if the BIA summarily dismisses a petitioner\u2019s appeal because he did not address the disputed issue in his brief, then the petitioner has not perfected his appeal to the BIA and has not exhausted his administrative remedies); <em>see also Fenandez-Bernal v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1317 n. 13 (11th Cir.2001) (stating that failure to raise an issue before the BIA results in this Court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction over that issue); <em>Asencio v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 614, 615-16 (11th Cir.1994) (noting that if a claim has not been first presented to the BIA, this Court lacks jurisdiction over that claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">In his brief before the BIA, however, Zapata did argue that the IJ erred in finding that Zapata failed to meet his burden of proof regarding persecution. His brief before the BIA also set forth the relevant law with respect to withholding of removal and noted that withholding of removal requires a higher burden of proof than asylum. We conclude that Zapata ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>hausted his administrative remedies with respect to the withholding of removal issue, and so we have jurisdiction to consider this aspect of his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">To the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision not to withhold Zapata\u2019s removal was based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). The IJ\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (citation omitted). The substantial evidence test is \u201cdeferential\u201d and does not allow us to \u201cre-weigh the evidence from scratch.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">\u201cAn alien seeking withholding of removal under the INA must show that his life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A)). \u201cAn alien bears the burden of demonstrating that he more-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tortured upon his return to the country in question.\u201d <em>Id.; see also 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b). Although neither the INA nor the regulations define \u201cpersecution,\u201d we have recognized other circuits\u2019 holdings that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations omitted); <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">An alien\u2019s testimony, if credible, may be sufficient without corroboration to sustain the burden of proof for withholding of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b). In an adverse credibility determination, however, when the IJ enumerates an applicant\u2019s inconsistencies and the record supports these findings, we will not substitute our judgment for the IJ\u2019s credibility findings. <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2004). Substantial evidence in the present case supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determinations and the subsequent decision that Zapata was not entitled to withholding of removal under the INA.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">The IJ noted inconsistencies in Zapata\u2019s testimony. For example, Zapata testified that he was a member of the Community Action Board (CAB) of Barbosa. After Zapata described the CAB\u2019s function and structure, the IJ asked Zapata to explain his involvement with the CAB, and Zapata replied that he was not actually a member of the CAB but was a member of a community action group.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">Zapata also testified that in February 1998 while he and his wife were working at the store they owned, they heard loud noises that sounded like gunshots, and they dropped to the floor, fearing for their lives. Later, a neighbor told Zapata that two people had come by on a motorcycle and had shot at the store. Zapata reported this incident to the authorities, but the persons responsible were never apprehended. Zapata testified that he moved around from place to place in Colombia after the incident at his store occurred, but his asylum application indicates that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>lived at the same address in Medellin, Columbia from 1989 to 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">Zapata had only one face-to-face encounter with ELN at a community meeting in La Chorrera in February 1998, and he was not harmed during his encounter. He did not report this incident to the authorities. Although he testified that he received threatening phone calls from ELN, Zapata provided sparse details concerning these calls. The IJ concluded that, overall, Zapata\u2019s testimony was vague, general, and lacking in specific details.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">The incidents Zapata testified about are best characterized as harassment and intimidation, and do not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. Moreover, his testimony and the evidence do not show that the assault on his store occurred because of political opinion. <em>See Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483, 112 S.Ct. at 816 (requiring a petitioner to show that he was persecuted because of his political opinion). Although the record demonstrates that Zapata was active in political campaigns, it does not establish that he was persecuted because of his political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">In denying Zapata\u2019s request for withholding of removal, the IJ provided specific, cogent reasons for his adverse credibility determination, and the record supports the IJ\u2019s findings. Zapata has failed to demonstrate that it is \u201cmore-likely-than-not [that he] would be persecuted or tortured\u201d if returned to Columbia. <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. Therefore, we affirm the IJ\u2019s denial of Zapata\u2019s petition with respect to withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b956-13\">. Zapata's wife, Blanca Margarita Mejia, was also ordered removed, but she is not mentioned as a petitioner in Zapata\u2019s initial brief. Nonetheless, because the government concedes that her application for asylum is derivative of her husband\u2019s, our discussion of and ruling on Zapata's claims also apply to his wife\u2019s petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
