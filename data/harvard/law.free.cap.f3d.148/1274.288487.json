Johnnie Oliver appeals his 121-month sentence for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846, possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and distribution of cocaine base, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-14\">The Olivers had successfully argued in their motions to vacate, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, that their convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) were invalid in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 142-43, 116 S.Ct. 501, 505, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995). The district court ordered that the Olivers be resentenced in order to determine whether their sentences should be enhanced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), which provides a two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm during the commission of a drug offense. At sentencing, the district court applied the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancements to the Olivers\u2019 offense levels. On appeal, the Olivers argue that the district court lacked jurisdiction to resentence them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-17\">We review <em>de novo </em>questions concerning the jurisdiction of the district court. <em>See e.g., United States v. Perez, </em>956 F.2d 1098, 1101 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-18\">Upon review of the relevant caselaw, and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-19\">Appellants\u2019 arguments are foreclosed by this Court\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. Mixon, </em>115 F.3d 900 (11th Cir.1997). In <em>Mixon, </em>115 F.3d at 901-02, as here, the defendant received a longer guideline sentence at resentencing, after his firearm conviction was vacated pursuant to <em>Bailey. </em>This Court held that, \u201cbased on the broad language of \u00a7 2255 and the interdependence of the multiple counts for sentencing purposes,\u201d a district court had jurisdiction to recalculate a defendant\u2019s entire sentence and that such resentencing did not defeat the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy rights nor expectations of finality. <em>Mixon, </em>115 F.3d at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-20\">This Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Rosen, </em>764 F.2d 763 (11th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 1061, 106 S.Ct. 806, 88 L.Ed.2d 781 (1986), is not in opposition to its decision in <em>Mixon. Rosen </em>was a pre-guide-lines case and the language cited by the Olivers was dicta. <em>See United States v. White, </em>980 F.2d 1400, 1401 n. 2 (11th Cir.l993)(rejecting otherwise precedential authority because the issue was considered in dicta in a pre-guidelines case); <em>see also Rosen, </em>764 F.2d at 763-66. Because it was a pre-guidelines case, the <em>Rosen </em>Court could not have considered the unique relationship between 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). Because the district court had jurisdiction to resentence the Olivers on their unchallenged counts following their successful collateral attacks on their convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
