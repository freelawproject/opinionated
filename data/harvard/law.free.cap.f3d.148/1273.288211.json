Fossett, </em>881 F.2d 976, 979 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-15\">We have reviewed the transcripts, the pre-sentence investigation report, the judgment and commitment order, and all other relevant portions of the record. Those, together with the briefs of the parties, demonstrate that the sentencing judge was aware of his authority to depart in light of <em>United States v. Lipman, </em>133 F.3d 726 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-17\">While it is possible to determine from this record that the district court was aware of its authority, it would facilitate review if sentencing judges would state on the record that they believe they have or do not have the authority to depart.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
