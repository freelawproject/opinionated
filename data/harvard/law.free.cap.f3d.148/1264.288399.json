Kent, <em>pro se, </em>appeals the dismissal of his petition for mandamus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-16\">On appeal, Kent essentially argues that the district court should have granted his petition for mandamus and ordered the Secretary of Labor to comply with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 503(b)(1) by conducting an investigation of the Georgia Department of Labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-17\">Whether a district court has subject-matter jurisdiction over an action is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Tamiami Partners, Ltd. v. Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, </em>999 F.2d 503, 506 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-18\">Upon review of the petition, the Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss, and the district court\u2019s order, and consideration of parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-19\">The language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 503(b)(1), which is the statute upon which Kent relies, shows that the district court did not have jurisdiction to grant his petition for mandamus. This statute provides that whenever the Secretary finds, after a hearing, that the state agency has effected \u201ca denial, in a substantial number of cases, of unemployment compensation to individuals entitled thereto,\u201d by a state agency, the Secretary \u201cshall notify such State agency that further payments will not be made to the State until the [Secretary] is satisfied that there is no longer any such denial of failure to comply.\u201d 42 U.S.C. <em>\u00a7 </em>503(b)(1). Thus, the Secretary\u2019s decision whether to invoke this statute is discretionary. Moreover, the statute authorizes the Secretary to act on behalf of all those who were denied unemployment compensation, and not individuals who were denied such benefits. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1313-20\">We conclude that because mandamus was not an appropriate means of relief here, the district court lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
