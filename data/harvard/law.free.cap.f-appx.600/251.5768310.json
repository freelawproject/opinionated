Sharbutt challenged the enhancement to his sentence pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act, following his conviction of being a felon in possession of a firearm. The district court denied relief, concluding that such allegations should be presented in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and that Sharbutt had not established that he was entitled to proceed under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e), which allows a federal prisoner to challenge his conviction under \u00a7 2241 if the remedies provided under \u00a7 2255 are \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-21\">A petitioner seeking to establish that his \u00a7 2255 remedy was inadequate or ineffective must make a claim (i) \u201cbased on 'a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and that (ii) \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-22\">Because Sharbutt essentially claims that he is innocent of his sentence under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>the Armed Career Criminal Act, rather than his offense of conviction, he has failed to make the showing required by <em>Reyes-Requena. </em>Sharbutt\u2019s contention that <em>Persaud v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1023, 188 L.Ed.2d 117 (2014), stands for the proposition that sentencing enhancements based on ineligible prior convictions are errors amenable to \u00a7 2241 relief is unavailing as <em>Persaud </em>is not a substantive decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b279-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
