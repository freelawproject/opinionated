Her claims were first denied in August 2008, then again by the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) in January 2010 following an administrative hearing the previous November. After Davis\u2019s request for appellate review was denied in September 2011, completing the administrative process, she filed the instant suit in the district court to appeal the Commissioner\u2019s disposition of her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-21\">Davis\u2019s action was referred to a Magistrate Judge who painstakingly reviewed the medical and legal history of Davis\u2019s claims, carefully analyzed the facts and the law, then submitted a 19-page Report and Recommendation in July 2013, which concluded: \u201cSubstantial evidence of record and relevant legal precedent support the ALJ\u2019s decision that plaintiff was not disabled\u201d and recommended that the decision of the ALJ be affirmed and Davis\u2019s action be dismissed with prejudice. Just over a year later the district court ordered the final decision of the Commissioner affirmed and the case dismissed with prejudice for the reasons assigned by the Magistrate Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-22\">The recommendation of the Magistrate Judge and the district court\u2019s adoption of the reasons assigned in the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendations turn largely on the standard of review dictated by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), which provides that review of the Commissioner\u2019s ultimate decision turns on whether it is supported by substantial evidence and is free of legal error. \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is that which is relevant and which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. It is more than a mere scintilla and less than a preponderance. The district court determined that the Magistrate Judge\u2019s analysis and conclusion are supported by substantial evidence and free of legal error.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>The summary of Davis\u2019s argument in her appellate brief takes up some four and a half pages to make the single point of which Appellant complains, <em>viz, </em>that the ALJ committed reversible error by \u201ccutting off\u2019 Davis\u2019s non-attorney representative\u2019s cross-examination of vocational experts for the Commissioner, blocking the representative\u2019s reference to Davis\u2019s \u201cmental impairment caused limitations\u201d in terms of \u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201cmarked\u201d and forbidding the use of those terms in questioning the vocational expert. This, according to Davis, violated due process and is the basis for reversing and remanding for additional administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Like the ALJ and the district court before us, we see that assignment of error as another example of Justice Holmes\u2019s reed too slender to support reversing the ALJ under the extremely deferential standard of review noted above. Agreeing with the Magistrate Judge that substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s determination, and perceiving no abuse of due process in the ALJ\u2019s limitation of cross-examination by Davis\u2019s representative, we affirm the Judgment of the district court that affirmed the Commissioner and dismissed Davis\u2019s action with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b277-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
