He contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court sentenced him to 46 months of imprisonment, which corresponded to the bottom of his advisory guidelines range, and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">The substantive reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Because Ramirez-Garcia\u2019s sentence is within his advisory guidelines range, his sentence is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Ramirez-Garcia wishes to preserve for further review the argument that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply to within-guidelines sentences calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 because \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis. As conceded by him, such an argument is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>660 F.3d 231, 232-33 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">Ramirez-Garcia argues that his sentence is greater than necessary because \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks empirical support and effectively double counts a defendant\u2019s criminal history through enhancements, such as his 16-level drug-trafficking enhancement, that are based on prior convictions. He further contends that his sentence overstates the seriousness of his instant illegal reentry offense and fails to account for the fact that this offense was his first illegal reentry into the United States; he had a limited criminal history; he had a history of agricultural work and reentered the United States to earn more money to assist his ailing mother; and his 46-month sentence is substantially longer than the sentence he received for his prior drug-trafficking conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-14\">We have rejected the argument that a sentence based on \u00a7 2L1.2 is substantively unreasonable because \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks empirical support or effectively double counts a defendant\u2019s criminal history. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). Ramirez-Garcia\u2019s remaining arguments concerning the \u00a7 3553(a) factors do not rebut the presumption of reasonableness applicable to his sentence. <em>See Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 565-66; <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008). The district court listened to his arguments for a lesser sentence but found that a 46-month sentence was appropriate. \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Ramirez-Garcia has not shown that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b322-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
