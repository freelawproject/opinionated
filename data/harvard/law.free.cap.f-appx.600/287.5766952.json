On the third day of trial, after the prosecutor cross-examined Alvarez, the district court granted defendants\u2019 request for a mistrial. In granting the mistrial, the district court cited instances where it believed the prosecutor tried to circumvent the court\u2019s order that the prosecutor not delve into matters of immigration status. Thereafter, Gutierrez and Alvarez filed a joint motion to dismiss, arguing that the prosecutor had provoked a mistrial in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. The district court denied the motion to dismiss, finding that the prosecutor did not intend to provoke a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">This court reviews the denial of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds de 'novo, and accepts as true the district court\u2019s underlying factual findings unless clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Dugue, </em>690 F.Sd 636, 637-38 (5th Cir.2012). A defendant generally waives double jeopardy protection by consenting to a mistrial. <em>United States v. Botella, </em>991 F.2d 189, 192 (5th Cir.1993). Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has recognized a narrow exception to this general rule; a defendant who was goaded into seeking a mistrial may invoke double jeopardy protections to avoid a retrial. <em>.See Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. 667, 676, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982). Although the prosecutor in this case acted improperly, prosecutorial misconduct alone \u2014 even harassment or overreaching \u2014 is not enough for a retrial to result in a double jeopardy violation. <em>Id. </em>at 675-76, 102 S.Ct. 2083. Gross negligence by the prosecutor, or even intentional conduct that seriously prejudices the defendant, is insufficient by itself to apply the double jeopardy bar. <em>United States v. Wharton, </em>320 F.3d 526, 531-32 (5th Cir.2003). Instead, there must be intent on the part of the prosecutor to subvert the protections afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. at 676, 102 S.Ct. 2083. Under this narrow standard, the court must examine the \u201cobjective facts and circumstances\u201d to determine the prosecutor\u2019s intent. <em>Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. at 675, 102 S.Ct. 2083.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-14\">Considering the facts and circumstances of the instant case, the district court\u2019s finding that the prosecutor did not intend to provoke a mistrial in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause was not clearly erroneous. In the face of the district court\u2019s factual finding that the prosecutor\u2019s improper actions were not intended to cause a mistrial, Gutierrez and Alvarez are unable to cite to any concrete evidence, beyond mere speculation, of the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cclear intent\u201d to provoke a mistrial. <em>See Dugue, </em>690 F.3d at 638. Moreover, the prosecutor in this case vigorously op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>posed a mistrial when the defendants requested it, which militates against a finding that the prosecutor intended to cause a mistrial. <em>See Wharton, </em>320 F.3d at 532. Finally, the manner in which the prosecutor tried to elicit information about Alvarez\u2019s immigration status suggests the he did not intend to provoke a mistrial. \u201cHad the prosecutor actually intended to provoke a mistrial, he could have violated the court\u2019s limitation by expressly [asking Alvarez about his immigration status]. But he did not do so.\u201d <em>See United States v. Singleterry, </em>683 F.2d 122, 125 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">In view of the foregoing, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in. 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
