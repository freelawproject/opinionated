He contends that the 24-month within-guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). According to Gardu-\u00f1o-Castillo, the guidelines range was too high to fulfill \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s goals because U.S. Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based and effectively double counts a criminal record. He also urges that the - guidelines range overstated the seriousness of his non-violent reentry offense and failed to account for his personal history and characteristics. He specifically cites his arrival in the United States at the age of 19, the 17 years he spent working for the same landscaping company, his close relationship with his wife and four children, who are United States citizens and live in Illinois, and his desire to reunite with and support them.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">We consider \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). When, as here, the district court imposes a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range, we \u201cgive great deference to that sentence and will infer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines in light of the sentencing considerations set out in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cA discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b967-15\">In reliance on <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 109-10, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and for purposes of preserving the issue for possible further review, Gardu\u00f1o-Castillo argues that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply because \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis. As Gardu\u00f1o-Castillo concedes, his argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir. 2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009). We have also rejected arguments th^t double-counting necessarily renders a sentence unreasonable, <em>see Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31, and that the Guidelines overstate the seriousness of illegal reentry because it is only a non-violent international-trespass offense, <em>see United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-17\">The district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and Garduno-Castillo\u2019s arguments for leniency and concluded that a sentence within the guidelines range was sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to satisfy the goals in \u00a7 3553(a). Gardu-no-Castillo\u2019s assertions that \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>of an empirical basis, the double-counting, the non-violent nature of his offense, his employment history, his close ties to his wife and children, and his motive for reentering justified a lower sentence are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir. 2008). Therefore, he has failed to show that the within-guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b967-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
