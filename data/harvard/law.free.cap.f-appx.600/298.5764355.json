He named as defendants Collin County Detention Facility, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Baten Intermediate Sanction Facility, Fort Worth Transitional Centers, and Tarrant County Jail. The district court dismissed a portion of Howell\u2019s complaint pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. The district court dismissed the remaining portion of Howell\u2019s complaint due to his failure to timely effect service of process under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(m). The district court also denied as futile Howell\u2019s motions to amend his complaint. Howell timely appealed the district court\u2019s order dismissing his \u00a7 1983 complaint and denying his motions to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Although Howell arguably identifies his \u00a7 1983 claims before this court, he fails to challenge the district court\u2019s reasons for granting the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss his \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Nor does he address or otherwise challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to timely effect service of process, or the district court\u2019s denial of his motions to amend. When an appellant fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, it is the same as if the appellant had not appealed that issue. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Howell has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that his \u00a7 1983 action should be dismissed for failure to state a claim, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and for failure to timely effect service of process. See <em>Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. Additionally, Howell\u2019s motions to amend his complaint on appeal and his motion to amend the amount of relief are DENIED as unnecessary. His motion for oral argument is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-5\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
