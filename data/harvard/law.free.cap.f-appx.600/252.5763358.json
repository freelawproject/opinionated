Previously, this court upheld the denial of employer-paid attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 928(a) or (b). <em>See Simmons v. Dir., OWCP, U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>509 Fed.Appx. 337 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-24\">Albe\u2019s new claim stems from his contention that in addition to an approved fee contract with his client Simmons, he had a lien on the compensation benefits, and the employer became obliged to deduct fees from its payments to Simmons (who unfortunately died before Albe could pursue payment from him). The Benefits Review Board rejected Albe\u2019s new claim in a succinct and clear opinion, which points out that Albe did not fulfill his duty to have the district director and administrative law judge \u201cfix in the award approving the fee, such lien and <em>manner of payment.\u201d </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 928(c) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>This court reviews Benefits Review Board decisions for substantial evidence and errors of law. <em>Conoco, Inc. v. Dir., OWCP, U.S. Dep't of Labor, </em>194 F.3d 684, 687 (5th Cir.1999). Albe does not challenge the Benefits Review Board\u2019s recitation of the facts, and we find no error of law in its interpretation of Albe\u2019s duty to perfect, or have \u201cfixed\u201d a lien against the employer\u2019s payment of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The petition for review of the judgment of the Benefits Review Board is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b280-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
