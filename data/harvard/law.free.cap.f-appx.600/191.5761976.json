(\u201cBarrett Daffin\u201d), a non-diverse defendant. Second, Trang asserts that because another defendant, Taylor Bean &amp; Whitaker (\u201cTBW\u201d), never appeared in the case, the district court should have entered a default judgment against it. We reject both assertions, however, because Trang failed to state a claim against either defendant. We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">In 2008, Dung Que Trang obtained a loan from TBW to purchase property in Pflugerville, Texas. The Deed of Trust executed to secure the loan named Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (\u201cMERS\u201d) as beneficiary and nominee for TBW, and gave MERS the \u201cright to exercise any or all of those interests [granted by Borrower] including, but not limited to, the right to foreclose and sell the Property and to take any action required of Lender.\u201d TBW declared bankruptcy in 2009, and, in the course of its bankruptcy proceedings, rejected its executory contracts. In 2011, MERS assigned the Deed of Trust to U.S. Bank. Trang later defaulted, prompting U.S. Bank, along with its counsel Barrett Daffin, to initiate foreclosure proceedings on the property. Trang then sued U.S. Bank, Barrett Daffin, and TBW in state court, alleging a host of state-law claims founded on' the notion that, because of TBW\u2019s bankruptcy, MERS\u2019s assignment of the Deed of Trust to U.S. Bank was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Asserting diversity jurisdiction, U.S. Bank removed the suit to the district court. Trang moved to remand, arguing that Barrett Daffin was, like Trang, a Texas citizen, and so its presence in the suit precluded the district court from exercising diversity jurisdiction. The district court denied Trang\u2019s motion, however, on the ground that Barrett Daffin had been improperly joined. It then granted mo-, tions to dismiss filed by U.S. Bank and Barrett Daffin. Trang filed a motion for default judgment against TBW, who had not appeared in the suit. The district court denied this motion and entered a final judgment against Trang.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">On appeal, Trang challenges (1) the district court\u2019s denial of her motion to remand; and (2) the district court\u2019s denial of her motion for default judgment against TBW. We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to remand de novo, <em>Clayton v. ConocoPhillips Co., </em>722 F.3d 279, 290 (5th Cir.2013), and its denial of a motion for default judgment for abuse of discretion. <em>Lewis v. Lynn, </em>236 F.3d 766, <em>767 (5th </em>Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">We consider first the district court\u2019s denial of Trang\u2019s motion to remand. When federal jurisdiction is based on diversity, a motion to remand should be granted if any \u201cproperly joined\u201d defendant resides in the same state as the plaintiff. <em>B., Inc. v. Miller Brewing Co., </em>663 F.2d 545, 550 (5th Cir.1981); <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. A non-diverse defendant is improperly joined if \u201cthere is no reasonable basis for the district court to predict that the plaintiff might be able to recover against\u201d that defendant. <em>Smallwood v. Ill. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number><em>Cent. R.R. Co., </em>385 F.3d 568, 573 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc). To determine whether there is a reasonable basis to predict that the plaintiff- might be able to recover against a non-diverse defendant, \u201c[t]he court may conduct a Rule 12(b)(6)-type analysis, looking initially at the allegations of the complaint to determine whether the complaint states a claim under state law against\u201d the non-diverse defendant. <em>Id. </em>Here, Trang seeks recovery against the non-diverse defendant, Barrett Daffin, under \u00a7 12.002 of the Texas Civil Practices and Remedies Code. Thus, the critical question is whether Trang\u2019s allegations \u201ccontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief \u201d under \u00a7 12.002 \u201c \u2018that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Carp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2006)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">They do not. The elements of a claim under \u00a7 12.002(a) are that the defendant (1) made, presented, or used a document with knowledge that it was a \u201cfraudulent lien or claim against real or personal property or an interest in real or personal property,\u201d (2) intended that the document be given legal effect, and (3) intended to cause the plaintiff physical injury, financial injury, or mental anguish.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-7\"><em>Henning v. OneWest Bank FSB, </em>405 S.W.3d 950, 964 (Tex.App.2013) (quoting Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code \u00a7 12.002(a)). Trang\u2019s allegations are insufficient as to the third element. Trang alleges no facts tending to show that Barrett Daffin acted with intent to cause her \u201cfinancial injury\u201d or \u201cmental anguish,\u201d rather than just \u201cfor business purposes.\u201d <em>See Golden v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>557 Fed.Appx. 323, 327 (5th Cir.2014). The allegation that might be construed as touching on \u00a7 12.002\u2019s intent element is that \u201cthe transactions by the Defendants Jointly and severally were designed to defraud the Plaintiff out of her property.\u201d But this allegation is, at most, a legal conclusion that Barrett Daffin acted with the requisite intent; it lacks any \u201cfactual content\u201d that would \u201callow[ ] the court to draw the reasonable inference\u201d that the intent element was met. <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937. The district court therefore held correctly that Barrett Daf-fin was improperly joined and that Trang\u2019s motion to remand should be denied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">We turn next to the district court\u2019s denial of Trang\u2019s motion for default judgment against ,TBW. Generally, a defendant\u2019s failure to appear is grounds for a default judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(a). But a plaintiff \u201cis not entitled to a default judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>ment as a matter of right, even where the defendant is technically in default.\u201d <em>Ganther v. Ingle, </em>75 F.3d 207, 212 (5th Cir. 1996). Instead, \u201c[t]here must be a sufficient basis in the pleadings for the judgment entered.\u201d <em>Nishimatsu Constr. Co. v. Hous. Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>515 F.2d 1200, 1206 (5th Cir.1975). Thus, TBW\u2019s failure to appear should have resulted in a default judgment against it only if Trang\u2019s factual allegations, taken as true, state a claim against TBW. <em>See Lewis, </em>286 F.3d at 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Trang fails to state a claim against TBW. Trang\u2019s claims against TBW hinge on her allegation that the Deed of Trust is an executory contract that was rejected in TBW\u2019s bankruptcy, <em>see </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365, and thus that MERS lacked authority to assign it. But even making the highly contestable assumption that the Deed of Trust was \u201cexecutory\u201d under the Bankruptcy Code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Trang mistakes the nature of rejection. Rejection of an executory contract \u201crelates only to those aspects of the contract[ ] which remain unfulfilled\u201d as of the bankruptcy filing, <em>Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Old Republic Nat\u2019l Title Ins. Co., </em>83 F.3d 735, 741 (5th Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted); it \u201cdoes not invalidate the contract, or treat the contract as if it did not exist.\u201d <em>In re Continental Airlines, </em>981 F.2d 1450, 1459 (5th Cir.1993). MERS obtained its right to assign the Deed of Trust when the Deed of Trust was executed, in 2008. That right was independent of any unfulfilled obligations on the part of TBW. It therefore was not \u201cundo[ne] or revers[ed]\u201d by TBW\u2019s rejection of its executory contracts in bankruptcy. <em>Stewart Title, </em>83 F.3d at 742 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Khan v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>CIVIL ACTION NO. H-12-1116, 2014 WL 200492, at *8, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6559, at *24 (S.D.Tex. Jan. 17, 2014) (\u201cRejection of executory contracts means that the debtor ... need not continue to perform under the contract, but does not impact prior completed acts under the contract.\u201d); <em>In re Marron, </em>485 B.R. 485, 488-89 (D.Mass.2012) (\u201cA lender\u2019s bankruptcy does not affect the ability of MERS to assign a mortgage.\u201d). Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Trang\u2019s motion for default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">For these reasons, the district court\u2019s denials of Trang\u2019s motions to remand and for default judgment are</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b219-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-6\">. The defendants urge several alternative grounds on which we might affirm the district court's denial of Trang\u2019s motion to remand, including that an assignment of a lien is not a \"lien or claim\u201d that can support liability under \u00a7 12.002(a). Courts have split on this issue of statutory interpretation. Some appear to agree with the defendants. <em>See, e.g., Bond v. Barrett Daffin Frappier Turner &amp; Engel, L.L.P., </em>C.A. NO. G-12-188, 2013 WL 1619691, at *11-12, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 55924, at *34-35 (S.D.Tex. Mar. 22, 2013); <em>Perdomo v. Fed. Nat'l Mortg. Ass\u2019n, </em>Civil Action No. 3:1 1-cv-734-M, 2013 WL 1123629, at *11-12, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37139, at *17-19 (N.D.Tex. Mar. 18, 2013); <em>Marsh v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., </em>888 F.Supp.2d 805, 812-14 (W.D.Tex.2012). Others-including one Texas appellate court \u2014 appear to go the other way. <em>See, e.g., Bernard v. Bank of Am., N.A., </em>No. 04-12-00088-CV, 2013 WL 441749, at *4-5, 2013 Tex.App. LEXIS 1045, at *11-13 (Tex.App. Feb. 6, 2013); <em>Kingman Holdings, LLC v. Citimortgage, Inc., </em>CASE NO. 4:10-CV-619, 2011 WL 1883829, at *5-6, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52770, at *13-14 (E.D.Tex. Apr. 21, 2011). We affirm on the ground stated in the text, and so we do not weigh in on this split of authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b222-5\">. The district court rested its denial of Trang's motion on the ground that the Deed of Trust was <em>not </em>executory. Because we hold that Trang does not state a claim against TBW even if the Deed of Trust is executory, we need not reach this question.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
