Lee first argues that there w\u00e1s no factual basis for his guilty plea on the conspiracy count because he lacked the intent to destroy the evidence so it could not be used in an \u201cofficial proceeding,\u201d where that term is defined under the statute as a federal proceeding. Lee then argues that the district court should have found that the Texas offense of delivery of a controlled substance, Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \u00a7 481.112, is no longer divisible in light of <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 138 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013). As Lee concedes he did not raise either objection in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">As to Lee\u2019s first argument, the factual basis he agreed to at his plea hearing alleged facts that satisfied the statutory requirements, including that Lee conspired with others to destroy videotape evidence in order to make it unavailable in his federal proceeding. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(c)(1). As Lee acknowledges, the factual basis was sufficient on its face. Although he contends that subsequent information casts doubt on whether he could have foreseen the federal proceeding, given the record as a whole, including his sworn statement under oath, any error there may have been was not clear or obvious. <em>See United States v. Alvarado-Casas, </em>715 F.3d 945, 952 (5th Cir.2013). Further, Lee does not argue that his substantial rights were affected or that this court should exercise its discretion to correct the error because the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. Thus, he has effectively abandoned any such arguments. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>620 F.3d 483, 496 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Green, </em>964 F.2d 365, 371 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">We have previously rejected Lee\u2019s contention that the Texas drug statute is not divisible in light of <em>Descamps. See United States v. Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d 453, 459 (5th Cir.2014), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Dec. 15, 2014) (No. 147593). Lee cites no case to the contrary and has not demonstrated error, plain or otherwise. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b282-34\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
