(CEC); CiviGen-ics, Inc.; and unknown \u201cJohn Doe\u201d defendants. In his second amended complaint, he alleged that unknown guards at Bowie County Jail used unreasonable and excessive force against him. He further contended that he sought medical treatment from injuries sustained from the alleged use of force, but received treatment only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>after an unreasonable delay, resulting in severe physical and mental pain. The district court, after briefing by the parties, dismissed Mathews\u2019s claims against Bowie County, Sheriff Prince, CEC, and CiviGen-ics pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. The district court permitted the claims against the unknown \u201cJohn Doe\u201d defendants to proceed. Mathews now appeals from the dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 and state law claims against the named defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">We review de novo a dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). <em>Bass v. Stryker Corp., </em>669 F.Sd 501, 506 (5th Cir.2012). \u201cTo survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must plead \u2018enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litigation, </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). A dismissal for failure to state a claim will be affirmed \u201cif, taking the plaintiffs allegations as true, it appears that no relief could be granted based on the plaintiffs alleged facts.\u201d <em>Samford v. Dretke, </em>562 F.3d 674, 678 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">A governmental entity or municipality may be held liable under \u00a7 1983 only if official policy or custom caused the deprivation of a constitutional right. <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. of City of New York, </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). The plaintiff must prove that the policy or custom in question was adopted with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d and that there was \u201ca direct causal link between the municipal action and the deprivation of federal rights.\u201d <em>In re Foust, </em>310 F.3d 849, 862 (5th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, the plaintiff must prove (1) the existence of a policymaker; (2) the existence of a policy or custom; and (3) a violation of his constitutional rights that resulted from the policy or custom. <em>Hampton Co. Nat\u2019l Surety, LLC v. Tunica Cnty., </em>543 F.3d 221, 227 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">Mathews failed to state a claim under \u00a7 1983 against any of the named defendants. His second amended complaint did not allege that the custom or policy in question was adopted with deliberate indifference. Rather, a plain reading of his complaint reflects that his allegations of deliberate indifference are confined only to the actions of the unknown correctional officers. Thus, the district court properly dismissed his \u00a7 1983 claim against the named defendants. <em>In re Foust, </em>310 F.3d at 862. Furthermore, we have consistently held, as is the case here, that \u201c[ajllega-tions of an isolated incident are not sufficient to show the existence of a custom or policy.\u201d <em>Fraire v. City of Arlington, </em>957 F.2d 1268, 1278 (5th Cir.1992). In addition, to the extent that Mathews even attempts to allege a custom or policy, his conclusory allegations that his treatment violated the Texas Administrative Code are insufficient to establish \u00a7 1983 liability. <em>See Brown v. Texas A &amp; M University, </em>804 F.2d 327, 335 (5th Cir.1986). \u201cSuch action may constitute a breach of contract or violation of state law, but unless the conduct trespasses on federal constitutional safeguards, there is no constitutional deprivation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, as to the dismissed state law claims of assault and battery, Mathews does not address this issue on appeal, and it is therefore abandoned. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>964 F.2d 365, 371 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">Mathews also argues on appeal that the district court erred by denying him leave to file a third amended complaint. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend a pleading for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Riascos, </em>76 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>F.3d 93, 94 (5th Cir.1996). The district court based its denial on a several factors, including the futility of the proposed amendments, undue delay, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, and undue prejudice. Having reviewed the pleadings, we conclude that the district court acted within its discretion, as the proposed amendments were futile. <em>See Martin\u2019s Herend Imports, Inc. v. Diamond &amp; Gem Trading United States of America Co., </em>195 F.3d 765, 771 (5th Cir.1999). Furthermore, the trial court properly considered other relevant factors, such as the \u201cunexplained delay\u201d in adding additional claims. and the fact that the circumstances underlying the amended complaint were known to Mathews when the original complaint was filed. <em>See In re Southmark Corp., </em>88 F.3d 311, 316 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b961-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
