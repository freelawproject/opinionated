Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c) and Federal Rule of Civil Proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>dure 73, the parties agreed a magistrate judge would conduct the entire proceeding. Moore appeals the dismissal of the case for failure to comply with discovery orders and the imposition of monetary sanctions. We lack jurisdiction to address these issues because Moore\u2019s appeal is untimely. We affirm the district court\u2019s reduction of the sanctions award to a judgment against Moore.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">This case stems from Moore\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action alleging that Columbus wrongfully detained and prosecuted him after a kidnapping complainant recanted her story. Thirty days before the discovery deadline, Columbus notified Moore\u2019s counsel that it wanted to depose Moore. Moore\u2019s counsel did not respond. After making two additional unanswered requests, Columbus unilaterally noticed Moore\u2019s counsel that a deposition would take place in a week\u2019s time. Two days before the scheduled deposition, Moore\u2019s counsel informed Columbus that she and her client would not be present. She did not, however, move to quash the notice of deposition or file for a protective order. When Moore failed to appear, Columbus moved to impose sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Finding Moore\u2019s explanations for his failure to appear at the deposition insufficient, the magistrate judge awarded attorney\u2019s fees to cover the costs Columbus incurred in attending the deposition and ordered Moore to make himself available for a deposition by April 19, 2013. After Moore failed to do so, the court granted Columbus\u2019s motion to dismiss with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">Following dismissal, Columbus submitted an affidavit in support of its request for $688 in attorney\u2019s fees. The court granted the request for fees and ordered Moore and his counsel to pay that sum. After Moore and his counsel failed to comply with two court-imposed payment deadlines, the magistrate judge granted a third extension on the condition that a $50 per diem penalty would be assessed for every day the attorney\u2019s fees remained unpaid following the new deadline. After this third deadline passed without payment and the per diem penalty had accrued for several months, the court granted Columbus\u2019s motion to reduce the sanctions award to a judgment of $8,338. Moore now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b231-15\">Moore challenges four orders: (1) the imposition of sanctions; (2) the dismissal of his claim with prejudice; (3) the assessment of a per diem fine for failing to pay the sanctions by the deadline; and (4) reducing the sanctions to a judgment against him. We lack jurisdiction to address the first three issues and dismiss accordingly. As the magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion in reducing the sanctions to a judgment against Moore, we affirm as to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-16\">Courts of appeals \u201chave jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In a civil case, a party has thirty days to appeal a final judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cThe timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> No equitable exceptions apply.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moore filed his appeal on March 19, 2014. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>magistrate judge\u2019s April 11, 2013 order assessing attorney\u2019s fees, the May 7, 2013 dismissal with prejudice, and the September 20, 2013 order imposing a per diem late-payment penalty were not timely appealed. Moore argues we can nevertheless exercise jurisdiction under: (1) the collateral order doctrine; (2) the doctrine of pendent appellate jurisdiction; and (3) 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The collateral order doctrine allows a party to appeal a non-dispositive decision that is conclusive, resolves an important question separate from the merits, and is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a judgment in the underlying action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The order dismissing with prejudice was a final judgment on the merits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It directly disposed of Moore\u2019s case on the merits, and thus it was not \u201cseparate from\u201d the merits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The collateral order doctrine does not apply. Accordingly, as Moore failed to appeal within thirty days, we lack jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">A pre-judgment order awarding attorney\u2019s fees must generally be appealed after a final judgment has been entered in the underlying action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While such orders are generally unrelated to the merits of underlying actions,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> they are also typically reviewable alongside the merits on appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The sanctions order would have been reviewable on timely appeal from a judgment on the merits. Accordingly, Moore had until thirty days after the dismissal of his case to appeal the April 11 order imposing attorney\u2019s fees. As he failed to appeal during this timeframe, we lack jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-13\">A post-judgment order awarding attorney\u2019s fees or sanctions must be appealed within thirty days after the entry of such order.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moore failed to appeal the September 20 order imposing sanctions within thirty days of its entry. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-14\">Section 1292(b) allows a district court judge to certify an interlocutory order for appeal under certain circumstances.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The judge did not certify any question for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-15\">We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s first three orders and dismiss this appeal as to those orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-16\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b232-17\">Moore timely appealed the magistrate judge\u2019s March 6, 2014 order convert<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>ing the sanctions into a judgment against Moore. In that order, the judge found: (1)Moore and his attorney repeatedly failed to pay the sanctions imposed by the established deadlines; (2) the court repeatedly extended those deadlines to accommodate them; (3) neither Moore nor his counsel has made payments; and (4) Moore owes a total of $8,338, notwithstanding a clerical' error in the text of the order. None of these findings are clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion in reducing the sanctions to a judgment against Moore.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we DISMISS this appeal in part and otherwise AFFIRM the judgment of the district court..</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b230-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
