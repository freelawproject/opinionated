Futch, </em>99 Fed.Appx. 880 (11th Cir.2004) (Table), we affirmed appellant John Randall Futch\u2019s conviction in November 2002 on a plea of guilty to an information charging him with conspiring to possess with intent to distribute, and to distribute, cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In April 2005, Futch moved the District Court to vacate his conviction and sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The court denied the motion to the extent that it sought the vacation of his conviction but granted the motion as to his sentence; it vacated his prison sentence of 240 months and resentenced him to a term of 215 months. Futch appealed the new sentence and simultaneously sought a certif\u00ed-cate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to appeal the denial of \u00a7 2255 relief as to his conviction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>We affirmed his sentence, but denied a COA to appeal his conviction. <em>United States v. Futch, </em>518 F.3d 887, 890 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">On March 10, 2014, Futch moved the District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7\u00a7 2255(f)(3) and (4) and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 60(b) for relief from his November 2002 conviction. Citing <em>Ka-ley v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1090, 188 L.Ed.2d 46 (2014), Futch argued that the Government lacked probable cause to seize $ 19,000 from his bank account; therefore, his original indictment in <em>United States v. Futch </em>and subsequent conviction for violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 were invalid. The Clerk of the District Court erroneously recorded the motion as having been filed in an <em>in rem </em>forfeiture action, <em>United States v. United States Currency Totaling $18,997.89, </em>brought by the Government to obtain forfeiture of the seized money. Futch ultimately prevailed in that action, and the District Court had closed case.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">The Government, in its response to Futch\u2019s March 10, 2014, motion, requested that the District Court treat the motion has having been filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and deny it on the ground that the motion was successive and that Futch had not obtained leave of the Court of Appeals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h) to file it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court denied Futch\u2019s motion, and he lodged this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">We treat Futch\u2019s motion as an effort to obtain the vacation of his 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 conviction and thus a motion under \u00a7 2255.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A prisoner standing in Futch\u2019s shoes, who previously sought habeas relief, must file a motion in this court seeking an order authorizing the district court to consider his successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3). This requirement trumps a prisoner\u2019s ability to file a Rule 60(b) motion to reopen his case. <em>Gonzalez v. Secretary of Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>366 F.3d 1253, 1270-71 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). Since Futch failed to obtain leave of this court to file his Rule 60(b) motion for relief from his \u00a7 846 conviction, the District Court lacked authority to entertain the motion and thus properly dismissed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-16\">. As we subsequently noted in <em>United States v. Futch, </em>518 F.3d 887, 890 (11th Cir.2008), Futch unsuccessfully appealed the District Court's denial of his motion to withdraw his plea of guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b751-20\">. To avoid having to seek such leave in the Court of Appeals, Futch requested the District Court to treat his motion as part of the \u00a7 2255 motion he had filed earlier, in April 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b751-21\">. We view a motion filed under Fed.R. Crim.P. 60(b) as a habeas corpus application if, as in the instant situation, it \"attacks the federal court\u2019s previous resolution of a claim <em>on the merits,\" </em>and is not deemed a habeas corpus application if it \"attacks, not the substance of the federal court's resolution of a claim on the merits, but some defect in the integrity of the federal <em>habeas </em>proceedings.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 532, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 2648, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
