Gonzalez argues that Officer Jordan acted with deliberate indifference to his safety because she \u201crushed\u201d him while escorting him to a hearing, despite the fact that his hands were cuffed behind his back and his legs were shackled. Gonzalez points out that Jordan failed to comply with prison procedures for escorting restrained prisoners and maintains that she confessed to \u201crushing\u201d him by admitting that she had told him to \u201cslow down.\u201d In addition, Gonzalez asserts that Jordan\u2019s failure to avert injury constitutes a due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Although Jordan\u2019s conduct could be categorized as negligent, the complaint and Gonzalez\u2019s more definite statement failed to allege that Jordan was aware of any facts from which an excessive risk of harm could be drawn or that she actually drew such an inference. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 889, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Gonzalez\u2019s conelu-sional allegations are insufficient to establish deliberate indifference. <em>See Oliver v. Scott, </em>276 F.3d 736, 741 (5th Cir.2002). Jordan\u2019s failure to comply with prison procedures, without more, does not constitute evidence of a constitutional violation. <em>See Hernandez v. Estelle, </em>788 F.2d 1154, 1158 (5th Cir.1986). Additionally, Gonzalez has not established that Jordan\u2019s actions rose to the level of an \u201catypical and significant hardship ... in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life,\u201d as is required to show a due process violation. <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Because Gonzalez\u2019s claims lacked an arguable basis in law and failed to state a facially plausible claim for relief, the district court did not err in dismissing his civil rights complaint. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009); <em>Samford v. Dretke, </em>562 F.3d 674, 678 (5th Cir.2009). Consequently, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Gonzalez\u2019s complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim counts as a strike pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Gonzalez is warned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b288-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
