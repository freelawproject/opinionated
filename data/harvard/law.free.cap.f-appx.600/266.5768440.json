Rodriguez-Salazar, 768 </em>F.3d 437, 437-38 (5th Cir.2014), and <em>United States v. Morales-Mota, </em>704 F.3d 410, 412 (5th Cir. 2013). In <em>Rodriguez-Salazar, </em>we rejected the argument that the Texas offense of theft is broader than the generic, contemporary definition of theft because the Texas offense, which includes theft by deception, may be committed by taking property with the owner\u2019s consent. <em>Rodriguez-Salazar, </em>768 F.3d at 437-38. In <em>Morales-Mota, </em>we rejected the argument that the Texas offense of \u201cburglary of a habitation\u201d is broader than the generic, contemporary definition of \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) because it defines the \u201cowner\u201d of a habitation as a person with a \u201cgreater right to possession of the property than the actor.\u201d <em>Morales-Mota, </em>704 F.3d at 412. Accordingly, the unopposed motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, the alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b295-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
