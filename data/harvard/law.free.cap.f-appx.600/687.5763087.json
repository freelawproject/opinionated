United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2225, 180 L.Ed.2d 114 (2011). He also asserts that the district court erred in denying his motion to take judicial notice of <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, 138 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013). After a thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-15\">The procedural history of this case, which spans over twenty-five years, may be briefly summarized as follows: In 1988, Reed was convicted, after a jury trial, of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of a mixture containing cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846; and possession with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of a substance containing cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a). He was sentenced to a total term of 420 months\u2019 imprisonment. In 1997, Reed filed a motion to vacate his sentence, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, alleging various sentencing errors, numerous instances of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel, and the denial of his right to be represented at trial by counsel of his choice. The district court denied his \u00a7 2255 motion and we affirmed. <em>See Reed v. United States, </em>273 F.3d 1119 (11th Cir.2001) (table).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-19\">In June 2012, Reed filed the instant \u00a7 2241 petition, arguing that he is actually innocent of violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and that his life sentence exceeds the 20-year statutory maximum authorized by Congress for a violation of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). In support of his argument, Reed highlighted that in <em>DePierre, </em>the Supreme Court ruled that the term \u201ccocaine base\u201d- in \u00a7 841 (b)(1)(A)(iii) is not synonymous with crack cocaine. Reed maintained that his \u00a7 2241 petition satisfied the requirements of the savings clause because his claim had been previously foreclosed by this court\u2019s th\u00e9n-existing case law. <em>See United States v. Munoz-Realpe, </em>21 F.3d 375, 377-79 (11th Cir.1994) (holding that the definition of \u201ccocaine base\u201d does not include all forms of \u201ccocaine base,\u201d but, rather, is limited to crack cocaine).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-20\">The magistrate judge recommended the dismissal of Reed\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>of jurisdiction because Reed had failed to establish the necessary conditions to satisfy the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 -2255(e), so that his claims might be considered in a \u00a7 2241 petition. Overruling Reed\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and dismissed his \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Reed next filed an unsuccessful motion for reconsideration, pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 59(e). He also moved for the district court to take judicial notice of <em>Al-leyne, </em>which the court also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">On appeal, Reed argues that his claim satisfies the requirements of the savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, he highlights that based on the Supreme Court\u2019s narrow interpretation of \u201ccocaine base\u201d in <em>DePierre, </em>he stands convicted of an offense involving a \u201cnon-existent substance\u201d because his indictment misrepresented the nature of his charges by stating that \u201ccocaine base\u201d was commonly known as crack cocaine. As such, he argues that he is actually innocent of violating \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) because his jury did not find the type and quantity of controlled substances in his offense conduct. Reed also asserts that the district court erred by denying his request to take judicial notice of <em>Alleyne.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">\u201cWhether a prisoner may bring a [] \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) is a question of law we review <em>de novo.\u201d Williams v. Warden, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1337 (11th Cir.2013), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 52, 190 L.Ed.2d 29 (2014). Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). Challenges to the execution of a sentence, rather than the validity of the sentence itself, are properly brought under \u00a7 2241. <em>Antonelli v. Warden, U.S.P. Atlanta, </em>542 F.3d 1348, 1352 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-14\">The \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255(e), however, permits a federal prisoner, under very limited circumstances, to file a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241. <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. Under the savings clause, a court may entertain a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided for under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). The applicability of \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause is a threshold issue, which imposes a subject-matter jurisdictional limit on \u00a7 2241 petitions. <em>See Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1337-38. Accordingly, before we may reach the substantive claims raised by Reed, we must determine whether the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) permits him to seek relief through a \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-15\">The restriction against second and successive \u00a7 2255 motions, standing alone, cannot render \u00a7 2255\u2019s remedy inadequate or ineffective under the savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e). <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1308 (11th Cir.2011) <em>(en banc). </em>Rather, we have explained that a petitioner can use the savings clause to \u201copen the portal\u201d to \u00a7 2241 only where he shows that: (1) throughout his sentencing, direct appeal, and original \u00a7 2255 proceeding, his claim was squarely foreclosed by our binding precedent; (2) his current claim is based on a Supreme Court decision that overturned the precedent that had fore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>closed his claim; (3) that Supreme Court decision is retroactively applicable on collateral review; (4) as a result of the application of the new rule, his sentences exceed the applicable statutory maximum penalties; and (5) the savings clause reaches his pure-Begay<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> error claim of illegal detention above the statutory maximum penalty. <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1262, 1274 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Here, the district court did not err in dismissing Reed\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. The claim that Reed raises in his petition addresses the legality of his sentence, not the execution of his sentence, and, therefore, it was within the scope of \u00a7 2255, not \u00a7 2241. <em>See Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. Because Reed already filed a \u00a7 2255 motion that was denied, he was not permitted to circumvent the statutory restriction on successive \u00a7 2255 motions by filing a petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Gilbert, </em>640 F.3d at 1308. In order to proceed under \u00a7 2241, Reed needed to show that \u00a7 2255 was \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to challenge the legality of his detention. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Reed\u2019s reliance on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>DePierre </em>to argue that \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate and ineffective\u201d to challenge the legality of his detention is unavailing. Contrary to Reed\u2019s contentions, <em>DePierre </em>did not narrow the interpretation of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii) and hold that \u201ccocaine base\u201d can never be \u201ccrack cocaine,\u201d but instead held that \u201ccocaine base\u201d includes not only \u201ccrack cocaine,\u201d but all cocaine in its chemically basic form. <em>See DePierri, </em>564 U.S. at-, 131 S.Ct. at 2237. Thus, <em>DePierre </em>did not decriminalize Reed\u2019s conduct, nor indicate that he was convicted of a non-existent offense. In any event, <em>DePierre </em>did not overturn a circuit precedent that squarely resolved his claim so that Reed had no genuine opportunity to raise it at trial, on appeal, or in his first \u00a7 2255 motion, as it merely involved the interpretation of a substantive criminal statute. See <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1262, 1274; <em>see also DePierre, </em>564 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2237.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-14\">Next, to the extent Reed is making a claim based on the reasoning in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), his argument is without merit. Reed asserts that he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d of the sentence enhancement in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), because his jury did not find the type and quantity of controlled substances in his offense. To make this argument, he relies on <em>Alleyne, </em>570 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. at 2155 (applying rule in <em>Apprendi </em>and holding \u201cany fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury\u201d). The problem for Reed is that we recently held that the decision in <em>AUeyne </em>does not apply retroactively on collateral review. <em>See Jeanty v. Warden, FCI-Miami, </em>757 F.3d 1283, 1285 (11th Cir.2014). Consequently, Reed, whose convictions became final long before <em>AUeyne </em>was decided, cannot now collaterally challenge his convictions based on his jury\u2019s failure to specify the nature and quantity of cocaine base. Thus, the district court did not err in denying Reed\u2019s motion to take judicial notice of <em>AUeyne.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>In sum, Reed has not satisfied the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause requirements and we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b716-16\">. Following the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion, Reed filed numerous post-conviction motions, all of which were unsuccessful.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b717-11\">. In construing Reed\u2019s arguments, we have accorded him the usual \"less stringent\u201d standard applied to <em>pro se </em>pleadings, liberally construing his arguments. <em>Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"pAPY\">. <em>Begay v.

But Reed fails to demonstrate how the holding in <em>McQuiggin </em>is applicable to his \u00a7 2241 petition as he has made no showing that he is actually innocent of his offense conduct. <em>See McQuiggin, </em>569 U.S. at -, -, -, 133 S.Ct. at 1928, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>1931, 1934-35 (addressing whether actual innocence, if proved, may provide an equitable exception to the statute of limitations applicable to a state prisoner\u2019s initial 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
