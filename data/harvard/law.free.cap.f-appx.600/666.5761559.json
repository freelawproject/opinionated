On appeal, Anderson argues that the district court erred in classifying him as an armed career criminal and applying the fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). He argues that his prior convictions for \u201csimple\u201d fleeing and eluding under Florida Statutes \u00a7 316.1935(1) and (2) do not qualify as violent felonies under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. However, because this Court\u2019s binding precedent forecloses Anderson\u2019s argument, we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-16\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a particular prior conviction qualifies as a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA. <em>United States v. Petite, </em>703 F.3d 1290, 1292 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 182, 187 L.Ed.2d 124 (2013). The ACCA mandates a fifteen-year minimum sentence for defendants who violate \u00a7 922(g) and have three previous convictions for \u201cviolent felon[ies] ... committed on occasions different from one another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). The ACCA defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d as \u201cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that ... is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-19\">The ACCA\u2019s inclusion of convictions for crimes that \u201cotherwise involve[] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d is known as the statute\u2019s \u201cresidual clause.\u201d <em>Id.; see Petite, </em>703 F.3d at 1293. The Supreme Court requires courts to use a \u201ccategorical approach\u201d and a \u201ccomparative inquiry\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>determine whether a crime qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. <em>Petite, </em>70B at 1294.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-4\">Using the categorical approach, the central inquiry is whether the offense presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another comparable to the risk posed by the ACCA\u2019s enumerated crimes.... [A] crime involves the requisite risk when the risk posed by [the crime in question] is comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-5\"><em>Id. </em>(second alteration in original) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Prior to his \u00a7 922(g) offense, Anderson had been convicted of fleeing and eluding under Florida Statutes \u00a7 316.1935(1) in 2009 and fleeing and eluding the police with lights and sirens under \u00a7 316.1935(2) in 2010 and 2011. The district court found these three prior convictions to be offenses \u201cinvolvpng] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause and, accordingly, applied the fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence. Anderson argues on appeal that the district court erred in doing so because his convictions for \u201csimple\u201d fleeing and eluding do not qualify as violent felonies for ACCA purposes. As Anderson recognizes, however, such an argument is foreclosed by this Court\u2019s binding precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">In <em>United States v. Petite, </em>we expressly held that \u201cFlorida\u2019s offense of simple vehicle flight from a flashing patrol car [in violation of \u00a7 316.1935(2) ] presents a serious potential risk of physical injury comparable to the ACCA\u2019s enumerated crimes of burglary and arson\u201d and thus qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. 703 F.3d at 1301. This court recently reaffirmed that holding in <em>United States v. Smith, </em>742 F.3d 949 (11th Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g denied en banc, </em>772 F.3d 680 (11th Cir.2014). Then, in <em>United States v. Travis, </em>747 F.3d 1312, 1317 (11th Cir.2014), we concluded that an offense for vehicle flight under subsection (1) of \u00a7 316.1935 also qualifies as a crime of violence under the sentencing guidelines, a holding that equally applies to the ACCA \u201cviolent felony\u201d analysis, <em>see Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1306 n. 16 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc) (stating that because the term \u201cviolent felony\u201d as used in the ACCA \u201cis virtually identical to crime of violence in [U.S.S.G.] \u00a7 4B1.1, ... decisions about one apply to the other\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">Anderson argues that our decisions in <em>Petite </em>and <em>Travis </em>\u201coverstepped the bounds of Supreme Court and [Eleventh] Circuit precedent.\u201d He argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011), which we found in <em>Petite </em>abrogated our previous holding in <em>United States v. Harrison </em>that \u00a7 316.1935(2) was not a violent felony for ACCA purposes, left open the question of whether \u201csimple\u201d fleeing and eluding qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">In <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>this Court held that the offense of simple vehicle flight in violation of Florida Statutes \u00a7 316.1935(2) was not a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA. 558 F.3d 1280, 1296 (11th Cir.2009), <em>abrogated by Sykes v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011). Section 316.1935(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-15\">Any person who willfully flees or attempts to elude a law enforcement officer in an authorized law enforcement patrol vehicle, with agency insignia and other jurisdictional markings prominently displayed on the vehicle, with siren and lights activated commits a felony of the third degree....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(2). We reasoned that Florida\u2019s simple vehicle flight offense, as ordinarily committed, was not \u201croughly similar\u201d to the ACCA\u2019s enumerated offenses in \u201cdegree of risk posed\u201d and thus did not fall within ACCA\u2019s residual clause. <em>Harrison, </em>558 F.3d at 1294. In determining whether the offense was similar in kind, we used the \u201cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive\u201d test articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). <em>Harrison, </em>558 F.3d at 1295. We also acknowledged that, by holding that fleeing and eluding a police officer in a motor vehicle was not a violent felony, we were joining a circuit split and were \u201cat odds with all but one other circuit that ha[d] addressed this issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1296-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Then, in <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court held that an Indiana vehicle flight statute constituted a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. 564 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2277. The Indiana statute made it a felony to knowingly or intentionally use a vehicle to \u201cfleet ] from a law enforcement officer after the officer has, by visible or audible means, identified himself and ordered the person to stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2271. The Supreme Court reasoned that the \u201c[r]isk of violence is inherent to vehicle flight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2274. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-12\">When a perpetrator defies a law enforcement command by fleeing in a car, the determination to elude capture makes a lack of concern for the safety of property and persons of pedestrians and other drivers an inherent part of the offense. Even if the criminal attempting to elude capture drives without going at full speed or going the wrong way, he creates the possibility that police will, in a legitimate and lawful manner, exceed or almost match his speed or use force to bring him within their custody. A perpetrator\u2019s indifference to these collateral consequences has violent \u2014 even lethal \u2014 potential for others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-14\"><em>Id. </em>at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2273. The Court also concluded that the \u201cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive\u201d formulation taken from Begay was limited to strict liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes. <em>Id. </em>at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2275-76; <em>see also United States v. Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d 971, 979 (11th Cir.2012) (stating that <em>Sykes </em>made it clear that <em>Begay\u2019s </em>\u201cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive\u201d test does not apply to offenses that are not strict liability, negligence, or recklessness crimes). Thus, the Supreme Court held that because the inherent risk of violence created by fleeing and eluding the police is similar to the risk involved in arson and burglary and in-, volves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to others, it qualifies as a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA. <em>Sykes, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. at 2273-75, 2277.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-20\">Accordingly, we held in <em>Petite </em>that <em>Sykes </em>undermined our prior decision v in <em>Harrison </em>to the point of abrogation. 703 F.3d at 1299. And because we found that \u201cthere [was] little meaningful distinction for ACCA purposes between Florida\u2019s simple vehicle flight statute and the Indiana statute of conviction at issue in <em>Sykes,\u201d id. </em>at 1300, we also held that \u00a7 316.1935(2) qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-21\">In the face of the Supreme Court\u2019s detailed analysis in <em>Sykes </em>regarding the substantial risks that inhere in <em>any </em>confrontational act of intentional vehicle flight, we similarly conclude that Florida\u2019s offense of simple vehicle flight from a flashing patrol car presents a serious potential risk of physical injury compa-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>rabie to the ACCA\u2019s enumerated crimes of burglary and arson.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">A little over a year later, in <em>United States v. Travis, </em>we once again relied on <em>Sylces </em>in holding that \u00a7 316.1935(1) also qualifies as a crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines and therefore also constitutes a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 747 F.3d at 1317. Section 316.1935(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">It is unlawful for the operator of any vehicle, having knowledge that he or she has been ordered to stop such vehicle by a duly authorized law enforcement officer, willfully to refuse or fail to stop the vehicle in compliance with such order or, having stopped in knowing compliance with such order, willfully to flee in an attempt to elude the officer, and a person who violates this subsection commits a felony of the third degree....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(1). Noting that <em>Sykes </em>\u201cmade clear that vehicle flight is an inherently risky enterprise, even when it does not involve high speeds or other reckless conduct, because it can end in a violent confrontation between the offender and the police,\u201d 747 F.3d at 1316, we concluded in <em>Travis:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-8\">That \u00a7 316.1935(1), unlike \u00a7 316.1935(2), does not require that the offender flee from a marked patrol vehicle with its sirens and lights activated does not meaningfully distinguish this case from either <em>Petite </em>or <em>Sykes. </em>Our decision in <em>Petite </em>did not focus on the statutory requirement that the police officer have his sirens and lights activated, but instead, on \u201cthe dangers created by the law enforcement response that <em>any </em>act of intentional flight provokes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 1317.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">Because this Court has expressly held that both subsection (1) and subsection (2) of Florida\u2019s \u00a7 316.1935 constitute violent felonies for purposes of the ACCA,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the district court did not err in finding that Anderson\u2019s prior convictions under that statute qualified as violent felonies under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause and in applying the fifteen-year mandatory minimum.
