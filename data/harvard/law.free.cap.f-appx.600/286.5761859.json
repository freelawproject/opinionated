As discussed below, because Romero-Molina has not shown that the district court plainly erred in imposing the sentencing enhancement, we need not address whether he knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal. <em>See United States v. Siros, </em>469 Fed.Appx. 373, 374 (5th Cir.2012) (per curiam) (citing <em>United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 230-31 (5th Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">According to Romero-Molina, the district court plainly erred in imposing a 16-level sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on his prior conviction for assault with a dangerous weapon under District of Columbia Code \u00a7 22-402. He maintains that his prior conviction does not meet the generic definition of aggravated assault because the statute does not require an assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">As Romero-Molina concedes, review is limited to plain error because he did not object to the enhancement in the district court. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Carrillo, </em>749 F.3d 376, 378 (5th Cir.2014) (per curiam). To show plain error, he must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affected his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes this showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The district court did not plainly err in imposing the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) sentencing enhancement. We have not addressed whether a conviction for assault with a dangerous weapon under D.C.Code \u00a7 22-402 is a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) in a published opinion. In an unpublished opinion, we held that the district court did not err in imposing a erime-of-violence enhancement for a District of Columbia conviction for assault with a dangerous weapon because \u201cthe generic contemporary meaning of aggravated assault does not require that the defendant have caused or intended to cause bodily injury.\u201d <em>United States v. Pereira-Carballo, </em>230 Fed.Appx. 460, 461 (5th Cir.2007) (per curiam). To rise to the level of plain error, a \u201clegal error must be clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable debate.\u201d <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>564 F.3d 370, 377-78 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because of the lack of published authority addressing this issue, Romero-Molina has not shown that the district court plainly erred in imposing the \u00a7 2L1.2 sentencing enhancement. <em>See id.; see also United States v. Trejo, </em>610 F.3d 308, 319 (5th Cir.2010) (holding that a claim that is \u201cnovel\u201d and \u201cnot entirely clear under the existing case authority\u201d is \u201cdoom[ed] ... for plain error\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b314-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
