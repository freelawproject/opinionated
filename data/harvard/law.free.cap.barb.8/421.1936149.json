The action was trespass, for entering a church and breaking down the seats, &amp;c. &lt;fcc. The judgment roll contained the complaint, in which the demand for relief was as follows: \u201c And the said plaintiffs say that by reason of the premises they have sustained damages to the amount of one hundred dollars, for which amount they demand judgment against the defendants, besides costs.\u201d It next contained an afiidavit of the service of the summons, also an affidavit that 20 days had elapsed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>no answer, &amp;c. had been received. Then followed the entry of judgment at a special term of this court, thus: (Title of the cause, &amp;c.) \u201cJudgment $114,72. Oct. 5th, 1848. It appearing that the summons in this action, with the affidavit required by law accompanying the same, was duly and personally served on the defendants Abram Wood and Thomas Wiles, on the said Wood on the 16th and on the said Wiles on the 26th of August, 1848, and that no answer thereto has been served on said attorney of the plaintiffs, now on motion of Hiram Riggs, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney; it is adjudged by the court that the said judgment in the said summons mentioned, to the amount aforesaid of one hundred dollars, with interest from the 5th day of October, 1848, together with fourteen dollars and seventy-two cents costs of the plaintiff in this action be enforced against the said defendants Abram Wood and Thomas Wiles in favor of the said\u201d plaintiffs, \u201c and that the said\u201d plaintiffs \u201c have execution thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b422-5\"><em>H. </em>Riggs, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b422-6\"><em>T.

In this class of actions, if the taking of an account, .or the proof of any fact, was necessary to enable the court to give judgment, &amp;c. the court, instead of taking the account or hearing the proofs, could have ordered a reference. And where the action was for the recovery of money only, the court, if the plaintiff required it, ordered the damages to be assessed by a jury, &amp;c. <em>(Code of </em>1848, \u00a7 202.)</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">It is evident that no judgment by default in an action for a trespass, could have been taken without proof. An assessment was necessary. In this case the order for judgment recites the proof of service and of default to answer, and then, upon motion of the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, it was adjudged that the judgment mentioned in the summons, to the amount of the sum therein claimed, should be enforced against the defendants with inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>est. It can not be presumed that there was any inquisition or assessment taken of the damages, either by the court or by a reference or jury. This was erroneous, and the judgment must be reversed; and the cause sent back to be properly disposed of at a special term. I think the court has power to do this within the spirit of section 330 of the present code. As this is not a ease of partial affirmance, or ordering a new trial, the appellants must have costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
