Appellant brought an action against appellee before a justice and recovered a judgment for $143, from which defendant appealed to the Circuit Court. In that court on January 11, 1905, at the January term, the following judgment was entered :</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-12\" pgmap=\"586\">\u201cThis cause being called for trial and the defendant failing to prosecute its appeal in this behalf, on motion of plaintiff\u2019s attorney it is ordered that said appeal be and the same is hereby dismissed at defendant\u2019s costs for want of prosecution and that a procedendo do issue herein that the plaintiff do have and recover of and from the defendant his costs and charges in this behalf expended and have execution therefor. \u2019 \u2019</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-13\" pgmap=\"586(10) 587(49)\">No motion was made at the January term by the defendant to set aside said judgment, but March 11th, at the February term, the following order was made in the case: \u201cThis day comes the defendant and enters herein its motion to set aside the order of dismissal and judgment heretofore entered herein, which motion is hereby continued.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-5\" pgmap=\"587\">March 18th, also at the February term, an order was made, continuing said motion, \u201cto the March term next ensuing.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-6\" pgmap=\"587\">March 21st, at the March term, the following order was entered in the case:</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-7\" pgmap=\"587\">1 \u00a3 This cause coming on to be heard upon the defendant\u2019s motion heretofore entered herein to set aside the order of dismissal and judgment heretofore entered herein after arguments of counsel and due deliberation by the court, said motion is sustained. It is therefore ordered that the order of dismissal and judgment heretofore on February 11, 1905, entered herein be and the same is hereby set aside and vacated. \u2019 \u2019</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-8\" pgmap=\"587\">May 14th, the case was set for trial on motion of plaintiff and notice to the defendant.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-9\" pgmap=\"587\">May 11th, the case was reached for trial, and the plaintiff f\u00e1iling to prosecute his suit, a judgment was entered that the suit be dismissed at plaintiff\u2019s costs, and from that judgment the plaintiff prosecutes this appeal.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-10\" pgmap=\"587\">The plaintiff took a bill of exceptions at the March term and another at the May term.</p><attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b587-11\" pgmap=\"587\">Hoyee, O\u2019Coeeob &amp; Hoyes, for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b587-12\" pgmap=\"587\">Kickham Scaelae, for appellee.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b587-13\" pgmap=\"587\">Mr. Justice Baker</author> <p id=\"A_rM\" pgmap=\"587\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b587-14\" pgmap=\"587(49) 588(10)\">One of the contentions of appellee is, that the call of February 11th, was not a \u201ctrial call,\u201d but a \u201cpreliminary call,\u201d and that a rule of the Circuit Courts provides that when an appeal is dismissed on a \u201cpreliminary call,\u201d \u201cthe appeal will be dismissed with leave to reinstate within thirty days for good cause shown.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b588-5\" pgmap=\"588\">, The judgment of dismissal, entered February 11th, begins with the recital: \u201cthis cause being called for trial,\u201d and the judgment of dismissal is absolute.</p> <p id=\"b588-6\" pgmap=\"588\">The published call of February 11th is not made a part of the affidavits filed in support of the motion to set aside the order of dismissal, nor is it stated, either expressly or by implication, in said affidavits, that the call of-that day was a \u201cpreliminary\u201d and not a \u201ctrial \u2018call.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b588-7\" pgmap=\"588\">Upon this record the judgment of dismissal must be held to have been entered when the case was called for trial, and the rule as to dismissal of appeals on a preliminary call not applicable.</p> <p id=\"b588-8\" pgmap=\"588\">The contention of appellee that the plaintiff by giving notice and having the case set for trial May 14th, waived the right to question the jurisdiction of the court to enter the order and judgment of March 21st, vacating the judgment \u00f3f dismissal, cannot be sustained. The plaintiff took his bill of exceptions upon the said order, but the order was not appealable and could not be reviewed until a final judgment was entered in the cause, and in order to have such judgment entered it was necessary to have the case set for trial. The plaintiff took no part in the trial, but refused to go to trial, upon the ground that the court had no jurisdiction of the case and the court then, on motion of the defendant, dismissed the suit for want of prosecution.</p> <p id=\"b588-9\" pgmap=\"588\">The record presents the question whether the Circuit Court, at the March term, had jurisdiction to set aside the judgment dismissing the appeal entered at the January term. It appears from the bill of exceptions taken May 17th, that there is a rule of the Circuit Court containing the following provision:</p> <p id=\"b588-10\" pgmap=\"588(32) 589(23)\">\u201cThe clerk of the court will each year make up a general calendar of all law cases pending prior to July 1st of each year in the order of their term numbers. Copies of such calendars shall be printed and ready for distribution on or before the third Monday of August of each year.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b589-4\" pgmap=\"589\">It appears from the affidavits filed in support of the motion to vacate the judgment of February 11th, that the printed trial calendar issued by the clerk of the Circuit Court, of cases pending July 1, 1904, contains no case with the title, \u201cJacob Aaron v. Jefferson Ice Company,\u201d but contains a case with the title \u201cJacob Aaron v. Anderson I. Co.;\u201d that in the copy of said calendar kept by the clerk the word \u201cJefferson\u201d was written over the word \u201cAnderson,\u201d and the memorandum of the order dismissing the appeal was entered in said calendar in said case; that defendant\u2019s attorneys who had charge of said case did not know until after said judgment of dismissal was entered, that the entry therein of: \u201cAaron v. Anderson I. Co.\u201d was a mistake, or that it was intended for the case of \u201cAaron v. Jefferson Ice Co.;\u201d that he watched the call of said calendar for the case of Aaron v. Jefferson Ice Co. and that the defendant had valid defense to said suit upon the merits.</p> <p id=\"b589-5\" pgmap=\"589\">- A rule of court required the clerk to make and print said calendar for distribution. Such a rule has the force of law. Lancaster v. W. &amp; S. W. R. R. Co., 132 Ill. 492.</p> <p id=\"b589-6\" pgmap=\"589(131) 590(16)\">Section 14 of the Practice Act requires the clerk to furnish to the judge and bar a copy of his docket containing a list of all pending cases. We think that the calendar in question, made and printed by the clerk for distribution, in accordance with said rule of court, must be regarded as a calendar or docket which the law required the clerk to make and print for distribution, and that the defendant and its attorneys had a right to rely upon such printed calendar. When the clerk discovered an error in such printed calendar he should have applied to the court, upon notice to the parties in the case is which such error was, for leave to correct the error, in place of making the correction without leave of court or notice to the parties and then calling the calendar as corrected.</p> <p id=\"b590-5\" pgmap=\"590\">In Pisa v. Rezek, 206 Ill. 344, it was said that: \u20186 The motion substituted by the statute for the writ of error coram nobis may be invoked to correct an error in fact that came within the scope of the writ at common law as that * * * a valid defense existed in fact but which without negligence of the defendant was not made either through duress, fraud or excusable mistake without negligence on the part of the party who by the motion complained of the action of the court.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b590-7\" pgmap=\"590\">We had occasion in Domitski v. American Linseed Co., 117 Ill. App. 292-296, to examine the authorities upon the question as to what errors of the clerk would authorize the court to set aside a judgment at a subsequent term, and need not here repeat what was said in that case.</p> <p id=\"b590-8\" pgmap=\"590(216) 591(22)\">The Circuit Court was, we think, from the facts above stated and. from all the evidence before it, warranted in finding that the failure of the attorneys of the defendant to be present at the call of the calendar on February 11th and thereby prevent the dismissal of defendant\u2019s appeal, was not caused by, nor was it the the result of any default or negligence on the part of the defendant or its attorneys, but was caused by and was the result of the fault and misprision of the clerk of the court in failing to include in the printed calendar, printed for and distributed by him, of cases pending in said court July 1, 1904, said case under its proper title, and in altering, without notice to the defendant or leave of court, said calendar by changing the title of the case appearing therein as \u201cAaron v. Anderson I. Co.\u201d to \u201cAaros v. Jefferson I. Co.,\u201d and calling said case for trial from said calendar under its title as so altered and changed, and that the defendant had a valid defense to the suit. And we are further of opinion that the Circuit Court did not err in holding \u2022 that the facts thus found disclosed such an error in fact as authorized that court, at the March term, to vacate and recall the judgment of dismissal entered at the February term.</p> <p id=\"b591-4\" pgmap=\"591\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment of the Circuit Court will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b591-5\" pgmap=\"591\">Affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
