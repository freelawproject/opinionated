For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition for review and summarily affirm the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-25\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b872-26\">Petitioner Arino Massie is a native and citizen of Indonesia. He entered the United States in July 2001 on a business visitor\u2019s visa, remained illegally after the visa expired, and was served with a notice to appear in April 2003. He conceded remov-ability and applied for asylum, withholding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), claiming persecution in Indonesia because he is an ethnic Chinese Christian. In a July 2006 hearing, the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied Massie\u2019s applications.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Massie then appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA. In support, Massie submitted two 2006 reports concerning country conditions in Indonesia that he had not previously presented to the IJ. Massie argued that the documents showed changed country conditions and a pattern or practice of violence against Christians in Indonesia. For example, Massie cited a passage stating that \u201c[t]he Government [of Indonesia] at times has tolerated the abuse of freedom of religion.... \u201d A.R. 028. The BIA treated Massie\u2019s new evidence as a motion to remand. In a decision dated January 31, 2008, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of Massie\u2019s applications. It also denied the motion to remand because the evidence did not show changed circumstances or a pattern or practice of persecution of ethnic Chinese Christians in Indonesia. Massie did not petition this Court for review of the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">On March 8, 2008, Massie moved the BIA to reopen his case based on a claim that Indonesia was experiencing renewed violence against Christians. In support, Massie proffered a 2006 Department of State International Religious Freedom Report, which stated that \u201cthe government [of Indonesia] tolerated the abuse of religious freedom by private groups or failed to punish perpetrators.\u201d <em>See </em>A.R. 008. According to Massie\u2019s motion, the Report was released in December 2006, after Mas-sie submitted his appeal brief and motion for remand to the BIA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">In a May 28, 2008, decision, the BIA found that Massie\u2019s evidence was \u201csimilar to or of the same character\u201d as the evidence previously presented to the BIA in support of his motion to remand. The BIA held that this evidence did not warrant reopening and did not demonstrate a pattern or practice of persecution of ethnic Chinese Christians in Indonesia. The BIA therefore denied Massie\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">Massie, through counsel, now petitions this Court for review of the BIA\u2019s May 28, 2008, decision denying his motion to reopen. He has also moved for a stay of removal. The Government opposes the stay and has moved for summary action.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">Only the BIA\u2019s decision denying Mas-sie\u2019s motion to reopen is properly before the Court at this time. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Guo v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 556, 562 (3d Cir.2004); <em>Lu v. Ashcroft, </em>259 F.3d 127, 131 (3d Cir.2001). The BIA\u2019s decision will be upheld unless it was \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Tipu v. INS, </em>20 F.3d 580, 582 (3d Cir.1994). We will take summary action to dispose of a case when \u201cno substantial question is presented.\u201d 3d Cir. LAR 27.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-13\">The BIA correctly held that reopening was not warranted because Massie\u2019s evidence was \u201csimilar to\u201d the evidence previously presented in support of his motion for remand and therefore was not suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>ciently new to warrant reopening. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(B) [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(B)] (requiring proof of \u201cnew facts\u201d for reopening). Indeed, the 2006 International Religious Freedom Report that Massie previously submitted to the BIA in support of his motion for remand includes language nearly <em>identical </em>to that which Massie contends is the \u201cnew evidence\u201d supporting his motion to reopen.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, Massie\u2019s claim that the evidence in support of his motion to reopen was not previously available to him is dubious. The report in question was issued in December 2006. Yet Massie filed his appeal brief with the BIA on May 11, 2007, and it included as evidence a 2006 State Department Report issued on March 6, 2007. <em>See </em>A.R. 018, 026. Thus, it appears that the information Massie presents was available to him when he last appeared before the BIA. Thus, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that this does not warrant reopening. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">Because this appeal does not raise a substantial question, we will grant the Government\u2019s motion for summary action and deny the petition for review. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. We will deny Massie\u2019s motion for stay of removal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b873-7\">. The IJ held that Massie's asylum application was untimely because he did not file within one year of his arrival and did not present extraordinary circumstances excusing the delay. A.R. 089-90, 95. The IJ denied withholding of removal and protection under the CAT because Massie failed to present sufficient evidence demonstrating he would more likely than not suffer persecution or torture if returned to Indonesia. A.R. 095-97.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b874-8\">. According to the report previously submitted in support of remand, \u201c[t]he Government sometimes tolerated discrimination against and the abuse of religious groups by private actors, and often failed to punish perpetrators.\u201d A.R. 055. This is nearly identical to the \"new developments\u201d Massie cites in his motion to reopen: \"the government tolerated the abuse of religious freedom by private groups or failed to punish perpetrators.\u201d A.R. 008.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
