He brought a Title VII action alleging that he was terminated on account of his national origin and race. He appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Coast. We review the district court\u2019s order de novo and view the evidence in the light most favorable to Magsanoc. <em>See Olsen v. Idaho State Bd. of Med., </em>363 F.3d 916, 922 (9th Cir.2004). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-16\">In evaluating a discrimination claim under Title VII, we apply the three-part burden-shifting analysis of <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>See Coghlan v. Am. Seafoods Co. LLC, </em>413 F.3d 1090, 1093-94 (9th Cir.2005). Magsa-noc established a <em>prima facie </em>case for racial discrimination, and Coast met its burden of offering a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Magsanoc\u2019s termination. To avoid summary judgment, <em>Magsanoc </em>must demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Coast\u2019s proffered explanation is pretextual. <em>Cotton v. City of Alameda, </em>812 F.2d 1245, 1248 (9th Cir.1987). Magsanoc fails to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-17\">Hunter\u2019s \u201cwhite people\u201d comment and \u201cjoke\u201d about shooting black people, while racist and insensitive, are \u201cstray remarks\u201d \u201cnot tied directly to [Magsanoc\u2019s] termination\u201d and are insufficient to create a triable issue of fact. <em>Nesbit v. Pepsico, Inc., </em>994 F.2d 703, 705 (9th Cir.1993). Neither remark was directed towards, or made with respect to, Magsanoc or any other Coast employee. Nor is it clear when the statements were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>There is nothing in the record to suggest that Hunter\u2019s English-only policy was adopted to discriminate against foreign nationals, or that it was enforced selectively against Magsanoc. It is, at best, weak circumstantial evidence of pretext. <em>See Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., </em>150 F.3d 1217, 1222 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Finally, the record belies Magsanoc\u2019s assertion that Coast lied in answering interrogatories, as Coast filed an amended response correcting its earlier mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b481-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
