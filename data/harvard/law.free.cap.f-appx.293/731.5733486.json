On appeal, Marion argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion because it based its decision on his criminal history, a factor that the court had already considered in imposing his original sentence. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-14\">We review a district court\u2019s decision not to grant a sentence reduction, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-15\">A district court is forbidden from modifying a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In such a case, a court may reduce the term of imprisonment after it considers the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) to the extent they are applicable, if the reduction is consistent with the applicable policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-17\">The policy statement applicable here provides that if a defendant\u2019s Guidelines range has \u201csubsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (c) below, the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u201d and \u201cany such reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment shall be consistent with this policy statement.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l) (Supp. May 1, 2008). Effective November 1, 2007, Amendment 706 \u2014 listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c), and thus, retroactively applicable, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 713; <em>United States v. Stratton, </em>519 F.3d 1305, 1307 (11th Cir.2008) \u2014 reduced the base offense level for offenses involving at least 20 but less than 35 grams of crack cocaine from 28 to 26. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706; <em>compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(6) (2006) <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>\u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7) (2007). In addition, the Guidelines provide,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-5\">In determining whether, and to what extent, a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement is warranted, the court shall determine the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the amendment(s) to the guidelines listed in subsection (c) had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced. In making such determination, the court shall substitute only the amendments listed in subsection (c) for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Consistent with these Guidelines provisions, we have held that before deciding whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a \u201cdistrict court must make two distinct determinations.\u201d <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998). First, the court must determine the sentence it would have imposed, given the defendant\u2019s amended guideline range and holding all other guideline findings made at the original sentencing hearing constant. <em>Id; United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). Second, the court must consider the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) and then determine, in its discretion, whether to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760; <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. l(B)G).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">\u201cAlthough the district court must undertake the two-step analysis ..., the district court is not required to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760. \u201cThe district court is not required to articulate specifically the applicability, if any, of each factor, as long as the record as a whole demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d <em>Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 762 (quotation omitted). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he court shall consider the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that may be posed by a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment in determining: (I) whether such a reduction is warranted; and (II) the extent of such reduction ...\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. l(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">We are unpersuaded by Marion\u2019s argument on appeal. As the record shows, the district court undertook <em>Vautier\u2019s </em>two-step analysis: (1) it first correctly determined that Marion\u2019s new guideline range would be 120 months after application of Amendment 706; and (2) it then properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, denying the motion based on Marion\u2019s criminal history \u2014 including convictions for drug offenses, theft offenses, and offenses involving violence \u2014 which is relevant to the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(A)-(C). <em>Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 762-63; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. l(B)(i). Indeed, the district court is specifically directed by statute and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Guidelines to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in considering whether to grant a sentence reduction \u2014 including the danger that a defendant poses to any person or the community, which is directly tied to a defendant\u2019s criminal history. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. l(B)(i), (B)(ii). These are the same factors that the court is required to consider when sentencing a defendant in the first instance. <em>See Gall v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (providing that, in sentencing a defendant, a district court must consider the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). Thus, the district court\u2019s consideration of Marion\u2019s criminal history was proper even though this was the same factor it considered at his original sentencing hearing. <em>See Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 759, 762-63 (holding that a district court properly denied a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion when the court based the denial on the very same considerations present at the defendant\u2019s original sentencing hearing). In short, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-8\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to: (A) reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense; (B) afford adequate deterrence; (C) protect the public; (D) provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (5) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (6) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (7) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(a)(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
