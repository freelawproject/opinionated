He appeals the district court\u2019s May 22, 2007 denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus and entry of judgment in favor of Respondent-Appellee Warden John Marshall.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\"><em>1. Certified Issue</em>\u2014Ineffective <em>Assistance of Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">Licon claims that his defense attorney should have called two witnesses, Arnold and Elvia Fleming, who had relevant information about his arrest. To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a habeas petitioner must demonstrate, first, that his counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and second, that he was prejudiced by this deficient performance. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-89, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Licon has met neither prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-17\">Licon\u2019s counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient. Licon\u2019s attorney personally spoke to the Flemings on at least one occasion, although it is unclear whether he spoke with them at any length. [ER 74; 88; 49 &amp; n. 9; SER 2 at 8.] Additionally, Licon has never alleged that his attorney or the defense investigator failed to interview the Flemings about any relevant information they might have. [See District Court lodgment # 13, Exh. A-7, Reporter\u2019s Transcript of Marsden Hearing (sealed), at 7-11.] The state court of appeal, sitting in habeas, found that \u201c[w]hen the prospective witnesses were interviewed ... they did not support appellant\u2019s account of events.\u201d [ER 11] Licon\u2019s attorney\u2019s decision not to use the Flemings\u2019 testimony at trial is thus distinguishable from the attorney\u2019s performance in <em>Luna v. Cambra, </em>306 F.3d 954 (9th Cir. 2002), where it was established that the defense attorney utterly \u201cfailed to contact\u201d potential alibi witnesses to assess the relevance of them information. <em>Id. </em>at 961; <em>see also Brown v. Myers, </em>137 F.3d 1154, 1156 (9th Cir.1998) (petitioner\u2019s \u201cattorney did not investigate [his] alibi claim\u201d and \u201cmade no effort to contact\u201d a potential alibi witness).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-18\">Nor did the omission of the Flemings\u2019 testimony leave Licon without any effective defense at trial. Licon\u2019s attorney re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>lied mainly upon a theory of voluntary intoxication, which he supported with the testimony of several defense and prosecution witnesses. But he also helped Licon present, as an alternative, Licon\u2019s own preferred defense theory: that he was not present at the scene of arrest all. In support of this alternative theory, Licon\u2019s counsel \u201cguided [Licon] through his own testimony\u201d [ER 54] and called a defense witness to testify in support of Licon\u2019s claim that he could not have threatened Officer Fox. [ER 54.] The omission of the Flemings\u2019 testimony, therefore, did not leave Licon without any effective defense. <em>Compare Luna, </em>306 F.3d at 961, <em>with Brown, </em>137 F.3d at 1158. While Licon disagrees with his attorney\u2019s decisions about how best to present his defense, he has not shown that his attorney\u2019s performance fell \u201cbelow an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>see also Hovey v. Ayers, </em>458 F.3d 892, 904 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Licon has also failed to show that prejudice resulted from his counsel\u2019s decision not to put the Flemings on the stand. Licon has never explained specifically what his potential witnesses would have said at trial. In his petition for a certificate of appealability from the district court, Licon adverted to a \u201csigned declaration from Elvia Fleming and of course Arnold,\u201d which he allegedly attempted to present to the state trial court during his Marsden hearing on July 26, 2001 [Dist. Ct. Dkt. # 41 at *4], but he never submitted this declaration to the state habeas court or the district court. Nor has he ever indicated with specificity what that declaration might say. Normally, a petitioner complaining of his counsel\u2019s failure to present the testimony of alibi witnesses will submit a declaration from those witnesses to show what they would have said. <em>See Dows v. Wood, </em>211 F.3d 480, 486 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Lord v. Wood, </em>184 F.3d 1083, 1092 (9th Cir.1999). Given Licon\u2019s <em>pro se </em>status before the district court, his failure to do so is not necessarily fatal to his claim. <em>See United States v. Sandoval-Lopez, </em>409 F.3d 1193, 1198 (9th Cir.2005). Yet even a <em>pro se </em>petitioner must offer <em>some </em>specific facts, rather than just eonclusory assertions, to show a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the inclusion of the omitted testimony would have made a difference at trial. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Because he failed to do so, Licon failed to establish that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s [decision], the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\"><em>%. Uncertified Issue</em>\u2014Admission <em>of Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Licon also briefed an uncertified issue in his appeal to this Court: whether the state trial court rendered his trial \u201cfundamentally unfair\u201d under <em>Payne v. Tennessee, </em>501 U.S. 808, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991), by admitting evidence of prior sexual child abuse. <em>See </em>Circuit Rule 22-l(e). We decline to certify this issue, because Licon has failed to make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">The Supreme Court has expressly declined to decide \u201cwhether a state law would violate the Due Process Clause if it permitted the use of \u2018prior crimes\u2019 evidence to show propensity to commit a charged crime.\u201d <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 75 n. 5, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991). Here, as in <em>Alberni v. McDaniel, </em>458 F.3d 860 (9th Cir.2006), \u201c[w]e cannot conclude that the [state court] acted in an objectively unreasonable manner in concluding that the propensity evidence introduced against [petitioner] did not violate due process, given that <em>Estelle </em>ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>pressly left this issue an \u2018open question.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 866. In light of the \u201c[l]ack [of] any Supreme Court authority directly on point,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 864, we cannot find that Licon has made the \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d required to warrant expanding the COA under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Licon\u2019s petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b495-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
