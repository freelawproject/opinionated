We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the ease, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-19\">Appellant argues that the district court\u2019s imposition of a within-Guidelines sentence of eighteen months was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We disagree. The District Court correctly noted during the sentencing that, under <em>U.S. v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) and <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir.2005), it must consider the Guidelines, but is not bound by them. The District Court also recognized that he was obligated to consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Appellant failed to document that her sentence proceeding was in any way procedurally flawed, nor has she demonstrated that her sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 30 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201c[W]e presume, in the absence of record evidence suggesting otherwise, that a sentencing judge has faithfully discharged her duty to consider the statutory factors.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-21\">For the foregoing reason, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
