We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a) requires that an appellant\u2019s brief contain, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ca statement of the issues presented for review,\u201d <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(5), and an argument section containing \u201cthe appellant\u2019s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies,\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9). \u201cAlthough pro se litigants are afforded some latitude in meeting the rules governing litigation, ... we need not, and normally will not, decide issues that a party fails to raise in his or her appellate brief.\u201d <em>Moates v. Barkley, </em>147 F.3d 207, 209 (2d Cir.1998) (citations omitted). Accordingly, because Sackey has presented no legal argument on appeal, and has merely submitted the entire record from the district court proceedings, her entire appeal is deemed waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-15\">To the extent Sackey has not waived all of her claims, an independent review of the record and relevant case law reveals the district court properly granted the Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-16\">Accordingly, there is no basis on which to challenge the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-17\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
