On appeal, his attorney has filed an <em>Anders</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>brief, concluding that there are no meritorious issues for appeal but asserting that Lester\u2019s classification as an armed career criminal was unconstitutional because Lester\u2019s predicate convictions were not charged in the indictment. Although informed of his right to do so, Lester has not filed a pro se supplemental brief. After a thorough review of the entire record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">As counsel notes, Lester\u2019s argument is barred by controlling circuit precedent. We have repeatedly found that the indictment need not reference or list prior convictions used as a basis for an armed career criminal sentence. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 284 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352-54 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Lester\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b221-9\"><em> Anders v.
