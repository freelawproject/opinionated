Lindao argues that his New York conviction for sexual abuse in the first degree was not a conviction for an aggravated felony or a crime of violence and that he is entitled to cancellation of removal. He asserts that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 does not deprive this court of jurisdiction over his petition for review. He additionally argues that removal statutes should be construed in favor of aliens. The government maintains that Lindao cannot raise these issues because did not raise them before the BIA and that Lindao\u2019s conviction was a conviction for an aggravated felony depriving this court of jurisdiction to consider Lindao\u2019s petition under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Lindao did not raise before the BIA any of the arguments he raises in this court. He does not argue, and has not shown, that his administrative remedies were inadequate. <em>See Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, </em>252 F.3d 383, 389 (5th Cir.2001). As Lin-dao failed to exhaust his available administrative remedies, we lack jurisdiction to consider his petition for review. <em>See Townsend v. INS, </em>799 F.2d 179, 181 (5th Cir.1986). As this case does not present exceptional circumstances, Lindao\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is denied. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b357-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
