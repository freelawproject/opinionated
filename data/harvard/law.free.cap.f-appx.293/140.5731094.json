The facts are well-known to the parties, so we will not recount them here at length. In summary, Snyder, along with her siblings Mark Snyder, Kash Snyder, and Scott Snyder shared ownership of a number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>properties located in Allegheny and Westmoreland Counties. Mortgage foreclosure actions regarding those properties commenced in July 2003 in Allegheny County and in October 2003 in West-moreland County. Snyder filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on November 17, 2003. On November 24, 2003, default judgment was entered in the mortgage foreclosure action in Allegheny County, and on December 12, 2003, default judgment was entered in the mortgage foreclosure action in Westmoreland County. Ultimately, Shanni Snyder\u2019s bankruptcy petition was dismissed in July 2004, due to her failure to file notice of a financing commitment and amended plan. The Allegheny County properties were sold at a sheriffs sale on January 14, 2005; those properties were then sold to third parties in June 2005 and September 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Meanwhile, her siblings also filed a number of their own individual bankruptcy petitions after foreclosure proceedings were initiated; none of the bankruptcy cases proceeded beyond preliminary stages. The bankruptcy filings included three petitions filed by Mark Snyder and one petition filed by Kash Snyder. Notably, in Kash Snyder\u2019s case, the Bankruptcy Court granted in rem relief from the automatic stay in January 2005 so that foreclosure on the Allegheny County properties could proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">In December 2005, Snyder filed a motion to reopen her bankruptcy petition so that she could pursue an adversary complaint to declare void the state court default judgments entered in the mortgage foreclosure actions. She argued that the judgments were void because they were obtained during the pendency of the automatic stay in her bankruptcy case. In addition to damages and other relief, she sought to have the effects of the sales reversed. After a hearing on February 15, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court granted Snyder\u2019s motion in part and denied it in part, referring to the reasoning on the record. The motion was denied regarding the attempt to pursue an adversary action, and was granted to retroactively annul the automatic stay to declare that the sheriff\u2019s sale of the Allegheny County properties was not in violation of the automatic stay.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Bankruptcy Court further noted that it would not permit Snyder to commence an adversary action as a litigation strategy, and it again closed the matter with its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">The District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision, determining that the Bankruptcy Court did not abuse its discretion in granting relief from the automatic stay and in denying reopening of the bankruptcy case for pursuing the adversary action. The District Court also denied Snyder\u2019s motion for reconsideration. This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We undertake plenary review of the District Court\u2019s decision acting as an appellate court of a bankruptcy matter. <em>In re Myers, </em>491 F.3d 120, 124 (3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Cir.2007). In reviewing the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision, we exercise the same standard of review as the District Court. <em>See id. </em>at 125. That is, we review the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo, </em>its factual findings for clear error, and its discretionary determinations for abuse of discretion. <em>See Reconstituted Comm. of Unsecured Creditors of the United Healthcare Sys., Inc. v. State of N.J. Dept. of Labor (In re United Healthcare Sys., Inc.), </em>396 F.3d 247, 249 (3d Cir.2005). As pertinent to this appeal, we review for abuse of discretion the decision to annul the automatic stay. <em>See In re Myers, </em>491 F.3d at 128.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">As noted by the appellees, the appeal centers on whether the Bankruptcy Court abused its discretion in annulling the stay. The Bankruptcy Code allows for relief from an automatic stay in a number of ways, including \u201cterminating, annulling, modifying or conditioning\u201d the stay. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d). By virtue of the term \u201cannulling\u201d being present in the statute, courts are empowered to grant retroactive relief, such as ratifying violations of the automatic stay that otherwise would be void. <em>See In re Myers, </em>491 F.3d at 127-28; <em>In re Siciliano, </em>13 F.3d 748, 750-51 (3d Cir.1994). We have observed a number of pertinent factors in determining whether the Bankruptcy Court abused its discretion in annulling a stay, including (1) whether the creditor was aware of the bankruptcy filing or encouraged violation of the stay; (2) whether the debtor is guilty of inequitable, unreasonable, or dishonest conduct; and (3) whether the creditor would suffer prejudice. <em>See In re Myers, </em>491 F.3d at 129. We also have noted that the Bankruptcy Court has a wide latitude to balance the equities when granting relief from the automatic stay. <em>See id., </em>491 F.3d at 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">Applying these factors, we cannot say that the Bankruptcy Court abused its discretion in annulling the automatic stay for the purpose of ratifying the Allegheny County sheriffs sale. Snyder waited more than ten months after the sheriffs sale to dispute the validity of the default judgments that were entered years earlier. The serial bankruptcy filings by her family members, as described earlier, suggest conduct in bad faith. Furthermore, as emphasized by the Bankruptcy Court during the hearing, also at stake were the significant interests of the third-party purchasers of the Allegheny County properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">Snyder argues that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order ratified the sheriffs sale without affecting the underlying state court judgment. Thus, she argues that she should have been allowed to revive her bankruptcy case to assert her claim that the judgment was entered in violation of the automatic stay and was void <em>ab initio. </em>To the extent that Snyder\u2019s position is based on the basis that an automatic stay is absolute and that a \u201cvoid\u201d action may never be cured by retroactive annulment, we have rejected this argument in previous cases, as noted above.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, we dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>cern no abuse of discretion in the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s denying allowance for Snyder\u2019s adversary complaint to proceed. Snyder does not dispute that pursuing her adversary action was the sole purpose of her motion to revive the proceedings. Instead, she asserts that the Bankruptcy Court erred by acknowledging during the hearing that a damages claim would be allowable yet ignoring that Snyder\u2019s complaint did include a claim for damages. Snyder\u2019s argument oversimplifies the basis of Bankruptcy Court\u2019s ruling. The hearing transcript reflects that the Bankruptcy Court engaged in an inquiry as to Snyder\u2019s intentions regarding her motion, ultimately ascertaining from Snyder\u2019s responses that Snyder had no intention to pursue Chapter 13 relief. The Bankruptcy Court emphasized that allowing Snyder\u2019s bankruptcy case to continue would involve filing schedules, creating a payment plan, and paying remaining creditors \u2014 and that Snyder could amend her motion to comply with those Chapter 13 requirements \u2014 otherwise, her case would be dismissed (again). <em>(See, e.g., </em>H\u2019rg Tr. Feb. 15, 2006 at 25, 27 (Appellant\u2019s App. Vol. II at 108, 110).)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Especially given Snyder\u2019s own history in failing to file a financing plan, as well as the history of Snyder\u2019s family\u2019s bankruptcy filings, we cannot say that denying the motion to revive her bankruptcy proceedings was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">We have considered the remaining arguments presented in Snyder\u2019s brief and motions and find them to be unpersuasive. We will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment affirming the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order annulling the stay as to the Allegheny County properties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Snyder\u2019s and Appellees\u2019 respective motions to expand the record are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b167-7\">. Specifically, the order provides in pertinent part: \"... the stay is annulled retroactively so that the sheriff's sale of the properties at [the street addresses of the five Allegheny County properties] is declared to be <em>not </em>in violation of the automatic stay, for the reasons expressed on the record this date. No adversary action is permitted at this time....'' <em>In Re: Shanni Snyder, </em>No. 03-34365 (Bankr.W.D.Pa. Feb. 16, 2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b167-11\">. Initially, it appeared that this Court lacked appellate jurisdiction due to an untimely notice of appeal. However, Snyder filed in District Court a motion under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(5) to extend the time to file an appeal. The District Court granted the motion on September 29, 2006. In light of this order, we are satisfied that we have appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b168-5\">. Although neither party raises the issue, we note that Snyder's motion to \u201creopen\u201d her bankruptcy case might be construed more accurately as a motion to vacate the dismissal of her case, as the matter was never \"closed\u201d under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 350(a). See <em>In re Income Property Builders, Inc., </em>699 F.2d 963, 965 (9th Cir. 1982). However, we observe that a motion filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Bank-niptcy Procedure 9024, which incorporates Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), may provide the vehicle for nullification of the dismissal order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b168-11\">. Also, we are unpersuaded by the suggestion that an annulment of the stay as to Allegheny County properties\u2019 sale somehow leaves the underlying default judgment subject to Snyder's challenge. To annul a stay is to negate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>its existence. <em>See In re Siciliano, </em>13 F.3d at 751 (distinguishing annulment of a stay, where annulment can operate as of the date of the bankruptcy petition's filing that gave rise to the stay, from termination of a stay, where a stay ends as of the date ordered). By the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order annulling the stay for purposes of the Allegheny County properties\u2019 sheriff's sale, it is as though the stay never existed. Accordingly, Snyder cannot argue that the underlying Allegheny County judgment was entered in violation of a non-existent stay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b169-6\">. Neither Snyder\u2019s motion nor the adversary complaint manifest any intent to pursue Chapter 13 relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b169-14\">. Snyder devotes part of her brief to disputing the District Court\u2019s \"prejudicial dicta\u201d that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s annulment applied not only to the Allegheny County properties but also to the Westmoreland County properties. She contends that the District Court's decision is thus inconsistent with the Bankruptcy Court's subsequent order in Mark Snyder\u2019s bankruptcy matter \u2014 separately pending at C.A. No. 07-2780 \u2014 and improperly expanded the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s ruling. Regardless of this characterization of the District Court\u2019s opinion, we merely note that the Bankruptcy Court's order is specific as to the intended scope of the annulment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
