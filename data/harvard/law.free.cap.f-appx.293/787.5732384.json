The BIA\u2019s order dismissed Veiro\u2019s appeal from the decision of the Immigration Judge (Montante, J.), finding Veiro removable as charged as a criminal alien, and denying his application for a waiver of inadmissibility under the now-repealed Section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-19\">We lack jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) to review final orders of removal against aliens deemed removable because of prior criminal convictions, and we lack jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) to review purely discretionary decisions by the Attorney General. <em>See Khan v. </em>Gonzales, 495 F.3d 31, 34 (2d Cir.2007). Our lack of jurisdiction is \u201csubject to the exception set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), which restores our jurisdiction to review \u2018constitutional claims or questions of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-20\">Veiro is removable because of his 1990 conviction for criminal sale of marijuana. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) (rendering inadmissible \u201cany alien convicted of ... a violation of ... any law or regulation of a State ... relating to a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of Title 21)\u201d). Veiro argues that the conviction has been vacated by Rochester City Court and thus cannot be used against him in immigration proceedings. But Veiro concedes that his conviction was vacated based upon the adverse immigration consequences of the conviction, rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>than reasons related to guilt or procedural flaws. In <em>Saleh v. Gonzales, </em>we held that \u201c[wjhen a conviction is amended nunc pro tunc solely to enable a defendant to avoid immigration consequences, in contrast to an amendment or vacatur on the merits, there is no reason to conclude that the alien is any less suitable for removal.\u201d 495 F.3d 17, 25 (2d Cir.2007); <em>see also United States v. Campbell, </em>167 F.3d 94, 97 (2d Cir.1999). Thus, Veiro\u2019s argument that the conviction should not render him removable due to the vacatur has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the denial of a Section 212(c) waiver, which is an issue committed by statute to the discretion of the Attorney General. <em>See Avendano-Espejo v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>448 F.3d 503, 505 (2d Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Veiro\u2019s argument that the BIA failed to consider the equities or to weigh certain factors in his favor amounts to an argument that the BIA abused its discretion, and does not raise a question of law or constitutional claim requiring this Court\u2019s review under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). <em>See Avendano-Espejo, </em>448 F.3d at 505-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">We therefore DENY the petition for review and the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
