Petitioner admitted the charge\u2019s factual allegations (contained in a Notice to Appear) and filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b), 1231(b)(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In her application, Petitioner alleged a fear of persecution in China related to her involvement with Falun Gong.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Following a hearing at which Petitioner testified at length, the Immigration Judge (IJ) found her not credible. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii),(iii) (establishing framework for credibility determinations). Based on blanket findings, the IJ first concluded Petitioner was not eligible for asylum. The IJ explained that Petitioner did not meet her burden of establishing that she was a \u201crefugee\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42), <em>ie., </em>having a well founded fear of persecution based on membership in, among other things, a religious or particular social group. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1158(b) (requiring applicant for asylum to establish refugee status). The IJ next concluded that Petitioner was not entitled to withholding of removal because she did not meet her burden of establishing her life or freedom would be threatened on account of religion or membership in a particular social group if removed to China. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1231(b)(3). The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissed Petitioner\u2019s appeal, concluding the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-12\">In <em>Jiang v. Gonzales, </em>474 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir.2007) we set forth the standard of review applicable to the present Petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5\">This court reviews findings of fact in immigration proceedings, including findings with respect to credibility, to determine whether those findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record. Under that standard, an adverse credibility determination may stand if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6\">(internal quotations and citation omitted). We need not repeat Petitioner\u2019s story here. We have carefully reviewed the entire record and the parties\u2019 briefs, and conclude that the IJ and BIA reached a permissible result under the applicable law. We have repeatedly opined that \u201c \u201cwhen a lower court accurately takes the measure of a case and articulates a cogent rationale, it serves no useful purpose for a reviewing court to write at length.\u2019 \u201d <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Zaldivar, </em>413 F.3d 119, 120 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Seaco Ins. Co. v. Davis-Irish, </em>300 F.3d 84, 86 (1st Cir.2002) (citing cases)). Because the BIA\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, we deny the Petition for Review for substantially the reasons set forth in that decision. <em>See Lin v. Mukasey, </em>521 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir.2008) (\u201cWhere the BIA does not [expressly] adopt the IJ\u2019s findings, we review the BIA\u2019s decision rather than the IJ\u2019s.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b31-9\">. Petitioner also unsuccessfully sought relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. That claim is not before us on the Petition for Review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
