While Southern was serving his second term of supervised release, he violated a special condition requiring him to participate satisfactorily in the pre-release component of a community corrections center program. The district court again revoked supervised release, this time sentencing him to serve 11 months in prison with no further supervised release. Southern appeals, arguing that the court abused its discretion in sentencing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">We conclude that the revocation sentence is not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Tyson, </em>413 F.3d 824, 825 (8th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (standard of review). The court sentenced Southern within the advisory range under Chapter 7 of the Guidelines, after listening to the arguments of counsel and allocution by Southern, engaging in a discussion with Southern about his repeated supervision failures, and expressly considering relevant matters under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) (permitting revocation of supervised release and re-imprisonment after considering specified factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)); <em>United States v. Franklin, </em>397 F.3d 604, 606-07 (8th Cir.2005) (all that is required is evidence that court considered relevant matters, not that court made specific findings on each \u00a7 3553(a) factor).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw on condition that counsel inform appellant about the procedures for filing petitions for rehearing and for certiorari.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-6\">. The Honorable Ortrie D. Smith, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
