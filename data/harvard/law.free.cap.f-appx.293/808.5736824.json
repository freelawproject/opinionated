Aug. 23, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A76 126 300 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 14, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-11\">In her brief to this Court, Lin challenges, exclusively, the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to reconsider. Contrary to Lin\u2019s argument, our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s August 2007 denial of her asylum and withholding of removal claims where that is the only decision from which a petition for review was timely filed. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>cf. Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 89-90 (2d Cir.2001) (noting that where the alien files a timely petition from the denial of a motion, but not from the underlying affirmance of the removal order, the Court may review only the denial of the motion). Accordingly, we are without jurisdiction to review Lin\u2019s arguments to the extent they challenge the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to reconsider. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-13\">Moreover, Lin has waived any challenge to the BIA\u2019s denial of her asylum and withholding of removal claims by failing to raise any relevant argument in her brief to this Court. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 546 n. 8 (2d Cir.2005) (emphasizing that, \u201c[ijssues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal\u201d)(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because Lin has waived any challenge to the only decision we are \u201cempowered\u201d to review, the petition for review must be denied. <em>See Nwogu v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 80, 84 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
