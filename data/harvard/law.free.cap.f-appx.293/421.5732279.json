In light of <em>United States v. Templeton, </em>543 F.3d 378 (7th Cir.2008), in which we abrogated our precedent holding that all escape and failure-to-report crimes qualify as violent felonies for the purposes of career offender status, we remand for resentenc-ing.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">In 2006 a Madison, Wisconsin police officer working undercover bought crack cocaine from a drug dealer he knew as Shane. During the sale, Shane, also known as Melvin Jackson, was joined by his partner Gregory Burks. The two were arrested and both later pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Burks was sentenced as a career offender because the district court held that he had been convicted of two crimes of violence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, 4B1.2. The first was a 2002 conviction for failure to report, <em>see </em>Wis. Stat \u00a7 946.425(lm)(b), where Burks had failed to report to county jail to serve a series of short sentences that totaled less than one year. The record contains no details about his eventual apprehension by the authorities. Burks\u2019s second crime of violence was a 2003 conviction for escape, <em>see </em>Wis. Stat \u00a7 946.42(3)(a), where, after a traffic stop, an officer attempted to put Burks into her vehicle, but he broke free and ran away. Two days later an officer attempted to take Burks into custody at his sister\u2019s home, but he ran away a second time. Again, the record reveals that Burks was eventually apprehended by the authorities, but it does not reveal any details about how he was apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-13\">At sentencing, Burks argued that he was not a career offender because his prior convictions for failure to report to jail and escape should not be considered crimes of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). To that end, Burks presented the testimony of Barry Widera of Court Data Technologies, a consulting business specializing in researching data maintained by the Wisconsin court system. Burks argued that the data, which we summarized in our <em>Temple-tan </em>opinion, <em>Templeton, </em>543 F.3d at 381-82, showed that neither the escape conviction nor the failure-to-report conviction should be considered a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 because in a typical case, neither \u201cpresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d The district court thanked Burks for his efforts, but ruled that it was bound by circuit precedent to treat the two convictions as crimes of violence triggering career offender status. The court calculated Burks\u2019s guidelines range as a career of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>fender to be 188 to 235 months and gave him 188 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Career offender status applies only to a defendant who has \u201cat least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a)(3). \u201cCrime of violence\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">We had read the \u201cotherwise\u201d clause in \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) and the identical language in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) to encompass the crimes of escape and failure to report. <em>United States v. Chambers, </em>473 F.3d 724, 726 (7th Cir.2007) (escape); <em>United States v. Golden, </em>466 F.3d 612, 614-15 (7th Cir. 2006) (failure to report). Burks\u2019s only argument on appeal was that the data he presented required us to revisit that precedent. But exactly one week before oral argument, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Begay v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), which held that felony drunk driving was not a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act because even assuming that it presented \u201ca serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\u201d it was \u201ctoo unlike the provision\u2019s listed examples.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1584. In supplemental briefing on the applicability of <em>Begay, </em>Burks argues that escape and failure to report should not be categorically considered crimes of violence because they are also unlike the enumerated examples. We recently agreed. <em>Templeton, </em>543 F.3d 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">In <em>Templeton, </em>we held that a conviction under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 946.425 for failure to report was not a crime of violence, <em>Tem-pleton, </em>543 F.3d at 383-84, and that a conviction under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 946.42 for escape was not categorically a crime of violence, <em>id. </em>With regard to the escape conviction, we remanded so that the district court could determine, by looking at the indictment or other charging papers, whether the way in which the defendant committed the offense qualified it as a crime of violence. Here too, Burks\u2019s conviction for failure to report is not a crime of violence, but we cannot say whether his conviction for escape qualifies. That would seem to leave only one possible violent felony, which would preclude career offender status. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, 4B1.2. But further proceedings on the nature of Burks\u2019s escape conviction may be necessary because he has another prior conviction \u2014 for vehicular fleeing/eluding an officer, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 346.04(3) \u2014 which the district court may determine to be a crime of violence itself. <em>Cf. United States v. Spells, </em>537 F.3d 743, 751-53 (7th Cir.2008) (holding that after <em>Begay, </em>Indiana\u2019s law against fleeing an officer, which is similar to Wisconsin\u2019s law, constitutes a \u201cviolent felony\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-15\">Accordingly, we REMAND for re-sentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
