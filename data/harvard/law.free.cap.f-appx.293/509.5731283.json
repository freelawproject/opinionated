This is an appeal from a final judgment of conviction in a criminal ease. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">In January 2002, Padilla-Salas was convicted of \u201cstatutory sexual seduction\u201d in violation of Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 200.364 and 200.368, for having sexual intercourse with a fifteen-year-old girl. Padilla-Salas pled guilty to the offense as a gross misdemeanor. The state court sentenced him to six months in jail. In July 2002, Padilla-Salas was convicted of a felony drug trafficking offense. After being paroled from state prison, Padilla-Salas was deported in January 2004. In March 2007, Padilla-Salas was arrested in Nevada following a traffic stop. Padilla-Salas was charged with unlawful entry by a deported alien under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and pled guilty to the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">At a sentencing hearing on November 28, 2007, the district court sentenced Padilla-Salas to twenty months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release. In calculating the sentence, the district court enhanced Padilla-Salas\u2019s base offense level by eight levels pursuant to U.S.S.G \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), which provides for an eight-level increase if a defendant was previously deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Padilla-Salas\u2019s principal contention is that his gross misdemeanor conviction for statutory sexual seduction under Nevada law is not an aggravated felony for sentencing purposes. Padilla-Salas\u2019s contention is squarely foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Alvarez-Gutierrez, </em>394 F.3d 1241 (9th Cir.2005). <em>Alvarez-Gutierrez </em>expressly holds that a conviction under Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 200.364 and .368 for statutory sexual seduction constitutes a conviction for \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d for purposes of federal sentencing law, and \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d is an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d as that term is defined by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). <em>Alvarez-Gutierrez, </em>394 F.3d at 1245. Section 1101(a)(43)(A) defines an \u201caggravated felony\u201d as \u201cmurder, rape, or sexual abuse of a minor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">Padilla-Salas argues that <em>Alvarez-Gutierrez </em>is no longer good law after the Supreme Court\u2019s intervening decision in <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006). <em>Lopez </em>is inapplicable because <em>Lopez </em>involved 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), not \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A). Section 1101(a)(43)(B) defines \u201caggravated felony\u201d as \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance ... including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(e) of Title 18).\u201d Section 924(c) further defines \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d as \u201cany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.\u201d In <em>Lopez, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201ca state offense constitutes a \u2018felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\u2019 only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under that federal law.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>127 S.Ct. at 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">Padilla-Salas further argues that the holding in <em>Alvarez-Gutierrez </em>should be limited to its facts and applied only where the defendant received a sentence of at least one year for an offense classified as a misdemeanor under state law. Padilla-Salas\u2019s argument is unavailing because <em>Alvarez-Gutierrez </em>explicitly recognizes that \u201c[t]here is nothing in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A) that requires the offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>listed in that subseetion to be felonies as that term is traditionally understood, or that requires those offenses to be punishable by any particular term of imprisonment.\u201d Alva<em>rez-Gutierrez, </em>394 F.3d at 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The district court did not err by classifying Padilla-Salas\u2019s state misdemeanor conviction for \u201cstatutory sexual seduction\u201d as a conviction of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A) and enhancing his base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b536-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
