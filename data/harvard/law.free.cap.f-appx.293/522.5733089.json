We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits de novo. <em>Ukolov v. Barnhart, </em>420 F.3d 1002, 1004 (9th Cir.2005). We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-20\">The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) erred by failing to request medical source statements from Dr. Tibbitts because the evidence as to what Mulanax could still do despite her impairments was ambiguous and incomplete. <em>See Mayes v. Massanari, </em>276 F.3d 453, 459-60 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-21\">Additionally, the ALJ erred by failing to give any consideration to lay witness Diana Long\u2019s statements addressing Mulanax\u2019s ability to work. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.913(d)(4). Because Long\u2019s statements bolstered Mulanax\u2019s claims of fatigue, that error is not harmless. <em>See Stout v. Comm\u2019r, Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>454 F.3d 1050, 1056 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-22\">The ALJ\u2019s rejection of Dr. Calvert\u2019s conclusions was not supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830 (9th Cir.1996). The ALJ rejected Dr. Calvert\u2019s conclusions because the ALJ objected to the form Dr. Calvert used. The ALJ has a duty to fully develop the record. <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1288 (9th Cir.1996). If the ALJ questioned Dr. Calvert\u2019s conclusions, the ALJ should have conducted an inquiry by subpoenaing Dr. Calvert or submitting further questions to him. <em>See id. </em>Also, Dr. Calvert\u2019s statements that Mulanax seems to feel better since she ceased working and that working is \u201creally difficult\u201d for Mulanax with her fibromyalgia support Dr. Calvert\u2019s opinion that Mulanax was unable to work</p>\n<p id=\"b548-23\">We need not reach the issue of the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination because the ALJ will need to reassess Mulanax\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>credibility based on the record developed upon remand. Nonetheless, we note that Mulanax\u2019s receipt of unemployment benefits does not by itself support a conclusion that she is not credible. Generally, in order to be eligible for disability benefits under the Social Security Act, the person must be unable to sustain full-time work-eight hours per day, five days per week. <em>See </em>SSR 96-8p. However, under Oregon law, a person is eligible for unemployment benefits if she is available for some work, including temporary or part time opportunities. <em>See </em>Or. Admin. R. 471-030-0036(2)(b), (3)(b). Therefore, Mulanax\u2019s claim of unemployment in Oregon is not necessarily inconsistent with her claim of disability benefits under the Social Security Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Furthermore, we note that there is no support in the record for the proposition that only a neurologic abnormality can cause a \u201cburning\u201d sensation. Additionally, Mulanax\u2019s testimony that she was fatigued and would fall asleep while working is corroborated by Long\u2019s statements, Dr. Wood\u2019s report that Mulanax was so tired she almost fell off of her chair at work, and references to fatigue throughout Mulanax\u2019s medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Finally, the ALJ should revisit his conclusions regarding Dr. Tibbitts\u2019 GAF assessment as well as his determination that Mulanax\u2019s migraines are controlled by medication in light of the record as it is developed upon remand. We have considered and reject and all other claims raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">We remand to the district court with instructions to remand to the Commissioner for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b548-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
