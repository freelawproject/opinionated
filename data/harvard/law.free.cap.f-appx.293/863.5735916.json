He argues that the District Court erred by including relevant conduct for which the jury acquitted Jacobs to determine his offense level in the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Jacobs also argues that the District Court erred by not considering the sentencing factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) to reduce his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>sentence. For the reasons stated below, we will affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">Because we write exclusively for the parties, we only discuss the facts and proceedings to the extent necessary for resolution of this case. Jacobs was indicted with thirteen other individuals in a drug conspiracy. He was charged with five counts, including conspiracy to distribute more than 50 grams of cocaine base. A jury convicted him of all charges except the conspiracy charge. At sentencing, the District Court increased Jacobs\u2019s offense level based on relevant conduct, which included Jacobs\u2019s involvement with the other defendants in the drug trafficking conspiracy pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.3(a)(1)(B), resulting in a sentence of 420 months\u2019 imprisonment. Jacobs appealed to this Court, which affirmed the sentence. Jacobs then petitioned for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court, which vacated the ruling of this Court in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). This Court remanded to the District Court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">At resentencing, the District Court heard testimony from friends and family about Jacobs\u2019s positive qualities and his difficult childhood. The District Court again increased Jacobs\u2019s offense level based on relevant conduct, but reduced his sentence to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment after considering the apparent disparity between Jacobs\u2019s sentence compared to those of similarly-placed defendants as provided under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), which permits the Court to tailor the sentence after considering various factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">On appeal, Jacobs argues that the District Court erred by increasing the offense level based on relevant conduct of which Jacobs was acquitted. Jacobs also argues that the District Court\u2019s sentence was unreasonable because the Court failed to consider the sentencing factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">As an initial matter, we have previously stated that a sentencing court is free to consider \u201crelevant conduct, including conduct resulting in acquittal, that was prove[n] by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d to determine a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>U.S. v. Jimenez, </em>513 F.3d 62, 88 (3d Cir.2008); <em>see also U.S. v. Grier, </em>475 F.3d 556, 568 (3d Cir.2007) (holding that, <em>post-Booker, </em>a court may apply a preponderance of the evidence standard to all facts relevant to determine a sentence under the Guidelines). After hearing lengthy argument from counsel on the issue, and discussing the significant amount of testimony from the trial that linked Jacobs to the drug conspiracy, the District Court noted that it \u201cremained mindful of [Jacobs\u2019s] participation\u201d in the drug trafficking activity with his brothers and others charged in the conspiracy. App. at 89. Accordingly, the District Court did not err when it considered relevant conduct in calculating Jacobs\u2019s offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">Moreover, the record is clear that the District Court adequately considered the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and ultimately imposed a sentence below the advisory guideline range. <em>United States v. Charles, </em>467 F.3d 828, 831 (3d Cir.2006). The District Court express<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>ly noted its obligation to evaluate the \u00a7 3353(a) factors, and discussed the apparent disparity between Jacobs\u2019s sentence and the sentences of similarly-placed defendants. The District Court also discussed the severity of the crime, including the number of lives adversely affected by the distribution of crack cocaine in the community in which Jacobs lived. In the end, the District Court resentenced Jacobs to 240 months, which was 180 months less than his original sentence and fifteen years below the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Given the deference afforded to a trial court judge\u2019s application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, especially a judge who has imposed a sentence below the Guidelines range, this Court concludes that the District Court\u2019s sentence was a substantively reasonable balancing of the statutory factors. <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 330-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment of sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b890-6\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b890-9\">. We review the District Court's determination of a sentence for reasonableness, which requires us to ensure that the district court gave \"meaningful consideration\u201d to the sentencing factors set out in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 329 (3d Cir. 2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
