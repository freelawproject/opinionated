Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 5525(a)(8). The District Court dismissed Appellant Joseph Ryncavage\u2019s complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) because it was filed after the applicable statute of limitations had run on his breach of contract claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-18\">Ryncavage is an independent contractor who sold insurance for the Appellee company. The issue in his action is over commissions Ryncavage contends he was to receive. Ryncavage\u2019s amended complaint indicates that he \u201cwas notified via a letter on July 30, 2002 ... confirming that his new business commissions and renewals would cease effective August 29, 2002.\u201d The record also reflects that the Appellee specifically notified Ryncavage that \u201ceffective August 29, 2002, you will not [sic] longer receive commissions on new business.\u201d Ryncavage sued the Appellee for breach of contract, but filed his original complaint on August 31, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-19\">Ryncavage argues that the District Court erred by not extending the statute of limitations past August 29, 2006, because his new commission payments were not anticipated until some later, uncertain date. He also argues that the Appellee\u2019s letter of July 30, 2002, could be treated as an anticipatory repudiation and that he was entitled to await Appellee\u2019s failure to perform before filing suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-20\">We have reviewed the briefs filed by the parties and conclude that, essentially for the reasons set forth by the District Court, its judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
