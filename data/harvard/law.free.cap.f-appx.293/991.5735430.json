At sentencing, the district court found that Walker\u2019s prior convictions classified him as an armed career criminal under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e) (\u201cACCA\u201d). Walker was sentenced to a term of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-25\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), appellate review of a district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence is for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). The appellate court must first ensure that the district court committed no procedural error, such as \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">Walker claims the district court erred in classifying him as an armed career criminal. A defendant qualifies as an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e)(1) if he has three prior convictions for a violent felony or serious drug offense. In determining whether a crime is a violent felony within the meaning of the ACCA, the offense is considered generieally in terms of how the law defines it and not in terms of how an individual offender might have committed the offense on a particular occasion. 18 U.S.CA. \u00a7 924(e)(1), (e)(2)(B); <em>Begay v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 1584, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). Walker concedes he has two qualifying violent felony convictions, but he contests the use of a 2005 North Carolina felony conviction for Habitual Misdemeanor Assault as the third qualifying offense. <em>See </em>N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-33.2 (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">Walker argues that N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-33.2 is a recidivist felony and not a violent felony for the purposes of the ACCA enhancement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, \u201can offense committed by a repeat offender is often thought to reflect greater culpability and thus to merit greater punishment. Similarly, a second or subsequent offense is often regarded as more serious because it portends greater future danger and therefore warrants an increased sentence for purposes of deterrence and incapacitation.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriquez,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 1783, 1789, 170 L.Ed.2d 719 (2008). The Supreme Court in <em>Rodriquez </em>rejected the argument that a defendant is punished under federal law for being treated as a recidivist under state law, noting that \u201cACCA is itself a recidivist statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-33.2 is not a sentencing enhancement but a substantive felony offense. <em>See State v. Smith, </em>139 N.C.App. 209, 533 S.E.2d 518, 520 (2000). We thus conclude the district court did not err when it classified Walker as an armed career criminal under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-16\">Accordingly, we affirm Walker\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1018-10\">. Walker pled guilty to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-33.2 after he committed three misdemeanor assaults.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1018-13\">. Although N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-33.2 states that convictions pursuant to that statute \"shall not be used as a prior conviction for any other habitual offense statute,\u201d federal law governs whether a particular state conviction is a qualifying predicate offense under the ACCA. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
