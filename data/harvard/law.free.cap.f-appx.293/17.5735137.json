Abrams denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), <em>see In re Feiping Weng, </em>No. A98-559-825 (B.I.A. Nov. 27, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 98 559 825 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Feb. 10, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-13\">Where the BIA summarily affirms an IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, as it did in this case, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See Ming Xia Chen v. BIA </em>435 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings for substantial evidence, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. United States Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-14\">In denying relief from removal, the IJ concluded that, although Weng testified credibly to his efforts to establish residency in the United States after leaving China, because he failed to adduce evidence that Chinese nationals who attempted to relocate to the United States faced persecution upon return to China, he failed to demonstrate the objectively well-founded fear of future persecution necessary to secure relief from removal. <em>See Ramsa-meachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004) (noting that in absence of past persecution, alien must demonstrate that he has well-founded fear of future persecution by presenting credible testimony that he subjectively fears persecution and establishing that his fear is objectively reasonable). On this appeal, Weng challenges this determination only as it resulted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>the denial of CAT relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we treat any challenges to the denial of his asylum and withholding claims as waived. <em>See Norton v. Sam\u2019s Club, </em>145 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Weng submits that the agency\u2019s ruling is infected by a factual error, i.e., the assumption that his departure from China was lawful. The IJ drew this inference from Weng\u2019s testimony that he used an official Chinese passport bearing his name and picture when he submitted to official inspection upon departing China for Hong Kong. Weng never testified that he left China illegally; thus, the IJ\u2019s finding that his testimony was credible is consistent with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Weng would not face any criminal prosecution upon his return to China. Even if we assume, as Weng suggests, that upon repatriation to China, he will nevertheless be viewed in violation of that country\u2019s emigration policies for attempting to relocate to the United States, no remand is required because we identify another independent basis relied upon by the BIA that justifies denial of CAT relief. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 339 (2d Cir.2006) (concluding remand not necessary in face of agency error when court can state with confidence agency would reach same conclusion on remand by relying on alternative ground).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">To establish eligibility for CAT relief, an alien bears the burden of proving \u201cthat it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(e)(2). Torture is defined as \u201cany act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person\u201d and does not include \u201clesser forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1208.18(a)(l)-(2). Weng asserts on appeal that he demonstrated a probability of such torture through his own testimony, a letter from his mother asserting that he would be arrested, jailed, and beaten on return to China, and State Department reports of wide-scale human rights abuses in China. Our precedent, however, does not recognize such evidence as sufficient to compel a grant of CAT relief. <em>See Mu Xiang Lin v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 157-58 (2d Cir.2005) (rejecting CAT claim by Chinese national who moved to United States for economic reasons, observing that testimony, family letters, and State Department reports failed to establish the requisite \u201cparticularized evidence\u201d that petitioner \u201cis likely to be subjected to torture in Chinese prisons\u201d); <em>Mu-Xing Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 143-44 &amp; n. 21 (2d Cir.2003) (rejecting similar CAT claim, noting that \u201calthough some of the \u2018country conditions\u2019 reports ... indicate that the government of China has committed serious human rights violations, including the torture and mistreatment of some prisoners, these documents by no means establish that prisoners in Wang\u2019s circumstances \u2014 namely, military deserters and unlawful emigrants are \u2018more likely than not\u2019 to be tortured\u201d). As we do not discern any material distinction between the evidence in this case and that in <em>Mu Xiang Lin, </em>we cannot conclude that the record compelled a reasonable adjudicator to find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>that Weng would more likely than not be subjected to torture if removed to China.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b45-7\">. Although at oral argument, Weng asserted that the IJ erred in failing to reach the question of whether Weng would be subject to torture upon his return to China and consequently should be considered eligible for CAT relief, the IJ did in fact separately address Weng\u2019s CAT claim, concluding that Weng had failed to meet his burden of establishing he would be either subject to harm upon his return, or that the harm he could face would constitute torture under the CAT.
