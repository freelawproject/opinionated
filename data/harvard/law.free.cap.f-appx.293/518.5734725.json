The ALJ so concluded because Local 287:(1) refused to hold a ratification vote on a tentative collective-bargaining contract on the date its agent agreed to hold it, and (2) demanded Granite Rock agree to a \u201cback-to-work\u201d agreement before it would hold the ratification vote it had already agreed to hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">Local 287 also petitions for review of the NLRB\u2019s remedial order, which held the collective-bargaining contract between Granite Rock and Local 287 that was ratified on August 22, 2004, should be effective retroactively as of July 2, 2004, when the contract would have been ratified but for Local 287\u2019s unfair labor practices. The NLRB cross-petitions for enforcement of this remedial order. We deny Local 287\u2019s petition for review and grant the NLRB\u2019s petition for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-14\">We must defer to the NLRB\u2019s determination whether a party engaged in \u201cgood faith\u201d bargaining if it is supported by substantial evidence that any \u201creasonable mind might accept as adequate.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Int\u2019l Bhd. of Electrical Workers, </em>345 F.3d 1049, 1054 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-15\">We are convinced the NLRB\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence. A valid condition precedent to a contract, such as the \u201cback-to-work\u201d agreement on which Local 287 insisted, requires a \u201cclear and unambiguous expression by the parties\u201d that the parties intended for the condition to precede contractual performance. <em>Nat'l Am. Ins. Co. of Calif. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s London, </em>93 F.3d 529, 539 (9th Cir.1996). Here, however, Local 287\u2019s negotiator agreed to put the proposed collective-bargaining contract to a vote before he ever mentioned the \u201cback-to-work\u201d agreement. This is a post-deal negotiation, and the NLRB did not exceed its wide discretion to enforce the National Labor Relations Act by concluding this post-deal negotiation violated the good faith requirement of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-16\">We also hold the NLRB did not act arbitrarily or capriciously by ordering the collective-bargaining contract ratified on August 22, 2004, to be effective retroactively as of July 2, 2004. The NLRB sought to remedy Local 287\u2019s breach of its duty to bargain in good faith by enforcing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>the collective-bargaining contract as of the date it would have been signed if Local 287 had not violated 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">This court will affirm an NLRB remedial order unless the order is \u201ca patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies\u201d of the National Labor Relations Act. <em>East Bay Automotive Council v. NLRB, </em>483 F.3d 628, 632 (9th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Fibreboard Paper Prods. Corp. v. NLRB, </em>379 U.S. 203, 216, 85 S.Ct. 398, 13 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964)). Here, the NLRB did not act arbitrarily or capriciously because it relied on its decision in <em>TNT Skypak, Inc. and Local 851, Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, AFL-CIO, </em>328 NLRB 468 (1999), which was approved by the Second Circuit, 208 F.3d 362 (2d Cir.2000). Further, we have held that where an NLRB remedy is not clearly arbitrary and capricious, doubts about its scope should be resolved against the perpetrator of the unfair labor practice. <em>See NLRB v. Int\u2019l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, Local Union 112, AFL-CIO, </em>992 F.2d 990, 993 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Petition for review (No. 06-72964) DENIED and cross-petition for enforcement (No. 06-73444) GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b545-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
