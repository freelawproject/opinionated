Koeltl of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b854-9\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">Defendant-Appellant Kenneth Brown was convicted, following a jury trial, of one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and three counts of substantive wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343. Brown was sentenced to sixty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment for count one, to run concurrently with concurrent sentences of eighty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment for each of the other counts; three years\u2019 supervised release; a mandatory assessment of $400; and asset forfeiture of $1,204,990. Familiarity by the parties is assumed as to the facts, the procedural context, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-13\">On appeal, Brown challenges his conviction on four grounds, alleging that: (1) the government constructively amended Brown\u2019s indictment (or, alternatively, created a prejudicial variance) by arguing that he was involved in so-called \u201cHigh Yield Investment Programs\u201d (\u201cHYIPs\u201d) as opposed to merely providing financing for them; (2) venue in the Southern District of New York was improper with respect to count two; (3) the government improperly shifted the burden of proof to Brown; and (4) the sentence imposed was unreasonable because it improperly applied \u201cmass marketing\u201d and \u201cleadership role\u201d enhancements under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d or \u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d), <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A)(ii) (imposing a two-level enhancement for use of mass marketing), 3Bl.l(c) (imposing a two-level enhancement for an \u201corganizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-14\">Brown\u2019s constructive amendment or prejudicial variance claim is without merit. He argues that the government\u2019s introduction of evidence concerning HYIPs \u2014 in the absence of an appropriate jury instruction \u2014 permitted the jury to convict Brown on the basis of conduct not charged in the indictment. The testimony offered by government witnesses relating to HYIPs was offered as background information to explain the kind of fictitious investments for which Brown\u2019s fraudulent \u201cadvance fee\u201d scheme purportedly provided financing. In denying Brown\u2019s post-trial motions pursuant to Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 29 and 33, the district court correctly concluded that \u201c[t]he jury was not told that Brown was a promoter of HYIP\u2019s.... \u201d App. of Appellant 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>Although the indictment did not specifically allege Brown\u2019s involvement in the promotion of HYIPs, we are satisfied that the government\u2019s proof at trial did \u201csubstantially correspond\u201d to the allegations of the indictment. <em>See United States v. Danielson, </em>199 F.3d 666, 670 (2d Cir. 1999) (quoting <em>United States v. Patino, </em>962 F.2d 263, 266 (2d Cir.1992)). For the same reason, we deny Brown\u2019s alternate argument of prejudicial variance. <em>See United States v. Mucciante, </em>21 F.3d 1228, 1236 (2d Cir.1994) (quoting <em>United States v. Heimann, </em>705 F.2d 662, 669 (2d Cir. 1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Brown\u2019s argument that venue in the Southern District of New York was improper with respect to count two acknowledges that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Gilboe, </em>684 F.2d 235 (2d Cir.1982), is controlling. He nevertheless maintains that it was wrongly decided. In <em>Gilboe, </em>as the district court noted below in denying Brown\u2019s post-trial motions, this Court held that venue in the Southern District of New York was appropriate under the second paragraph of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3237(a) where a wire transfer was routed through that district, without any processing of the transaction within the district. <em>See Gilboe, </em>684 F.2d at 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Here, as in <em>Gilboe, </em>the wire transfer that passed through Manhattan was an \u201coffense involving ... transportation in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3237(a). As such, it could be \u201cprosecuted in any district from, through, or into which such commerce, mail matter, or imported object or person move[d].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the passage of the wire transfer through the Southern District of New York created venue for statutory purposes \u2014 the Southern District was clearly a \u201cdistrict from, through, or into which such commerce, mail matter, or imported object or person move[d].\u201d <em>Id. </em>We likewise agree that venue in the Southern District was justified by the \u201csubstantial contacts\u201d with that district arising from Brown\u2019s wire fraud offense. <em>See United States v. Saavedra, </em>223 F.3d 85, 92-93 (2d Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">Brown also contends that the district court permitted the government to improperly shift the burden of proof by arguing that Brown did not control the assets he claimed would be used to finance his victims\u2019 HYIP investments and by arguing that he faded to verify the \u201cproofs of funds\u201d he provided his victims to demonstrate such control. We agree with the government that the government\u2019s proof shifted the burden to Brown no more than any other incriminating evidence routinely offered by the government. In this case, while the government was prevented by the district court from providing evidence concerning the <em>actual content </em>or <em>legitimacy </em>of the accounts (because the government, during its investigation, had not undertaken to ascertain these facts), it was surely not barred from inquiring into Brown\u2019s efforts to determine his own control over the funds he falsely portrayed as his own. It was entirely consistent with the government\u2019s theory of fraud for the government to show that Brown had posed as the funds\u2019 principal, without inquiring into whether the funds in fact existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">Finally, Brown challenges the reasonableness of the sentence imposed by the district court on the grounds that two enhancements \u2014 one for \u201cmass marketing,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(A)(ii), and the other for leadership role, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3Bl.l(c) \u2014 were wrongly applied. At the sentencing hearing before the district court, Brown made substantially the same argument against application of the mass marketing enhancement that he now repeats on ap<em>peal </em>\u2014 i.e., that it was Brown\u2019s coconspirator, Sheppard, who handled the marketing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>of the advance fee scheme over the Internet. The district court flatly rejected Brown\u2019s attempt at disassociation, stating that \u201cthe relationship between Mr. Brown and Mr. Sheppard ... [was] spelled out quite clearly.\u201d App. of Appellant 182. He went on to note that \u201c[w]hen Mr. Brown received the money, one of the first payments he made was to Mr. Sheppard,\u201d and the district court referred to Sheppard and others as \u201cfeeders.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">As the commentary to section 2B1.1 makes clear, \u201c[f]or purposes of subsection (b)(2), \u2018mass-marketing\u2019 means a plan, program, promotion, or campaign that is conducted through solicitation by telephone, mail, the Internet, or other means to induce a large number of persons to ... (iii) invest for financial profit.\u201d \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 4(A). Under these circumstances, the district court\u2019s application of the mass marketing enhancement was squarely within its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The district court\u2019s rejection of Brown\u2019s argument that a leadership role enhancement should not apply was similarly reasonable. The district court noted that Brown paid his coconspirators \u201ca small fraction of the amount he kept for himself,\u201d a relevant consideration for application of the role enhancement. App. of Appellant 184; <em>See </em>\u00a7 3Bl.l(c) cmt. n. 4 (\u201cIn distinguishing a leadership and organizational role from one of mere management or supervision, ... [factors the court should consider include ... the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the conviction and sentence imposed below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
