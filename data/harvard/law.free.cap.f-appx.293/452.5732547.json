(\u201cBrooke\u201d) receives special education services from the Alaska Gateway School District (\u201cAGSD\u201d), which include periodic speech and language, occupational and physical therapy \u201crelated services\u201d sessions. She filed an administrative complaint with the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development (\u201cDEED\u201d) claiming that AGSD \u201cfailed to provide the minimum on-site monthly ... supervision of those therapies,\u201d then required by Alaska regulations. <em>See </em>Alaska Admin. Code tit. 4, \u00a7\u00a7 52.250(d), 52.252(b) (2006). After conducting an investigation, DEED found that no violations of law had occurred and that no corrective action was required. Brooke brought suit against DEED, claiming that it had violated the supervisory responsibility provisions of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d). <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1412(a)(11)(A), 1413(g). Because Brooke did not exhaust administrative remedies, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>We reject DEED\u2019S contention that Brooke lacks Article III standing. On a \u201cmotion to dismiss we presum[e] that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.\u201d <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). Brooke alleged that she was not provided related services supervision in accordance with the state\u2019s regulations and standards. She therefore has adequately pled that DEED\u2019S conduct deprived her of the free appropriate public education that IDEA guarantees. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1401(9), 1412(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">We agree with DEED, however, that Brooke\u2019s failure to pursue a due process hearing cannot be excused. Although administrative exhaustion may be unnecessary when the basis of the IDEA claim is that the \u201cagency has adopted a policy or pursued a practice of general applicability that is contrary to the law,\u201d structuring a complaint as a challenge to an alleged policy is not enough. <em>See Hoeft v. Tucson Unified Sch. Dist., </em>967 F.2d 1298, 1303-04 (9th Cir.1992). DEED expressly concluded that AGSD \u201cprovided qualified personnel, training, and supervision of those serving\u201d Brooke and that there was \u201cinsufficient evidence to support [her] allegation of noncompliance\u201d with state and federal law. Thus, unlike in <em>Christopher S. v. Stanislaus County Ofice of Education, </em>384 F.3d 1205, 1211 &amp; n. 3, 1213 (9th Cir.2004), it is not an \u201cundisputed fact\u201d that DEED has in effect a \u201cfacially unlawful policy\u201d of refusing to enforce district compliance with state educational requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Brooke has not met her burden of establishing that resort to a due process hearing would be futile or inadequate. <em>See Kutasi v. Las Virgenes Unified Sch. Dist., </em>494 F.3d 1162, 1168 (9th Cir.2007). Should a due process hearing officer find that AGSD had violated the state educational regulations relating to monthly on-site supervision of related services, the hearing officer could order appropriate educational relief. <em>See id. </em>at 1169. Accordingly, there remain outstanding educational issues that could be developed \u2014 and potentially resolved \u2014 in the context of a due process hearing. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b479-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
