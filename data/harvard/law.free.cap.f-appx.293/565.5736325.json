R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-20\">Jose Garza, a state inmate incarcerated at the Lansing Mental Health Facility in Kansas, appears pro se and seeks review of the district court\u2019s dismissal of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. This court exercises jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-21\">Mr. Garza\u2019s district court complaint claimed that his state-appointed defense counsel in the original state criminal proceeding against him gave him false information regarding a plea of insanity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Garza contends that his counsel told him he could not enter a plea of \u201cinsanity,\u201d that his defense counsel \u201ctook advantage\u201d of Mr. Garza because he did not know the law, and that, therefore, his rights were violated and his case should be reconsidered. Mr. Garza also seeks thirty million dollars in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>In completing the required screening process of this complaint, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A (mandating screening and ultimate dismissal of prisoner\u2019s complaints if the complaint \u201cis frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted\u201d), the district court ordered Mr. Garza to show how his complaint states a claim for relief under \u00a7 1983. Mr. Garza responded to the district court\u2019s order by arguing that his defense counsel violated state professional conduct rules by not \u201cletting\u201d Mr. Garza enter an insanity plea and that therefore Mr. Garza\u2019s free speech rights were violated. In its final order, the district court dismissed Mr. Garza\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), which requires dismissal if the court determines that the action \u201cfails to state a claim on which relief may be granted.\u201d The district court also declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3) over any state law claim Mr. Garza intended to pursue for legal malpractice. Mr. Garza then filed the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss an in forma pauperis complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim. <em>Kay v. Bemis, </em>500 F.3d 1214, 1217 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">Dismissal of a pro se complaint for failure to state a claim is proper only where it is obvious that the plaintiff cannot prevail on the facts he has alleged and it would be futile to give him an opportunity to amend. In determining whether a dismissal is proper, we must accept the allegations of the complaint as true and construe those allegations, and any reasonable inferences that might be drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-8\"><em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). The same standard of review is applied for dismissals under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) as is applied for dismissals under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim. <em>Id. </em>at 1217-18. In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Twombly </em>decision, <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), this standard requires that we \u201clook to the specific allegations in the complaint to determine whether they plausibly support a legal claim for relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1218.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">\u201cPlaintiffs alleging a violation of \u00a7 1983<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> must demonstrate they have been deprived of a right secured by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, and that the defendants deprived them of this right acting under color of law.\u201d <em>Jenkins v. Currier, </em>514 F.3d 1030, 1032 (10th Cir.2008). However, the Supreme Court has stated that \u201ca public defender does not act under color of state law when performing a lawyer\u2019s traditional functions as counsel to a defendant in a criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 325, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981). In addition, \u201ceven though the defective performance of defense counsel may cause the trial process to deprive an accused person of his liberty in an unconstitutional manner, the lawyer who may be responsible for the unconstitutional state action does not himself act under color of state law within the meaning of \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Briscoe v. LaHue, </em>460 U.S. 325, 329 n. 6, 103 S.Ct. 1108, 75 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983). <em>See also Harris v. Champion, </em>51 F.3d 901, 909-10 (10th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>1995) (stating that \u201ceven if counsel performs what would otherwise be a traditional lawyer function ... so inadequately as to deprive the client of constitutional rights, defense counsel still will not be deemed to have acted under color of state law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Mr. Garza\u2019s complaint clearly alleges that the defendant, Mr. Bandy, was his appointed criminal defense counsel in his state court proceedings. Mr. Garza\u2019s complaint also alleges that Mr. Bandy was acting as his attorney at the time of the complained-of conduct, <em>i. e., </em>at the time of discussion of his plea options. The district court was correct in finding that the facts alleged \u2014 that Mr. Bandy was a public defender performing a lawyer\u2019s traditional functions as counsel to a defendant in a criminal proceeding \u2014 were insufficient to state a plausible claim that Mr. Bandy was acting under color of state law for purposes of \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">In his appellate brief, Mr. Garza cites the case of <em>West v. Atkins, </em>487 U.S. 42, 108 S.Ct. 2250, 101 L.Ed.2d 40 (1988), to support his proposition that Mr. Bandy was a state actor. However, <em>West </em>states only the general rule that \u201c[t]o constitute state action, the deprivation must be caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the State or by a person for whom the State is responsible, and the party charged with the deprivation must be a person who may fairly be said to be a state actor. State employment is generally sufficient to render the defendant a state actor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49, 108 S.Ct. 2250 (internal quotations omitted). <em>West </em>then goes on to discuss <em>Polk County </em>in detail, however, and specifically references the holding from <em>Polk Comity </em>that \u201ca public defender does not act under color of state law when performing a lawyer\u2019s traditional functions as counsel to a defendant in a criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50, 108 S.Ct. 2250. The <em>West </em>court also states that a public defender is different from a typical government employee and state actor because of his professional independence and his adversarial position against the State. <em>Id. </em>The <em>West </em>case, therefore, does not support Mr. Garza\u2019s position.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">Accordingly, the district court correctly dismissed Mr. Garza\u2019s complaint and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Mr Garza is reminded of his continuing obligation to make partial payments toward his appellate filing fee until the entire balance of the appellate filing fee is paid in full. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b)(1)\u2014 (2).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b591-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed.R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-22\">. Throughout the district court\u2019s proceedings, the defendant, Mr. Bandy, was not served and did not enter an appearance. Accordingly, Mr. Bandy has not responded to Mr. Garza\u2019s brief in these appellate proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b592-6\">. Section 1983 provides in relevant part: \u201cEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b593-7\">. Mr. Garza also cites the case of <em>Northington v. Jackson, </em>973 F.2d 1518 (10th Cir.1992), for the case's discussion of the pretrial points at which a district court may dismiss a pro se prisoner complaint, including when a claim is \"frivolous or malicious\" under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-19\">Mr. Garza apparently mistakenly believes his complaint was dismissed under this \"frivolous or malicious\" standard. Even a cursory reading of the district court's order of dismissal shows that it was not.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
