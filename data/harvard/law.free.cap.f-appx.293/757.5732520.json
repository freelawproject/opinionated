We agree with the district court that Tindall waived review of the merits of the sanctions order by failing to timely object to the magistrate\u2019s order. In this regard, we note that plaintiff has conceded that the magistrate\u2019s order was a nondispositive order governed by Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a). Even if the merits are reviewed, we agree with the district court that Tindall\u2019s challenges to the sanctions order are without merit. We agree with the district court that the 2005 federal suit was clearly barred by res judicata on account of the judgment in the 2005 state suit. We agree with the district court that there are no non-frivolous arguments against this res judicata holding. The sole recourse from the judgment in the 2005 state court suit would have been an appeal thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-18\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b783-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
