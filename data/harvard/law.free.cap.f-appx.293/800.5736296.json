Oct. 18, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>As a preliminary matter, we deem Chen\u2019s CAT claim abandoned, as he fails to raise it in his brief to this Court. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">When, as here, the BIA does not adopt the decision of the IJ in any respect, we review only the decision of the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Passi v. Mukasey, </em>535 F.3d 98, 101 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">For all appeals filed after September 25, 2002, the BIA may not engage in independent fact-finding or conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of the IJ\u2019s factual findings. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i), (iv). However, the BIA is authorized to review \u201cquestions of law, discretion, and judgment from decisions of immigration judges <em>de novo.\u201d </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">We conclude that the BIA did not conduct independent fact-finding in determining that Chen failed to establish \u201cother resistance\u201d to the family planning policy. Rather, it assumed the truth of the facts that Chen himself had proffered and found them insufficient to establish \u201cother resistance.\u201d Such review, requiring the BIA to apply a legal standard to a set of uncontested facts, was permissible under the regulations. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3) (ii); <em>Matter of A-S-B- </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 493, 497 (BIA 2008); <em>see also Matter of V-K-, </em>24 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 500, 501-02 (BIA 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">Nevertheless, Chen testified that he attempted to deceive the Chinese authorities and \u201ctold them that my wife would be sterilized and I ran away the next day,\u201d and argues that such actions constituted \u201cother resistance\u201d to the family planning policy. In <em>Matter of S-L-L-, </em>the BIA held that an applicant claiming persecution for \u201cother resistance\u201d must demonstrate: (1) \u201cresistance\u201d to a coercive family planning policy, which can \u201ccovert ] a wide range of circumstances, including expressions of general opposition, attempts to interfere with enforcement of government policy in particular cases, and other overt forms of resistance to the requirements of the family planning law\u201d; and (2) that the applicant has \u201csuffered harm amounting to persecution on account of that resistance.\u201d 24 I &amp; N. Dec. 1, 10-11 (BIA 2006), <em>overruled on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 309-10 (2d Cir.2007) <em>(\u201cShi Liang Lin II\u201d). </em>Thus, an individual whose spouse or partner has been subjected to a forced abortion or involuntary sterilization can qualify for \u201crefugee\u201d status under the BIA\u2019s interpretation if that individual can prove past persecution or a fear of future persecution for \u201cresistance\u201d that is directly related to his or her own opposition to a coercive family planning policy. <em>See Shi Liang Lin II, </em>494 F.3d at 313. Here, Chen was required to show that he has suffered persecution in the past or has a fear of future persecution on account of his alleged lie to the authorities and his subsequent flight. See <em>id. </em>His failure to make this showing proves fatal to his other resistance claim. Chen does not identify any portion of his testimony or his written submissions asserting that the Chinese authorities contin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>ue to seek his arrest on account of his \u201cother resistance.\u201d Nevertheless, he argues, \u201cThere would be no reason for this testimony to be developed or expanded at the hearing or in the record, because at the time of the hearing,\u201d he could establish eligibility for asylum based solely on his wife\u2019s forced sterilization. However, Chen\u2019s brief to the BIA indicates that there is no need to develop the record more fully, where he effectively acknowledged that his wife\u2019s forced sterilization erased any fear of persecution that he may have had as a result of his resistance to the authorities: \u201cAfter the forced sterilization, there was no need to hide.\u201d In light of that disavowal, the BIA did not err in denying Chen\u2019s family planning claim because it was based solely on his wife\u2019s forced sterilization. <em>See Shi Liang Lin II, </em>494 F.3d at 313; <em>Gui Yin Liu v. I.N.S., </em>508 F.3d 716, 723 (2d Cir.2007) (finding that claims based solely on a spouse\u2019s forced sterilization are \u201cdoomed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">Chen asserts that the BIA\u2019s decision was <em>ultra vires </em>and that it \u201cshould have determined whether [his] evidence presented was sufficient and credible to establish eligibility for [the] relief sought under the law at the time of the prior hearing.\u201d This argument is unavailing, as courts are bound \u201cto apply a rule of federal law retroactively after the case announcing the rule has already done so\u201d in all cases still open on direct review. <em>See Harper v. Virginia Dep\u2019t of Taxation, </em>509 U.S. 86, 97-98, 113 S.Ct. 2510, 125 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993). The BIA was therefore bound to apply <em>Shi Liang Lin II </em>to Chen\u2019s case, even though his merits hearing predated that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Chen further argues that he was denied due process of law because the BIA did not afford him the opportunity to submit written briefs or present additional evidence in light of the change in the law established by <em>Shi Liang Lin II. </em>In order to prevail on a claim alleging the denial of due process, an individual in removal proceedings must \u201callege some cognizable prejudice fairly attributable to the challenged process.\u201d <em>Garcia-Villeda v. Mukasey, </em>531 F.3d 141, 149 (2d Cir.2008) <em>(quoting Lattab v. Ashcroft, </em>384 F.3d 8, 20 (1st Cir.2004)). Here, Chen does not demonstrate that a new hearing or additional evidence would have changed the result in his case, as he has already acknowledged that \u201cthere was no need to hide\u201d from the authorities after his wife was sterilized. Because Chen has not shown that he was prejudiced by the BIA\u2019s actions, his due process claim fails. <em>See Garcia-Villeda, </em>531 F.3d at 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">Given that Chen was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, he was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir .2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
