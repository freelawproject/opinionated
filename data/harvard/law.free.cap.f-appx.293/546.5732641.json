We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">We have carefully reviewed the briefs and the record and we affirm the judgment for the reasons cogently set forth by the district court in its order of October 21, 2005, and its two orders of December 22, 2005 (one regarding Lahren\u2019s claims and one regarding Schweickert\u2019s claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">However, we do need to mention a few matters which, of necessity, were not addressed by the district court: (1) The district court determined that the May 14, 2002, United States Equal Opportunity Commission Settlement Agreement, and the Settlement of All Claims of the same date were valid and enforceable. <em>See Nilsson v. City of Mesa, </em>503 F.3d 947, 951-52 (9th Cir.2007); <em>Stroman v. W. Coast Grocery Co., </em>884 F.2d 458, 462 (9th Cir.1989). To the extent that the district court did not expressly address Karlin\u2019s argument that Lahren had released all claims against him for the period before the date of those settlements, it did so by necessary implication, and no claims against him remain; (2) To the extent that we are asked to address issues not raised before the district court or not raised in the opening brief, we decline so to do. <em>See Smith v. Marsh, </em>194 F.3d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir.1999); <em>Crawford v. Lungren, </em>96 F.3d 380, 389 n. 6 (9th Cir.1996); and (3) To the extent that Schweickert\u2019s equal protection claim is based upon a class-of-one theory, as it may well be, that theory is not available in this public employment case. <em>See Engquist v. Or. Dep\u2019t of Agric.,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 2146, 2157, 170 L.Ed.2d 975 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b572-31\"> -phjj disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>ed by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
