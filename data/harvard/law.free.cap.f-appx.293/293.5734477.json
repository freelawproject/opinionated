Garcia has filed a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-24\">The record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration, at this time, of Garcia\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Such claims, generally, \u201ccannot be resolved on direct appeal when [they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>have] not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations\u201d. <em>United States v.
