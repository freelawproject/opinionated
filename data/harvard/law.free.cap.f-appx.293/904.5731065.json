We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">Coffee pled guilty on August 23, 2006 to one count of being a felon (he was previously convicted in Pennsylvania state court of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute) in possession of a firearm, namely, a loaded Ruger nine-millimeter handgun.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argued in his sentencing memoranda that the probation department erred in the pre-sentence investigation report by including \u201cnumerous\u201d petty offenses, which he characterized as \u201cmore or less fines,\u201d when it calculated his criminal history. He also argued for a downward departure on the ground that the mother of three of his nine children has serious medical issues and that, as a result, his assistance is needed to take care of the children and their mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-16\">The District Judge held a sentencing hearing on May 3, 2007. Following argument, the Judge found that the probation department\u2019s assignment of four criminal history points for Coffee\u2019s prior convictions for failing to file earned income tax returns, criminal mischief/harassment and theft/simple assault/conspiracy, was warranted. After granting Coffee a three-level reduction for his acceptance of responsibility, the Judge adopted the findings of the pre-sentence investigation report and its offense level of 25, criminal history category of V, and sentencing guidelines range of 100 to 125 months. Because the statutory maximum sentence for the crime to which Coffee pled guilty was ten years, however, the guidelines range became 100 to 120 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-17\">Coffee called three witnesses in support of his motion for a downward departure\u2014 the mother of the three children, a clinical social worker, and a clinical therapist. The mother testified that she needed Coffee to help her conduct day-to-day activities and to assist in rearing their children. The two professionals concurred, testifying that Coffee played a positive role in the children\u2019s and their mother\u2019s lives. After considering this testimony, the Judge denied the motion for a downward departure and sentenced Coffee to a term of imprisonment of 100 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-18\">Coffee argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the District Judge \u201cin-clud[ed] petty offenses in calculating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>sentence\u201d and because the Judge \u201cdid not fully consider the defendant\u2019s family hardships and medical conditions when determining his sentence.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. 7.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1). We review sentences for procedural error and for substantive reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See United States v. Hoffecker, </em>530 F.3d 137, 196 (3d Cir.2008). If there was no procedural error and if the sentence \u201cfalls within the broad range of possible sentences that can be considered reasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we must affirm.\u201d <em>United States v. Wise, </em>515 F.3d 207, 217 (3d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(c), a defendant\u2019s criminal history computation shall include one point for each of certain misdemeanor and petty offenses resulting in sentences of less than 60 days, up to a maximum of four points. Section 4A1.2(c) lists generally the types of offenses that shall be included and those that shall not be included under section 4Al.l(c). Coffee argued at the sentencing hearing that the convictions that were included in the computation \u201care not reflective of the matter before the court,\u201d that \u201c[tjhey\u2019re summary,\u201d and that to include them \u201cwould not be reflective of the nature of his crimes.\u201d (App. at 57.) The District Judge did not err in determining that those convictions were properly included. The fact that the convictions were of a different nature than the crime to which Coffee pled guilty, and that they were \u201csummary\u201d in nature, is not violative of any requirement in section 4Al.l(c). Moreover, the Judge noted that the four points \u201cput the defendant at the top of category 5, and that even if two of the three points were excluded he would still be in [criminal history] category 5.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 83.) Indeed, Coffee had been convicted of an additional three crimes that could have been assigned points under section 4Al.l(c) but were not because he had already been assigned the maximum allowable number of points\u2014 four.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">Coffee\u2019s second argument \u2014 that his sentence is unreasonable because the District Judge failed to account for his extraordinary family circumstances \u2014 also fails. After hearing evidence from three witnesses who testified that Coffee was needed in the lives of three of his children and their mother, the Judge stated that he was \u201cnot unsympathetic or unmindful of the delicate nature of the problems facing this family unit, but I don\u2019t believe that Mr. Coffee has been providing the sustenance and assistance that you [counsel] suggest he has provided or would like to provide.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 78.) Indeed, Coffee had been in prison for the preceding two years and had been a fugitive before then. Moreover, as the Judge found, \u201c[i]t appears as though the defendant has four additional children since the children that he had with [the testifying mother]. So clearly he has not been a stay at home father\u201d despite the arguments that had been made. <em>(Id. </em>at 76.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">The District Judge committed no procedural error and the sentence imposed was substantively reasonable. We will affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b931-14\">. Because Coffee only challenges his sentence, we need not discuss the facts surrounding the crime to which he pled guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b932-5\">. Coffee does not argue on appeal that his motion for a downward departure was wrongly denied, and the argument section of his brief on appeal totals less than three pages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b932-11\">. The pre-sentence investigation report reflects, and Coffee does not dispute, that he has nine children by six women.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
