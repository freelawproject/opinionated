We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Ochoa v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1166, 1169 (9th Cir.2005), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Even if their asylum application had been timely filed, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that petitioners failed to establish eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal, because they did not provide evidence indicating that they were or would be targeted on account of a protected ground. <em>See id. </em>at 1170-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">Because we reach the merits of petitioners\u2019 asylum claim, we decline to consider petitioners\u2019 contention that their due process rights were violated by ineffective assistance of counsel with regard to the untimely filing of their asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Tuyen Hong did not show that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to Vietnam. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b471-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
