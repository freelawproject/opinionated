The Magistrate Judge permitted him to proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>and join the Texas Republican Party. However, he admonished Smith to file a more detailed complaint that stated claims within the jurisdiction and venue of the court and contained the level of factual recitations required by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as construed by the Court in <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 (West 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">Instead, Smith simply filed an Amended Complaint containing only three paragraphs of allegations. In those paragraphs, he complained that his right to be a candidate <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was violated by the defendants and that the defendants acted \u201cunder color of law.\u201d He asserted vague constitutional rights. Further, he alleged his \u201cFirst Amendment right to protection from Zionism and/or Christian-Zionists\u201d under the establishment clause of the First Amendment. \u201cPlaintiff further asserts an implied principle of \u2018fairness in communication\u2019 in that the Defendants ... have acquiesced to the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and have allowed only Zionistic campaigns within the (two major political party) campaign coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">Smith has wholly failed to allege claims stating a case for relief against any party. Despite clear and specific directives from the Magistrate Judge, he has filed a con-clusory pleading without any of the information necessary to state a claim. Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing the Amended Complaint. The final judgment in this case is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b273-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-11\">. It is unclear for what office and under what party label Smith contends he was a candidate. In a motion filed with the district court, he alleged he was denied the right to participate in the Iowa and Texas Republican \"straw polls\u201d for the Presidential race. However, a letter in the district court record from the Texas Republican Party wishes him the \"best of luck in your primary against Misters Kelly, McMurrey and Noriega,\u201d who were candidates for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate from Texas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
