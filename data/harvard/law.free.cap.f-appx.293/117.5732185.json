At issue is whether there was reasonable suspicion to stop and investigate Cooper, whether there was probable cause to arrest Cooper, and whether the arresting officers\u2019 testimony was improperly credited. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-21\">At 8:25 PM on September 8, 2004, while surveilling a high-crime area, Philadelphia Police Officer Marcus Alen observed Cooper exit a black Lexus and approach two men on a street corner.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cooper spoke to the men for five to ten minutes. Officer Alen then observed Cooper lift his shirt, displaying a silver handgun to the men. Cooper then returned to his car and drove away. Officer Alen radioed three assisting officers, who pulled Cooper over two blocks away, removed him from his car, and took the weapon from his waistband. The weapon was a nine millimeter semiautomatic handgun with its serial number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>scratched off. It was loaded with eleven live rounds in the magazine and one live round in the chamber. When the officers asked Cooper if he had a license for the weapon, he responded that he did not. The officers also observed a large quantity of crack cocaine in plain view on the floor of Cooper\u2019s car. The police seized the crack cocaine and firearm and arrested Cooper.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In District Court, Cooper moved to suppress the weapon and drug evidence seized by the officers. The District Court denied the motion, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">The Court concludes that when Officer Allen saw the defendant lift his shirt and reveal the gun in his waistband, and radioed that information to his backup officers, the backup officers had reasonable suspicion to conduct a <em>Terry </em>stop of the car. They had a basis at that point to get the defendant out of the car for their own safety. It was then permissible for the officer to put his hand where Officer Allen said that he saw the gun. Once Officer Wiley retrieved the gun, he asked the defendant if he had a permit for it. The defendant said no. At this point, there was probable cause to arrest the defendant. In addition, Officer Wiley saw the bag of what appeared to be crack cocaine in plain view inside the car. He, therefore, could legally seize the contraband. At that point, there was also probable cause to arrest the defendant for narcotics violations as well as for firearms violations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Cooper appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">Cooper contends the stop of his vehicle was improper because it was not based on Officer Allen\u2019s reasonable suspicion. Under Pennsylvania law, police officers may perform an \u201cinvestigative detention\u201d of a vehicle if they have reasonable suspicion to do so. <em>E.g., Commonwealth v. Hill, </em>874 A.2d 1214, 1217 (Pa.Super.Ct.2005); cf<em>. Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) (holding a police officer may stop a suspect and search for weapons where the officer \u201cobserves unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot\u201d). Because a firearm may be lawfully possessed under some circumstances, Cooper contends the facts here \u2014 Officer Allen\u2019s mere viewing of Cooper in possession of a weapon on a public street in Philadelphia \u2014 did not create reasonable suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">But Pennsylvania courts have consistently held an officer\u2019s observance of an individual\u2019s possession of a firearm in a public place in Philadelphia is sufficient to create reasonable suspicion to detain that individual for further investigation. <em>Commonwealth v. Romero, </em>449 Pa.Super. 194, 673 A.2d 374, 377 (1996); <em>Commonweath v. Robinson, </em>410 Pa.Super. 614, 600 A.2d 957, 959 (1991) (\u201c[Pjossession of a concealed firearm by an individual in public is sufficient to create a reasonable suspicion that the individual may be dangerous, such that an officer can approach the individual and briefly detain him in order to investigate whether the person is properly licensed.\u201d). Accordingly, Cooper\u2019s contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>In <em>Commonwealth v. Bigelow, </em>484 Pa. 476, 399 A.2d 392, 396 (1979), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that licensure is an affirmative defense to a statutory violation for possession of a firearm, 18 Pa. Cons.Stat \u00a7 6108 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 rather than non-licensure constituting an element of the crime that must be proved by the prosecution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Officer Allen\u2019s decision to stop Cooper\u2019s vehicle was based on reasonable suspicion, and the motion to suppress evidence was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Cooper also contends his arrest was unlawful because it was not supported by probable cause. After discovering Cooper possessed a concealed firearm, the police officers asked him whether he was licensed to carry a concealed weapon. Cooper admitted illegal activity by responding that he was not licensed. <em>See 18 </em>Pa. Cons.Stat \u00a7 6108 (requiring a license to possess a concealed weapon in public). Additionally, the officers observed what they recognized to be crack cocaine in plain view in Cooper\u2019s vehicle. On these facts, the police had probable cause to arrest Cooper. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hensley, </em>469 U.S. 221, 235-36, 105 S.Ct. 675, 83 L.Ed.2d 604 (1985) (\u201cHaving stopped [the Defendant], the ... police were entitled to seize evidence revealed in plain view in the course of the lawful stop, to arrest [the Defendant\u2019s] passenger when evidence discovered in plain view gave probable cause to believe the passenger had committed a crime, and subsequently to search the passenger compartment of the car because it was within the passenger\u2019s immediate control.... [And h]aving discovered additional weapons in [the Defendant\u2019s] car during the course of a lawful search, the ... officers had probable cause to arrest [the Defendant] himself for possession of firearms.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-14\">Cooper also appeals the District Court\u2019s factual findings that credited the testimony of the arresting officers. We agree with the District Court that the four Philadelphia Police Officers were credible and had no reason to fabricate a detailed story involving Cooper\u2019s arrest. We see no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-15\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-16\">Accordingly, we see no error in the District Court\u2019s denial of Cooper\u2019s motion to suppress and will affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-13\">. The District Court sentenced Cooper to 97 months\u2019 incarceration on each of counts one and three, to be served concurrently, and to 60 months' incarceration on count two, to be served consecutively. Cooper was also sentenced to four years\u2019 supervised release and a $300 special assessment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b144-23\">. We restate the facts as found by the District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b145-8\">. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise plenary review over a District Court\u2019s determination of reasonable suspicion and probable cause. <em>United States v. Valentine, </em>232 F.3d 350, 353 (3d Cir.2000) (citation omitted). We review the District Court's findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>280 F.3d 318, 336 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\">. 18 Pa. Cons.Stat \u00a7 6108 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">No person shall carry a firearm, rifle or shotgun at any time upon the public streets or upon any public property in a city of the first class unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">(1) such person is licensed to carry a firearm; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-10\">(2) such person is exempt from licensing under section 6106 of this title.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b146-11\">. Subsequently, the Pennsylvania legislature amended a separate section of the Uniform Firearms Act to state that a gun owner's failure to produce proof of gun licensure upon lawful demand by a law enforcement officer \"shall create a rebuttable presumption of nonlicensure.\u201d 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 6122. Cooper contends \"[t]he addition and amendment of \u00a7 6122 after the adoption of \u00a7 6108 and its interpretation in Bigelow signifies the legislature\u2019s intent to change the Uniform Firearms Act.\" Cooper Br. at 11 (citations omitted). On this view, according to Cooper, \"licensure under \u00a7 6108 is an evidentiary presumption, not an affirmative defense,\" <em>id. </em>at 11-12, and therefore the potential for non-licensure would not be sufficient to create a reasonable suspicion when a law enforcement officer observes the possession of a firearm in a public place. We see no merit to this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
