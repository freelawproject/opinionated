Pursuant to the parties\u2019 agreement, the district court resolved the dispute based on trial memo-randa, concluding that AI Life had arbitrarily and capriciously denied benefits. The district court awarded full policy benefits of $25,000, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs. Because AI Life did not abuse its discretion in denying benefits, we reverse and render judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b383-13\">Wal-Mart established an Employee Welfare Benefit Plan, and AIG Life Insurance Companies insured the Plan\u2019s benefits. AI Life, an AIG affiliate, issued a Dependent Life and Accidental Death and Dismemberment Policy to insure death or dismemberment benefits for certain dependents of covered Wal-Mart employees. Peggy Young was a covered employee, and her husband Earl Young was a dependent.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-14\">The AI Life policy provides for \u201caccidental death\u201d benefits if \u201c[ijnjury to an [insured [dependent\u201d results in the dependent\u2019s death. In the policy, \u201c \u2018Injury\u2019 means bodily injury caused by an accident occurring while the Policy is in force with respect to the person whose injury is the basis of the claim and results directly and independently of all other causes in a covered loss.\u201d The policy expressly excludes benefits for \u201cany loss caused in whole or in part by, or resulting in whole or in part from ... sickness, disease or infections of any kind.\u201d \u201cSickness\u201d is defined as \u201cillness or disease diagnosed by a Physician.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-15\">Earl Young suffered from hypertension with a history of vomiting, choking, and becoming unconscious. Approximately ten days before his death, Earl Young stopped taking his hypertension medication. A week later, he said he did not feel well, vomited, and became unconscious. He was taken by ambulance to River West Medical Center. Dr. Mark Portacci, Earl Young\u2019s treating physician, noted upon admission that \u201cpatient has severe hypertension and stopped taking his medication over one week ago. Upon having a vomit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>ing spell, then passing out, the ambulance was called. By the time he got to the ER, the patient was having what could have been seizure activity and then became comatose and unresponsive to pain requiring intubation and ventilation.\u201d Dr. Portacci initially assessed his condition to include \u201cMypertensive emergency: Hypertension with history of noncompliance and is currently status epilepticus.\u201d A chest X-ray indicated that Earl Young suffered from, among other things, pulmonary venous hypertension.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">After showing no signs of improvement, Earl Young\u2019s ventilator was withdrawn, and he expired. On the River West Discharge Summary, Dr. Portacci listed the cause of death as \u201c[c]hoking resulting in syncope and vomiting and possible aspiration with severe hypertension and anoxic brain injury.\u201d However, on the death certificate, Dr. Portacci stated the cause of death to be \u201c[rjespiratory arrest[;] choking \u2014 Foreign body aspirated into trachea[;] anoxic brain injury,\u201d without mentioning hypertension. Dr. Portacci also described the death as an \u201cAccident\u201d for the first time on the death certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Following her husband\u2019s death, Peggy Young filed an application for accidental death benefits under the Plan. AI Life then consulted Dr. James Lewis, a forensic pathologist with the International Institute of Forensic Science, and requested an independent evaluation and opinion. In his report, Dr. Lewis summarized the River West medical records followed by a series of questions and answers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">Q. In your opinion what was the cause of death?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">A. In my opinion the cause of death is uncontrolled hypertension and complication thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">Q. In your opinion what was the manner of death?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-9\">A. In my opinion the manner of death is natural.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-10\">Q. In your opinion was the decedent\u2019s death due: to an accident clear and free of any [and] all illness or disease states?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-11\">A. No, in my opinion the decedent suffered with severe uncontrolled Chronic Hypertension which resulted in his death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-12\">Q. In your opinion were there any illness [sic] or diseases that played a significant or major, role in his death?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-13\">A. Yes, the decedent suffered with severe uncontrolled hypertension and was non-compliant with his anti hypertensive medications for 1 week.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">AI Life denied Young\u2019s application stating that it relied on \u201cthe facts and circumstances surrounding the insured\u2019s death,\u201d including its review of medical records from River West. AI Life\u2019s denial letter did not mention Dr. Lewis\u2019s report, although, as the district court noted, a copy of that report is included in the administrative record. Young appealed the decision, during which time Dr. Portacci submitted a one-paragraph letter stating that Earl Young\u2019s death was \u201ccaused by an accidental choking.... Therefore, it was an accidental death.\u201d AI Life affirmed its decision to deny benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-15\">Peggy Young filed suit in the 18th Judicial District Court for the Parish of Iber-ville, Louisiana, and Wal-Mart and AI Life removed to federal district court. After the parties agreed to submit the case for \u201ctrial\u201d on briefs only, the district court held that AI Life had arbitrarily and capriciously denied death benefits to Young and awarded policy benefits of $25,000, as well as $8,333.33 in attorney\u2019s fees. The district court reasoned that AI Life abused its discretion in relying on Dr. Lewis\u2019s report because \u201c[h]is findings failed to es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>tablish a causal connection between Young\u2019s controlled or uncontrolled hypertension and his choking!,]\u201d and \u201cfail[ed] to demonstrate a causal connection, through medical evidence outside of Mr. Young\u2019s medical records, between either controlled or uncontrolled hypertension and vomiting or choking.\u201d Wal-Mart and AI Life now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">ERISA provides federal courts with jurisdiction to review benefit determinations by fiduciaries or plan administrators.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consistent with established principles of trust law, courts review <em>de novo </em>a denial of benefits challenged under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When a plan grants \u201cthe administrator or fiduciary <em>discretionary authority </em>to determine eligibility for benefits, ... [t]rust principles make a <em>deferential standard </em>of review appropriate,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and a court reviews an administrator\u2019s denial of ERISA benefits for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination of whether the administrator abused its discretion in denying benefits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-15\">When, as here, the insurer of plan benefits also determines eligibility for benefits, a conflict of interest exists.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court recently explained in <em>Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Glenn, </em>\u201c[tjrust law continues to apply a deferential standard of review to the discretionary decisionmaking of a conflicted trustee, while at the same time requiring the reviewing judge to take account of the conflict when determining whether the trustee, substantively or proeedurally, has abused his discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201c[Conflicts are but one factor among many that a reviewing judge must take into account.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Judges will often \u201ctak[e] account of several different, often case-specific, factors, reaching a result by weighing all together.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cIn such instances, any one factor will act as a tiebreaker when the other factors are closely balanced, the degree of closeness necessary depending upon the tiebreaking factor\u2019s inherent or case-specific importance.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-16\">The Supreme Court further explained in <em>Glenn </em>that an administrator\u2019s conflict of interest arising from its role in determining eligibility \u201cshould prove more important (perhaps of great importance) where circumstances suggest a higher likelihood that it affected the benefits decision, including, but not limited to, cases where an insurance company administrator has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>history of biased claims administration.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Conversely, the conflict</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHO\">should prove less important (perhaps to the vanishing point) where the administrator has taken active steps to reduce potential bias and to promote accuracy, for example, by walling off claims administrators from those interested in firm finances, or by imposing management checks that penalize inaccurate decision-making irrespective of whom the inaccuracy benefits.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7H\">In <em>Glenn, </em>the Supreme Court found \u201cnothing improper\u201d in the Sixth Circuit\u2019s review in which that court had observed that the insurance company \u201chad emphasized a certain medical report that favored denial of benefits, had deemphasized certain other reports that suggested a contrary conclusion, and had failed to provide its independent vocational and medical experts with all of the relevant evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"alm-dedup-0\">In the present case, there is no evidence that AI Life has a history of biased claims administration. Nor is there any evidence that AI Life failed to provide its independent expert with all relevant evidence. On the other hand, there is no evidence that AI Life has \u201cwall[ed] off claims administrators from those interested in firm finances.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> AI Life did not emphasize any report over another, but its decision to deny benefits reflects that it did not accept an opinion expressed by Earl Young\u2019s treating physician. We nevertheless conclude that on balance, based on the record as a whole, the conflict of interest factor is not of great importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">The Supreme Court observed \u201cthat <em>Firestone </em>means what the word \u2018factor\u2019 implies, namely, that when judges review the lawfulness of benefit denials, they will often take account of several different considerations of which a conflict of interest is one.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Court analogized review of an ERISA plan administrator\u2019s denial of benefits to the standards of review applied in trust and administrative law, noting \u201cjudges ... determine lawfulness by taking account of several different, often case-specific, factors, reaching a result by weighing all together,\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> citing its decisions in <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe,</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB.</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, </em>the Secretary of Transportation authorized construction of an interstate highway through a public park.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-12\">Both the Department of Transportation Act and the Federal-Aid to Highway Act provide that the Secretary \u2018shall not approve any program or project\u2019 that requires the use of any public parkland \u201cunless (1) there is no feasible and prudent alternative to the use of such land, and (2) such program includes all possible planning to minimize harm to such park.... \u201d This language is a plain and explicit bar to the use of federal funds for construction of highways through parks \u2014 only the most unusual situations are exempted.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>The Court then held that the standard for reviewing the Secretary\u2019s decision was governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Court held that neither the substantial evidence nor the <em>de novo </em>standards of review applied, but that \u201cthe generally applicable standards of \u00a7 706 require the reviewing court to engage in a substantial inquiry.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> If the Secretary acted within his or her authority, \u201c[sjcrutiny of the facts ... requires a finding that the actual choice made was not \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Reviewing courts \u201cmust consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment. Although this inquiry into the facts is to be searching and careful, the ultimate standard of review is a narrow one.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> An appellate court is \u201cnot empowered to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-19\">In the <em>Universal Camera Corp. </em>decision,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> cited as another guidepost in <em>Glenn,</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Supreme Court examined the phrase \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence\u201d in the Administrative Procedure Act,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and the phrase \u201cif supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole\u201d in the Taft-Hartley Act.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The Court held, \u201cIt would be mischievous wordplaying to find that the scope of review under the Taft-Hartley Act is any different from that under the Administrative Procedure Act,\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The Court proceeded to explain how reviewing courts are to conduct a substantial evidence review.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Although it is not entirely clear from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Glenn </em>whether a \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d determination is included in our review to determine if AI Life abused its discretion, we conclude, for the reasons that follow, that AI Life\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, and that based on the record as a whole, the decision was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The decision to deny benefits finds support in the record. The hospital admissions records indicate that the treating physician, Dr. Portaeci, described Earl Young\u2019s \u201cPresent Illness\u201d as severe hypertension with a \u201cPast Medical History\u201d of hypertension. Dr. Portaeci later noted that Earl Young arrived at the emergency room in hypertensive emergency and the subsequent chest x-ray showed, among other things, \u201cpulmonary venous hypertension.\u201d Further, Dr. Portaeci noted in the treatment records that Earl Young had a \u201cclear\u201d history of vomiting, choking, and syncope \u2014 the same conditions leading to his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">After reviewing the River West medical records, Dr. Lewis, the forensic pathologist consulted by AI Life, concluded that the cause of death was \u201cuncontrolled hypertension and complication thereof.\u201d Rather than an accident that was not the result \u201cin whole or in part from ... sickness, disease or infection of any kind,\u201d Dr. Lewis opined that Earl Young \u201csuffered with severe uncontrolled Chronic Hypertension which resulted in his death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Despite the evidence in the medical records, Young argues that the plan administrator abused its discretion in relying on Dr. Lewis\u2019s report because the report failed to establish a causal connection between her husband\u2019s hypertension and his choking. However, when asked \u201cwere there any illness [sic] or diseases that played a significant or major role in his death,\u201d Dr. Lewis specifically stated \u201c[y]es, the decedent suffered with severe uncontrolled hypertension and was non-compliant with his anti hypertensive medications for 1 week.\u201d Young also focuses on whether hypertension was the cause of her husband\u2019s choking, rather than whether his choking was \u201can accident\u201d that \u201cresulted] directly and independently of all other causes.\u201d The medical records reflect that Earl Young described what was happening to him before he became unconscious, saying \u201cthat he did not feel good\u201d and that he then vomited and passed out. This does not indicate that he suddenly choked on a foreign object, as his physician opined only after Earl Young\u2019s death. In light of Earl Young\u2019s history of choking and vomiting followed by unconsciousness, his history of \u201cnoncompliance\u201d in managing his hypertension, and the admission records, it was reasonable to conclude that his death was \u201ccaused in whole or in part by, or resulted] in whole or in part from ... sickness [or] disease ... of any kind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">Young also contends that AI Life abused its discretion when it chose to rely on a medical consultant rather than the treating physician. The Supreme Court has made clear that while \u201c[p]lan administrators ... may not arbitrarily refuse to credit a claimant\u2019s reliable evidence, including the opinions of a treating physician,\u201d reviewing \u201ccourts have no warrant to require administrators automatically to accord special weight to the opinions of a claimant\u2019s phy-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>sitian; nor may courts impose on plan administrators a discrete burden of explanation when they credit reliable evidence that conflicts with a treating physician\u2019s evaluation.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In the present case, as discussed above, there was credible evidence that conflicted with the treating physician\u2019s evaluation, including credible evidence from the treating physician\u2019s own records regarding the symptoms \u2014 vomiting, choking, and syncope \u2014 Earl Young had a history of displaying. Courts cannot second guess the weight that AI Life gave to the treating physician\u2019s and the independent expert\u2019s respective opinions. \u201c[T]he job of weighing valid, conflicting professional medical opinions is not the job of the courts; that job has been given to the administrators of ERISA plans.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The administrative record contained substantial evidence, \u201ceven if disputable,\u201d that supports the plan administrator\u2019s denial of benefits.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Based on that evidence, and taking into consideration the minimal conflict of interest, AI Life did not abuse its discretion in denying benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The district court had discretion to award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and court costs under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1), including to the non-prevailing party. \u201cSuch an award is purely discretionary, and we review the district court\u2019s decision only for an abuse of discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Wal-Mart and AI Life argue that the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to Young was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">In an ERISA case, the district court applies the five factors enumerated in <em>Iron Workers Local No. 272 v. Bowen,</em><footnotemark><em>38</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to determine whether the party is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Those factors are: (1) the degree of the opposing parties\u2019 culpability or bad faith; (2) the ability of the opposing parties to satisfy an award of attorney\u2019s fees; (3) whether an award of attorney\u2019s fees against the opposing parties would deter other persons acting under similar circumstances; (4) whether the party requesting attorney\u2019s fees sought to benefit all participants and beneficiaries of an ERISA plan or to resolve a significant legal question regarding ERISA itself; and (5) the relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">Under the first factor, the degree of culpability or bad faith, the district court found that AI Life acted in bad faith because it failed to adequately explain the reasons for its denial and the medical records failed to support the plan administrator\u2019s decision to deny benefits. However, the plan administrator\u2019s decision was sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>ported by the medical records,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> and the plan administrator did not make its decision in bad faith and was not culpable. Accordingly, the first factor weighs against the award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">As to the second factor, we agree with the district court that there is no indication that AI Life is incapable of satisfying an award of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. Therefore, this factor supports the award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">With regard to the third <em>Bowen </em>factor, the district court found that an award of attorney\u2019s fees may encourage other insurers to exercise greater care when reviewing claims for benefits. However, the district court based its finding on the belief that the plan administrator abused its discretion in denying benefits to Young. Because the administrator did not abuse its discretion, awarding attorney\u2019s fees would not encourage other insurers to exercise greater care when reviewing claims for benefits. Instead, awarding attorney\u2019s fees to Young would encourage claimants with non-meritorious claims to contest the denial of benefits in a court of law. The third factor weighs against the award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The district court found the fourth factor, whether the party requesting attorney\u2019s fees sought to benefit all participants of an ERISA plan or resolve a significant question regarding ERISA, to not be a significant consideration. Young admits that requesting attorney\u2019s fees does not raise nor resolve a significant legal question regarding ERISA. Nor does Young seek attorney\u2019s fees for the benefit of all plan participants. Accordingly, the fourth factor weighs against awarding attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Finally, the district court determined that the fifth factor, the relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions, favored an award of attorney\u2019s fees because AI Life lacked factual or evidentiary support. The substantial evidence in the administrative record supports the plan administrator\u2019s decision. Therefore, the fifth factor also weighs against awarding attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Because four of the five <em>Bowen </em>factors weigh against awarding attorney\u2019s fees, and the only factor weighing in favor is the defendant\u2019s ability to pay, we conclude that the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE and RENDER judgment that the plaintiff take nothing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-17\">To be sure, the requirement for canvassing 'the whole record\u2019 in order to ascertain sub-stantiality does not furnish a calculus of value by which a reviewing court can assess the evidence. Nor was it intended to negative the function of the Labor Board as one of those agencies presumably equipped or informed by experience to deal with a specialized field of knowledge, whose findings within that field carry the authority of an expertness which courts do not possess and therefore must respect. Nor does it mean that even as to matters not requiring expertise a court may displace the Board\u2019s choice between two fairly conflicting views, even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it <em>de novo. </em>Congress has merely made it clear that a reviewing court is not barred from setting aside a Board decision when it cannot conscientiously find that the evidence supporting that decision is substantial, when viewed in the light that the record in its entirety furnishes, including the body of evidence opposed to the Board's view.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-21\">... Reviewing courts must be influenced by a feeling that they are not to abdicate the conventional judicial function. Congress has imposed on them responsibility for assuring that the Board keeps within reasonable grounds. That responsibility is not less real because it is limited to enforcing the requirement that evidence appear substantial when viewed, on the record as a whole, by courts invested with the authority and enjoying the prestige of the Courts of Appeals. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Board\u2019s findings are entitled to respect; but they must nonetheless be set aside when the record before a Court of Appeals clearly precludes the Board\u2019s decision from being justified by a fair estimate of the worth of the testimony of witnesses or its informed judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>ment on matters within its special competence or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b389-9\">. <em>Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v.
