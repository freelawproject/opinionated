Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review factual findings for substantial evidence, reversing only if the evidence compels the result, <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We review an IJ\u2019s denial of a motion for a continuance for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Sandoval-Luna v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 1243, 1246 (9th Cir.2008). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that petitioners\u2019 lack of serious injury, general discrimination, and harassment are insufficient to compel the conclusion that they suffered past persecution. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2003). Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that petitioners failed to establish an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution in light of the fact that they have similarly situated immediate family members who have remained in Indonesia unharmed. <em>See Anita v. INS, </em>80 F.3d 1389, 1395 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Because petitioners did not establish eligibility for asylum, it necessarily follows that they did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because petitioners have not shown that it is more likely than not that they will be tortured if returned to Indonesia. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">We conclude that the IJ did not abuse his discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion for a continuance. <em>See Sandoval-Luna, </em>526 F.3d at 1247. We also conclude that petitioners\u2019 due process contention lacks merit because they have not established that they were prejudiced by the denial of a continuance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">We lack jurisdiction to review petitioners\u2019 contention that the IJ should have allowed the expert witness to testify because they failed to exhaust it before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part, DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b513-25\">This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
