Ct. Hartford Dec. 15, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Before this Court, petitioner sought only remand to the IJ so that her visa application could be adjudicated. Subsequent to the parties\u2019 briefing in this case, however, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (\u201cUSCIS\u201d) denied a visa application by petitioner\u2019s purported husband, Todd Wallace, on her behalf. Mr. Wallace filed a motion with the USCIS to reopen the petition, which the agency denied. Next, Mr. Wallace appealed US-CIS\u2019s denial of his visa application on behalf of Ms. Gadi.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">In light of these developments, the government filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that petitioner\u2019s challenge to the IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance is moot as a result of USCIS\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s husband\u2019s visa application. We agree. Even if we were to determine that the IJ abused its discretion in not granting petitioner\u2019s motion for a continuance, we could not provide relief that would alter the outcome of petitioner\u2019s case, as her visa application has now been adjudicated. Should the BIA affirm USCIS\u2019s order in response to Mr. Wallace\u2019s appeal, Mr. Wallace may bring a new petition for review of that decision. Whatever course of action Mr. Wallace may pursue in the future, petitioner no longer has a \u201cpersonal stake\u201d in this particular litigation, and we therefore lack subject matter jurisdiction over the action. <em>In re Kurtzman, </em>194 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the government\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED, and the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
