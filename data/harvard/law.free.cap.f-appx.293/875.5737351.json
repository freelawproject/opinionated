For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">Inasmuch as we are writing primarily for the parties who are familiar with this case, we need not reiterate the factual or procedural background except insofar as may be helpful to our brief discussion. Pajollari is a native and citizen of Albania who attempted to gain admission into the United States by using a false Belgian passport.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">Prior to his merits hearing, Pajollari offered numerous supplements to his asylum application. On July 25, 2005, Pajol-lari appeared for his asylum hearing with yet another supplement. This time it was an undated eleven page, single-spaced document purporting to supplement his existing asylum claim. Counsel for DHS argued that the most recent \u201csupplement\u201d was more in the nature of a new asylum petition than a supplement to the existing one. However, the IJ agreed to consider the supplement over the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">Because of the differences between Pa-jollari\u2019s original asylum application and the new supplement, a short recess was called to allow the IJ and counsel for DHS to review the supplement. However, when the hearing resumed, the tape was not running. Therefore, when the IJ resumed recording, the IJ summarized her recollection of what had transpired, including opening statements by Pajollari\u2019s counsel and DHS counsel. Neither party objected to the IJ\u2019s summary of the opening statements, although Pajollari\u2019s counsel stated that she did not recall any mention in Pajollari\u2019s submissions of a grenade being thrown. In response, the IJ noted that the grenade was mentioned during the credible fear interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-14\">The IJ then summarized a short portion of Pajollari\u2019s testimony, which was consistent with Pajollari\u2019s latest supplement. The IJ recounted that Pajollari\u2019s explanation of why his asylum statement was so different from his asylum application was that Pajollari was \u201cnot used to being questioned.\u201d AR 97-98. The IJ first noticed the tape was not running when Pajollari was asked if the asylum <em>statement </em>and the asylum <em>application </em>were prepared at the same time. At this point, the IJ, on the record, asked Pajollari about the discrepancies between his asylum application, and his credible fear interview and supporting materials:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-15\">Q: All right. Now, your attorney wants to know why [the filings are] so different. The Court wants to know why they\u2019re so different.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-16\">A: I don\u2019t even understand myself why they\u2019re different.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-17\">AR 99. Pajollari said that the documents were not prepared the same day and that his attorney asked him to \u201ccreate\u201d a history for himself. <em>Id. </em>He said that he did not recall when he finished his statement. When questioned about his girlfriend, Pa-jollari said that he had lost all contact with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>In denying Pajollari\u2019s claims for relief, the IJ found that Pajollari had not testified credibly. The IJ explained that there were substantial discrepancies that were never adequately explained. The IJ found that Pajollari had not established a meritorious asylum claim based on either his alleged attack on account of his membership in the Democratic Party, or his relationship with Niko, the Socialist Party leader, because he failed to demonstrate any government complicity or that any abuse was based on something that was protected under the INA. She further found that Pajollari could not establish any well-founded fear of future persecution if he were returned to Albania. Accordingly, the IJ denied Pajollari all relief from removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">On appeal to the BIA, Pajollari argued the merits of his asylum claim and advanced an argument that his due process rights were violated because the transcript of the hearing contained numerous indiscernible words. He also alleged that the IJ was biased based on the IJ\u2019s exchange with his counsel about the incident with the grenade.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, and found that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was not \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i). It also found no evidence of a due process violation by the IJ. This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">Where the BIA both adopts the findings of the IJ and discusses some of the bases for the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA. <em>Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>376 F.3d 215, 222 (3d Cir.2004). Judicial review of immigration matters is limited. <em>INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002). The BIA\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d INA \u00a7 242(b)(4)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Under this deferential standard, we will not reverse the agency\u2019s findings \u201csimply because an alternative finding could be supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Yan Lan Wu v. Ashcroft, </em>393 F.3d 418, 424-25 (3d Cir.2005). Instead, the petitioner must establish that the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion, but compels it. <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir.2002) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-14\">The Attorney General may not remove an alien to a country if the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in that country on account of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A); <em>see also INS v. Stevie, </em>467 U.S. 407, 413, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984). To be eligible for this relief, the alien must establish a \u201cclear probability of persecution\u201d on account of one of the foregoing grounds. <em>Stevie, </em>467 U.S. at 413, 104 S.Ct. 2489. The burden of proof for establishing eligibility for withholding of removal is more stringent than the burden required for asylum. <em>Lukwago v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 157, 183 (3d Cir.2003). The clear probability standard has no subjective component. It requires objective evidence that it is more likely than not that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>alien will be subject to persecution upon removal. <em>See Chen v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d 212, 216 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">To qualify for CAT relief, an alien must show that it is more likely than not that he/she would be tortured by the government of the proposed country of removal, or that the government would acquiesce in torture at the hands of others. <em>Amanfi v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 719, 726 (3d Cir.2003); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2). Torture is \u201can extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment and does not include lesser forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that do not amount to torture.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Pajollari makes two arguments in support of his petition for review. His first argument is that his due process rights were violated because the IJ \u201cbased her credibility determination in large part upon sworn testimony that was off-the-record because she failed to restart the tape machine after a recess.\u201d Pajollari\u2019s Br. 21. (We review due process claims <em>de novo. Abdulrahman v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 587, 595-96 (3d Cir.2003)) The argument is meritless. It is clear that the adverse credibility determination was based on the discrepancies between his testimony, asylum application, and the eleven page supplement that he produced the day of the hearing and the fact that he was not able to explain the discrepancies. The IJ restated what little of Pajollari\u2019s testimony had not been recorded and summarized it on the record. Significantly, Pajollari\u2019s counsel did not object to the IJ\u2019s summary or otherwise attempt to clarify the record. To prevail on a due process challenge to Immigration hearing procedures, an alien must show \u201csubstantial prejudice.\u201d <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 533, 541 (3d Cir. 2006). Pajollari suffered no substantial prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">Pajollari\u2019s second argument is that the IJ failed to consider potentially corroborative evidence. He contends that the IJ placed particular reliance on the State Department Profile of Asylum Claims for Albania, produced in May 2001, rather than the State Department\u2019s 2000 and 2001 Country Reports for Albania. According to Pajollari, the 2001 Asylum Profile concludes that \u201c[t]here is virtually no evidence that individuals are targeted for mistreatment on political grounds,\u201d \u201c[t]here is no post-Communist tradition of retribution against political leaders and few instances thereof,\u201d and \u201c[t]he Government has neither the means nor the will to carry out systematic persecution.\u201d Pajollari\u2019s Br. 25. However, Pajollari contends that these conclusions are at odds with the 2000 and 2001 Country Reports, which he claims \u201ccite numerous allegations of violence and intimidation at [Democratic Party] members that often went uninvestigated and unpunished.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26. In Pajollari\u2019s view, the Asylum Profile is not proof that his claims lack merit and, therefore, the IJ erred in relying on it in making her credibility findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">However, as noted above, the IJ\u2019s credibility determination rested on Pajollari\u2019s inability to satisfactorily explain serious inconsistencies in his testimony, asylum application, and supplement. Moreover, the IJ\u2019s citation to the 2001 Asylum Profile was conducted along with the IJ\u2019s citation to the Country Reports and concluded that \u201cthere [are] is no serious political conflicts between groups in a systematic organized manner and [the] even show there to be a coalition government, although the Socialist Party remains in power.\u201d The miminal reference to the Asylum Profile could have no effect on the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>V.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">For all of the above reasons, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-9\">.
