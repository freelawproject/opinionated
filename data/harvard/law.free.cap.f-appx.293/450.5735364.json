U.S. v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 394-96, 68 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948). A review of the record demonstrates that the inconsistencies in Petitioners\u2019 testimony go to the heart of Petitioners\u2019 claim. <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004). Specifically, the IJ found that: (1) Davaanyam admitted that he conformed his testimony to his asylum application; (2) Davaanyam\u2019s explanation for the inconsistencies between his testimony and the asylum application contradicted his wife\u2019s explanations for the inconsistencies; (3) Davaanyam\u2019s testimony and application were inconsistent regarding the type of drug he discovered; (4) Davaanyam\u2019s testimony and application presented inconsistent descriptions of the police force that responded to the initial call regarding the drugs and the police force that later arrested and allegedly persecuted him; and (5) Davaanyam\u2019s testimony and application were inconsistent in them description regarding where he was taken after being detained in October 2002. These discrepancies go to the heart of the claim and provide substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See, e.g., Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 992-93 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The BIA also properly upheld the IJ\u2019s determination that the documents submitted by Petitioners were insufficient to overcome Petitioners\u2019 lack of credibility. The IJ properly found that the documents could not establish Petitioners\u2019 claims both due to the incredible nature of Petitioners\u2019 testimony, and because several of the documents lacked certified translations or were not original. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The record also demonstrates that the BIA properly denied Petitioners\u2019 due process claim alleging that the translator at the hearing before the IJ was incompetent and/or prejudiced the outcome of the hearing. <em>Cf. Perez-Lastor v. INS, </em>208 F.3d 773, 777-80 (9th Cir.2000). Petitioners fail to demonstrate that any of the alleged instances of translation error contributed to the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding or the denial of Petitioners\u2019 claims, or that a different translation would have affected the outcome of the hearing. <em>See Hartooni v. INS, </em>21 F.3d 336, 339-40 (9th Cir.1994). Prior to the hearing, the IJ urged Davaanyam to ask for questions to be repeated or explained in the event he did not understand something, rather than trying to answer an unclear question. Furthermore, when questions of translation arose during the hearing, the IJ thoroughly questioned Davaanyam and the interpreter to ensure the accuracy of the intended meaning and to verify that she understood the central facts of the Petitioners\u2019 case correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">PETITIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b477-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
