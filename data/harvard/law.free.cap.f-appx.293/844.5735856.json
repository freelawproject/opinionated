Ap-pellees, officials at the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d), have filed a motion for summary affirmance. We will grant the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">In his habeas petition, Corral asserts that BOP officials wrongfully charged him with three disciplinary violations (threatening another with bodily harm, insolence towards staff, and using obscene/abusive language) and that the Disciplinary Hearing Officer (\u201cDHO\u201d) wrongfully sanctioned him for these violations. As a result of the sanction imposed, Corral lost 27 days of good time credit and a number of privileges. He challenges the loss of good time credits in this habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">Corral, who speaks only Spanish, asserts that BOP officials denied him due process by failing to obtain an independent translation of his statement to the officer who filed the charges against him. Corral contends that, if properly translated, his remarks would not support the charges against him. Relying on a staff member\u2019s translation of Corral\u2019s statement, the DHO determined that Corral had said the following: \u201cWhy are you f-ing with me. I am going to write your ass up Mother F-er. You will see what is going to happen to you later[,] punk.\u201d Corral insists that his statement contained no obscenity, and that, properly translated, said, \u201cWhy do you harass me? I\u2019m going to write you up cuckhold; I\u2019m tired of this foolishness!,] you\u2019ll see later what happens.\u201d The District Court determined that Corral\u2019s own translation of his statement could be construed as a threat, based upon the language used and Corral\u2019s concession that he raised his voice when speaking to the BOP official. Because there was some evidence to support the disciplinary decision regardless of the translation credited, the District Court dismissed the habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. A prison disciplinary determination comports with due process if it is based on some evidence. <em>Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst. v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454-56, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985) (\u201c[T]he relevant question is whether there is any evidence in the record that could support the conclusion reached by the disciplinary board.\u201d). Considering Corral\u2019s own translation of his statement, we agree that the DHO\u2019s decision was based on some evidence. Corral conceded that he raised his voice and told the officer, \u2018Why do you harass me? I\u2019m going to write you up cuckhold; I\u2019m tired of this foolishness!,] you\u2019ll see later what happens.\u201d Spoken in a loud tone, this statement is adequate to support a finding that Corral had made a threat to an officer and that he had exhibited insolence. Corral\u2019s use of the term \u201ccuckhold\u201d can be considered abusive language. Under these circumstances, the DHO\u2019s decision was adequately supported and comported with due process under <em>Hill.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b871-12\">As this appeal presents no substantial question, we will grant appellee\u2019s motion for summary affirmance. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4 and 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"afr-dedup-0\">. Appellant also raises a number of arguments for the first time on appeal: that he was not permitted to call witnesses at his disciplinary hearing, that he was not permit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>ted to show video surveillance footage of his interaction with BOP officials, and that the appropriate punishment for obscene speech under BOP regulations is the revocation of certain privileges, not the loss of good time credits. As appellant failed to timely raise these arguments, they are waived. <em>United Parcel Seivice v. Int'l Broth. of Teamsters, Local No. 430, </em>55 F.3d 138, 140 n. 5 (3d Cir. 1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
