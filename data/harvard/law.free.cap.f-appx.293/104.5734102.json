Dec. 10, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-17\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that</p>\n<p id=\"b130-18\">such motions are \u201cdisfavored.\u201d <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 322-23, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992)). We find that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Chen\u2019s motion to reopen for failure to rebut the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cU\u201d) underlying adverse credibility determination. See <em>Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 234 (2d Cir.2005); <em>see also Qin Wen Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 143, 147 (2d Cir.2007) (relying on the doctrine of <em>falsus in uno, falsus in </em>omnibus). Moreover, although the agency may err in rejecting a document solely based on the alien\u2019s failure to properly authenticate the document pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 287.6, <em>see Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 403 (2d Cir.2005), it does not abuse its discretion where, as here, its decision to reject the document is based substantially on legitimate credibility concerns and it relies only in part on the fact that a document was not authenticated. <em>See Qin Wen Zheng, </em>500 F.3d at 148-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-19\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
