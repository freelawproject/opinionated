Sept. 27, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-21\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted). The movant\u2019s failure to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for the underlying substantive relief sought is a proper ground on which the BIA may deny a motion to reopen. <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104-05, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>We find that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Yu\u2019s motion to reopen where it reasonably found that he failed to establish <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007), we held that the definition of \u201crefugee,\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42), did not extend automatically to partners (legally related or otherwise) of individuals who have been forcibly sterilized or forced to have an abortion. <em>Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 309-10. Accordingly, in order for the spouse of an individual who was forcibly aborted or sterilized to be eligible for asylum, the spouse must independently \u201cprove past persecution or a fear of future persecution for \u2018resistance\u2019 that is directly related to his or her own opposition to a coercive family planning policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Here, Yu argues the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen for failure to demonstrate <em>p\u00f1ma facie </em>eligibility for relief was an abuse of discretion where he was not provided an opportunity to establish his own resistance to the family planning policy. However, despite ample opportunity at his hearing before the IJ, Yu has never alleged personal acts of resistance to the family planning policy, and he does not do so now. Thus, the factual record in this case was \u201cadequately developed\u201d with respect to the issue of other resistance. <em>See Shu Wen Sun v. BIA, </em>510 F.3d 377, 381 n. 5 (2d Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 723 (2d Cir.2007)). Accordingly, we cannot find that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen where he failed to establish <em>pri-ma facie </em>eligibility for asylum. <em>See Abu-du, </em>485 U.S. at 104-05, 108 S.Ct. 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">As the BIA properly found that Yu failed to establish <em>p\u00f1ma facie </em>eligibility for relief, we need not reach Yu\u2019s argument that the BIA abused its discretion by finding that the evidence he submitted in support of his motion to reopen was neither new nor previously unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b834-5\">. We note that Yu waives any challenge to the BIA's finding that his motion to reopen was number-barred; however, because the BIA may have erred in making such finding, we deny the instant petition for review based on the BIA\u2019s alternative <em>prima facie </em>finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
