The amount of cocaine triggered a mandatory minimum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>sentence of five years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). The written plea agreement acknowledged the mandatory minimum sentence but also stated that based on the evidence known at the time of the agreement Harrington was eligible for application of the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision, so he could receive a sentence below the mandatory minimum. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(f). But while preparing the pre-sentence investigation report, the probation officer discovered that Harrington had a previous drug conviction that translated to three criminal history points, which made him ineligible for the safety-valve provision. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(f)(1). The district court nevertheless sentenced Harrington to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 nine months shy of the mandatory minimum\u2014 reasoning that Harrington\u2019s poor physical condition and cooperation with the government rendered the mandatory minimum sentence unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The government appealed the sentence. Both the government and Harrington\u2019s counsel agree that the district court did not have discretion to impose a sentence below the mandatory minimum. Indeed, district courts may not apply the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) to impose a sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum even after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. James, </em>487 F.3d 518, 530 (7th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>479 F.3d 924, 930 (7th Cir. 2007). District courts may impose a sentence below the mandatory minimum only if the government moves for a departure based on substantial assistance or if the defendant is eligible for the safety-valve provision. <em>See United States v. Crickon, </em>240 F.3d 652, 655 (7th Cir.2001). Neither of these exceptions apply here, which all parties and the district court acknowledged. Accordingly, we grant the parties\u2019 agreed motion to waive oral argument, vacate Harrington\u2019s sentence, and remand the case to the district court for resentenc-ing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
