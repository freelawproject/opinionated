Robinson contends that his sentence is unreasonable because the District Court erred by (1) not adequately considering the statutory sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); (2) not offering an adequate explanation of its reasons for imposing this particular sentence as required by \u00a7 3553(c); and (3) incorrectly classifying him as a career offender. Robinson also contends the District Court erred by denying his request for a downward departure from the sentencing guidelines. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">The burden to show unreasonableness rests on the party challenging the sentence, and this Court gives deference to a district court\u2019s judgment on whether sentencing was reasonable under \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 330 (3d Cir.2006). A district court need not state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors nor explicitly record its consideration of each factor. Instead, \u201cthe record must demonstrate that the trial court gave meaningful consideration to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">Robinson contends that the District Court unduly focused on \u00a7 3553(a)(4). It is clear, however, that the District Court also considered other factors. <em>See </em>App. 58-64. For example, the District Court considered \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1); \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A); \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B); \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed to provide the defendant with the needed ... medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D); and \u201cthe need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C). Based on the District Court\u2019s treatment of the factors and the deference due the District Court, we are satisfied that the District Court adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-12\">Robinson also contends that the District Court did not fulfill the requirements of \u00a7 3553(c). Section 3553(e) requires a district court to \u201cstate in open court the reasons for its imposition of a particular sentence.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c). This Court has found the requirement satisfied \u201cwhen a district court indicates the applicable Guideline range, and how it was chosen.\u201d <em>United States v. Georgiadis, </em>933 F.2d 1219, 1223 (3d Cir.1991). If the range exceeds 24 months, the district court must state \u201cthe reason for imposing a sentence at a particular point within the range.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-13\">The District Court explained that it was imposing a sentence consistent with the guidelines and reflective of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, with a focus on Robinson\u2019s failure to capitalize on the opportunities given through lenient sentences for his previous crimes. <em>See </em>App. 60. Accordingly, we are satisfied that the District Court fulfilled the requirements of \u00a7 3553(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">Robinson also contends that his sentence is unreasonable because the District Court incorrectly found him to be a career offender. In his brief on appeal, however, Robinson concedes that he qualifies under the sentencing statute as a career offender. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 31. Given Robinson\u2019s criminal history, we are satisfied with the District Court\u2019s finding that Robinson was a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">Finally, Robinson contends that the District Court erred in denying a downward departure from the sentencing guidelines. We decline to review this claim because we lack jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a downward departure. <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 332-333.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">* :Js $ * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">We have considered all of the contentions presented by the parties and conclude that no further discussion is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
