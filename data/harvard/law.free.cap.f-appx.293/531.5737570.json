Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law, <em>Altamirano v. Gonzales, </em>427 F.3d 586, 591 (9th Cir.2005), and claims of constitutional violations, <em>Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir. 2001). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that petitioners failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 929-30 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">We reject petitioners\u2019 contention regarding the IJ\u2019s refusal to consider their motion to reopen because the BIA considered the additional evidence of hardship submitted with the motion and acted within its broad discretion in determining that the evidence was insufficient to warrant reopening. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (The BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">We are not persuaded that petitioners\u2019 removal results in the deprivation of their children\u2019s rights. <em>See Urbano de Malaluan v. INS, </em>577 F.2d 589, 594 (9th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b557-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
