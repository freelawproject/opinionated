(CBK). They claim that their employment was terminated in a reduction in force (RIF) in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1), and New Mexico state law. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-20\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b652-21\">Defendant operates a plant in Roswell, New Mexico, that manufactures holiday <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>ornaments. Both plaintiffs were long-time supervisory employees. Mr. Montano worked there for thirty-one years, and Ms. Lucero for twenty-four. Because it was a seasonal business, in late September of each year, supervisors were asked to follow a written RIF policy to decide which nonsupervisory workers would be let go at the end of the season. In 2004, CBK suffered major financial losses, so in addition to the customary end-of-season layoffs, it decided to consolidate or eliminate supervisory positions and to lay off some supervisory personnel in a RIF. Mr. Montano\u2019s position was consolidated with another supervisory job and Ms. Lucero\u2019s position was eliminated. CBK\u2019s executive committee decided that plaintiffs would be discharged in the RIF. Mr. Montano, aged 57, was terminated on November 16, 2004. Ms. Lucero, aged 60, was terminated on December 13, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Thereafter, both plaintiffs filed for social security disability insurance (SSDI) benefits, claiming they became disabled prior to their respective termination dates. The Social Security Administration (SSA) eventually awarded benefits to both plaintiffs. Mr. Montano was deemed disabled as of June 2006 and his benefits commenced at that time. Ms. Lucero was deemed disabled as of April 2005 with benefits starting then.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Following their terminations, both plaintiffs also filed complaints with the EEOC and ultimately were issued right-to-sue letters. They filed suit in federal district court on April 17, 2006, asserting that they were selected for the RIF because of their ages in violation of the ADEA. They further asserted that CBK breached an implied contract of employment that was not terminable at will.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The district court granted summary judgment in favor of CBK. Plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider, which was denied. They do not challenge that ruling on appeal. Rather, plaintiffs argue on appeal that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to CBK on their breach-of-contract and ADEA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">\n<em>Standards of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, viewing the record in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment. <em>McGowan v. City of Eufala, </em>472 F.3d 736, 741 (10th Cir.2006). Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">\n<em>State-law Implied Contract Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">Plaintiffs challenge the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to CBK on their state-law contract claims. They maintain that an implied contract of employment was created by CBK\u2019s RIF policy, oral representations, and past practices, such that their employment was not terminable at will. CBK responds that plaintiffs were at-will employees whose employment could be terminated at any time for any reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">We apply the law of the forum state, New Mexico, to determine the existence and enforceability of a contract. <em>See MediaNews Group, Inc. v. McCarthey, </em>494 F.3d 1254, 1260 (10th Cir.2007). Under New Mexico law, \u201c[ejmployment without a definite term is presumed to be at will.\u201d <em>Trujillo v. N. Rio Arriba Elec. Coop., Inc., </em>131 N.M. 607, 41 P.3d 333, 341 (2001). At-will employment \u201ccan be terminated by either party at any time for any reason or no reason, without liability.\u201d <em>Hartbarger v. Frank Paxton Co., </em>115 N.M. 665, 857 P.2d 776, 779 (1993). Plaintiffs rely on an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>exception to this general rule: \u201cwhere the facts disclose the existence of an implied employment contract provision that limits the employer\u2019s authority to discharge.\u201d <em>Trujillo, </em>41 P.3d at 341 (quotation omitted). \u201cA promise, or offer, that supports an implied contract might be found in written representations such as an employee handbook, in oral representations, in the conduct of the parties, or in a combination of representations and conduct.\u201d <em>Hartbar-ger, 857 </em>P.2d at 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Plaintiffs argue that the following language of the RIF policy is mandatory and thus created an implied contract of employment requiring CBK to follow it before terminating their employment: \u201cSupervisors <em>must </em>constantly evaluate their employee\u2019s attitude and work practices .... Supervisors <em>need to </em>formulate a ranking of their employees.... Seniority <em>does </em>play a role in the decision to lay-off.\u201d Aplt.App. Vol. II at 249 (emphasis added). They also assert that the deposition testimony of CBK\u2019s President (the RIF criteria \u201cneeds to be considered certainly,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 222), and its Human Resources Director (CBK expected its supervisors and other employees to know and follow the RIF policy), shows that they \u201cconsidered the ranking process and the criteria discussed in the RIF Policy to be mandatory.\u201d Aplt. Opening Br. at 26. In addition, even though the RIF policy specifies that the listed criteria are \u201cnot all-inclusive, but [they] will serve as a guide,\u201d Aplt.App. Vol. II at 249, plaintiffs contend that the criteria that are listed were mandatory. Finally, plaintiffs argue that because CBK required them, as supervisors, to make a list ranking their employees from best to worst when deciding who to lay off at the end of each season, they reasonably expected that CBK would make a written list ranking the supervisors in the RIF process, but no such list was made. In short, plaintiffs assert that the RIF policy and CBK\u2019s actions in previous RIFs created a contract by which CBK could not discharge them except by adherence to the RIF policy. They claim that CBK did not follow the RIF policy in deciding to lay them off; therefore, it is liable for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">New Mexico law requires \u201cthat the totality of the parties\u2019 relationship, circumstances, and objectives will be considered to overcome the presumption that the employment contract was terminable at will.\u201d <em>Newberry v. Allied Stores, Inc., </em>108 N.M. 424, 773 P.2d 1231, 1234 (1989). The RIF policy provides: \u201cEmployment is not guaranteed. Employment may be terminated with or without cause and with or without prior notice.\u201d Aplt.App. Vol. II at 249. In addition, each plaintiff signed an Acknowledgment of Receipt and Understanding stating, \u201cNothing contained in the [employee handbook] is intended to create <em>(nor shall be construed as creating) </em>a contract of employment <em>(express or implied ) </em>or guarantee employment for a definite or indefinite term.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Vol. I at 106; Vol. IV at 496. We recognize that \u201ca contractual disclaimer does not automatically negate a document\u2019s contractual status and must be read by reference to the parties\u2019 norms of conduct and expectations founded upon them.\u201d <em>McGinnis v. Honeywell, Inc., </em>110 N.M. 1, 791 P.2d 452, 457 (1990) (quotations and brackets omitted). But plaintiffs\u2019 evidence in support of an implied contract to follow the RIF policy falls short in the face of the clear, unequivocal language stating that employment was at will. Plaintiffs have not \u201cshown that the employer has demonstrated an intent to restrict its power to discharge.\u201d <em>Hartbar-ger, 857 </em>P.2d at 782. Accordingly, the district court properly granted summary judgment to CBK on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>\n<em>ADEA Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">\u201cUnder the ADEA, it is \u2018unlawful for an employer ... to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s age.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 141, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000) (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1)). Both plaintiffs were members of the protected class because they were at least forty years of age. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. 631(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\"><em>Judicial Estoppel </em>\u2014 Social <em>Security Disability Rulings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The district court granted summary judgment to CBK on plaintiffs\u2019 ADEA claims based on the doctrine of judicial estoppel, finding that the plaintiffs had not explained the apparent conflict between their statements to the SSA that they were totally disabled prior to their respective terminations, and their ADEA claims that they were qualified for their jobs. The Supreme Court addressed the similar question of whether a plaintiff is estopped from maintaining a claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101-12213, if she has been awarded SSDI benefits. In <em>Cleveland v. Policy Management Systems Corp., </em>526 U.S. 795, 806, 119 S.Ct. 1597, 143 L.Ed.2d 966 (1999), the Court recognized the seeming contradiction in a plaintiffs claim that she is unable to work, thus entitling her to SSDI benefits, and her claim that she was qualified to perform her job. Nevertheless, the Court held that such a plaintiff is not precluded from pursuing an ADA claim after being awarded SSDI benefits. But \u201can ADA plaintiff cannot simply ignore the apparent contradiction that arises out of the earlier SSDI total disability claim. Rather, she must proffer a sufficient explanation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">Here, of course, we are faced not with an ADA/SSDI dilemma, but a possible conflict between an ADEA claim and an SSDI award. We adopt the Third Circuit\u2019s approach that \u201ca prima facie showing under the ADEA that conflicts with earlier statements made to the SSA is subject to the same analysis, as the reasoning of the Court in <em>Cleveland </em>also applies in the context of the ADEA.\u201d <em>Detz v. Greiner Indus., Inc., </em>346 F.3d 109, 117 (3d Cir.2003). Under <em>Cleveland, </em>we first determine whether there is a genuine conflict between plaintiffs\u2019 respective statements to the SSA and their ADEA claims, and if so, we then evaluate whether their explanations for the inconsistency are sufficient. <em>See Cleveland, </em>526 U.S. at 806, 119 S.Ct. 1597.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">CBK argues that <em>Cleveland\u2019s </em>reliance on the ADA\u2019s requirement that the employer provide \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d to the disabled worker, <em>id. </em>at 803, 119 S.Ct. 1597, dictates a different result here because the ADEA does not include such a requirement. But CBK\u2019s concession that both plaintiffs were performing their jobs satisfactorily, Aplt.App. Vol. II at 228, obviates any inquiry into whether either plaintiff could perform his or her job satisfactorily with reasonable accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">We conclude that plaintiffs are not es-topped from claiming they remained able to perform their jobs after they were terminated, even though both claimed in their SSDI applications that they became disabled before their employment ended.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Cleveland </em>the Court recognized that \u201cif an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>individual has merely applied for, but has not been awarded, SSDI benefits [when the statement is made], any inconsistency in the theory of the claims is of the sort normally tolerated by our legal system.\u201d <em>Cleveland, </em>526 U.S. at 805, 119 S.Ct. 1597. Because a plaintiff \u201cmay not be sure in advance upon which legal theory she will succeed,\u201d the rules of procedure \u201cpermit parties to \u2018set forth two or more statements of a claim or defense alternately or hypothetically,\u2019 and to \u2018state as many separate claims or defenses as the party has regardless of consistency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 8(e)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Mr. Montano submitted his SSDI application on March 24, 2006, claiming disability since November 13, 2004, three days before he was terminated. The agency determined he was disabled and therefore entitled to benefits as of June 2006. Although his claim of disability starting November 13, 2004, apparently conflicts with his claim that he was able to do his job with CBK on and after the date he was terminated, under <em>Cleveland, </em>Mr. Montano was permitted to state alternately or hypothetically that he was disabled as of November 13, 2004, and also able to work as of that date. CBK\u2019s admission that he was doing his job satisfactorily when he was laid off in November 2004, coupled with the agency\u2019s determination that he was not disabled until June 2006, adequately explains the apparent conflict in his statements. Therefore, Mr. Montano is not estopped from pursuing his ADEA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Similarly, Ms. Lucero filed her SSDI application on January 21, 2005, almost a month after she was terminated, claiming disability since October 12, 2004. In April 2005, she was deemed eligible for benefits and began receiving payments. As with Mr. Montano, CBK conceded that Ms. Lucero was performing her job satisfactorily at the time she was terminated and the agency did not determine that she was disabled until after she was laid off. Ms. Lucero\u2019s explanation for the apparently conflicting statements that she was disabled and able to do her job is also sufficient and she also is not estopped from pursuing her ADEA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Therefore, we decline to affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that plaintiffs are es-topped by their SSDI claims from bringing their ADEA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">\n<em>Direct and Indirect Evidence of Age Discrimination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">The district court did not evaluate the parties\u2019 evidence pertaining to the ADEA claims because it entered summary judgment in defendants\u2019 favor, based on its finding that plaintiffs were estopped by them SSDI applications from pursuing them. \u201cRather than examining and resolving the merits of these contentions, ... we adopt the better practice of leaving the matter to the district court in the first instance.\u201d <em>Evers v. Regents of Univ. of Colo., </em>509 F.3d 1304, 1310 (10th Cir.2007). Accordingly, we reverse the judgment in defendant\u2019s favor on the ADEA claims and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s summary judgment in defendant\u2019s favor on the state-law contract claims. We REVERSE the summary judgment entered on the ADEA claims and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this order and judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b652-12\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. See Fed.R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed.R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b655-8\">. Ms. Lucero disputes that she said she became disabled on October 12, 2004, stating that she underwent surgery on that date. Even if she did claim October 12 as her disability date, she is not estopped from pursuing her ADEA claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
