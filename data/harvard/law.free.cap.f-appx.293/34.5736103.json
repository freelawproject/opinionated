On appeal, defendant raises three principal challenges: (1) the District Court erred by reviewing the arbitration award for manifest disregard of the law instead of <em>de novo </em>as required by the arbitration agreement; (2) the arbitrator exceeded his authority under the arbitration agreement by awarding consequential damages in violation of specific contractual language and in dismissing defendant\u2019s conversion claim; and (3) the District Court erred in confirming the declaration award because it was not a \u201cfinal and definite\u201d as required by the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(d). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Judicial review of arbitration awards is \u201cseverely limited.\u201d <em>Greenberg v. Bear, Steams &amp; Co., </em>220 F.3d 22, 28 (2d Cir. 2000). A reviewing court evaluates an award for \u201cmanifest disregard of the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To vacate an arbitration award, a reviewing court must find \u201cboth that (1) the arbitrators knew of a governing legal principle yet refused to apply it or ignored it altogether, and (2) the law ignored by the arbitrators was well defined, explicit, and clearly applicable to the case.\u201d <em>Di-Russa v. Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., </em>121 F.3d 818, 821 (2d Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). We review a district court\u2019s determination of whether the arbitrator acted in manifest disregard of the law <em>de novo. See, e.g., Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., Inc. v. 1109580 Ontario, Inc., </em>409 F.3d 87, 91 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">Defendant\u2019s argument that the parties contracted for a heightened standard of review is squarely foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Hall Street Assocs., LLC v. Mattel, Inc., </em>552 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 1396, 170 L.Ed.2d 254 (2008) (holding that the FAA does not permit \u201cexpandable judicial review\u201d through contract). Accordingly, the District Court did not err by reviewing the award under the manifest disregard-of-the-law standard.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-13\">We agree with the District Court that the arbitrator did not act in manifest disregard of the law in awarding plaintiff damages for the Chadian judgments, and related charges and expenses, and in dismissing defendant\u2019s conversion claim. The arbitrator cited the applicable rules under New York law for determining whether damages are consequential damages and for evaluating conversion claims and provided a justification for his conclusions. Taylors concludes that the arbitrator\u2019s award of damages arising from the Chadian court judgments was \u201ca legal ruling the Arbitrator got wrong,\u201d and that his disposition of the conversion claim was \u201canother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>legal ruling that the Arbitrator got wrong.\u201d (Grey 12, 19). But this is, of course, of no moment because the law of this Circuit is plain that \u201c[a] federal court cannot vacate an arbitral award merely because it is convinced that the arbitration panel made the wrong call on the law.\u201d <em>Wallace v. Buttar, </em>878 F.3d 182, 190 (2d Cir.2004) (collecting cases). Accordingly, we cannot say that the arbitrator refused to identify or ignored the applicable legal principles. <em>See DiRussa, </em>121 F.3d at 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">We also agree that the arbitration award was \u201cfinal and definite.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(d). The arbitrator decided both liability and damages on the claims presented. <em>See Michaels v. Mariforum Shipping, SA, </em>624 F.2d 411, 413-14 (2d Cir.1980) (\u201cGenerally, in order for a claim to be completely determined, the arbitrators must have decided not only the issue of liability of a party on the claim, but also the issue of damages.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b61-8\">. We note that one district court in our Circuit has recently held that, after <em>Hall Street, </em>\"the manifest disregard of the law standard is no longer good law.\u201d <em>Robert Lewis Rosen Associates Ltd. [RLR] v. Webb, </em>566 F.Supp.2d 228, 233 (S.D.N.Y.2008); <em>see also Ramos-Santiago v. UPS, </em>524 F.3d 120, 124 (1st Cir. 2008) (\"[M]anifest disregard of the law is not a valid ground for vacating or modifying an arbitral award in cases brought under the FAA.\u201d). We express no opinion as to the correctness of this decision. Rather, in light of the fact that the manifest disregard standard has so clearly been satisfied in this case, and that confirmation of the arbitral award is so plainly warranted, we see no useful purpose to be served here by a discussion of the standard\u2019s continued validity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
