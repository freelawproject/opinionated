For the foregoing reasons, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Amponsah filed a motion under \u00a7 2255 on January 9, 2008, in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The District Court subsequently advised Amponsah of his rights under <em>United States v. Miller, </em>197 F.3d 644 (3d Cir. 1999). On April 24, 2008, the District Court directed the government to respond to Amponsah\u2019s motion within 45 days. The District Court also instructed Ampon-sah not to file any additional motions or papers other than a reply to the government\u2019s answer. On July 3, 2008, counsel for the government entered an appearance and filed an answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">On July 10, 2008, apparently having not yet received the government\u2019s answer, Amponsah filed this petition seeking an order directing the District Court to hear and decide his motion in light of the government\u2019s failure to respond within 45 days. As the government has responded to Amponsah\u2019s motion, and the proceedings in the District Court continue apace, Amponsah\u2019s concern has been addressed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Amponsah also requests that his \u00a7 2255 motion be assigned to a different judge based on the District Judge\u2019s purported lack of impartiality, or the appearance thereof. As Amponsah has not filed a motion requesting the District Judge\u2019s re-cusal, he has not demonstrated that his right to mandamus is \u201cclear and indisputable.\u201d <em>Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 35, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980) (quoting <em>Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co. v. Holland, </em>346 U.S. 379, 384, 74 S.Ct. 145, 98 L.Ed. 106 (1953) (quoting <em>United States v. Duell, </em>172 U.S. 576, 582, 19 S.Ct. 286, 43 L.Ed. 559 (1899))). Accordingly, we will deny Amponsah\u2019s mandamus petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-7\">. To the extent that Amponsah takes issue with the government\u2019s answer having been filed outside the 45 days ordered by the District Court, we note that the District Court has discretion over the management of its docket, <em>In re Fine Paper Antitrust Litig., </em>685 F.2d 810, 817 (3d Cir.1982), and that the District Court has the discretion to decide what, if any, significance to afford the government\u2019s minor delay in responding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
