The district court order affirmed the State Review Officer\u2019s (\u201cSRO\u201d) determination that Kildonan School was not a proper placement for E.M.\u2019s eighth grade year under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400 <em>et seq., </em>and denied the parents\u2019 request for tuition reimbursement. <em>See Matrejek v. Brewster Central School District, </em>471 F.Supp.2d 415 (S.D.N.Y.2007). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s award of summary judgment and its application of the IDEA\u2019S statutory and regulatory provisions to the facts of a particular case. <em>Cerra v. Pawling Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>427 F.3d 186, 191 (2d Cir.2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-15\">The parents raise several arguments on appeal. First, the parents argue that the SRO and the district court applied an erroneous standard and improperly required the private school placement to be \u201cperfect.\u201d We disagree. The SRO and the district court properly considered whether the parents satisfied their burden of showing that their unilateral placement \u201cprovides educational instruction specially designed to meet the unique needs of a handicapped child.\u201d <em>See Frank G. v. Bd. of Educ. of Hyde Park, </em>459 F.3d 356, 365 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-16\">Second, the parents argue that the record does not support the district court\u2019s deference to the SRO\u2019s finding that E.M. failed to make progress at Kildonan. \u201cAn assessment of educational progress is a type of judgment for which the district court should defer to the SRO\u2019s educational experience, particularly where ... the district court\u2019s decision was based solely on the record that was before the SRO.\u201d <em>M.S. ex rel. S.S. v. Bd. of Educ. of Yonk</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number><em>ers, </em>231 F.3d 96, 105 (2d Cir.2000), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Schaffer v. Weast, </em>546 U.S. 49, 57-58, 126 S.Ct. 528, 163 L.Ed.2d 387 (2005). The findings of the SRO were detailed, the administrative proceedings were thorough, and the conclusions arrived at were supported by a preponderance of evidence. <em>See Bd. of Educ. v. Rowley, </em>458 U.S. 176, 206, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982); <em>Walczak v. Florida Union Free Sch. Dist., </em>142 F.3d 119 (2d Cir.1998) (\u201cDeference is particularly appropriate when, as here, the state hearing officers\u2019 review has been thorough and careful.\u201d). The record contains ample evidence justifying the findings at issue, including that in his first two years at Kildonan, that is, prior to the year at issue: (i) E.M.\u2019s grades and progress reports showed inconsistent academic performance that worsened by the end of seventh grade, (ii) his standardized test scores showed that he fell further behind his peers, and (iii) he did not improve his reading level beyond what he had attained during his last year of public school three years earlier. <em>See, e.g., Gagliardo v. Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>489 F.3d 105, 113 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">Third, as to the parents\u2019 argument that Kildonan offered an appropriate educational program for E.M., the SRO and district court properly relied on testimony of Kildonan\u2019s academic dean that the school did not provide the type of instruction and services recommended by the evaluators hired by the parents. The record also established that Kildonan offered no speech-language therapy of the sort specifically recommended by E.M.\u2019s neuropsychologist, and failed to develop strategies to address E.M.\u2019s difficulty with attention and focus. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 114. The parents did not offer evidence sufficient to counter this record and meet their burden of proving that Kildonan was appropriate to E.M.\u2019s needs. <em>See Schaffer v. Weast, </em>546 U.S. at 57-58, 126 S.Ct. 528; <em>School Comm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>471 U.S. 359, 370, 105 S.Ct. 1996, 85 L.Ed.2d 385 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">We have considered all of the parents\u2019 other arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
