DeFonzo denying Harlina Gunawan\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal, which included as derivative applicants her two children, Kurniawan Felix Ong and Kurniawan Steven Ong.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>In re Gunawan, Ong, Ong, </em>No. A 98 642 607/608/609 (B.I.A. June 18, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 98 642 607/608/609 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 30, 2005). Additionally, Petitioners seek review of an October 12, 2007 order of the BIA denying their motion to reconsider its June 2007 order. <em>In re Gunawan, Ong, Ong, </em>No. A 98 642 607/608/609 (B.I.A. Oct. 12, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">I. Denial of Asylum and Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-14\">As a preliminary matter, Gunawan failed to exhaust any CAT claim before the agency and her petition for review is dismissed to that extent. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Karaj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113, 119 (2d Cir.2006). In addition to the statutory requirement that petitioners exhaust the categories of relief they seek, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), petitioners must also raise to the BIA the specific issues they later raise in this Court. <em>See Foster v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 75, 78 (2d Cir.2004). While not jurisdictional, this judicially imposed exhaustion requirement is mandatory. <em>Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 119-20 (2d Cir.2007). Gunawan\u2019s due process argument before this Court regarding the IJ\u2019s conduct during her hearing cannot be considered a subsidiary legal argument of her challenge to the IJ\u2019s credibility determination before the BIA because it is an independent ground for challenging the IJ\u2019s denial of relief. <em>See Steevenez v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 114, 117-118 (2d Cir.2007). Thus, she failed to exhaust that argument, and we will not address it. <em>See Lin Zhong, </em>480 F.3d at 119-20. We find, however, that Gunawan\u2019s credibility-related arguments raised here are \u201csubsidiary argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>ments\u201d to those she raised before the BIA, and we will address the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination accordingly. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 119-20 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, which was based on Gunawan\u2019s demeanor, an inconsistency in her testimony, and omissions in her asylum application and testimony. <em>See Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). An IJ\u2019s assessment of an applicant\u2019s demeanor merits \u201cgreat deference.\u201d <em>See Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 400 (2d Cir.2006). Here, the IJ noted that Gunawan was unresponsive and appeared to be reciting a rehearsed script, and Gunawan points to no evidence compelling a contrary conclusion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). Additionally, the IJ reasonably identified an inconsistency regarding the year that her home was attacked during a prayer meeting and the omission of any reference to several incidents in Gunawan\u2019s testimony and asylum application \u2014 an attack on her friend\u2019s home while she was present during a prayer meeting, the robbery of her younger sibling, an assault on her by a vendor, and the discovery of a bomb in her church. Contrary to Gunawan\u2019s claim, these inconsistencies and omissions where they were material to Gunawan\u2019s claim that she was persecuted and has a well-founded fear of persecution based on her ethnicity and religion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42); <em>cf. Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307-309 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on Gunawan\u2019s claims for asylum and withholding of removal because the only evidence that she was likely to be persecuted depended upon her credibility. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). Therefore, we need not address the agency\u2019s alternate finding that Guna-wan failed to carry her burden of proof in establishing eligibility for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">II. Denial of Motion to Reconsider</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). An abuse of discretion may be found where the decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Gunawan\u2019s motion to reconsider because she failed to assert any legal or factual error in the BIA\u2019s dismissal of her appeal or any argument that the BIA failed to consider and, instead, raised additional arguments challenging the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and the IJ\u2019s conduct during the merits hearing. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>Matter of Cerna, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 399, 402 n. 2 (BIA 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED, in part, and DENIED, in part. As we have completed our review, the unopposed pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-10\">. Because Gana wan's children\u2019s applications are derivative of her application, this order will refer primarily to Ganawan.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
