Herrera raises two issues on appeal. First, Herrera contends that the government breached his plea agreement, in which the government promised to recommend crediting him with a two-level sentencing reduction for being a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the criminal activity, where a case agent told the probation officer that he \u201cbelieved the defendant probably had significant involvement in drug trafficking given the amount of drugs and his prior stop at the border a few weeks prior to the instant offense.\u201d Second, Herrera contends that the sentencing court erred by not granting him a two-level reduction in his Sentencing Guidelines Offense as a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the criminal activity. The facts and procedural history of this case are known to the parties and need not be repeated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The information furnished by the case agent to the probation officer was nothing more than his impression based upon the undisputed facts of Herrera\u2019s offense. All parties, especially the government, have a duty of candor to the court and have an obligation to furnish all information that bears upon the sentencing decision. <em>See United States v. Franco-Lopez, </em>312 F.3d 984, 992 (9th Cir.2002).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Unlike in <em>Franco-Lopez, </em>where we found the government\u2019s conduct amounted to a breach of the plea agreement, the case agent here did not affirmatively make a recommendation to the probation officer that contradicted the terms of the plea bargain. <em>See id. </em>at 991 (explaining that the government\u2019s conduct amounted to a breach of the plea agreement because the government \u201caffirmatively recommended to the Department that \u2018role enhancements were considered appropriate.\u2019 \u201d). Therefore, the information and impression furnished to the probation officer by the case agent did not constitute a breach of the plea agreement by the government. <em>See United States v. Maldonado, </em>215 F.3d 1046, 1052 (9th Cir.2000). Having determined that the government did not breach the plea agreement, there is no basis for Herrera\u2019s request to have the sentencing hearing before another judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">Herrera also contends that the sentencing court erred in not reducing his Sentencing Guidelines Offense level by two based upon a contention that he was a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the criminal activity. A defendant has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to a downward reduction based on his role in the offense. <em>United States v. Ladum, </em>141 F.3d 1328, 1348 (9th Cir.1998). Whether a defendant qualifies for a minor participant adjustment is heavily dependent on the facts of the particular case and the sentencing court\u2019s findings are upheld unless clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>The defendant has the burden of establishing that he was \u201csubstantially less culpable than his co-participants.\u201d <em>United States v. Benitez, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>34 F.3d 1489, 1498 (9th Cir.1994). Judge Burns thoroughly analyzed Herrera\u2019s participation including the time of his involvement, the quantity of drugs, his \u201cdry run,\u201d his possession of a cell phone to report his success, and his role in having the vehicle used registered in his name. The sentencing court did not err in determining that Herrera was not \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d U.S.S.G. 3B1.2(b) cmt. 3(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"aix-dedup-0\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-7\">. As we have previously noted, our standard of review for a district court\u2019s determination of whether the government has breached a plea agreement has been inconsistent. <em>See Franco-Lopez, </em>312 F.3d at 988; <em>compare United States v. Salemo, </em>81 F.3d 1453, 1460 (9th Cir. 1996) (clearly erroneous) <em>with United States v. Schuman, </em>127 F.3d 815, 817 (9th Cir. 1997) (de novo). We need not resolve the inconsistency in this case because the government did not breach the plea agreement under either standard of review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
