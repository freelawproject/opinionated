HALL, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b812-4\">\n<em>SUMMARY ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">Petitioner Wen Xiong Chen, a native and citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China, seeks review of an August 10, 2007 order of the BIA affirming the February 7, 2006 decision of Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) Noel Ferris denying petitioner\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In </em>re <em>Wen Xiong Chen, </em>No. A98 642 247 (B.I.A. Aug. 10, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 642 247 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, Feb. 7, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Where the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in all respects but one and then supplements that decision, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA, but \u201cminus the single argument for denying relief that was rejected by the BIA.\u201d <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005); <em>See also an Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t. of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Ro-sales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">As an initial matter, we generally lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s pretermission of an alien\u2019s asylum application. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). However, we retain jurisdiction, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), to review constitutional claims and \u201cquestions of law.\u201d In his brief, Chen argues that the IJ violated his due process rights by excluding evidence that he claims went to his date of entry, <em>i.e., </em>evidence that allegedly \u201cconfirms his presence in China within the one-year deadline.\u201d However, Chen does not argue that the agency\u2019s pretermission of his asylum application was itself a due process violation. To the extent Chen intended to make such an argument, it is unavailing where the IJ has broad discretion in determining the weight to be afforded to particular pieces of evidence. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 342 (2d Cir.2006); <em>see also Dedji v. Mukasey, </em>525 F.3d 187, 192-193 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">Chen also argues that he did not receive an impartial hearing because IJ Ferris was \u201chostile\u201d and wrongly accused him of perjury. Although the IJ\u2019s perjury finding was not supported by the record, the IJ\u2019s conduct did not deprive Chen of a full and fair hearing. <em>See Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 104 (2d Cir.2006). Nor did the IJ\u2019s conduct result in \u201cthe appearance of bias or hostility such that we cannot conduct a meaningful review of the decision below.\u201d <em>Cf. Islam v. Gonzales, </em>469 F.3d 53, 55 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">The agency denied withholding of removal and CAT relief on the basis of its adverse credibility determination which was supported by substantial evidence. The IJ found numerous inconsistencies and implausibilities within Chen\u2019s testimony as to the events surrounding his wife\u2019s second pregnancy and alleged forced abortion. The IJ properly found that Chen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>testified inconsistently as to whether he returned home to take care of his daughter after she hurt her ankle \u2014 the event that allegedly led his wife to come out of hiding. <em>See Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006). Chen attempted to explain the apparent inconsistency, but no reasonable fact finder would be compelled to credit his explanation. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">In addition, the IJ also properly found that it was implausible that Chen\u2019s wife would come out of hiding while she was five months pregnant and that family planning cadres would arrive at Chen\u2019s house within hours of her return. <em>See Wensheng Yau v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 63, 66-68 (2d Cir.2007); <em>See also Ying Li v. BCIS, </em>529 F.3d 79, 82-83 (2d Cir.2008). These findings constitute \u201cspecific examples in the record of inconsistent statements\u201d and \u201cinherently improbable testimony.\u201d <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 74 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc). They therefore provided substantial evidence for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination; we need not reach the IJ\u2019s additional adverse credibility findings or her alternative burden finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
