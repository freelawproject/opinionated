To obtain withholding of removal, an applicant must show a clear probability of persecution if removed. <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-16\">Nyaigoti challenges the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and the IJ\u2019s determination that Nyaigoti failed to show a clear probability of persecution, if he were to return to Kenya, on account of his alleged membership in a political party. Nyaigoti asserts that the inconsistencies in his live testimony and the evidence are not material to his claims. Although Nyaigoti seeks to minimize the importance of the inconsistencies, our review of the record does not compel a determination contrary to that of the IJ. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994); <em>see also Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 905 (5th Cir.2002). Similarly, Nyaigoti has failed to show that the evidence of past persecution or the probability of future persecution is so compelling as to require a conclusion contrary to that of the IJ. <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d at 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-21\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b322-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
