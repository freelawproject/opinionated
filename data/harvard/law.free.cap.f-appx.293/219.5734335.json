Based on our review of the record and Kelojou\u2019s concession that the immigration judge lacks jurisdiction over his application for adjustment of status, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: Kelojou </em>(B.I.A. Dec. 7, 2007).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b246-15\"> We find no support for Kelojou\u2019s assertion that he filed a motion for remand with the Board in August 2006. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction over the claims raised in his brief, which all pertain to the motion for remand, on the ground that we lack jurisdiction to consider such claims in the first instance. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000) (\u201cA court may review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d); <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004) (holding that the court lacks jurisdiction to consider an argument that was not raised before the Board).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
