Shafford appeals a decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) dismissing Mr. Shafford\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Shafford v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>No. CH3443060300-B-1 (M.S.P.B. June 6, 2007) <em>(\u201cBoard Decision </em>\u201d). Because we agree that Mr. Shafford has not established jurisdiction, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Mr. Shafford was employed by the United States Postal Service (\u201cUSPS\u201d) as a Mail Processing Clerk (PS-05). After Mr. Shafford was detailed to a Networks Specialist position (EAS-15) for approximately three years, the USPS mailed a letter to Mr. Shafford stating that he had been officially promoted to that position effective October 5, 2002. On October 23, 2002, however, the USPS rescinded this letter, explaining that it was sent in error, and Mr. Shafford resumed his work as a Mail Processing Clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Mr. Shafford appealed what he perceived as a demotion to the Board. After a jurisdictional hearing, the administrative judge concluded that the Board lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Shafford\u2019s appeal because Mr. Shafford failed to establish that he had completed one year of current continuous service in the same or similar position. <em>Board Decision, </em>slip op. at 2, 6. Specifically, the administrative judge found that Mr. Shafford did not satisfy this one-year requirement because: (1) Mr. Shafford only occupied the Networks Specialist position for nineteen days \u2014 from October 5, 2002 to October 23, 2002; (2) his prior service in that position on a detail \u201cdoes not count toward the one year of current continuous service\u201d; and (3) his time as a Mail Processing Clerk also could not count toward the one-year requirement because the positions were not sufficiently similar. <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 4-6. Accordingly, the administrative judge concluded that the Board lacked jurisdiction and dismissed Mr. Shafford\u2019s appeal. <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 6. When the Board denied review, the administrative judge\u2019s decision became the final decision of the Board. <em>Shafford v. U.S. Postal Sen., </em>No. CH3443060300-B-1 (M.S.P.B. Nov. 14, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b788-12\">The Board\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to those matters prescribed by the applicable laws, rules, and regulations. <em>Torain v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>83 F.3d 1420, 1422 (Fed. Cir.1996) (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a)). When a non-preference-eligible postal employee <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals an adverse personnel action, the Board only has jurisdiction if the employee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-13\">(I) is in the position of a supervisor or a management employee in the Postal Service, or is an employee of the Postal Service engaged in personnel work in other than a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-14\">(II) has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-15\">39 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii); <em>Waldau v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>19 F.3d 1395, 1398 (Fed.Cir.1994). Mr. Shafford has the burden of establishing the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.56(a)(2)(i). Whether the Board has jurisdiction is a question of law that we review without deference, but we are bound by the Board\u2019s underlying factual findings \u201cunless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>those findings are not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Bolton v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>154 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed.Cir. 1998); <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">As noted above, the administrative judge found that the Board lacked jurisdiction because Mr. Shafford had not \u201ccompleted 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions.\u201d <em>See </em>39 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). First, although Mr. Shafford contended that his demotion did not occur until sometime in 2004, the administrative judge found that the evidence established that the USPS rescinded the letter on October 23, 2002. <em>Board Decision, </em>slip op. at 2-3. Thus, at most, Mr. Shafford occupied the Networks Specialist position for only nineteen days. <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 4. A review of the record shows that this factual finding is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Second, while Mr. Shafford was detailed to the Networks Specialist position for approximately three years, the administrative judge found that service on a detail \u201cdoes not count toward the one year of current continuous service.\u201d <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 4-5 (citing <em>Wafford v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>34 M.S.P.R. 691, 693-94 (1987)). In <em>Wafford, </em>the Board concluded that an appellant\u2019s service on a detail \u201cdoes not entitle him to the rights of the position to which he was detailed and therefore cannot be credited toward his completion of one year of service in the same or similar positions.\u201d 34 M.S.P.R. at 693. Because the administrative judge correctly applied the controlling law, we perceive no error in this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">Finally, the administrative judge found that Mr. Shafford\u2019s service as a Mail Processing Clerk could not count toward the one-year requirement because that position was not the same as or sufficiently similar to the Networks Specialist position. <em>Board Decision, </em>slip op. at 5-6. Two positions are \u201csimilar\u201d when they \u201cinvolve related or comparable work that requires the same or similar skills\u201d; however, if positions \u201cinvolve \u2018two distinctly different lines of work,\u2019 \u201d the positions are not sufficiently similar. <em>Mathis v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>865 F.2d 232, 234-35 (Fed.Cir.1988) (quoting <em>Van Skiver v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>6 MSPB 630, 7 M.S.P.R. 18, 20 (1981); <em>Wafford, </em>34 M.S.P.R. at 696).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">After a jurisdictional hearing, the administrative judge found that the Mail Processing Clerk and Networks Specialist positions \u201cinvolve significantly different responsibilities and duties.\u201d <em>Board Decision, </em>slip op. at 6. While the Mail Processing Clerk physically processes, sorts, and distributes the mail, the Networks Specialist occupies a higher-level position that \u201ccoordinates activities between contract carriers and postal supervisors\u201d and helps administer \u201cnetwork changes regarding dispatch and routing activities.\u201d On appeal, Mr. Shafford alleges that the positions are similar because, in both, an employee may respond to inquiries from contract carriers. A minor overlap, however, does not establish similarity where the evidence indicates that the two positions involve different types of work requiring different skill sets. In addition, Mr. Shafford argues that the two positions are similar because the \u201cbasic fuetion [sic]\u201d of both is \u201cthe efficient movement of the mail.\u201d But simply having a common basic function also does not indicate that two positions are \u201csimilar,\u201d especially when this basic function applies to nearly <em>any </em>position with the USPS. <em>See </em>39 U.S.C. \u00a7 403(b)(1) (The USPS is responsible for \u201cmaintain[ing] an efficient system of collection, sorting, and delivery of the mail.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">We conclude, therefore, that substantial evidence supports the administrative judge\u2019s finding that the Mail Processing Clerk and Networks Specialist positions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>\u201cinvolve significantly different responsibilities and duties\u201d and, thus, are not sufficiently \u201csimilar.\u201d <em>Board Decision, </em>slip op. at 6. Because Mr. Shafford has not established that he \u201ccompleted 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions,\u201d the Board lacks jurisdiction over his appeal. See 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II); <em>Waldau, </em>19 F.3d at 1398. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b788-8\">. The parties concede that Mr. Shafford is not preference eligible. <em>See Board Decision, </em>slip op. at 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
