We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and the procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">As this Court remanded for resentencing pursuant to <em>United States v. Fagans, </em>406 F.3d 138, 141 (2d Cir.2005), Azzara\u2019s sentence is reviewed for reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Singletary, </em>458 F.3d 72, 79 (2d Cir.2006). Reasonableness review has both substantive and procedural dimensions. <em>See United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103, 114 (2d Cir.2005). Substantive reasonableness examines \u201cwhether the length of the sentence is reasonable in light of the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Rattoballi, </em>452 F.3d 127, 132 (2d Cir.2006). Procedural reasonableness examines whether the district court correctly \u201c(a) identified the Guidelines range supported by the facts found by the court, (b) treated the Guidelines as advisory, and (c) considered the Guidelines together with the other [\u00a7 3553(a) ] factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Azzara\u2019s sentence is proeedurally reasonable because the district court correctly calculated the Guidelines range, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and was aware that the guidelines were not mandatory. <em>See id. </em>The sentence is also substantively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 27 (2d Cir.2006) (finding that \u201cin the overwhelming majority of cases, a Guidelines sentence will fall comfortably within the broad range of sentences that would be reasonable in the particular circumstances\u201d). The district court evaluated each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining the appropriate sentence and Azzara has not challenged the length of his sentence in light of these factors. We have considered all of Az-zara\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
