HARTZ, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">Leonardo Alvarez-Flores, an inmate incarcerated in the Kansas Department of Corrections, filed a civil rights complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging a denial of adequate medical care in violation of his constitutional rights. He appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of all defendants. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">We quote in full the substantive portion of Mr. Alvarez-Flores\u2019s appeal brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-12\">1. Statement of the Case. (This should be a <em>brief </em>summary of the proceedings in the district court.) n/a</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-13\">2. Statement of Facts Relevant to the Issues Presented for Review, n/a</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-15\">3. Statement of Issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-16\">a. First Issue: n/a Argument and Authorities:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-17\">b. Second Issue: n/a Argument and Authorities:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-18\">4. Do you think the district court applied the wrong law? If so, what law do you want applied? n/a</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-19\">5. Did the district court incorrectly decide the facts? If so, what facts? n/a</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-20\">6. Did the district court fail to consider important grounds for relief? If so, what grounds? That I had 15 to 50 years on my sentence and I\u2019d have no possible way of paying restitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-21\">7. Do you feel that there are any other reasons why the district court\u2019s judgment was wrong? If so, what? n/a</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-22\">8. What action do you want this court to take in your case? dismiss any restitution fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-23\">9. Do you think the court should hear oral argument in this case? If so, why? n/a</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-24\">Aplt. Br. at 2-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-25\">\u201cAlthough a pro se litigant\u2019s pleadings are to be construed liberally and held to a less stringent standard than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers, this court has repeatedly insisted that pro se parties follow the same rules of procedure that govern other litigants.\u201d <em>Garrett v. Selby Connor Maddux &amp; Janer, </em>425 F.3d 836, 840 (10th Cir.2005) (citation, brackets, and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cUnder [Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure] 28, which applies equally to pro se litigants, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>brief must contain more than a generalized assertion of error, with citations to supporting authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 841 (ellipsis and internal quotation marks omitted). This court provides pro se litigants with a form to guide them in presenting their appellate issues and arguments. When properly completed, we accept this form in lieu of a formal brief. But perfunctory allegations of error that fail to frame and develop an issue are insufficient to invoke appellate review. <em>See Murrell v. Shalala, </em>48 F.3d 1388, 1389 n. 2 (10th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Mr. Alvarez-Flores submitted his brief using the pro se form, but he answered \u201cn/a\u201d to all but two of the questions. We are unable to discern the nature of his allegation of error from the remainder of his responses. He asserts that this court should \u201cdismiss any restitution fees,\u201d Aplt. Br. at 4, yet the district court did not enter a restitution order in this case. Even liberally construed, his brief is \u201cwholly inadequate to preserve issues for review\u201d and we decline to exercise our discretion to \u201cdelve for substance\u201d in it in order to consider his appeal. <em>Garrett, </em>425 F.3d at 840.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Appellant\u2019s motion for leave to proceed on appeal without prepayment of the filing fee is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b644-14\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed.R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
