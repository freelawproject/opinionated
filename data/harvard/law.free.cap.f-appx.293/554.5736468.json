We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We grant the petition in part and remand for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Abdelrahhim entered the United States illegally on December 26, 1998. On September 27, 1999, he filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT. At the hearing before the IJ, Abdelrahhim testified that he is a native and citizen of Sudan and his wife and family still live there. Abdelrahhim attested that as a member of the Democratic Union Party, he participated in demonstrations against the government in Sudan. He testified that he was beaten, imprisoned, and subjected to mental and physical torture because of his political views. Two witnesses, who knew Abdelrahhim when he was a student in Sudan, testified as to his identity, political involvement, and harassment by the Sudanese government for his political opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">In support of his application, Abdelrah-him submitted a declaration and numerous other documents, including his Notice to Appear, passport, nationality certificate, birth certificate, marriage certificate, a letter from the National Democratic Alliance, and reports on Sudan. The government submitted a record of Abdelrahhim\u2019s non-immigrant entry into the United States. A forensic document examiner testified that Abdelrahhim\u2019s nationality and birth certificates \u201care not what they purport to be.\u201d The examiner also testified that Ab-delrahhim\u2019s passport was genuine and unaltered, but that it was impossible to say if the passport was issued by an authorized entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">By decision dated April 25, 2003, the IJ denied Abdelrahhim\u2019s application in its entirety because his nationality certificate and birth certificate were fraudulent. Ab-delrahhim timely appealed. The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, stating that submission of fraudulent documentation indicated Abdelrahhim\u2019s overall lack of credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-14\">Abdelrahhim argues the IJ erred in denying his application based on his unknowing submission of two false documents. He contends the court should credit his testimony and find he established eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT. The government argues substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility determination and the court should affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-15\">\u201cWe review adverse credibility determinations under the substantial evidence standard.\u201d <em>Ge v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1121, 1124 (9th Cir.2004). \u201cAlthough this standard is deferential, the adverse credibility finding must be supported by specific, cogent reasons, and cannot be based on speculation, and conjecture.\u201d <em>Shire v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 1288, 1295 (9th Cir.2004). \u201cWhere, as here, the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s credibility determination, we look through the BIA\u2019s decision to examine the IJ\u2019s reasons for deeming the person not credible.\u201d <em>Bandari v. INS, </em>227 F.3d 1160, 1165 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>(9th Cir.2000). When the IJ\u2019s proffered reasons for an adverse credibility finding fail, we accept the petitioner\u2019s testimony as credible. <em>Kaur v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 876, 890 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The IJ based his adverse credibility finding on Abdelrahhim\u2019s submission of fraudulent nationality and birth certificates. The IJ\u2019s decision stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsyO\">[R]espondent\u2019s identification documents go to the very heart of his claim as to who he is and where he came from. As the respondent testified, he spent some time in Egypt. For all the Court knows, this respondent may very well be from Egypt. He could be from Somalia. He could be from Ethiopia. He could be from anywhere on the planet. Surely it is not too much to ask of a respondent who is seeking the protection of this country that he present a valid document showing who he is and where he is from.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The IJ also cited Abdelrahhim\u2019s failure to rebut or present an acceptable explanation for the fraudulent documents as a basis for discounting his credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Contrary to the IJ\u2019s assertion, the nationality and birth certificates were not necessary to establish Abdelrahhim\u2019s identity and nationality. Abdelrahhim\u2019s testimony, the testimony of two witnesses, and several documents, including his marriage certificate, passport, and record of non-immigrant entry into the United States, corroborated Abdelrahhim\u2019s identity and citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">In addition, the two documents did not go to the heart of Abdelrahhim\u2019s claims for relief. We have previously held that submission of counterfeit birth certificates was \u201cnot a legitimate basis for an adverse credibility finding\u201d where the documents were not attempts to enhance the applicant\u2019s claims of persecution. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>266 F.3d 1094, 1100 (9th Cir.2001), <em>overruled on other grounds by INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002). Here, as in <em>Chen, </em>Abdelrahhim\u2019s nationality and birth certificates were incidental to his claim because they \u201crevealed] nothing about his fear for his safety.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">Moreover, submission of a fraudulent document that goes to the heart of an asylum claim is not automatically determinative of an adverse credibility finding, especially when there is no evidence the petitioner knew the document was fraudulent. <em>Yeimane-Berhe v. Ashcroft, </em>393 F.3d 907, 911 (9th Cir.2004). Abdelrahhim testified that his family in Sudan sent him the nationality and birth certificates, he did not know they were fraudulent, and he would not have submitted them to the court had he known. Because there is no evidence that Abdelrahhim knew or should have known the certificates were fraudulent, Abdelrahhim\u2019s submission of the certificates alone is not substantial evidence that he lacks credibility. <em>See, id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">The IJ also discounted Abdelrahhim\u2019s passport although the forensics expert found it to be \u201cgenuine and unaltered,\u201d because it was impossible to say if it was issued by an authorized entity. Because there is no evidence undermining the reliability of the passport, Abdelrahhim\u2019s mere failure to authenticate the passport is insufficient for an adverse credibility finding. <em>Shire, </em>388 F.3d at 1299.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">Finally, the IJ erroneously relied on Ab-delrahhim\u2019s testimony regarding events at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) office when he was fingerprinted as a basis for the adverse credibility determination. When asked to explain this incident, Abdelrahhim testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-12\">I went to get my fingerprints, and I was with a friend of mine. At that time, I had most of my belongings lost or sto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>len. Even my clothes; I lost my clothes. The clothes I was wearing were not my own clothes, were not like fit to my size. When I went to the fingerprints place, the individual there asked me, do you have an I.D.? I told him I don\u2019t have. He said if I frisk you, would I find something? I said go ahead, frisk me. So he found the wallet of the other person in my trousers, and this is the same person who went with me to the fingerprints place. He asked me, where did you get this from? I got very scared, and I got panicked. I told him this belonged to this friend of mine. So I was panicking; I got scared, and he said, that\u2019s it. So he took my fingerprints, and he said, okay, you can go now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The IJ rejected Abdelrahhim\u2019s explanation, suggesting that Abdelrahhim was attempting to \u201cmasquerade his actual identity\u201d which would explain \u201cwhy he was so ready to submit fraudulent documents to the Court.\u201d This is impermissible speculation and conjecture. <em>Shire, </em>388 F.3d at 1295. Even if Abdelrahhim\u2019s account were false, it does not support an adverse credibility finding because it was not made to establish a critical element of his asylum claim. <em>See, Akinmade v. INS, </em>196 F.3d 951, 956 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the adverse credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence and that Abdelrahhim\u2019s testimony is credible. We remand for further proceedings to consider Abdelrahhim\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED IN PART and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"****\">\n<p id=\"b581-16\"> This deposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
