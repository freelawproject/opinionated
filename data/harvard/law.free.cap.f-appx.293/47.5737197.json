Nov. 30, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A95 710 303 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, Mar. 10, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-24\">Where, as here, the BIA issues a decision adopting the IJ\u2019s decision and supplementing that decision, we review the underlying IJ decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t. of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law including \u201cwhat evidence will suffice to carry any asylum applicant\u2019s burden of proof.\u201d <em>Islami v. Gonzales, </em>412 F.3d 391, 396 (2d Cir.2005) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Here, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of relief. The agency properly determined that Liu did not meet her burden of proof to establish an objective, well-founded fear of persecution. While, as the IJ found, Liu may have had a subjective fear of persecution, the evidence she presented, including her own testimony as well as documentary evidence, failed to support the objective reasonableness of that fear. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 128 (2d Cir.2005); see <em>also Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 130 (2d Cir.2005). The agency properly noted that Liu has never practiced Falun Gong. Furthermore, the agency relied on Liu\u2019s testimony that she was never arrested or detained by public safety officials, and, in fact, never had any contact with them whatsoever. The only indication Liu had of any police interest in her was an unauthenticated subpoena issued after she had already relocated to the United States. On this record, we find no error in the agency\u2019s conclusion that Liu failed to carry her burden of proof. <em>See Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 286 (2d Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Even if we were to find that Liu had proven both a subjective and objectively reasonable fear of persecution, the agency\u2019s internal relocation determination is, on its own, a proper basis for the denial of relief. <em>See Steevenez v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 114, 117-18 (2d Cir.2007); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3)(ii). As the IJ found, Liu not only had the ability to relocate and live safely in China, but in fact did so on two separate occasions. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s relocation finding, which is a valid alternative basis for the denial of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Because Liu\u2019s withholding of removal claim is premised on the same set of facts that the IJ found insufficient to establish her eligibility for asylum, the agency\u2019s denial of withholding was also proper. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). Finally, because Liu has failed to sufficiently challenge the agency\u2019s denial of relief under the CAT in her brief to this Court, we deem any such arguments waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, Liu\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
