Diallo was the primary applicant for relief and his family were derivative applicants. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">The INA authorizes the Attorney General to confer asylum on any refugee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a) (2006). It defines a refugee as a person unwilling or unable to return to his native country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2006). \u201cPersecution involves the infliction or threat of death, torture, or injury to one\u2019s person or freedom, on account of one of the enumerated grounds.... \u201d <em>Li v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 171, 177 (4th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">An alien \u201cbear[s] the burden of proving eligibility for asylum,\u201d <em>Naizgi v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 484, 486 (4th Cir.2006); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2008), and can establish refugee status based on past persecution in his native country on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1) (2008). \u201cAn applicant who demonstrates that he was the subject of past persecution is presumed to have a well-founded fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Ngaru-rih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 187 (4th Cir.2004). Without regard to past persecution, an alien can establish a well-founded fear of persecution on a protected ground. <em>Id., </em>371 F.3d at 187. The well-founded fear standard contains both a subjective and an objective component. The objective element requires a showing of specific, concrete facts that would lead a reasonable person in like circumstances to fear persecution. <em>Gandziami-Mickhou v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 351, 358 (4th Cir.2006). \u201cThe subjective component can be met through the presentation of candid, credible, and sincere testimony demonstrating a genuine fear of persecution.... [It] must have some basis in the reality of the circumstances and be validated with specific, concrete facts ... and it cannot be mere irrational apprehension.\u201d <em>Li, </em>405 F.3d at 176 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-8\">Credibility findings are reviewed for substantial evidence. A trier of fact who rejects an applicant\u2019s testimony on credibility grounds must offer \u201cspecific, cogent reason[s]\u201d for doing so. <em>Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989). This court accords broad, though not unlimited, deference to credibility findings supported by substantial evidence. <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). If the immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility finding is based on speculation and conjecture rather than specific and cogent reasoning, however, it is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Tewabe v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 533, 538 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-9\">A determination regarding eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal is affirmed if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to decide to the contrary. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2006). This court will reverse the Board only if \u201cthe evidence ... presented was so compelling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 488-84, 112 S.Ct. 812; <em>see Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">We find substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s and the Board\u2019s adverse credibility finding. We further find support for the finding that Diallo was intending to establish a home here in the United States prior to the event that allegedly led him to flee Guinea in fear of persecution. We also find the immigration judge\u2019s decision denying Dial-lo\u2019s application for relief under the CAT was supported by substantial evidence. In denying relief under the CAT, the immigration judge considered the adverse credibility finding as well as the background evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">We also review the Board\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2008). A motion for reconsideration asserts that the Board made an error in its earlier decision, <em>Turri v. INS, </em>997 F.2d 1306, 1311 n. 4 (10th Cir.1993), and requires the movant to specify the error of fact or law in the prior Board decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1) (2008); <em>Matter of Cerna, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 399, 402 (B.I.A.1991) (noting that a motion to reconsider questions a decision for alleged errors in appraising the facts and the law). The burden is on the movant to establish that reconsideration is warranted. <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 110, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988). \u201cTo be within a mile of being granted, a motion for reconsideration has to give the tribunal to which it is addressed a reason for changing its mind.\u201d <em>Ahmed v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 247, 249 (7th Cir.2004). Motions that simply repeat contentions that have already been rejected are insufficient to convince the Board to reconsider a previous decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-9\">We find no abuse of discretion in the Board\u2019s denial of Diallo\u2019s motion to reconsider. Diallo failed to show any error of fact or law supporting granting the motion. Likewise, we find the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Diallo\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2008); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Nibagwire v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 153, 156 (4th Cir.2006). His newly discovered evidence did not address many of the significant issues found by the immigration judge and the Board that prevented granting relief. The Board\u2019s conclusion was not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-10\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We grant the motion to remove Mariama Diallo as a party to the petition. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-11\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
