Dec. 19, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 223 343 (Immigr. Ct. N.Y. City Jan. 13, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, we review both the BIA\u2019 s and IJ\u2019s opinions\u2014or more precisely, we review the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard, and treat them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). For applications governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, like the one at issue here, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on the applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-13\">As a preliminary matter, Zou does not challenge the pretermission of her asylum application or the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief. Accordingly, we review only Zou\u2019s challenge to the denial of her application for withholding of removal under INA \u00a7 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-14\">We find that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. For example, the agency reasonable noted the implausibility of Zou\u2019s testimony that although she practiced Falun Gong in various practitioners\u2019 homes throughout China, delivered Falun Gong materials to fellow practitioners, and participated in activities promoting the practice to the public, her only involvement with Falun Gong in this country was her periodic practice at home, alone. The IJ found that Zou\u2019s \u201clack of Falun Gong activity in the United States undermines her claimed testimony regarding those activities in China.\u201d That conclusion is not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>result of \u201cbald speculation\u201d because it is tethered to the record, i.e., Zou\u2019s own testimony and personal statement. <em>See Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 168-69 (2d Cir. 2007); <em>Wensheng Yan v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 63, 66-67 (2d Cir.2007). Indeed, it is understandable that the IJ found Zou\u2019s story, as a whole, farfetched. <em>See Ying Li v. BCIS, </em>529 F.3d 79, 80 (2d Cir.2008). Even if there are plausible explanations, such would not compel us to disturb the IJ\u2019s finding. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, the IJ did not err in basing her adverse credibility determination on these implausible aspects of Zou\u2019s account. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167-68; <em>Wensheng Yan, </em>509 F.3d at 66-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The IJ also based her adverse credibility determination on internal inconsistencies in Zou\u2019s testimony. The IJ noted in particular that while Zou initially testified that her parents did not know she was involved in Falun Gong until she was arrested in 2003, Zou later stated that she told her parents in May 2000, and that they also observed her practicing at that time. The IJ further observed that while Zou testified that her parents told her that Public Security Ministry officials came looking for her, she omitted this detail from the statement accompanying her asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Although less than dramatic, the agency reasonably relied on these discrepancies in its cumulative analysis of Zou\u2019s credibility. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167-68; <em>Liang Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>454 F.3d 103, 106-107 (2d Cir.2006). Because the only evidence of a threat to Zou\u2019s life or freedom depended on her credibility, the agency\u2019s denial of withholding of removal was proper. <em>Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir .2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
