His attorney has moved to withdraw his representation under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). We grant the motion and affirm the conviction and sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">A police officer testified that at around 5:00 a.m. on September 24, 2002, he saw Harrison (who was carrying an orange bag) fire a gun. He chased Harrison and, after temporarily losing sight of him, caught him and arrested him. A witness residing in the area testified that at approximately 5:00 a.m. that day, gunshots woke her up. As she looked out of her window, she saw someone running, orange bag in hand, and the runner tossed an object into a vacant lot. The police later found a gun in the lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">Because Harrison was a felon, he was charged, tried and convicted for being a felon in possession of a firearm. The District Court sentenced him to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. Harrison and his counsel have identified several potential grounds for appeal: the District Court erred in ordering Harrison to submit to a competency examination, should not have denied Harrison\u2019s request that he be permitted to represent himself, incorrectly admitted the witness\u2019s 911 call, erred in denying Harrison\u2019s motions for a new trial and for acquittal, and erroneously overruled Harrison\u2019s objections at sentencing. Harrison further argues that his counsel was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">Our rules provide that \u201c[w]here, upon review of the district court record, trial counsel is persuaded that the appeal presents no issue of even arguable merit, trial counsel may file a motion to withdraw and supporting brief pursuant to <em>Anders.\u201d </em>3d Cir. LAR 109.2(a). \u201cIf the panel agrees that the appeal is without merit, it will grant trial counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>motion, and dispose of the appeal without appointing new counsel.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b956-11\">We are satisfied that counsel has filed an adequate <em>Anders </em>brief. Further, we agree that any grounds for appeal are frivolous. Given the rambling and confused statements Harrison made to the District Court, the Court properly ordered a competency hearing. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(a). Further, because Harrison refused to answer questions relevant to whether he truly desired to represent himself, understood the case, and was competent to stand trial, the Court properly declined to allow Harrison to represent himself. <em>See United States v. Peppers, </em>302 F.3d 120, 131-32 (3d Cir.2002). Moreover, the Court properly admitted the 911 call under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(1) and (2). In addition, it properly denied the motions for a new trial and for acquittal because the evidence was sufficient to permit a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>see United States v. Brodie, </em>403 F.3d 123, 134 (3d Cir.2005), because there was no \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence and the facts do not suggest diligence on Harrison\u2019s part, <em>see United States v. </em>Jasin, 280 F.3d 355, 361 (3d Cir.2002), and because we know no reason to conclude (as Harrison alleges) that the prosecutor intentionally introduced false evidence. As for sentencing, the District Court properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>followed the procedures announced in our Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Gunter, </em>462 F.3d 237, 247 (3d Cir.2006), and the ultimate sentence is not unreasonable. Finally, we decline to consider Harrison\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, which is inappropriate on this direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Haywood, </em>155 F.3d 674, 678 (3d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the District Court and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b956-8\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
