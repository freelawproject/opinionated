On appeal, he argues the district court erred in <em>sua sponte </em>dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). Cobb asserts his complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>is not barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 2372, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because his challenge is to the process used by the State of Florida to determine whether he violated his probation, not the validity of his probation revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of a suit for failure to state a claim for relief under \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) <em>de novo. Harden v. Pataki, </em>320 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2003). The complaint\u2019s \u201c[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007); <em>see also Watts v. Florida Int\u2019l Univ., </em>495 F.3d 1289, 1295 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s most recent formulation of the pleading specificity standard is that \u2018stating such a claim requires a complaint with enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest\u2019 the required element.\u201d <em>Watts, </em>495 F.3d at 1295 (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1965). This rule does not \u201cimpose a probability requirement at the pleading stage.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1965. Instead, the standard \u201csimply calls for enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence\u201d of the required element. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIt is sufficient if the complaint succeeds in \u2018identifying facts that are suggestive enough to render [the element] plausible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Watts, </em>495 F.3d at 1296 (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1965). In reviewing the dismissal of a complaint under the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l), this court accepts allegations in the complaint as true, and <em>pro se </em>pleadings are liberally construed. <em>Brown v. Johnson, </em>387 F.3d 1344, 1350 (11th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">A plaintiff cannot win relief under \u00a7 1983 if \u201ca judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence.\u201d <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. at 2372; <em>see Abella v. Rubino, </em>63 F.3d 1063, 1064-1065 (11th Cir.1995) (holding, in an action under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), that plaintiffs argument that the defendants fabricated testimony was barred under <em>Heck </em>because \u201c[\u00a1judgment in favor of Abel-la on these claims would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction.\u201d (quotation omitted)). A plaintiff may only proceed after showing \u201cthat the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. However, the plaintiff may proceed under \u00a7 1983 when \u201cthe plaintiffs action, even if successful, will <em>not </em>demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal judgment against the plaintiff ... in the absence of some other bar to the suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487, 114 S.Ct. at 2372-73; <em>see Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1160 (11th Cir.2003) (explaining that \u201can illegal search or arrest may be followed by a valid conviction, [and therefore] a successful \u00a7 1983 action for Fourth Amendment search and seizure violations does not necessarily imply the invalidity of a conviction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Upon review of the district court record and Cobb\u2019s brief, we discern no error. The district court correctly dismissed Cobb\u2019s complaint because the necessary implication of a grant of relief would be that Cobb\u2019s probation revocation is invalid. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
