Corp. of California v. Super. Ct., </em>6 Cal.4th 287, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 861 P.2d 1153, 1160 (1993) (explaining that the duty to defend arises if there is potential liability). Indeed, St. Paul concedes this point on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-21\">However, the district court erred in interpreting the terms of the St. Paul policy to exclude from the definition of \u201ccovered person,\u201d volunteers who were not acting at the <em>express </em>direction of Kraft. <em>See Bank of the West v. Super. Ct., </em>2 Cal.4th 1254, 1264-65, 10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545 (1992) (holding that policy terms must be read in their \u201cordinary and popular sense\u201d) (citations omitted). As a result, St. Paul <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>was obligated to indemnify Scher for the settlement paid by Red Cross on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The district court also erred in granting summary judgment in favor of St. Paul with respect to pre-tender defense costs. An insurer generally has no duty to defend an insured until the insured tenders his defense. <em>See Tradewinds Escrow, Inc. v. Truck Ins. Exch., </em>97 Cal.App.4th 704, 710, 118 Cal.Rptr.2d 561 (2002). However, an exception exists where the insured was unaware of the existence or contents of the policy and was therefore unable to tender. <em>See Shell Oil Co. v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, </em>44 Cal.App.4th 1683, 1649, 52 Cal.Rptr.2d 580 (1996). There remains a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Appellants had knowledge of their potential coverage under the St. Paul policy and thereby qualify for the exception to the tender rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Finally, we agree with the district court that St. Paul did not act in bad faith in denying the tendered defense of Scher, as there was a legitimate coverage dispute, especially considering Appellants\u2019 late tender. <em>See Jordan v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>148 Cal.App.4th 1062, 1072, 56 Cal.Rptr.3d 312 (2007) (\u201cWhere there is a <em>genuine issue </em>as to the insurer\u2019s liability under the policy for the claim asserted by the insured, there can be no bad faith liability imposed on the insurer for advancing its side of that dispute.\u201d) (citation omitted) (emphasis in the original).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">We therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Appellants as to St. Paul\u2019s duty to defend and in favor of St. Paul as to the issue of bad faith, REVERSE the district court\u2019s grant of summary in favor of St. Paul as to recovery of pre-tender costs and the duty to indemnify, and REMAND for entry of judgment in favor of Appellants as to the duty to indemnify and for further proceedings as to recovery of pre-tender costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART and REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">Each party is to bear its costs of appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b538-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
