Reid contends he is entitled to a credit for time served and that credit should be applied to his current term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">Reid pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute cocaine base and served his sentence of 135 months of imprisonment. Reid subsequently violated his conditions of supervised release, and the district court revoked supervised release and ordered an additional thirty-seven months of imprisonment. Reid argues he is entitled to a retroactive reduction of his sentence for conspiracy to distribute cocaine, under the recent amendments to the United States Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 1B1.10, 2D1.1, App\u2019x C, Amend. 706 (2007 &amp; Supp. May 1, 2008). Reid states he should receive a credit for the excess time he served based on the amendments to the guidelines, and the district court should apply this credit against his current sentence for revocation of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">The application notes accompanying the guidelines amendment state, \u201c[i]n no case, however, shall the term of imprisonment be reduced below time served.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 comment, (n.3). Thus, we decline to reduce Reid\u2019s sentence for his cocaine base conviction below the amount of time he has already served for the crime. Furthermore, the Guidelines application notes provide that the amendment \u201cdoes not authorize a reduction in the term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation of supervised release.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 comment. (n.4(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">Accordingly, we affirm the district coui't\u2019s order. We deny Reid\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
