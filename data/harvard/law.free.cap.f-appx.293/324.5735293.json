Cartwright challenged a prison disciplinary hearing and the resulting loss of good time credit. This court reviews a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition for failure to exhaust administrative remedies for an abuse of discretion. <em>Fuller v. Rich, </em>11 F.3d 61, 62 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-17\">Cartwright first argues that he did exhaust his administrative remedies. However, Cartwright\u2019s appeal to National Inmate Appeals Administrator, despite the Regional Director\u2019s order for a rehearing, did not exhaust his administrative remedies. If an \u201cagency has offered to reexamine its decision it should be permitted to do so.\u201d <em>Smith v. Thompson, </em>937 F.2d 217, 219 (5th Cir.1991). Cartwright\u2019s administrative appeals following the rehearing also do not show exhaustion because the rehearing and subsequent administrative appeals all occurred <em>after </em>he had filed his \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Fuller, </em>11 F.3d at 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-22\">Cartwright also argues that exhaustion should be excused because the extensive delay in scheduling the rehearing suggests that exhaustion would be futile and because the administrative process was biased against him. Exceptions to the exhaustion requirement arise when \u201cavailable administrative remedies either are unavailable or wholly inappropriate to the relief sought, or where the attempt to exhaust such remedies would itself be a patently futile course of action.\u201d <em>Fuller, </em>11 F.3d at 62 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). These exceptions \u201capply only in extraordinary circumstances,\u201d and the petitioner bears the burden of establishing that administrative review would be futile. <em>Id. </em>The fact that Cartwright did successfully appeal to the Regional Director following his first hearing demonstrates that the review process was not \u201cunavailable,\u201d \u201cinappropriate,\u201d or \u201cpatently futile.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-23\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
