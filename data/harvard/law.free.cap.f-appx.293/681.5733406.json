The jury returned a verdict for Hamatie. The district court denied defendant\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial, and defendant brought this appeal. For the following reasons, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">John Hamatie was stringing Christmas lights on a window in the dining room of his house when the extension ladder on which he was standing partially collapsed, causing him to fall. He sued Louisville Ladder, Inc. (\u201cLouisville\u201d), claiming that the fly \u2014 the upper extension of the ladder \u2014 was negligently designed and manufactured causing it to separate from the base and collapse. The case was tried on both the negligent design and manufacture theories, but Hamatie withdrew the design claim prior to the juiy receiving the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">1. <em>The Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Louisville contends that judgment as a matter of law is required in this case because Hamatie failed to present evidence sufficient to establish that its manufacture of the ladder caused Hamatie\u2019s fall and injuries. Specifically, Louisville argues that Hamatie failed to prove that \u201cbut for\u201d the alleged manufacturing defects, his accident more likely than not would have been prevented. Rather, since Hamatie\u2019s expert testified that Louisville was negligent in both the <em>design </em>and the manufacture of the ladder, he could not say, and the jury could not conclude, that \u201cbut for\u201d the manufacturing negligence the accident would not have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">This, however, mistakes the standard for establishing \u201cbut for\u201d causation in Florida. In Floiida, the defendant is liable for \u201cinjury pi\u2019oduced or substantially produced in a natural and continuous sequence by his conduct, such that \u2018but for\u2019 such conduct, the injury would not have occurred.\u201d <em>Jones v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>463 So.2d 1153, 1156 (Fla.1985). However, \u201c[sjuch liability is not escaped in the recognition that the injury would not have occurred \u2018but for\u2019 the occurrence or intervention of some <em>other </em>cause as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant is liable for his own negligence even when it combines with some other intervening cause since \u201cbut for\u201d the other cause as well, injury would not have occurred. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">Louisville recognizes that this is the law, but contends that it does not apply to this case because the alleged design and manufacturing defects \u201care not part of a natural and continuous sequence of events but are instead <em>mutually exclusive </em>theories of recovery.\u201d Louisville, however, offers no authority for this proposition, because there is none. The evidence indicates that the design and manufacturing defects were concurrent in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">Plaintiffs expert testified that there were both design and manufacturing defects in the ladder. But he did not testify that but for the design defect the accident would not have occurred. Rather he testified each defect, concurring with the other, was sufficient to cause the failure of the ladder. This is the very definition of concurrent causes. <em>Jones, </em>463 So.2d at 1156. The defendant is liable for the defect resulting from his own negligence, even when it combines with some other intervening cause. <em>Id. </em>This is especially true, when, as here, the same defendant is the author of both defects causing injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-13\">Accordingly, the defendant is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-14\">2. <em>Motion for a New Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b709-15\">There was more than ample evidence presented at trial from which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>jury could conclude that the ladder was negligently manufactured. Defendant\u2019s contentions to the contrary, we do not substitute our own credibility choices and judgment for those of the jury. This verdict was not against the great weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Louisville also argues that it was denied a fair trial because plaintiff presented evidence regarding Louisville\u2019s relocation of its ladder plant to Mexico and because plaintiff suggested in closing that the damages calculation should factor in the amount saved by plaintiff due to the foreign relocation of its plant. While this court does not condone the not so subtle attempt to influence the jury in this way, we cannot conclude that any prejudice occurred in this case. First, the location of the plant and the manufacturing guidelines there were relevant to the liability issue in the case. Second, the jury only awarded plaintiff $200,000 for his pain and suffering, far below the amount that would have been awarded by factoring in the savings due to the relocation of the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Accordingly, Louisville is not entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court denying Louisville\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial is due to be</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
