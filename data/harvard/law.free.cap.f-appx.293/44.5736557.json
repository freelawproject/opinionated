Chew, granting her application for asylum. <em>In re Cui Jin Yu, </em>No. A98 690 029 (B.I.A. Nov. 23, 2007), <em>rev\u2019g </em>No. A98 690 029 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 14, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-15\">When the BIA does not adopt the decision of the IJ to any extent, this Court reviews only the decision of the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Jin Yu Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>413 F.3d 188, 191 n. 4 (2d Cir. 2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Vumi v. Gonzales, </em>502 F.3d 150, 153 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-16\">We find that the BIA\u2019s burden-of-proof finding is amply supported by the record. To establish asylum eligibility based on a claimed fear of future persecution, an applicant must show that he or she subjectively fears persecution and that this fear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>is objectively reasonable. <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d </em>169, 178 (2d Cir. 2004). A fear is objectively reasonable \u201ceven if there is only a slight, though discernible, chance of persecution.\u201d <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 284 (2d Cir.2000) (citing <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 431, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987)). On the other hand, a fear is not objectively reasonable if it lacks \u201csolid support\u201d in the record and is merely \u201cspeculative at best.\u201d <em>Jian Xing Htiang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Here, the BIA did not err in finding that the evidence in the record did not support Yu\u2019s claim that her fear was objectively reasonable. Both this Court and the BIA have concluded that \u201cthe oft-submitted \u2018Aird Affidavit\u2019 prepared by retired demographer and immigration expert Dr. John S. Aird[ ] was inadequate to establish the existence of an official policy of forced sterilization on the part of any Chinese province or locality, and thus insufficient to show that the applicants were likely to face forced sterilization if returned to China.\u201d <em>Jin Xiu Chen v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>468 F.3d 109, 110 (2d Cir.2006); <em>see also Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 274-76 (2d Cir.2006) (finding, in the context of a motion to reopen, that the Aird Affidavit was insufficient to establish the existence of a policy of forced sterilization in China); <em>Matter of C-C-, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 899, 903 (B.I.A.2006) (finding the Aird Affidavit insufficient to establish prima facie eligibility for relief on a claim of forced sterilization). Further, Yu\u2019s argument that her mother\u2019s and aunt\u2019s sterilizations provided sufficient evidence that she herself would be sterilized is \u201cspeculative at best,\u201d where she has not established that the authorities are aware of her U.S.born children or that the penalty would be the same as that imposed on her family members whose children were born in China. <em>See Jian Xing Huang, </em>421 F.3d at 129. Accordingly, the BIA did not err in denying Yu\u2019s application for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Yu argues that the BIA erred in finding her ineligible for withholding of removal and CAT relief where the IJ had not made any finding regarding those forms of relief in the first instance, having granted Yu\u2019s application for asylum. While the BIA reviews an IJ\u2019s factual findings for clear error and may not itself engage in fact-finding, the BIA reviews <em>de novo </em>\u201cquestions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of immigration judges.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i)-(iv); <em>see also Wood v. Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 564, 569 (7th Cir.2008)(holding that the BIA properly denied an application for adjustment of status in the first instance where the applicant had requested a continuance and a remand to pursue the application before the IJ). Therefore, the BIA did not err in finding that Yu was unable, as a matter of law, to establish eligibility for -withholding of removal because she had provided insufficient objective evidence to satisfy the lower burden of proof required to establish her asylum claim. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 155-56 (2d Cir.2006). Similarly, because Yu\u2019s CAT claim was based upon the same factual predicate as her asylum and withholding claims, she was unable as a matter of law to show eligibility for CAT relief. <em>See id. </em>at 156-57; <em>cf. Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 183 (2d Cir.2004). In such circumstances, the BIA is not required to remand to the IJ. <em>See Wood, </em>516 F.3d at 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, Yu\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
