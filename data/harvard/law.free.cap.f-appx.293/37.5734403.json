Korman, of the United States District Court for the Eastern Disti'ict of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b64-10\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">Petitioner Alban Gjata, a native and citizen of Albania, seeks review of a May 30, 2007 order of the BIA affirming the October 19, 2005 decision of an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denying petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, relief under the Convention Against Torture, and adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) and ordering him removed. <em>In re Alban Gjata, </em>A79 066 559, 2007 WL 1794212 (BIA May 30, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>A79 066 559 (Immig. Ct. Buffalo Oct. 19, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-15\">When, as here, the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision with some modification, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as altered by the BIA. <em>See Ming Xia Chen v. BIA, </em>435 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122, 126 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-16\">Petitioner contends (1) that the BIA erred \u201cas a matter of law\u201d in concluding that he had participated in alien smuggling and was therefore not eligible for an adjustment under section 245(i) of the INA, Aplt\u2019s Br. at 18; and (2) that the IJ\u2019s reliance on hearsay testimony violated his due process rights. We find that both of petitioner\u2019s claims lack merit. The BIA\u2019s conclusion that petitioner was involved in alien smuggling is amply supported by evidence in the record. Pursuant to section 212(a)(6)(E) of the INA, any alien who has participated in alien smuggling, as defined by the Act, is not eligible for an adjustment under section 245. Therefore, the BIA\u2019s determination that petitioner was not eligible for an adjustment was sound. Second, while it appears that petitioner failed to raise his due process claim before the BIA, we nonetheless find that it is without merit because \u201c[hearsay] is admissible in removal proceedings.\u201d <em>Lin v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>459 F.3d 255, 272 (2d Cir.2006). Here, the IJ did not err in considering the prior testimony of petitioner\u2019s brother at his own removal proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>ing, which implicated petitioner in an alien smuggling scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
