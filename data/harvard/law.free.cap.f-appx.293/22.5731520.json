Rakoff, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b49-18\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b49-19\">Plaintiff-appellant Stanley McPherson, a New York State prisoner, brought this action against corrections officials alleging that he is being exposed to harmful environmental tobacco smoke in violation of the Eighth Amendment. This is an interlocutory appeal from the district court\u2019s order (a) denying McPherson\u2019s motion for leave to amend his complaint to add new defendants, and (b) denying his motion for a preliminary injunction ordering the defendants to provide him with a smoke-free prison environment. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case and the scope of the issues presented by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b49-21\">We lack appellate jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s decision denying McPherson leave to amend his complaint. <em>Kahn v. Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., </em>91 F.3d 385, 387-89 (2d Cir.1996). Although the denial of a preliminary injunction is subject to interlocutory appeal, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1), the denial of leave to amend is not. We therefore dismiss McPherson\u2019s appeal insofar as it challenges the district court\u2019s order denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Mm leave to amend. Our dismissal is without prejudice to McPherson\u2019s ability to challenge the district court\u2019s order on appeal from a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u201cWe review the denial of a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Doninger v. Niehoff, </em>527 F.3d 41, 47 (2d Cir.2008). Where, as here, \u201cthe injunction sought \u2018will alter, rather than maintam, the status quo,\u2019 \u201d \u201c[t]he moving party must make a \u2018clear\u2019 or \u2018substantial\u2019 showing of likelihood of success on the merits.\u201d <em>Jolly v. Coughlin, </em>76 F.3d 468, 473 (2d Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Tom Doherty </em>Assocs., <em>Inc. v. Saban Entm\u2019t, Inc., </em>60 F.3d 27, 33-34 (2d Cir.1995)). Upon review of the record, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that McPherson faded to make such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">$ * <em>%</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the plaintiffs appeal is DISMISSED m part and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
