Miller; and (2) declining to certify his untimely appeal pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(c). <em>In re Mark Anthony Maynard, </em>No. A36 429 796 (B.I.A. May 5, 2004) (per curiam), <em>aff'g </em>A36 429 796 (Immig. Ct. Napanoch, N.Y. March 1, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">We generally lack jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense, unless the petitioner raises either a constitutional claim or question of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>see also Noble v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 73, 77 (2d Cir.2007). Further, a petitioner may not \u201cus[e] the rhetoric of a \u2018constitutional claim\u2019 or \u2018question of law\u2019 to disguise what is essentially a quarrel about fact-finding or the exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Barco-San-doval v. Gonzales, </em>516 F.3d 35, 39 (2d Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 330 (2d Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-13\">With this standard in mind, we consider Maynard\u2019s claims. Maynard\u2019s argument that the BIA committed legal error by failing to provide adequate reasoning for its discretionary decision not to certify his appeal is not a question of law over which we may exercise jurisdiction. Conclusory statements that the BIA committed legal error, absent a showing that the BIA failed to address completely any discretionary exceptions to general timeliness rules, cannot change a disagreement with a discretionary decision into a question of law. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 329 (finding a lack of jurisdiction where \u201cthe petition for review essentially disputes the correctness of an IJ\u2019s fact-finding or the wisdom of his exercise of discretion and raises neither a constitutional claim nor a question of law\u201d); <em>see also Zhong Guang Sun v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>421 F.3d 105, 111 (2d Cir.2005) (finding legal error where the BIA failed to even mention any procedure by which it could excuse an untimely appeal). After establishing the uncontested fact that Maynard\u2019s petition for review was untimely filed, the BIA went on to expressly consider the possibility of certifying the appeal to itself pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(c). Under this provision, the BIA may certify \u201cin its discretion\u201d without regard to untimeliness. <em>Id. </em>Because the BIA expressly considered certification and Maynard\u2019s arguments in its favor, it cannot rightly be said to have committed legal error by failing to adequately consider his claims or explain its reasons for rejecting them. Thus, Maynard\u2019s quarrel is with the BIA\u2019s discretion<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>ary decision, rather than the process by which it was reached. Accordingly, he raises no actual question of law such that we may exercise jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Finally, we find that the procedure by which the BIA dismissed Maynard\u2019s untimely appeal did not violate his due process rights. In order to establish a violation of due process, Maynard must show \u201cthat [he] was denied a full and fair opportunity to present [his] claims or that the IJ or BIA otherwise deprived him of fundamental fairness.\u201d <em>Burger v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d 131, 134 (2d Cir.2007) (internal quotations omitted). As discussed above, the BIA expressly addressed both Maynard\u2019s explanation for his untimeliness and its own discretionary option to entertain the appeal notwithstanding its untimeliness. <em>See Saloum v. U.S. Citizenship &amp; Immigration Servs., </em>437 F.3d 238, 243 (2d Cir. 2006) (\u201cA petitioner may not create the jurisdiction that Congress chose to remove simply by cloaking an abuse of discretion argument in constitutional garb.\u201d). Further, Maynard has failed to establish that the BIA denied him fan' notice or an opportunity to be heard. Thus, Maynard\u2019s petition properly construed \u201cmerely quarrels over the ... justification for the [BIA\u2019s] discretionary choices ...,\u201d without raising a colorable constitutional claim. <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Because Maynard\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s discretionary decision presents no constitutional claim or question of law, we lack jurisdiction to review it further. Accordingly, the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
