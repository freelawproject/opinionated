Ilaraza argues that his sentence, which was within the recommended guidelines range, was substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">An appellate court\u2019s review of a sentence must start with the issue whether the district court committed any \u201csignificant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If the sentencing decision is procedurally sound, the appellate court then considers \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Ilaraza did not challenge the substantive reasonableness of his sentence in the district court, this issue should be reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert denied</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 2959, 171 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008). Ilaraza concedes that plain error review applies but seeks to preserve the issue of the applicable standard of review for Supreme Court review.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-20\">Ilaraza has not shown that the district court plainly erred in imposing a sentence of 168 months of imprisonment. Ilaraza\u2019s within-guidelines sentence is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Rita v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Ilaraza\u2019s contention that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to comply with its intention \u2014 noted in the Statement of Reasons \u2014 to sentence him in the middle of the guideline range is unavailing. Ilaraza has not shown that the court did not understand 168 months to be a sentence in the middle of the guideline range; he thus has not shown that the notation in the Statement of Reasons contradicts the court\u2019s actual sentencing in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>tention. Moreover, to the extent that the Statement of Reasons conflicts with the court\u2019s pronouncement at sentencing, the court\u2019s oral pronouncement controls. <em>See United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 935 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Ilaraza also argues that the district court accorded improper weight to his criminal histoi\u2019y to determine the particular guidelines sentence that it imposed. Given that a defendant\u2019s criminal history is a factor that a court may consider in imposing a non-guidelines sentence, <em>see United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 709 (5th Cir.2006), the district court did not err in using Ilaraza\u2019s criminal history to determine where he should be sentenced within the applicable guidelines range. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.4 (2006). In fact, \u00a7 3553 requires the court to consider, among other things, the history and characteristics of a defendant and the need for the sentence imposed to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(C). In the instant case, Ilaraza had an extensive criminal history, including some offenses that were unaccounted for in his guidelines sentence, and his prior offenses were salient in the parties\u2019 sentencing arguments. Thus, the district court\u2019s consideration of Ilaraza\u2019s criminal history to determine a specific guidelines sentence was not plainly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Ilaraza further argues that a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines <em>range </em>\u2014 i.e., 140 months \u2014 would have been sufficient to achieve the sentencing objectives of \u00a7 3553(a). However, there is nothing in the record to support Ilaraza\u2019s argument and, in any event, \u201c[tjhat an appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Likewise, his contention that the sentencing court failed to identify any other circumstances that suggested a sentence above 140 months\u2019 imprisonment was necessary is without merit. Because the district court imposed a sentence within the guidelines range, a lengthy explanation of the sentence was not required and this court will infer that the district court considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth the Guidelines. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468. Accordingly, Ilaraza has not shown that the sentence imposed by the district court constituted error, plain or otherwise. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 376 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>,\u2014U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 163, 169 L.Ed.2d 112 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
