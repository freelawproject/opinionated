PORFILIO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b648-20\">Everett Lee Cavely seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to vacate, set aside or correct sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We deny his request for a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Mr. Cavely was convicted of various drug and firearm offenses and sentenced to 440 months in prison. We affirmed his conviction and sentence, <em>United States v. Cavely, </em>318 F.3d 987 (10th Cir.), and the Supreme Court denied him a writ of cer-tiorari, <em>Cavely v. United States, </em>539 U.S. 960, 123 S.Ct. 2653, 156 L.Ed.2d 659 (2003) . He timely filed his \u00a7 2255 motion but moved to amend it after the one-year filing deadline expired. Although the district court initially permitted him to amend his \u00a7 2255 motion, the court recognized in its March 26, 2008, order that the amendment was untimely. Nevertheless, the court found that Mr. Cavely\u2019s added claims under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) , were foreclosed because <em>Blakely </em>does not apply retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">As for his originally filed \u00a7 2255 motion, the court determined that none of Mr. Cavely\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims warranted relief under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Specifically, the court found that his trial attorney had not been ineffective in failing to impeach police officers on the precise timing of Mr. Cavely\u2019s consent to search his business or in failing to question officers on their justification for performing a protective sweep of his home. The court also concluded that Mr. Cavely\u2019s appellate attorney had not rendered ineffective assistance by declining to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence underlying an element of a firearms conviction. Mr. Cavely appealed, but the district court denied a COA. His application for a COA is now before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">An appeal from the district court\u2019s decision may not be taken absent a grant of COA by this court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). The issuance of a COA is jurisdictional, <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003), and requires an applicant to make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C \u00a7 2253(c)(2). An applicant \u201csatisfies this standard by demonstrating that jurists of reason could disagree with the district court\u2019s resolution of his constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 327, 123 S.Ct. 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">The district court refused to grant a COA because Mr. Cavely failed to make a substantial showing that he was denied a constitutional right and failed to cite authority indicating that the issues presented could be decided differently. We agree with this assessment. Nothing in Mr. Cavely\u2019s appellate materials, the district court\u2019s orders, or the relevant legal authority suggests that he was denied a constitutional right or that reasonable jurists would decide the case differently. Accordingly, for substantially the same reasons as articulated by the district court in its orders dated March 26, 2008, and April 4, 2008, we DENY Mr. Cavely\u2019s request for a COA and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b648-5\"> After examining the brief and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed.R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
