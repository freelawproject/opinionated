Johnson appeals from an order of the District Court entered on August 15, 2006, adopting the June 13, 2006 Report and Recommendation of Magistrate Judge Frank Maas, denying Johnson\u2019s pro se motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">On November 15, 1999, Johnson was charged with three counts, all stemming from the same incident: (1) bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a); (2) armed bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d); and (3) using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). On April 5, 2000, a jury found Johnson guilty on all three counts. On September 28, 2000, the District Court sentenced Johnson to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count One and 274 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count Two, to run concurrently. The District Court also sentenced him to 300 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count Three, to run consecutively to all other terms, special assessments of $300, restitution in the amount of $4,100, and five years\u2019 supervised release. Johnson appealed, and on November 28, 2001, we affirmed the judgment of the District Court by summary order. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>24 Fed.Appx. 70 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">On December 27, 2002, Johnson filed a pro se motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, raising several claims. The District Court referred the petition to Magistrate Judge Mass, who issued a Report and Recommendation on June 1, 2006, recommending the denial of Johnson\u2019s motion. On or about June 23, 2006, Johnson submitted objections to the Report and Recommendation, asserting for the first time that his conviction for both armed bank robbery (Count One) and bank robbery (Count Two) violated the double jeopardy clause. In an August 14, 2006 order, the District Court adopted the magistrate\u2019s Report and Recommendation in its entirety, and rejected Johnson\u2019s double jeopardy claims on the merits, without reaching the issue of whether those claims were procedurally proper. The District Court then dismissed Johnson\u2019s petition with prejudice, and declined to issue a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">On April 11, 2007, Johnson moved in this Court for a certificate of appealability, and on April 16, 2007, we granted the motion with respect to: \u201c(1) whether Appellant\u2019s double jeopardy claim was waived when it was not raised on direct appeal and was first raised in the district court in Appellant\u2019s objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation; and (2) whether Appellant\u2019s two separate convictions and concurrent sentences entered by the district court for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d), were erroneous\u201d in light of our decision in <em>United States v. Sappe, </em>898 F.2d 878 (2d Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">The government conceded at oral argument that it was erroneous for the District Court to enter two separate convictions and concurrent sentences for Johnson\u2019s violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d). <em>See Sappe, </em>898 F.2d at 880-81. The two sentences at issue here are to run concurrently, and therefore, the remedy for the District Court\u2019s failure to merge the two counts will not change the aggregate sentence. Thus, we will not require a remand and instead will modify the judgment to vacate the conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). <em>See United States v. McLeod, </em>251 F.3d 78, 84 (2d Cir.2001) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">Upon a review of the record and the arguments of counsel, we reject Johnson\u2019s remaining arguments as lacking in merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment is MODIFIED to vacate defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence on Count One under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), and to vacate the $100 special assessment imposed on that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>Count. As modified, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
