We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">Medical source statements from Lewis\u2019s examining and treating physicians would have materially assisted the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) in determining Lewis\u2019s ability to perform work-related activities on a sustained basis. Accordingly, the ALJ erred and failed to fulfill his duty to fully and fairly develop the record when he failed to request those statements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Tonapetyan v. Halter, </em>242 F.3d 1144, 1150 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cThe ALJ in a social security case has an independent \u2018duty to fully and fairly develop the record and to assure that the claimant\u2019s interests are considered.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513(b)(6) (requiring ALJ to request, from the claimant\u2019s physicians, \u201cmedical source statements] about what [the claimant] can still do despite [his or her] impairment(s).\u201d); <em>see also </em>SSR 96-5p, 1996 WL 374183, *4 (July 2, 1996) (defining medical source statements).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-14\">The hypothetical posed to the Vocational Expert (VE) and relied on by the ALJ in finding Lewis not disabled was legally inadequate. The ALJ found Lewis\u2019s migraine headaches to be \u201csevere,\u201d which required a finding that Lewis\u2019s migraine headaches significantly limited her physical or mental ability to do basic work activity. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1521(a); <em>see also </em>SSR 96-8p, 1996 WL 374184, *2 (July 2, 1996) (noting that a severe impairment has more than a minimal effect on a claimant\u2019s ability to do basic work activities). The ALJ failed to include limitations reflecting the severity of the migraine headaches in Lewis\u2019s residual functional capacity (RFC) assessment and in the hypothetical posed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>VE upon which the ALJ relied. <em>See Robbins v. Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>466 F.3d 880, 886 (9th Cir.2006) (holding that hypothetical to a VE based on an incomplete set of limitations is legally inadequate).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Finally, the ALJ\u2019s reason for rejecting the opinion of treating physician Dr. Rex is neither legitimate nor supported by substantial evidence. The ALJ rejected Dr. Rex\u2019s opinion that Lewis was disabled on the sole ground that Dr. Rex failed to support the opinion with objective medical evidence such as treatment records. However, the record establishes that Dr. Rex did supply treatment records supporting his opinion. <em>See Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830 (9th Cir.1995) (holding that an ALJ may not reject the controverted opinion of a treating physician unless he provides \u201c\u2018specific and legitimate reasons\u2019 supported by substantial evidence in the record for so doing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">We have considered and reject all other claims raised by Lewis. We reverse and remand with instructions to remand to the Commissioner of Social Security for further administrative proceedings consistent with this memorandum disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b522-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-17\">. The Commissioner of Social Security does not dispute that the AU failed to request medical source statements from Lewis's treating and examining physicians.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
