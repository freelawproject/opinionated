On appeal, Butler argues that the district court erred by denying his \u00a7 3582(c) motion without recalculating his guideline range under the amendment, and that the record did not support the denial. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-21\">We review a district court\u2019s order denying a sentence reduction, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-22\">Under the Guidelines, the offense level of a career offender is generally determined by reference to his offense statutory maximum. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Amendment 506, effective November 1, 1994, changed the definition of \u201coffense statutory maximum\u201d so that it included only the basic statutory maximum, rather than a maximum that had been increased by virtue of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ath-dedup-0\">\u2018Offense Statutory Maximum,\u2019 for the purposes of [\u00a7 4B1.1] refers to the maximum term of imprisonment authorized for the offense of conviction that is a crime of violence or controlled substance offense, <em>not including any increase </em>in that maximum term under a sentencing enhancement provision that applies because of the defendant\u2019s prior criminal record (such sentencing enhancement provisions are contained, for example, in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), (b)(1)(C), and (b)(1)(D)). For example, where the statutory maximum term of imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) is increased from twenty years to thirty years because the defendant has one or more qualifying prior drug convictions, the \u2018Offense Statutory Maximum\u2019 for the purposes of this guideline is twenty years and not thirty years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-24\">U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 506 (emphasis added). Applying this amendment, Butler <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>contends that when he was sentenced in July 1997, the sentencing enhancements should not have been included in determining his offense level for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Thus, he says, his offense level should have been 32, rather than 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Yet in May 1997, the Supreme Court held that Amendment 506 violated the plain language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 944(h) because that section required that \u201coffense statutory maximum\u201d must include sentencing enhancement provisions. <em>United States v. LaBonte, </em>520 U.S. 751, 757-62, 117 S.Ct. 1673, 137 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1997). In response to <em>LaBonte, </em>the Commission issued Amendment 567, which amended \u00a7 4B1.1 cmt. n. 2 to specify that \u201coffense statutory maximum\u201d includes sentencing enhancement provisions. See U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">We find no merit to Butler\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c) motion. Under Section 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a defendant\u2019s previously imposed sentence, after considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, when the term of imprisonment was based on a guideline range that was <em>subsequently lowered </em>by the Sentencing Commission, as long as the reduction is consistent with the Commission policy statements. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Here, however, Amendment 506 \u2014 which Butler now claims was retroactively applicable to him \u2014 was in place in July 1997, when he was sentenced. As a result, that amendment could not have been retroactively applicable to him, and he therefore is not entitled to relief under Section 3582(c). Moreover, at the time he was sentenced, the Supreme Court had already invalidated Amendment 506, and the district court correctly calculated Butler\u2019s sentence based on the guidelines that were valid and applicable to him at that time. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Butler\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
