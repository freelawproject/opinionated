We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law, <em>Alta-mirano v. Gonzales, </em>427 F.3d 586, 591 (9th Cir.2005), and for abuse of discretion the IJ\u2019s denial of a request for a continuance, <em>Sandoval-Luna v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 1243, 1246 (9th Cir.2008) (per curiam). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-25\">The agency did not err in determining that Ramirez Reyes was removable where he conceded the allegations and admitted the charge in the Notice to Appear. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(2)(A) (alien has burden of establishing that he is entitled to be admitted or that he is lawfully present pursuant to a prior admission).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-26\">The IJ did not abuse his discretion in refusing to grant Ramirez Reyes a second continuance in order to attack his criminal conviction collaterally in state court. <em>See Gonzalez v. INS, </em>82 F.3d 903, 908 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Ramirez Reyes\u2019 contention regarding whether his conviction under Cal.
