We will affirm the order denying <em>informa pauper-is </em>status and vacate the dismissal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">Douris filed a motion to proceed <em>in for-ma pauperis </em>in District Court in a civil rights action against Middletown Township, Newtown Borough, and two police officers. Douris alleged in his complaint that the police officers injured his hands while fingerprinting him at the police station in connection with disorderly conduct charges. In his <em>informa pauperis </em>motion, Douris stated that he had not been employed since 1994, he was disabled, he had no income or cash, and he owned half of a house valued at $100,000 and half of a car valued at $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">The District Court denied Douris\u2019s motion to proceed <em>informa pauperis, </em>stating that Douris appeared to qualify financially for such status, but concluding that Dour-is\u2019s frequent filings in federal court constituted an abuse of the system and \u201cextreme circumstances\u201d that justified denying <em>in forma pauperis </em>status. The District Court noted that this was Douris\u2019s ninth lawsuit in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania since 1999, that all of his lawsuits had lacked merit, and that significant time and resources had been spent on Douris\u2019s claims. The District Court ordered Douris to pay the filing fee within 20 days or his action would be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-14\">Douris appealed the order denying <em>in forma pauperis </em>status. After 20 days had passed, and while Douris\u2019s appeal was pending, the District Court entered an order dismissing Douris\u2019s action for failure to pay the filing fee. Douris filed another notice of appeal, and the two appeals were consolidated. We grant Douris\u2019s motions to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>for the purpose of these appeals. We have jurisdiction over Douris\u2019s first appeal because an order denying <em>in forma pauperis </em>status is final for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>Deutsch v. United States, </em>67 F.3d 1080, 1083 (3d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-15\">The <em>in forma pauperis </em>statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, \u201cis designed to ensure that indigent litigants have meaningful access to the federal courts.\u201d <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 324, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). Specifically, Congress enacted the statute to ensure that administrative court costs and filing fees, both of which must be paid by everyone else who files a lawsuit, would not prevent indigent persons from pursuing meaningful litigation. <em>Deutsch, </em>67 F.3d at 1084. Toward this end, \u00a7 1915(a) allows a litigant to commence a civil or criminal action in federal court in <em>forma pauperis </em>by filing in good faith an affidavit stating, among other things, that he is unable to pay the costs of the lawsuit. <em>Neitzke, </em>490 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>U.S. at 324, 109 S.Ct. 1827.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Congress recognized, however, that a litigant whose filing fees and court costs are assumed by the public, unlike a paying litigant, lacks an economic incentive to refrain from filing frivolous, malicious, or repetitive lawsuits. <em>Neitzke, </em>490 U.S. at 324, 109 S.Ct. 1827; <em>Deutsch, </em>67 F.3d at 1084. To prevent such abusive litigation, \u00a7 1915(e) (formerly \u00a7 1915(d)) authorizes federal courts to dismiss an <em>in forma pauperis </em>complaint if satisfied that the action is frivolous or malicious. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Like the other courts of appeals, we have established procedures by which \u00a7 1915 is to operate. <em>Deutsch, </em>67 F.3d at 1084. In this Circuit, leave to proceed <em>in forma paupens </em>is based on a showing of indigence. <em>Id. </em>at 1084 n. 5 (citing <em>Roman v. Jeffes, </em>904 F.2d 192, 194 n. 1 (3d Cir. 1990)). The court reviews the litigant\u2019s financial statement, and, if convinced that he or she is unable to pay the court costs and filing fees, the court will grant leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. Id. See also Sinwell v. Shapp, </em>536 F.2d 15, 19 (3d Cir.1976) (holding that the district court abused its discretion in denying <em>in forma pauperis </em>status based on a finding of improper venue, rather than on economic status). In cases where leave is granted, the court thereafter considers the separate question whether the complaint should be dismissed as frivolous or malicious under \u00a7 1915(e). <em>Deutsch, </em>67 F.3d at 1084 n. 5; <em>Sinwell, </em>536 F.2d at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">We have noted in dicta that \u201cextreme circumstances\u201d might justify denying an otherwise qualified litigant leave to proceed <em>informa paupens. Deutsch, </em>67 F.3d at 1085 n. 5 (citing <em>Lockhart v. D\u2019Urso, </em>408 F.2d 354, 355 (3d Cir.1969) (per curiam)). In <em>Deutseh, </em>we stated that we had not delineated the circumstances that might be sufficiently \u201cextreme\u201d to justify denial, but we \u201cremained] open to the possibility that an affiant may someday warrant invocation of this exception to the usual procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Relying on <em>Deutseh, </em>the District Court concluded that Douris\u2019s abusive filings constituted such \u201cextreme circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">We hold that the District Court did not err in denying <em>in forma pauperis </em>status based on Douris\u2019s abusive filings. As recognized by the District Court, Douris has repeatedly and unsuccessfully filed lawsuits claiming violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act and other civil rights violations, and his lawsuits have required the expenditure of significant judicial resources. We have affirmed orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>dismissing these suits pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), <em>see Douris v. Huff, </em>C.A. No. 06-4924, and <em>Douris v. Newtown Borough, </em>C.A. No. 06-2015; we have also dismissed as frivolous an appeal from an order dismissing a complaint, <em>see Douris v. Bucks County, et al., </em>C.A. No. 05-1362; and we have affirmed orders granting motions to dismiss and/or motions for summary judgment, <em>see, e.g., Douris v. Office of Pa. Attorney General, </em>C.A. No. 04-2953. The abusive nature of Douris\u2019s filings is further exemplified by his many filings in this Court while his appeal has been pending.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Finally, the District Court lacked jurisdiction to issue the order dismissing Douris\u2019s action after Douris filed his notice of appeal. <em>Venen v. Sweet, 758 </em>F.2d 117, 120-21 (3d Cir.1985). Accordingly, we shall affirm the order of the District Court denying Douris\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in for-ma pauperis. </em>We also shall vacate the District Court\u2019s order dismissing Douris\u2019s action and shall remand this matter for further proceedings conditioned upon Douris\u2019s payment of the requisite filing fee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> All of Douris\u2019s outstanding motions are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b158-6\">. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">Subject to subsection (b) [applicable to prisoners], any court of the United States may authorize the commencement, prosecution or defense of any suit, action or proceeding, civil or criminal, or appeal therein, without prepayment of fees or security therefor, by a person who submits an affidavit that includes a statement of all assets such prisoner possesses [sic] that the person is unable to pay such fees or give security therefor. Such affidavit shall state the nature of the action, defense or appeal and affiant\u2019s belief that the person is entitled to redress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1). The reference to prisoners in \u00a7 1915(a)(1) appears to be a mistake. <em>In forma paupens </em>status is afforded to all indigent persons, not just prisoners.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b158-12\">. In <em>Deutsch, </em>we cited <em>In re Sindram, </em>498 U.S. 177, 111 S.Ct. 596, 112 L.Ed.2d 599 (1991) (per curiam), as support for the possibility that there may be an exception to the usual procedure. In that case, the Supreme Court denied in <em>forma pauperis </em>status to a petitioner who sought an extraordinary writ, noting that it had a duty to deny <em>in forma pauperis </em>status to those, like the petitioner, who had abused the system. <em>Id. </em>at 180, 111 S.Ct. 596. After <em>Sindram, </em>the Supreme Court amended its rules to provide that it may deny <em>in fonna pauperis </em>status where a petition for a writ of certiorari, jurisdictional statement, or petition for an extraordinary writ is frivolous or malicious. <em>See Zatko v. California, </em>502 U.S. 16, 17, 112 S.Ct. 355, 116 L.Ed.2d 293 (1991) (invoking rule).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b159-7\">. There may be little practical effect to a litigant when <em>in forma pauperis </em>status is denied based on an abuse of the system. As noted above, when a litigant is granted <em>in forma pauperis </em>status based on indigence, the district court may dismiss the complaint as frivolous or malicious under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). <em>See Sinwell, </em>536 F.2d at 18-19. Like the denial of <em>in forma pauperis </em>status, a dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) is without prejudice to the filing of a paid complaint. <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 34, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b159-24\">. Upon remand, the District Court shall provide a reasonable amount of time to pay the filing fee, and, of course, may dismiss the action should Douris fail to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
