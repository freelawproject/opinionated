The . NPS received 22 proposals in response, including a proposal from appellee Wassel Realty Group, Inc. (\u201cWRG\u201d). WRG\u2019s proposal identified 44 buildings at Fort Hancock for possible rental and envisioned \u201ca sophisticated, multi-use facility that would feature a technology-driven office space and a state-of-the-art educational facility and conference center.\u201d An NPS-appointed panel evaluated the proposals and recommended WRG\u2019s proposal and another company\u2019s proposal for negotiation.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-17\">WRG organized appellee Sandy Hook Partners, LLC (\u201cSH Partners\u201d) and, in November 2001, the NPS and SH Partners executed a Letter of Intent committing the parties to enter into a lease pertaining to certain buildings at Fort Hancock. The NPS circulated a draft Environmental Assessment (\u201cEA\u201d) of WRG\u2019s proposal in February 2002, a revised EA in July 2003, and a Finding of No Significant Impact in July 2003. On July 9, 2004, NPS and SH Partners executed a 60-year lease for 36 buildings at Fort Hancock.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-18\">Appellants Save Sandy Hook Corp., a non-profit group headquartered in Middle-town, New Jersey, and James M. Coleman, Jr. filed suit alleging (1) that the lease between NPS and SH Partners violates the National Park Service Organic Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1, <em>et seq., </em>and the Gateway Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 460cc, <em>et seq.; </em>(2) that the lease violates the National Historic Preservation Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 470, <em>et seq.; </em>and (3) that the NPS violated the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321, <em>et seq., </em>by entering into the lease. In essence, appellants claimed that \u201c[t]he proposed uses authorized by the Lease amount to a thinly disguised corporate office park in derogation of the purposes and values for which the Sandy Hook Unit was created and, as a result, will result in the crass commercialization and privatization of the Sandy Hook Unit in violation of the purposes and values for which Gateway was established.\u201d Among other things, appellants asked the District Court for a declaration that the lease violates the above-listed federal statutes and a declaration that the lease is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-19\">The parties cross-moved for summary judgment and, on September 13, 2007, 2007 WL 2704813, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees. Appellants timely appealed, as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>serting that the District Court erred in dismissing two of its three claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We have carefully examined the record and considered the parties\u2019 arguments on appeal and can discern no error in the District Court\u2019s ruling. Accordingly, we will affirm for substantially the reasons set forth in Judge Cooper\u2019s excellent fifty-six page opinion. <em>See Laird v. Horn, </em>414 F.3d 419, 425 (3d Cir.2005) (affirming \u201cfor substantially the reasons set forth by the district court in its well-reasoned opinion\u201d).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
