Nov. 1, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 95 708 722 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 28, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-26\">When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, this Court reviews both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions\u2014 or more precisely, the Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). For asylum applications governed by the REAL ID Act of 2005, the agency may, considering the totality of the circumstances, base a credibility finding on an asylum applicant\u2019s demeanor, the plausibility of his or her account, and inconsistencies in his or her statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Thus, we \u201cdefer to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility detei\u2019mination which was based on: (1) the inconsistency between Wang\u2019s testimony that he was arrested on December 5th and later testimony that he was arrested on February 10th; (2) the omission from Wang\u2019s asylum application of any assertion that he was beaten during his detention, despite his testimony that he was; and (3) the implausibility of Wang\u2019s testimony that the government did not revoke his business license after arresting him and closing down his store for selling Falun Gong compact discs.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Wang asserts that the inconsistency and omission are minor. However, under the REAL ID Act, which applies to Wang\u2019s application for relief, \u201can IJ may rely on <em>any </em>inconsistency or omission in making an adverse credibility determination as long as the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 establishes that an asylum applicant is not credible.\u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167 (emphasis in original). Although Wang asserts that he reasonably explained the omission from his asylum application, a reasonable factfinder would not be compelled to credit his explanation that he forgot to include the beating or that he was pressured by a snakehead. <em>See Ma-jidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Regarding the IJ\u2019s implausibility finding, Wang argues that he could not reasonably be expected to know the motivation for the government\u2019s actions concerning his business. However, when taken in the context of the IJ\u2019s other findings, the IJ did not err in finding this testimony implausible. <em>See Ying Li v. BCIS, </em>529 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir.2008) (explaining that this Court reviews implausibility findings in the context of the entire record and \u201cnot whether each unusual or implausible feature of the account can be explained or rationalized\u201d). Additionally, the IJ properly found that Wang\u2019s deficient corroboration rendered him unable to rehabilitate his testimony. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Taken as a whole, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167. Therefore, the IJ properly denied Wang\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief where the only evidence that he would be persecuted or tortured depended on his credibility. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance Procedure 34(a)(2), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>with Federal Rule of Appellate and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
