McNeil brought suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims challenging a levy imposed on his federal retirement annuity to collect back taxes and penalties. The Court of Federal Claims dismissed McNeil\u2019s action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>McNeil v. United States, </em>78 Fed.Cl. 211, 239(2007). <em>We affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">McNeil is a retired federal employee who receives annuity payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability fund. He has refused to pay income tax on those annuity payments. In 2006, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) served a Notice of Levy on the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) to collect McNeil\u2019s unpaid taxes for tax years 2002 and 2003, along with penalties from 1999 through 2003. OPM informed McNeil that it would reduce his retirement annuity payments as required by the levy, and it explained to McNeil that he must contact the IRS if he intended to challenge the levy.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">McNeil instead brought suit in the Court of Federal Claims. In his pro se complaint, McNeil objected to the IRS\u2019s assessment of any tax on his retirement annuity, the IRS\u2019s levy of the annuity, and OPM\u2019s execution of the levy. His complaint raised numerous constitutional, statutory, and regulatory theories purportedly supporting these objections. As the Court of Federal Claims correctly explained, \u201c[a]ll of [McNeil\u2019s] objections are premised on his belief that his retirement annuity is property, and not income subject to taxation.\u201d <em>McNeil, </em>78 Fed.Cl. at 215-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-13\">The government moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In a detailed opinion, the Court of Federal Claims addressed each of McNeil\u2019s asserted claims and jurisdictional theories, concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and granted the government\u2019s motion. McNeil appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-14\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3). \u201cWe review the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction <em>de novo.\u201d Ontario Power Generation, Inc. v. United States, </em>369 F.3d 1298, 1300 (Fed.Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-15\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b785-16\">\u201cThe Court of Federal Claims is a court of limited jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Southfork Sys., Inc. v. United States, </em>141 F.3d 1124, 1132 (Fed.Cir.1998). \u201c[T]o establish jurisdiction under the Tucker Act for a suit for money damages, \u2018a plaintiff must identify a separate source of substantive law that creates the right to money damages,\u2019 in other words, \u2018that source must be \u201cmoney-mandating.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Ferreiro v. United States, </em>501 F.3d 1349, 1351-52 (Fed.Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Fisher v. United States, </em>402 F.3d 1167, 1172 (Fed.Cir.2005) (en banc in relevant part)). Liberally construed, McNeil\u2019s brief on appeal raises four possible sources of substantive law: (1) the Administrative Procedure Act; (2) the authority of the Court of Federal Claims to adjudicate a tax dispute; (3) the Takings Clause; and (4) 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8346 and 8470. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-17\">First, regardless of whether McNeil could have obtained review in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>federal district court under the Administrative Procedure Act, he cannot obtain review under that act in the Court of Federal Claims. The Court of Federal Claims \u201clacks the general federal question jurisdiction of the district courts, which would allow it to review [an] agency\u2019s actions and to grant relief pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act.\u201d <em>Crocker v. United States, </em>125 F.3d 1475, 1476 (Fed.Cir.1997)</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Second, the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction under the Tucker Act for actions seeking a refund of taxes only when the plaintiff has satisfied the \u201cfull payment rule.\u201d <em>Shore v. United States, </em>9 F.3d 1524, 1526 (Fed.Cir.1993) (citing <em>Flora v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 145, 150, 80 S.Ct. 630, 4 L.Ed.2d 623 (1960)). Under the \u201cfull payment rule,\u201d a taxpayer must fully pay disputed taxes and seek a refund from the IRS before filing suit. <em>See id. </em>McNeil has neither fully paid his taxes nor sought a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Third, the Takings Clause does not provide a basis for jurisdiction, because McNeil has not conceded the validity of the challenged tax, levy, and execution. <em>See Crocker, </em>125 F.3d at 1476 (holding that the Tucker Act does not create jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims for a party that challenges the validity of a taking); <em>Tabb Lakes, Ltd. v. United States, </em>10 F.3d 796, 802 (Fed.Cir.1993) (\u201c[The] claimant must concede the validity of the government action which is the basis of the taking claim to bring suit under the Tucker Act.\u201d) To the contrary, McNeil has insisted \u2014 both in his complaint and on appeal\u2014 that the actions of the IRS and OPM were \u201cwrongful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Finally, McNeil cites 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8346 and 8470 and claims that the Court of Federal Claims ignored a binding decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board \u2014 by which he presumably means the original decision to award him a retirement annuity. Sections 8346 and 8470 both provide that certain retirement benefits are not subject to levy \u201cexcept as otherwise may be provided by Federal laws.\u201d Neither section mandates the payment of money damages, and therefore neither section can be the basis for Tucker Act jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">The Court of Federal Claims therefore properly granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Because the remainder of McNeil\u2019s arguments on appeal address the merits of his underlying claim rather than the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims, we need not address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we <em>affirm </em>the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
