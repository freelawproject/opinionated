Fisk, Office of United States Attorney, Philadelphia, PA, for Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b953-7\">Before: McKEE, SMITH, and WEIS, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b953-8\">\n<em>OPINION</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b953-9\">WEIS, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">Javon Shoemake pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base (\u201ccrack\u201d) in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, distribution and possession with intent to distribute cocaine base (\u201ccrack\u201d) in violation of various provisions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, and aiding and abetting in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">At Shoemake\u2019s April 4, 2007 sentencing, the District Court found that his total offense level of 34 and criminal history category I resulted in an advisory guideline range of 151-188 months. The Court sentenced Shoemake to 151 months of incarceration based on the 100 to 1 disparity between the recommended sentences for crack and powder cocaine offenses involving the same quantity of the offending substance in the 2006 United States Sentencing Guidelines and other sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-12\">On appeal, Shoemake argues that he should be resentenced because the District Court did not consider whether the disparate treatment of crack cocaine and powder cocaine in the Guidelines produced an unnecessarily long sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-13\">In <em>Kimbrough v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 558, 575, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), the Supreme Court held that district courts could conclude \u201cwhen sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary5 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes.\u201d <em>Kimbrough </em>is in harmony with our decisions in <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324 (3d Cir. 2006), and <em>United States v. Gunter, </em>462 F.3d 237 (3d Cir.2006). <em>Gunter, </em>which was decided on September 11, 2006, prior to Shoemake\u2019s plea and sentencing, held that the 100 to 1 crack/powder cocaine ratio should be treated \u201cas simply advisory at step three of the <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing process (imposing the actual sentence after considering the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors).\u201d <em>Gunter, </em>462 F.3d at 249. Thus, Shoemake could have objected to the disparity before the District Court and may not raise it for the first time on appeal. <em>See United States v. King, </em>518 F.3d 571, 576-77 (8th Cir.2008) (defendant could not raise the issue of the crack/powder cocaine disparity for the first time on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-17\">On November 1, 2007, however, the United States Sentencing Commission adopted Amendment 706 to the advisory Guidelines. \u201cIn general, the effect of Amendment 706 is to decrease by two levels the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses.\u201d <em>United States v. Wise, </em>515 F.3d 207, 219 (3d Cir.2008) (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 (Nov. 1, 2007); U.S.S.G. Supp. to App\u2019x C, Amend. 706). On March 3, 2008, Shoemake became eligible for retroactive application of the reduced advisory crack guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 (Supp. March 3, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-18\">In Shoemake\u2019s case, the application of the amendment would result in a 2-level reduction, reducing the advisory range from 151-188 months to 121-151 months. In its brief, the government agreed that, if the amendment became retroactive and no new information emerges with respect to the danger Shoemake poses to society, his sentence should be reduced to 121 months, one month above the mandatory minimum, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>should he file a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">In light of the government\u2019s admission, we will remand this case to the District Court so that it can decide whether to reduce the sentence based on the amended advisory range and the standard set forth in \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Marcello, </em>13 F.3d 752, 756 n. 3, 758 (3d Cir. 1994), <em>superseded on other grounds by </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.20 (2000), <em>as recognized in United States v. Spinello, </em>265 F.3d 150, 160 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b954-11\">. Section 3582(c)(2) provides a mechanism for a defendant to receive, at the district court\u2019s discretion, a reduction in a sentence that was based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
