We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">On July 22, 2008, Defendant-Appellant was released from custody without any subsequent term of supervision. As Defendant-Appellant appealed only his sentence, which he has now served in full, we dismiss this appeal as moot. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Suleiman, </em>208 F.3d 32, 36-37 (2d Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Mercurris, </em>192 F.3d 290, 293-94 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the appeal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
