We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">The District Court acted well within its discretion in admitting evidence of Carter\u2019s marijuana distribution. Carter contends that the District Court should have applied the balancing test articulated in <em>United States v. Sampson, </em>980 F.2d 883 (3d Cir.1992). Because the evidence of marijuana distribution was direct evidence of Carter\u2019s relationship with his co-conspirators, rather than evidence of \u201cother acts,\u201d <em>Sampson </em>is not relevant here. <em>Sampson </em>applies only to evidence admitted under Rule 404(b), Federal Rules of Evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">We are not impressed by Carter\u2019s assertion that the District Court made several errors at sentencing: (a) improperly calculating the amount of cocaine Carter was responsible for distributing; (b) enhancing Carter\u2019s base offense level by four levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a); and (c) further enhancing Carter\u2019s sentence based upon a determination of obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-12\">The District Court found that Carter was responsible for distributing over 15 kilograms of cocaine pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. Fact finding by a judge shall not be set aside \u201cunless clearly erroneous, and the reviewing court must give due regard to the trial court\u2019s opportunity to judge the witnesses\u2019 credibility.\u201d Rule 52(6), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \u201cClearly erroneous\u201d has been interpreted to mean that a reviewing court may upset a finding of fact, even if there is some evidence to support the finding, only if the court is left with \u201cthe definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. U.S. Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948). This means the appellate court must accept the factual determination of the fact finder unless that determination \u201ceither (1) is completely devoid of minimum evidentia-ry support displaying some hue of credibility, or (2) bears no rational relationship to the supportive evidentiary data.\u201d <em>Krasnov v. Dinan, </em>465 F.2d 1298, 1302 (3d Cm. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-13\">Testimony of several witnesses established that Carter trafficked more than 15 kilograms of cocaine, and the District Court determined that these witnesses were \u201cvery credible.\u201d App. 575. We accord \u201cgreat deference to a presiding judge\u2019s credibility determinations in sentencing proceedings because she is able to directly observe a testifying witness\u2019s tone and demeanor.\u201d <em>United States v. Leekins, </em>493 F.3d 143, 150 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-14\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-15\">Carter contends that the District Court erred in enhancing his offense level by four levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). Under \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), the sentencing court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>may increase the offense level by four levels \u201c[i]f the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 BBl.l(a). A \u201cdefendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants\u201d to qualify for this enhancement. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.1, cmt. n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">The District Court concluded that Carter qualified for an enhancement under \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). Sufficient evidence indicates that Carter functioned as a leader and organizer of an extensive cocaine distribution conspiracy involving more than five participants. He organized trips to Columbus, Ohio, to obtain large amounts of cocaine for his co-conspirators and orchestrated sales between co-conspirators when he was out of town. <em>See </em>App. 288-290. He also exerted control over the participants of the conspiracy when he excluded a co-conspirator from the enterprise because the co-conspirator attempted to sell Carter\u2019s cocaine back to Carter at a higher price. <em>Id. </em>at 442-443.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">We are satisfied with the District Court\u2019s finding that Carter obstructed justice pursuant to \u00a7 3C1.1. Obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 includes \u201cthreatening, intimidating, or otherwise unlawfully influencing a ... witness ... directly or indirectly, or attempting to do so.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, cmt. n. 4(a). Carter threatened a government witness when, in a voice message for a witness, he said, \u201cloose lips sink ships\u201d and \u201cyou should be running instead of running your mouth.\u201d App. 292. The following exchange about those statements occurred between the witness and the prosecution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-8\">Q. And how did you take that? What did you interpret that to mean? Did you consider it a threat?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-14\">The District Court gave meaningful consideration to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and concluded that Carter\u2019s sentence was reasonable. The burden to show unreasonableness rests on the party challenging the sentence, and this Court gives deference to a district court\u2019s judgment on whether sentencing was reasonable under \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 330 (3d Cir.2006). A district court need not state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or record its consideration of each factor. Instead, \u201c[t]he record must demonstrate the trial court gave meaningful consideration to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-15\">Here, the District Court considered \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1); \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A); \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B); and \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C). <em>See </em>App. 543, 568-577.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-16\">s\u00a1s s\u00a1c # s}: \u00edJ\u00ed</p>\n<p id=\"b983-17\">We have considered all of the contentions presented by the parties and conclude that no further discussion is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-18\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
