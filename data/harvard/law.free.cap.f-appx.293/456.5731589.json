Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 770, 773 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in construing petitioner\u2019s motion for administrative closure as a motion to reopen where petitioner sought closure to pursue possible amnesty relief should Congress pass amnesty legislation. Petitioner\u2019s motion was filed after a final administrative order had been entered, and, accordingly, there were no administrative proceedings to close.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">In addition, an alien who is subject to a final order of removal is limited to filing one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and that motion must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Because petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen was filed beyond the 90-day deadline, and petitioner has not contended that any exceptions to this time limit apply, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s untimely motion to reopen. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-15\">Accordingly, respondent\u2019s unopposed motion for summary disposition is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-16\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-17\">Petitioner\u2019s motion for reinstatement of voluntary departure is denied. <em>See Garcia v. Ashcroft, </em>368 F.3d 1157 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b483-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
