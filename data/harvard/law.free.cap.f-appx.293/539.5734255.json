The sole question on appeal is whether the district court erred in determining that the TIG following-form excess policy failed to sufficiently specify that its exclusion for \u201cany ... earth movement\u201d was meant to exclude coverage for \u201csinkhole collapse\u201d in light of a provision extending coverage for such a peril in PUD\u2019s primary insurance policy with Federated Rural Electric Insurance Exchange (\u201cFederated\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation of the TIG policy, and we affirm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">TIG argues that the district court erred in finding that the TIG policy provided coverage for sinkhole collapse. We disagree. The primary goal in interpreting a contract is to determine the agreement intended by the parties at the time of contract. <em>Berg v. Hudesman, </em>115 Wash.2d 657, 801 P.2d 222, 226 (1990). Nonetheless, under Washington law, \u201c[i]f the language of an insurance contract is clear and unambiguous, the court must enforce it as written and may not modify or create ambiguity where none exists.\u201d <em>Pub. Util. Dist. No. 1 of Klickitat County v. Int\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>124 Wash.2d 789, 881 P.2d 1020, 1025 (1994). Where the language of a contract, however, \u201cis fairly susceptible to two different reasonable interpretations\u201d it is considered ambiguous. <em>Weyer-haeuser Co. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>123 Wash.2d 891, 874 P.2d 142, 145 (1994). \u201cUnresolved ambiguities are resolved against the drafter-insurer and in favor of the insured.\u201d <em>Queen City Farms v. Cent. Nat\u2019l. Ins. Co., </em>126 Wash.2d 50, 882 P.2d 703, 713 (1994) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">The TIG excess policy, which follows the \u201cterms, conditions, and definitions of coverage and recovery\u201d of the Federated policy \u201c[ejxcept as provided elsewhere in [the TIG excess policy],\u201d specifically excludes coverage for \u201cany ... earth movement.\u201d The TIG excess policy itself does not anywhere define \u201cearth movement.\u201d Undefined terms in a contract are not necessarily ambiguous and are generally assigned their \u201cplain, ordinary, and popular meaning.\u201d <em>Queen City Farms, </em>882 P.2d at 712. <em>See also Truck Ins. Exch. v. Rohde, </em>49 Wash.2d 465, 303 P.2d 659, 664 (1956). Whether the plain meaning of earth movement includes a sinkhole collapse is a difficult question to answer with certainty. The Court need not undertake such an inquiry here, however, as the Federated policy, which the TIG policy follows unless it provides otherwise, may reasonably be read to define the term \u201cearth movement\u201d to exclude sinkhole collapse.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">The TIG policy provision in question is contained in Section I.D., as amended by the Miscellaneous Endorsement. The sentence beginning \u201cAny earth movement (other than sinkhole collapse) ...\u201d in Section I.D.(2)(a) may be viewed as defining the term \u201cearth movement\u201d in the immediately preceding heading \u201c2. Losses resulting from earth movement\u201d as excluding sinkhole collapse. Of course, the same language may alternately be reasonably interpreted to define \u201cearth movement\u201d as including sinkhole collapse. In this latter view, the words \u201cother than\u201d preceding \u201csinkhole collapse\u201d suggest that sinkhole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>collapse is a form of earth movement, but that sinkhole collapse is excepted from the earth movement exclusion. In light of these two reasonable interpretations, the Federated policy is ambiguous as to the definition of earth movement. As unresolved ambiguities are to be interpreted in favor of the insured, we must therefore interpret the Federated policy as defining earth movement to exclude sinkhole collapse.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Because the TIG excess policy \u201cfollow[s] the terms, conditions, and definitions\u201d of the Federated policy unless it specifies otherwise, we properly import the Federated policy definition of earth movement into the TIG excess policy. Further, even without this following form language, the Federated policy\u2019s definition of earth movement is strong extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 intended meaning for earth movement in the TIG policy because the latter policy was clearly intended to apply \u201can additional layer of excess coverage\u201d over the Federated policy. <em>Sentry Select Ins. Co. v. Royal Ins. Co. of Am., </em>481 F.3d 1208, 1221 (9th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Pub. Util. Dist. No. 1 of Klickitat County, </em>881 P.2d at 1027) (applying Washington law to find that definition of terms in an underlying policy was extrinsic evidence of the meaning of the same terms in endorsement to umbrella policy); <em>see also Coleman Co., Inc. v. California Union Ins. Co., </em>960 F.2d 1529, 1533-34 (10th Cir.1992) (relying on general principles of insurance law to find that umbrella policy expressly following underlying policy may have certain of its terms defined by reference to the underlying policy.)</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">TIG asserts that we may not read the TIG excess policy in conjunction with the Federated policy. In TIG\u2019s view, the excess policy stands alone. In support of this proposition, TIG relies on <em>Home Ins. Co. v. American Products Corp., </em>902 F.2d 1111 (2d Cir.1990) (per curiam). However, that case states that where there is no conflict between a \u201cfollowing form\u201d policy, such as the TIG policy, and an underlying policy, they must be read together in determining the scope of the excess insurer\u2019s liability. <em>Id. </em>at 1113; <em>see also Coleman, </em>960 F.2d at 1534 n. 9 (\u2018While the court [in <em>Home Insurance </em>] recognized that ... the excess policy would control in the event it conflicted with the underlying policy, it nonetheless stated that \u2018both policies must be looked to in determining the scope\u2019 of the excess insurer\u2019s liability.\u201d (quoting <em>Home Insurance, </em>902 F.2d at 1113)).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Unlike in <em>Home Insurance, </em>where there was a \u201cconflict\u201d between the two policies because the excess policy explicitly excluded the expenses at issue from coverage while the underlying policy included them, <em>see </em>902 F.2d at 1113-14, here there is no \u201cconflict\u201d or inconsistency. The Federated and TIG policies do not define \u201cearth movement\u201d in an inconsistent manner; rather, the TIG policy is simply less specific than the Federated policy in that it does not state whether \u201csinkhole collapse\u201d is encompassed in the \u201cearth movement\u201d exclusion. Because there is no \u201cconflict,\u201d we look to both the Federated policy and the TIG policy to determine whether the TIG policy, like the Federated policy, covers sinkhole collapse. Doing so, in turn, reveals the ambiguity that requires us to rule in favor of PUD.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">TIG also brings to our attention this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Northrop Grumman Corp. v. Factory Mutual Ins., </em>538 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir.2008). In that case, Northrop Grumman Corporation procured both a primary and excess policy from Factory Mutual Insurance Company. 538 F.3d at 1091-92. At issue was the meaning of the word \u201cflood\u201d in the excess policy. The insured sought to use the differing definition of flood in the primary and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>excess policies to create ambiguity with regard to the meaning of flood in the excess policy. This court, applying California law, rejected the insured\u2019s argument, asserting that \u201c[tjhough the primary policy may be consulted in interpreting the excess policy, we decline to treat the two documents as one contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1095. The court also refused to read into the excess policy\u2019s less specific definition of flood, as compared to the primary policy\u2019s definition, ambiguity as to whether the insurer thereby intended to narrow the meaning of the word in the excess policy. <em>Id. </em>at 1096-98. The court instead proceeded to define flood according to its plain meaning and the definition laid down in the excess policy alone. <em>Id. </em>at 1095-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">The holding in <em>Northrop </em>in no way forecloses our analysis here. There is no indication in the court\u2019s review of the excess policy at issue in <em>Northrop </em>that it was a following form policy like the TIG policy. Furthermore, as noted above, we do not find ambiguity here because of differing definitions of earth movement in the Federated and TIG policies, as was urged in <em>Northrop </em>with respect to the definition of flood. We find ambiguity in this case because the TIG policy possesses no definition of earth movement, requiring us by the TIG policy\u2019s own terms to reference the Federated policy, which itself is ambiguous in its definition of earth movement.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Accordingly, we hold as a matter of law that the TIG policy provides coverage for sinkhole collapse and affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b566-6\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
