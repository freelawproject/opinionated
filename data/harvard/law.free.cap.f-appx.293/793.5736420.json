Montante, Jr. denying petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen her removal order. <em>In re Lolita Shivmangal, </em>No. A39 060 935 (B.I.A. Apr. 23, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-20\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir. 2005). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conelusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-21\">In declaring the decision of the immigration judge final, the BIA explained that \u201cpayment could not be collected on the check that [petitioner] submitted in payment of the fee requirement.... The respondent has failed to satisfy the fee requirements for filing an appeal.\u201d (internal citations omitted). This ruling is consistent with the regulations governing appeals to the BIA. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.8 provides that a filing fee or a fee waiver request is required in connection with a motion to reopen before the BIA. And the regulations specify that appeals to the BIA \u201cmust be accompanied by a cheek, money order, or fee waiver request in satisfaction of the fee requirements.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.3(a)(3). The regulations further provide that the fee shall be paid by check, money order, or electronic payment, and \u201c[a] payment that is uncollectible does not satisfy a fee requirement.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.8(a)(4)(i). \u201cAn appeal is not prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>erly filed unless it is received at the Board, along with all required documents, fees or fee waiver requests, and proof of service, within the time specified\u201d by the regulations. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.3(a)(1). In addition, the regulations state that if the fee is not paid within the requisite time period, \u201cthe appeal will not be deemed properly filed and the decision of the Immigration Judge shall be final to the same extent as though no appeal had been taken.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.38(d). These regulations are unambiguous and controlling on the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Petitioner argues that the BIA erred in failing to consider whether there were \u201cextraordinary or unique circumstances such that the petitioner\u2019s appeal should have been heard, despite the untimeliness of the filing.\u201d <em>Zhong Guang Sun v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>421 F.3d 105, 111 (2d Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have explained that the \u201cBIA \u2018abuses its discretion\u2019 in dismissing an appeal as untimely when it does not consider whether the reasons given for an untimely appeal constitute extraordinary or unique circumstances.\u201d <em>Khan v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 255, 259 (2d Cir.2007). We further noted, however, that \u201c[w]e do not lightly infer such omissions on the part of administrative adjudicators.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because this case does not present \u201csufficient indicia that the BIA did not consider the limited equitable exceptions to the timely filing of appeals discussed in <em>Zhong Guang Sun,\u201d id., </em>remand is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Finally, petitioner argues that the BIA erred in failing to exercise its jurisdiction to reopen her case <em>sua sponte </em>pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). \u201c[A] decision of the BIA whether to reopen a case <em>sua sponte </em>under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) is entirely discretionary and therefore beyond our review. ...\u201d <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam). Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to consider this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
