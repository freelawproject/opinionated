California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), requesting permission to withdraw as counsel, and Anderson has filed a <em>pro se </em>brief in response. Because we conclude that Anderson\u2019s appeal is \u201cwholly frivolous,\u201d <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment of conviction and sentence and grant his counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. In addition, pursuant to our Local Appellate Rule 109.2, we note that the legal issues presented in this appeal lack legal merit and do not require the filing of a petition for a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-18\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b987-19\">On May 29, 2003, the government returned a three-count indictment charging Anderson and others with violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371 and 2314. Count I of the indictment charged that the defendants had violated \u00a7 371 by conspiring to violate \u00a7 2314, and Counts II and III charged the defendants with substantive violations of \u00a7 2314. The charges stemmed from a number of burglaries committed by Anderson and his confederates between 2000 and 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-20\">On September 29, 2004, Anderson, represented at that time by a different attorney than his present counsel, pled guilty to Counts I and II of the indictment in exchange for the government\u2019s promise to recommend a two-level downward adjustment to his base offense level at sentencing, and a further promise that the government would not initiate further criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>charges against him in connection with his offenses in this case. On December 29, 2005, Anderson was provided with new counsel, who has represented him at sentencing and on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">On March 15, 2006, Anderson appeared for sentencing and expressed his \u201cdeepest condolences\u201d to the victims of his crimes. (Appellant App. at 30.) The District Court sentenced him to 109 months imprisonment, three years supervised release and restitution in the amount of approximately $355,000. On March 24, 2006, Anderson filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\"><em>II. </em>Discussion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">Anderson\u2019s counsel argues in an <em>Anders </em>brief that the only conceivably legitimate issues \u2014 i.e., whether former counsel was ineffective and whether Anderson\u2019s sentence was unreasonable \u2014 are frivolous. Anderson has filed a <em>pro se </em>brief arguing that the <em>Anders </em>brief is too conelusory to be considered by us. On the merits, he further alleges that there was not a sufficient factual basis for his guilty plea because Hector Lima, whom Anderson says is an eyewitness to the burglaries, supposedly informed a private investigator that he could not identify Anderson. He also contends that his earlier counsel was ineffective because he failed to interview Lima prior to the plea hearing, failed to file a motion to suppress Lima\u2019s statements, and failed to file a motion to withdraw Anderson\u2019s guilty plea. Finally, Anderson alleges that the warrant used to arrest him lacked probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">Under <em>Anders, </em>counsel \u201cshould ... advise the court and request permission to withdraw\u201d if he finds an appeal \u201cto be wholly frivolous[ ] after a conscientious examination of it.\u201d 386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. A counsel\u2019s request to withdraw must be \u201caccompanied by a brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, when counsel submits an <em>Anders </em>brief, the Court considers \u201c(1) whether counsel adequately fulfilled the rule\u2019s requirements; and (2) whether an independent review of the record presents any nonfrivolous issues.\u201d <em>United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 300 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">Pointing to the brevity of the <em>Anders </em>brief and its omission of the various arguments raised in his <em>pro se </em>brief, Anderson\u2019s first argument is that the <em>Anders </em>brief fails to meet the standard set forth in the first prong of the <em>Youla </em>test. However, we do not reject briefs \u201cin those cases in which frivolousness is patent[,]\u201d <em>United States v. Marvin, </em>211 F.3d 778, 781 (3d Cir.2000), and that is certainly the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">Anderson next argues that there was an insufficient factual basis for his guilty plea because, after pleading guilty, he \u201chad a premonition of his innocence,\u201d and hired a private investigator to interview Hector Lima. (Pro Se Br. at 3.) Lima allegedly told the private investigator that he was unable to identify Anderson, and the investigator gave Anderson an affidavit documenting that conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>We will construe Anderson\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief liberally. In doing so, it appears that Anderson is arguing that the investigator\u2019s affidavit shows that the District Court erred in accepting his guilty plea.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That argument, is frivolous. A district court may only accept a guilty plea if \u201cthere is a factual basis for the plea.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(3). That standard does not require, however, that the court be \u201cconvinced beyond a reasonable doubt of a defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Lessner, </em>498 F.3d 185, 197 (3d Cir.2007). Rather, the court only needs to \u201cfind sufficient evidence in the record as a whole to justify a conclusion of guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A \u201cdefendant\u2019s own admissions\u201d are enough to supply the required basis. <em>Id. </em>The record plainly establishes that Anderson admitted in open court to committing the crimes with which he was charged. Because Anderson admitted to committing the charged offenses, it was not plain error for the District Court to accept his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Next, Anderson claims that his former counsel was ineffective because he did not seek to question Lima prior to the plea hearing, because he failed to move to suppress Lima\u2019s statements, and because he failed to move to -withdraw the guilty plea. Anderson\u2019s argument is frivolous because \u201cineffective assistance of counsel claims ... are ... not entertained on a direct appeal\u201d unless \u201cthe record is sufficient to allow determination of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>United States v. McLaughlin, </em>386 F.3d 547, 555-56 (3d Cir. 2004). Anderson\u2019s claim is made on direct appeal, and the record does not establish that \u201can evidentiary hearing to develop the facts is not needed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For example, Anderson\u2019s claim turns in part on the veracity of the affidavit concerning Lima\u2019s alleged statements to the investigator, and, therefore, we cannot determine the merits of that claim on the current record.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">Next, Anderson argues that the warrant used to arrest him lacked probable cause. That argument is frivolous because Anderson entered a guilty plea in open court, thereby waiving his right to make that claim. <em>See Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973) (noting that a criminal defendant may not, after admitting guilt, \u201craise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">Finally, the <em>Anders </em>brief discusses whether \u201cthe sentence imposed was improper.\u201d (Appellant Br. at 4.) As defense counsel notes, the District Court imposed a sentence that was within the range contemplated by the plea agreement, and our own review of the record confirms that the District Court did not err in imposing that sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">\n<em>III. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b989-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment of conviction and sentence, and grant defense counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b988-7\">. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. As explained more fully in this opinion, we must review the claims raised in Anderson\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief and the claims discussed in the <em>Anders </em>brief to determine whether they are \"wholly frivolous.\" <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. Our standard for determining frivolousness depends upon the standard of review applicable to the potential claims. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 974-76 (7th Cir.2002) (noting that, in <em>Anders </em>context, withdrawal of guilty plea is reviewed for abuse of discretion while a Rule 11 violation is reviewed for plain error).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b989-6\">. When an appellant alleges on appeal for the first time that there is no factual basis for a guilty plea, our review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Lessner, </em>498 F.3d 185, 196 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b989-7\">. Indeed, by signing the plea agreement, Anderson agreed to waive a number of challenges to his sentence, including, <em>inter alia, </em>any challenge to \"the sentencing court's authority to sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines in accordance with [the terms of the plea agreement.]\u201d (Supp.App. at 7 \u00b6 12-13.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
