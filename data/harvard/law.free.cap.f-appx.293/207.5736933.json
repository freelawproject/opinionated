The district court properly calculated Portillo-Sosa\u2019s advisory Guidelines range to be 57-71 months of imprisonment, and sentenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>him to 71 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Portillo-Sosa appeals, alleging his sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review a sentence to determine whether it is unreasonable, applying a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A district court must engage in a multi-step process at sentencing. First, the sentencing court must calculate the appropriate Guidelines range by making any necessary factual findings. <em>Id. </em>at 596. Then the court should afford the parties \u201can opportunity to argue for whatever sentence they deem appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Next, it should consider the resulting advisory sentencing range in conjunction with the factors set out in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2008), and determine whether the \u00a7 3553(a) factors support the sentence requested by either party. <em>Id. </em>Consideration of the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) does not require the sentencing court to \u201crobotically tick through\u201d every subsection of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">To determine whether a sentencing court abused its discretion, we undertake a two-part analysis. <em>United States v. Pau-ley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). First, we examine the sentence for \u201csignificant procedural errors,\u201d and second, we evaluate the substance of the sentence. <em>Id. </em>Significant procedural errors include \u201c \u2018failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). \u201cSubstantive reasonableness review entails taking into account the \u2018totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). An appellate court may presume a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable. <em>Rita v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2459, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">Here, the district court followed the necessary steps in sentencing Portillo-Sosa, and we find no abuse of discretion in its decision to sentence him at the top of the Guidelines range. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b234-8\"> Portillo-Sosa does not challenge the calculation of his advisory Guidelines range.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
