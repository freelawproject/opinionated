The parties entered into a settlement agreement, which the district court approved. On September 5, 2007, that court, retaining jurisdiction, dismissed the matter without prejudice to the plaintiffs\u2019 right to reopen the matter to enforce the agreement. Forty-eight days later, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel contacted Allstate because plaintiffs had not received payment; the check arrived the next day. Several weeks later, on November 13, 2007, plaintiffs moved to reopen the case and sought penalties, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs. They did not, however, state under which rule of civil procedure they were proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-15\">In light of the fact that plaintiffs cast the standard of review on appeal as abuse of discretion and moved for relief more than ten days after entry of judgment, it appears they were proceeding under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The only applicable subsection of that rule allows relief from a final judgment for \u201cany other reason that justifies relief.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6). This relief will be granted only under \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Batts v. Tow-Motor Forklift Co., </em>66 F.3d 743, 747 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-16\">Plaintiffs rely on La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 22:658 (2008) and 22:1220 (2008) for the proposition that failure to pay an insurance settlement within thirty days entitles the insured to penalties, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs. Instead of creating strict liability for the insurer, however, \u00a7 22.658 requires a showing that the insurer was \u201c \u2018arbitrary, capricious, or without probable cause,\u2019 a phrase that is synonymous with \u2018vexatious.\u2019\u201d <em>Reed v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>857 So.2d 1012, 1021 (La. 2003) (quoting <em>La. Maint. Servs., Inc. v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London, </em>616 So.2d 1250, 1253 (La.1993)). In the district court and on appeal, plaintiffs have failed to offer any proof that Allstate acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or without probable cause. The burden is on plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>tiffs to offer such proof, <em>id. </em>at 1020, and they have not.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claim under \u00a7 22.1220(B)(2) does not demonstrate such \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d as to justify reopening the judgment under rule 60(b)(6). Plaintiffs concede that Allstate has paid the agreed settlement amount. The district court\u2019s denial of the equitable relief available under rule 60(b)(6) was not \u201cso unwarranted as to constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d 396, 402 (5th Cir. Unit A Jan.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
