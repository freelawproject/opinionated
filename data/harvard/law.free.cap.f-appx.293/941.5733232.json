McDonald alleges that the District Court erred in finding that substantial evidence supported the Commissioner\u2019s decision that McDonald was not disabled from March 8, 2004 (his alleged disability onset date) through March 14, 2006 (the date of the decision by the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) denying benefits). Attacking the administrative decision underlying the District Court\u2019s opinion, McDonald alleges that the ALJ erred in determining that McDonald\u2019s impairments did not meet or equal the requirements in the Listing of Impairments, Appendix 1 to Subpart P, 20 C.F.R. Part 404 (the \u201cListed Impairments\u201d), and that the ALJ erred in determining that McDonald could make an adjustment to other work. For the following reasons, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-15\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b968-16\">Because we write primarily for the benefit of the parties, we set forth only those facts pertinent to the issues before us on appeal. McDonald filed an application for DIB and SSI on August 23, 2004, claiming that he stopped working on March 3, 2004, following a head injury. He sustained his injury when, as he was shopping, an employee at a Lowe\u2019s hardware store dropped a boxed, 45-pound toilet from a ladder, striking McDonald\u2019s head, neck, and right shoulder, and cracking two of his teeth. McDonald claimed that the ongoing pain, blackouts, dizziness, headaches, and back spasms resulting from the injury, in addition to the tiredness caused by his pain medication, limited his ability to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-17\">McDonald\u2019s application was initially denied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He filed a timely request for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>hearing before an ALJ, and, following a hearing on February 6, 2006, the ALJ issued a decision on March 14, 2006, finding that McDonald was not disabled under the Act and, therefore, was not entitled to DIB or SSI.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> McDonald appealed that decision to the Appeals Council, which denied his request for review. Accordingly, the ALJ\u2019s decision denying benefits was adopted as the Commissioner\u2019s final decision. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.981, 416.1481. On appeal, the District Court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s denial of McDonald\u2019s claim. McDonald then timely appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">II. Discussion<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">The Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) has established a five-step sequential evaluation process to determine whether a person is disabled under the Act. <em>See Ramirez v. Barnhart, </em>372 F.3d 546, 550-51 (3d Cir.2004). At step one, the SSA will find that an individual is not disabled unless he demonstrates that he is not working at a \u201csubstantial gainful activity.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(b), 416.920(b). At step two, the SSA will find no disability unless the individual shows that he has a \u201csevere impairment,\u201d defined as \u201cany impairment or combination of impairments which significantly limits [the individual\u2019s] physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(c), 416.920(c). If the individual successfully demonstrates that he has a severe impairment, the SSA determines at step three whether the impairment meets or equals one of the \u201cListed Impairments,\u201d a list of problems presumed severe enough by the SSA to render one disabled; if the impairment does, the individual qualifies as disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(d), 416.920(d). If, however, the individual\u2019s impairment is not on the list, the inquiry proceeds to step four and the SSA assesses whether the individual has the \u201cresidual functional capacity\u201d to perform his previous work. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(e), 416.920(e). The SSA will determine that the individual, is not disabled unless he shows that he is unable to perform his previous work. If the individual satisfies step four, the fifth step requires the SSA to consider his residual functional capacity together with his \u201cvocational factors\u201d (the individual\u2019s age, education, and past work experience) to determine whether he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>capable of performing other jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(g), 416.920(g). A significant number of jobs exist in the national economy if there are a significant number of jobs either in the region where the individual lives or in several regions in the country. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1560(c), 416.960(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">In conducting the five-step evaluation, the ALJ in this case first found that McDonald was not gainfully employed. Second, she found that McDonald had impairments \u2014 post concussive syndrome, cervical and lumbar spine denervation, and back spasm \u2014 and that his impairments were severe. Third, the ALJ concluded that McDonald\u2019s impairments did not meet the specific criteria found in any of the Listed Impairments. Fourth, in consideration of the medical records, McDonald\u2019s symptoms, his testimony, his subjective complaints, his daily activities, and the hearing testimony of a vocational expert, the ALJ found that McDonald did not retain the residual functional capacity to perform the requirements of his past occupation. Fifth, in consideration of his residual functional capacity, age, education, work experience, and the vocational expert\u2019s testimony, the ALJ concluded that McDonald was capable of making a successful adjustment to other work that existed in significant numbers in the national economy and was, therefore, not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">A. <em>Evidentiary Basis for ALJ\u2019s Conclusion as to Listed Impairments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">McDonald first alleges that the ALJ erred in her conclusion that McDonald\u2019s impairments did not meet or equal Listed Impairments 1.04 or 12.02.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b970-11\">The ALJ determined that the record failed to reveal the necessary diagnostic testing or physical findings to meet or equal Listed Impairment 1.04, which describes disorders of the spine.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to the ALJ, McDonald\u2019s magnetic resonance images (MRIs) and x-rays were all \u201cnormal, negative or unremarkable\u201d and his physical exam findings revealed a normal gait and negative straight leg raising. (A.R. at 13.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There is substantial evidence in the record to support that determination. As the District Court noted, the medical record contains no evidence to confirm a compromised nerve root, a threshold requirement of Listed Impair<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>ment 1.04.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although Dr. Leroy Pelicci, McDonald\u2019s neurologist, noted \u201cnerve involvement\u201d following an electromyography on May 17, 2004, a nearly contemporaneous MRI revealed \u201cno significant compromise of the existing root.\u201d (A.R. at 218, 245.) Other MRIs failed to reveal significant abnormalities. Following almost a year of treatment, Dr. Pelicci ordered another MRI to explore the possibility of nerve root involvement. The MRI was normal, which left Dr. Pelicci \u201cat a loss\u201d to explain the diffuse symptomatology that McDonald was experiencing. Moreover, McDonald received chiropractic care from Dr. Mary Ann Hordesky, who noted that by August of 2004 McDonald had a negative straight leg raise test and that McDonald consistently responded favorably to care.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">There is similarly substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that McDonald failed to meet or equal all the criteria of Listed Impairment 12.02, \u201cOrganic Mental Disorders.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We cannot agree with McDonald that his medical records and Dr. Pelicci\u2019s observations clearly show that McDonald\u2019s impairments satisfy the requirements set forth in that listing. To the contrary, McDonald testified that he is able to take care of his own personal hygiene, perform some household chores, shop with his fiancee and attend church regularly. Like the District Court, we are unable to find any evidence of extended decompensation in the record and only minimal evidence of difficulties in concentration, persistence or pace. McDonald refused anti-depressants, and, although Dr. Pelicci referred him to a psychologist, the record contains no evidence that McDonald pursued that line of treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-14\">The District Court was therefore correct in concluding that the AL J had substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>evidence to support its finding that McDonald\u2019s impairments did not meet or equal a listed impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">B. <em>Evidentiary Basis for ALJ\u2019s Conclusion that McDonald Could Adjust to Other Work</em></p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">McDonald next alleges that the ALJ erred in determining that McDonald could make an adjustment to other work because the ALJ inadequately considered McDonald\u2019s residual functional capacity and vocational factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">McDonald implicitly challenges the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that McDonald \u201chas the residual functional capacity to lift 50 pounds occasionally and 25 pounds frequently, walk/stand 6 hours and sit 6 hours with a sit/stand option, with a bilateral overhead reaching limitation, [and to do a job that] does not require climbing ladders, avoids temperature extremes, noise, vibration, hazards and sudden light change and exposure and involves simple routine tasks.\u201d (A.R. at 16.) According to McDonald, the ALJ should have given more weight to McDonald\u2019s testimony regarding his memory loss, headaches and pain in his neck and back. An ALJ, however, must weigh testimony as to pain or other symptoms against objective medical evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The ALJ here found that McDonald\u2019s statements concerning the \u201cintensity, duration and limiting effects of [his] symptoms were not entirely credible\u201d because the record lacked any findings to support his claimed functional limitations. (A.R. at 15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">Our own review of the record reveals not only a similar lack of support for McDonald\u2019s complaints, but evidence to the contrary. McDonald\u2019s primary care physician noted that, a few weeks after the injury, McDonald\u2019s dizziness and light-headedness had resolved. Regular physical therapy made the pain and headaches McDonald suffered \u201cless frequent and intense.\u201d (A.R. at 141.) Chiropractic treatments regularly decreased his pain and increased his range of motion. At his final recorded visit with Dr. Pelicci, the doctor noted that McDonald was \u201cbasically stable.\u201d (A.R. at 230.) The objective evidence more than adequately supports the ALJ\u2019s residual functional capacity determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">McDonald challenges the ALJ\u2019s ultimate conclusion that he could make an adjustment to other work. He argues that his condition \u201cshould have forced the [ALJ] to conclude that the Plaintiff would be incapable of adjusting to another type of work.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 16.) We are not unsympathetic, but he overstates his case. The hypothetical posed to the vocational expert adequately reflected all of McDonald\u2019s impairments that had support in the record, as well as McDonald\u2019s age and education. In light of that, the vocational expert confirmed that work McDonald could do was available in the regional economy. For example, in line with her finding that McDonald only had \u201cmoderate limitations with his ability to maintain concentration, persistence and pace,\u201d the ALJ included in her hypothetical that the individual be limited to \u201csimple, routine tasks\u201d and that he avoid noise extremes and bright or sudden light changes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>the hypothetical was adequate, the vocational expert\u2019s testimony regarding other work provided substantial evidence for the ALJ\u2019s conclusion. <em>See Chrupcala v. Heck</em>ler, 829 F.2d 1269, 1276 (3d Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b968-13\">. According to the Commissioner, McDonald's application was evaluated according to a test program that eliminated the reconsideration step in the administrative review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>process. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.906(b)(4), 416.1406(b)(4). Accordingly, McDonald was notified that he had 60 days to ask for a hearing following the Commissioner\u2019s initial denial of his claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b969-8\">. Disability is defined as the \"inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical and mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). In order to be considered \"disabled,\u201d an individual\u2019s \"physical or mental impairment or impairments [must be] of such severity that [the individual] is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy____\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b969-13\">.
