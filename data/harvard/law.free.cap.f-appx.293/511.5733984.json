The district court properly held that the state prosecutors were entitled to absolute immunity for their parole recommendations. <em>See Genzler v. Longanbach, </em>410 F.3d 630, 636 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201cA prosecutor is protected by absolute immunity from liability for damages under \u00a7 1983 when performing the traditional functions of an advocate.\u201d) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-24\">2. The district court properly held that the parole board members were entitled to absolute immunity. <em>See Bermudez v. Duenas, </em>936 F.2d 1064, 1066 (9th Cir.1991) (\u201cAlthough a section 1983 action may be maintained against officials acting in their individual capacities, parole board officials are entitled to absolute immunity from liability for damages for their actions taken when processing parole applications.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-25\">3. The district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Warden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Susan Poole (Poole), because Brown failed to present any evidence that Poole \u201cset in motion a series of acts by others, which [she] knew or reasonably should have known, would cause others to inflict the constitutional injury.\u201d <em>See Motley v. Parks, </em>432 F.3d 1072, 1081 (9th Cir.2005) (citation, alterations, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">4. The district court correctly held that the California Department of Corrections and the California Board of Prison Terms were entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity. <em>See Dittman v. California, </em>191 F.3d 1020, 1025-26 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b537-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b537-17\">. In her opening brief on appeal, Brown did not challenge the district court's ruling that she failed to produce evidence that Steve Cooley, the Los Angeles District Attorney, had formulated a policy opposing Brown\u2019s release. That issue is waived. <em>See Rick-Mik Enterprises Inc. v. Equilon Enters., LLC, </em>532 F.3d 963, 976 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
