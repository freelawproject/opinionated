United States, </em>80 Fed.Cl. 442 (Fed.Cl. 2008) <em>(\u201cDismissal Order </em>\u201d). Because May\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim for a Fifth Amendment taking by the United States, we <em>affirm </em>the trial court\u2019s dismissal of May\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">On October 12, 2007, May filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims against the United States, the State of Florida, and various state departments and officials \u201cfor the taking [and] condemnation of [May\u2019s] limestone, limestone mining rights, sand, rock, gravel, light, air, [and] view, by flooding, [and] filing court papers turning his property into a flooding easement.\u201d May sought over $345 million in compensation for the alleged taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">The government moved to dismiss May\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim because his complaint did not identify any action by the United States that resulted in a taking of May\u2019s property and because May had not identified any parcel of real property which was taken. Because May had filed ten previous lawsuits in the Court of Federal Claims that were dismissed before a trial on the merits, the government also asked the trial court here to enter an order prohibiting May from filing future complaints in that court without prior written permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">On February 12, 2008, the trial court granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss. The trial court held that May had not alleged \u201cany action by the Corps or DHS that effected a taking of his property.\u201d <em>Dismissal Order </em>at 447. May had alleged that his property was flooded when a dike was cut, but the trial court found that May had not alleged that either the Corps or another entity acting at the Corps\u2019 direction was responsible for cutting the dike. <em>Id. </em>The trial court also stated that May had alleged that the operation of a weigh station destroyed his business, but found that May had not alleged that the federal government had any involvement in the construction or operation of the weigh station. <em>Id. </em>Instead, the trial court found that May had alleged that actions by the Florida Department of Transportation and the South Florida Water Management District amounted to a taking. <em>Id. </em>at 448.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court further held that its decision in <em>Florida Rock Industries, Inc. v. United States, </em>45 Fed. Cl. 21 (1999) was inapplicable to May\u2019s case. In <em>Florida Rock, </em>the court found that a regulatory taking occurred where the federal government denied the property owner a mining permit. <em>Id. </em>at 41\u201443. The trial court found the present case distinguishable because May had not alleged that he was denied any permit. <em>Dismissal Order </em>at 448. Finally, the trial court found that May\u2019s complaint in this case was \u201cfrivolous,\u201d and because May had filed ten previous suits, the court found that sanctions would be appropriate. Thus, it ordered that May obtain the permission of a Court of Federal Claims judge prior to filing future complaints. <em>Id. </em>at 448-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-13\">May timely appealed to this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-15\">This court reviews de novo the trial court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. <em>E.g., Greenlee County, Ariz. v. United States, </em>487 F.3d 871, 877 (Fed.Cir.2007). Under Rule 8(a)(2) of the Rules of the Court of Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>Claims (\u201cRCFC\u201d), a complaint must include \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a complaint need not contain detailed factual allegations, but the \u201c[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964-65, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">On appeal, May argues that his property was taken by flooding, and he now alleges that the Army Corps of Engineers cut the dike that flooded his property. However, he did not make such an allegation in his complaint before the trial court. Reading that complaint liberally, we agree that May failed to allege any cognizable claim against the United States for a Fifth Amendment taking, and we affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b802-9\">. The trial court stated that the claims against parties other than the United States \"must be ignored as beyond the jurisdiction of the court.\" <em>Id. </em>at 444. The caption of the trial court\u2019s opinion and its judgment listed only the United States as the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b803-14\">. RCFC 12(b)(6) is substantially identical to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
