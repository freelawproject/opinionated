Flores was arrested after an inspection of his vehicle at an immigration checkpoint on the highway between Laredo and San Antonio revealed that barrels on the truck he was driving contained marijuana. At Flores\u2019s trial, Agent Rene Martinez of the Border Patrol testified that Flores admitted knowledge of the marijuana, and a supplemental report prepared by Agent Martinez containing notes on Flores\u2019s admissions was admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-21\">Flores contends that the district court erred in excluding testimony by Agent Antonia Mojica of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) regarding his denial of knowledge of the marijuana on the vehicle. He also contends that the district court erred by failing to admit a report prepared by Agent Mojica, which reflected that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>had denied knowledge of the marijuana in an interview with DEA agents. Flores argues that the excluded evidence was admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 106. Citing Texas state authorities, Flores also relies on the \u201crule of optional completeness\u201d and on Rule 107 of the Texas Rules of Evidence. Because state evidentiary rules have no application in federal district courts, we do not consider Flores\u2019s arguments based on Texas law.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">A district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Cantu, </em>167 F.3d 198, 203 (5th Cir.1999). If an abuse of discretion is found, the error is reviewed under the harmless error doctrine. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\u201cRule 106 does not apply to a witness\u2019s testimony at trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>530 F.3d 348, 353 (5th Cir.2008). \u201cRule 106 only allows the admission of portions [of a document] that are \u2018relevant and necessary to qualify, explain, or place into context the portion already introduced.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352 (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Here, the excluded evidence was not necessary to qualify, to explain, or to place into context Flores\u2019s admission to Agent Martinez of his knowledge of the marijuana. Evidence of Flores\u2019s admission to Agent Martinez, viewed alone, was not \u201cmisleading.\u201d <em>See United States v. Branch, </em>91 F.3d 699, 727 (5th Cir.1996). Flores has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in excluding evidence. <em>See Cantu, </em>167 F.3d at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Additionally, we agree with the Government that, if the district court erred in excluding the evidence in question, any error was harmless. Agent Mojica testified that Flores told DEA agents that the purpose of his journey to San Antonio was to obtain maintenance work on the vehicle. It was clear from Agent Mojica\u2019s testimony that Flores told a different story to the DEA agents than he told to Agent Martinez and that Flores did not admit knowledge of the marijuana in his interview with the DEA. The excluded evidence would therefore have been cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">Moreover, the evidence showed that Flores admitted knowledge of the marijuana to two Border Patrol agents at different times. Agent Martinez\u2019s testimony regarding Flores\u2019s admission was similar to testimony by Agent Hector Lira that Flores indicated an awareness of the concealed marijuana. In view of the above, and considering the overall strength of the Government\u2019s case, any error in excluding evidence was harmless and did not affect Flores\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Tucker, </em>345 F.3d 320, 326-27 (5th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Skipper, </em>74 F.3d 608, 612 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b310-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
