The district court dismissed the complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim because it was barred under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Mahogany also challenges the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for reconsideration of the magistrate judge\u2019s (MJ) denial of his \u201cMotion For Judgment/Rule to Show Cause\u201d concerning the defendants\u2019 alleged spoliation of evidence. This interlocutory order merged into the district court\u2019s final judgment and became reviewable in Mahogany\u2019s appeal of the final judgment. <em>See Dickinson v. Auto Ctr. Mfg. Co., </em>733 F.2d 1092, 1102 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-14\">Mahogany\u2019s retaliation claim is not barred under <em>Heck </em>because \u201cfavorable termination [of allegedly retaliatory disciplinary proceedings] is not a requisite of a retaliatory interference claim.\u201d <em>Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1164 (5th Cir.1995). Mahogany has not, however, alleged \u201ca chronology of events from which retaliation may plausibly be inferred,\u201d nor has he shown that the defendants\u2019 destruction of evidence supported such a chronology of events. <em>Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 324-25 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-15\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mahogany\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-16\">Despite our briefing order, counsel failed adequately to brief the issue whether the district court erred in failing to consider Mahogany\u2019s retaliation claim or in denying his motion for judgment; neither has counsel addressed the issue whether Mahogany has established a retaliation claim. Counsel is ORDERED to show cause within 30 days why she should not be sanctioned. <em>See Coghlan v. Starkey, </em>852 F.2d 806, 808-09 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b286-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
