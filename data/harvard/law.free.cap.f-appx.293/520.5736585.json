Subsequently, he filed suit against Defendants Orange County, Sheriff Michael Carona, and Deputy Daniel Missel, alleging civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 and related state law tort claims. Jarboe appeals the district court\u2019s dispositive grant of summary judgment to defendants pursuant to <em>Heck v. Humphrey, 512 </em>U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Scheuring v. Traylor Bros., Inc., </em>476 F.3d 781, 784 (9th Cir.2007). \u201cViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we must determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact, and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.\u201d <em>Jackson v. City of Bremerton, </em>268 F.3d 646, 650 (9th Cir .2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Deputy Missel went to Jarboe\u2019s house to investigate a hit-and-run at a nearby 7-Eleven. Shortly after he arrived, Jarboe pulled into his driveway with his pickup truck. The deputy asked Jarboe about the hit-and-run; he denied any involvement. The deputy began to inspect the truck for damage and saw what he thought was a handgun in the truck. He ordered Jarboe to \u201ccome here,\u201d and asked whether he had any weapons on his person or in the truck. Jarboe answered no. After Jarboe failed to comply with his \u201ccome here\u201d command, Jarboe said the deputy began to fire his gun. The deputy said that Jarboe moved toward the front passenger side of the truck after he commanded Jarboe to \u201ccome here.\u201d He feared Jarboe was going for the handgun. A physical struggle between the two ensued. The deputy radioed for backup and peppered sprayed Jar-boe. The wind blew some of the pepper spray back into the officer\u2019s eyes. His vision was blurred and he thought he saw Jarboe reach inside the truck. He dropped the pepper spray, drew his weapon, and fired six shots. Because he was afraid Jarboe was still trying to get to the gun, he fired another ten shots. Jarboe pled nolo contendere to resisting and obstructing a police officer under CaL.Penal Code \u00a7 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">Jarboe\u2019s acts of resistance all occurred in a brief span of two minutes and ten seconds. Nevertheless, his acts prior to the shooting included (1) denying that he was involved in the hit-and-run accident under investigation, and (2) his refusal to comply with Deputy Missel\u2019s command. In an action such as this where the defendant relies on <em>Heck, </em>he has the burden of proving that the plaintiffs success will necessarily imply the invalidity of the plaintiffs underlying conviction. <em>Sanford v. Motts, </em>258 F.3d 1117, 1119 (9th Cir.2001). Here, we are unable to discern from the record the factual basis for Jarboe\u2019s plea. Accordingly, his excessive force claim for activity that followed his acts of resistance does not necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction and is therefore not barred by <em>Heck. See Smith v. City of Hemet, </em>394 F.3d 689, 698 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc). On the facts, we conclude that this case is distinguishable from <em>Cunningham v. Gates, </em>312 F.3d 1148 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b546-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
