STOCKARD, Jr., Plaintiff-Appellant, v. Michael J. ASTRUE, Commissioner of Social Security, Defendant-Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b419-13\">No. 07-2148.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b419-14\">United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b419-16\">Aug. 14, 2008.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b420-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>BEFORE: NORRIS, BATCHELDER, and GIBBONS, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b420-10\">MEMORANDUM OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b420-11\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">Plaintiff was denied Supplemental Security Income (\u201cSSI\u201d) benefits under Title XVI of the Social Security Act. In its review of the decision, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Commissioner of Social Security. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-13\">Plaintiff filed an application for SSI benefits on April 30, 2003, which was subsequently denied. A Social Security Administration hearing was held on October 13, 2005, where the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) determined that plaintiff was not \u201cdisabled\u201d as defined under the Social Security Act, and thus was ineligible for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-15\">Plaintiff subsequently brought an action for judicial review in district court. The district court referred cross motions for summary judgment to a magistrate judge. Finding substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s decision, the magistrate judge recommended that summary judgment in favor of the Commissioner be granted. Plaintiff did not object to the report and recommendation, which the district court later adopted in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-16\">Although plaintiff filed an appeal of the district court decision to adopt the magistrate judge\u2019s report, a party who does not file timely objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, after being advised to do so, waives his right to further appeal under the doctrine articulated in <em>United States v. Walters, </em>638 F.2d 947, 949-50 (6th Cir.1981) (\u201c[A] party shall file objections with the district court or else waive right to appeal.\u201d). <em>See also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 155, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985); <em>United States v. Sullivan, </em>431 F.3d 976, 984 (6th Cir.2005). In this case, the magistrate judge\u2019s report specifically stated that the parties must file objections within ten days, and a failure to file specific objections would constitute a waiver of any further right of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-17\">This court may choose not to apply the rule if exceptional circumstances are present that justify disregarding the rule in the interests of justice. <em>Thomas, </em>474 U.S. at 155 &amp; n. 15, 106 S.Ct. 466. \u201cRecognizing that the waiver rule is not absolute, this court has excused default \u2018where the district court\u2019s error is so egregious that failure to permit appellate review would work a miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>431 F.3d at 984 (quoting <em>United States v. Real Property Located at 1184 Drycreek Rd., </em>174 F.3d 720, 726 (6th Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>After a careful review of plaintiffs filings, the record before us, including the earlier decisions, we discern no circumstances that persuade us to disregard the <em>Walters </em>waiver rule. Furthermore, were this court to reach the merits of the ease, the result would be the same. The Commissioner\u2019s determination was clearly supported by substantial evidence as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). In addition, plaintiff attached a number of documents to his pro se brief. To the extent this court might construe these attachments as an implicit request to have his case remanded pursuant to the sixth sentence of \u00a7 405(g), the request fails because the evidence submitted is not \u201cnew and material.\u201d <em>See Hollon ex rel. Hollon v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>447 F.3d 477, 483-84 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">For the reasons outlined above, we hold that by failure to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, plaintiff has waived appellate review. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
