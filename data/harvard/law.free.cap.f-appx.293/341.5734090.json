This court reviews a sentencing decision for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which is the equivalent of abuse-of-discretion review. <em>Gall v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">The district court did not treat the Guidelines as mandatory and stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine a reasonable sentence. <em>See id. </em>Solis argues that the sentence should nevertheless be vacated and the case summarily remanded on the basis of the Supreme Court\u2019s intervening decisions in <em>Gall </em>and <em>Kimbrough v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), which, he urges, \u201chave fundamentally altered the legal landscape of federal sentencing.\u201d The argument is not well-taken as nothing in the record suggested that the district court was constrained by this court\u2019s precedent from fully considering Solis\u2019s ai\u2019guments for a non-guideline sentence. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338-39 (5th Cir. 2008). Specifically, Solis contends that the district court erroneously felt it lacked the discretion to disagree with the Guidelines instruction to run the sentence consecutively to his prior undischarged term. However, the record establishes that the district court was aware of its authority to decline to impose a consecutive sentence if it felt the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a) were better served by concurrent sentences. Contrary to Solis\u2019s assertion, the district court did not feel it lacked the authority to impose concurrent sentences; rather, it simply denied his request for concurrent sentences based on its determination that a consecutive sentence was appropriate on the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-18\">Solis further contends that the district court felt constrained not to deviate from the Guidelines despite its disagreement with guidelines policy choices regarding the 16-level U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b) increase. This argument is similarly not supported by the record. The district court rejected Solis\u2019s contention that the 16-level enhancement was inappropriate because robbery was not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A), which argument Solis conceded was foreclosed by Fifth Circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Santiesteban-Hemandez, </em>469 F.3d 376, 378 (5th Cir.2006). At no time did the district court indicate that it would have been inclined not to impose the increase because of the individual circumstances of Solis\u2019s conviction but believed it lacked the authority to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-19\">Additionally, Solis argues, for the first time on appeal, that the district court erred in assessing the 16-level increase because such increase is \u201cempirically unsupported.\u201d By \u201cempirically unsupported,\u201d Solis means that the Sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Commission did not determine the appropriateness of the amount of increase, 16 levels, based on empirical data and thus the decision to increase by 16 levels was \u201cessentially arbitrary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">To satisfy procedural reasonableness, the district court is required first to correctly calculate the guidelines range, and the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) increase was properly applied in the instant case due to Solis\u2019s prior robbery conviction. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>see also Santiesteban-Her-nandez, </em>469 F.3d at 378. Solis\u2019s argument that the enhancement should not apply due to any lack of empirical support is without merit. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b368-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
