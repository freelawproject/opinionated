The district court granted the United States judgment as a matter of law, and Stewart has appealed. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-28\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss (which it treated as a motion for summary judgment) by applying the same standards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>the district court used.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That standard requires us to determine if the Government is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, meaning no reasonable trier of fact could find in Stewart\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Stewart\u2019s claim is that a doctor treating him at a Veteran Affairs hospital committed medical malpractice during a throat examination. The source of the doctor\u2019s alleged malpractice was his failure to ask Stewart to consent to the examination. To succeed on this claim, Stewart must meet the requirements of the Federal Tort Claims Act, which in turn requires him to establish all of the elements of a cause of action for medical malpractice under Texas law, since the alleged malpractice occurred in Texas.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under Texas law, the plaintiff in a medical malpractice claim alleging lack of informed consent must present expert testimony to support his position.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Stewart, however, neither timely designated an expert (i.e. told the district court the identity of the doctor who would testify on his behalf), nor requested additional time to do so. As a result, the district court determined that Stewart was not going to have an expert for trial and therefore correctly granted the United States summary judgment, determining it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b298-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
