We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 966 (9th Cir.1998), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-26\">Dualan does not raise any contention pertaining to past persecution, so we only consider well-founded fear. Sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>stantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s decision that Dualan failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution because he was not targeted by the New People\u2019s Army in the Philippines. <em>See Singh, </em>134 F.3d at 967 (\u201c[T]o establish well-founded fear, petitioner cannot simply prove that there exists generalized or random possibility of persecution, she must show that she is at particular risk.\u201d). Furthermore, Dualan failed to meet his burden to show that he could not safely relocate within the Philippines. <em>See Kaiser v. Ashcroft, </em>390 F.3d 653, 659 (9th Cir.2004) (in the absence of establishing past persecution, the applicant bears the burden of establishing that it would be either unsafe or unreasonable for him to relocate unless the persecutor is the government); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Because Dualan failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Dualan has waived any challenge to the IJ\u2019s denial of his CAT claim by failing to raise it in his opening brief. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b466-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
