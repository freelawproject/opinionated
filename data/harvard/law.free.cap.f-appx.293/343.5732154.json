Citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Gall v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), Romero-Alvarez contends that his sentence was unreasonable. \u201cWe review whether a sentence is reasonable under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v, Herrera-Garduno, </em>519 F.3d 526, 529 (5th Cir.2008). \u201cIn performing this review, we \u2018first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error\u2019 and then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-28\">Romero-Alvarez argues that the binding precedent of this court at the time of his sentencing prohibited the district court from disagreeing with a guidelines provision, such that the district court was not able to freely consider his argument that a 16-level crime of violence enhancement un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>der U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) was unwarranted in light of his personal history and circumstances. Romero-Alvarez also argues that the district court\u2019s deference to \u00a7 2L1.2 is problematic because \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks support from empirical research and was not derived from the usual process employed by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the Guidelines. These arguments are reviewed for plain error because Romero-Alvarez did not raise them before the district court. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">There is no indication in the record that the district court disagreed with the application of \u00a7 2L1.2 based on its consideration of the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), as a matter of policy, or any other reason. At no time did the district court indicate that it would have been inclined not to impose the 16-level enhancement because of Romero-Alvarez\u2019s individual circumstances but believed it lacked the authority to do so. Furthermore, this court\u2019s precedent \u201cdid not preclude the district court from deviating from the guidelines range based on a conclusion that the 16-level enhancement resulted in an excessive sentence\u201d in light of Romero-Alvarez\u2019s arguments for a downward departure or variance. <em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339. Romero-Alvarez has not shown reversible plain error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Romero-Alvarez also argues that the district court erred by requiring \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d before it would impose a sentence outside of the guidelines range. Relying on <em>Gall, 128 S.Ct. </em>586, Romero-Alvarez argues that, by requiring a showing of extraordinary circumstances, the district court erroneously treated the Guidelines as mandatory. The district court\u2019s comments prior to sentencing Romero-Alvarez reflect that it considered his individual circumstances, and there is no indication that the district court required a showing of extraordinary circumstances before it would impose a sentence outside of the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b369-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
