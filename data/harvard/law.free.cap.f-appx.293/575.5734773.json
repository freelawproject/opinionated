Ajaj is a federal prisoner incarcerated at the Administrative Maximum United States Penitentiary in Florence, Colorado (ADX). In this prisoner civil rights action, brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and <em>Bivens</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Plaintiff challenges the conditions of his confinement at ADX, as well as the United States Bureau of Prisons\u2019 (BOP) failure to provide him notice of, or a hearing concerning, his transfer to ADX in 2002. <em>See Simmat v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, </em>413 F.3d 1225, 1230-32 (10th Cir.2005). Plaintiff appeals from the district court\u2019s December 22, 2006 Order Granting Qualified Immunity and Dismissing Claims. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-20\">Because the district court accurately and thoroughly set forth this case\u2019s extensive facts and procedural history, we only set forth this matter\u2019s background to the extent necessary to resolve this appeal. <em>See Ajaj v. United States, </em>No. 03-CV-1959-MSK-PAC, 2006 WL 3797871, at *1-5 (D.Colo. Dec. 22, 2006). Plaintiff sued all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Defendants in their individual and official capacities, alleging, as relevant here, four claims. Third Am. Compl. 118. First, Plaintiff asserted Defendant United States violated the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) in negligently failing to house him in a low-altitude and smoke-free environment contrary to medical instructions (Claim 1). Second, Plaintiff averred Defendants Hood, Burrell, Wiley, and Nalley (the Federal Officers) violated the Eighth Amendment by failing to protect Plaintiff from an unreasonable risk of harm by failing to move him to a low altitude, smoke-free housing assignment, contrary to prescribed medical instructions (Claim 2). Third, Plaintiff claimed that the Federal Officers violated the Eighth Amendment by acting with deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs conditions of confinement at ADX (i.e., limitations on his property rights, mail, access to telephones and recreation, lock-down 23 hours per day, extreme isolation, imposition of discipline for minor offenses, noise, and the indefinite nature of his confinement) (Claim 3(A)). Fourth, Plaintiff asserted Defendant Hood deprived him of a liberty interest by transferring Plaintiff to ADX without notice or a hearing, and also by continuing to confine him there for an indefinite duration without the ability to meaningfully challenge his placement (i.e., without admittance to ADX\u2019s \u201cstep-down program\u201d) (Claim 3(B)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therein, Plaintiff sought compensatory damages and injunctive relief. Third Am. Compl. at 17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">The Federal Officers moved for summary judgment on \u201call claims.\u201d App. at 178. The district court subsequently issued an Order Granting Qualified Immunity and Dismissing Claims. The Order granted the Federal Officers\u2019 motion in its entirety, save Plaintiffs official capacity claim under Claim 3(B) to the extent it sought admittance to ADX\u2019s step down program. <em>Ajaj, </em>2006 WL 3797871, at *12 (stating that the <em>\u201csole claim </em>remaining for trial is Claim 3(B) (denial of procedural due process <em>with regard to ADX step </em>downs) against [the Federal Officers] ... in their official capacities.\u201d (emphasis added)). On January 4, 2007, BOP placed Plaintiff in ADX\u2019s step-down program. As such, the parties submitted a Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(l)(ii) stipulation to dismiss Claim 3(B).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Ajaj, </em>No. 03-CV-1959-MSK-PAC, Doc. # 270, at 11 9 (filed 2/22/07) (agreeing that Plaintiffs placement in ADX\u2019s step-down unit program meant he had obtained \u201cthe remedy available pursuant to the ... December 22, 2006 Order ... under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>[C]laim 3(B)\u201d). Pursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulation, the district court dismissed Claim 3(B) without prejudice and directed the clerk to close the case. <em>See Ajaj, </em>No. 03-CV-1959-MSK-PAC, Doc. # 271, at 1 (filed 2/23/07). Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">We review \u201cde novo a district court\u2019s decision regarding qualified immunity.\u201d <em>Amundsen v. Jones, </em>533 F.3d 1192, 1198 (10th Cir.2008). Under the summary judgment standard, we generally review the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>See Nelson v. McMullen, </em>207 F.3d 1202, 1205 (10th Cir. 2000). Yet, when \u201cqualified immunity is raised in a summary judgment motion, ... [this Court applies] special rules to determine whether the motion was properly granted or denied.\u201d <em>Reynolds v. Powell, </em>370 F.3d 1028, 1030 (10th Cir.2004) (quotations omitted). Because the Federal Officers raised qualified immunity, Plaintiff \u201cbears the initial burden of proving\u201d: (1) the Federal Officers\u2019 conduct violated a constitutional right; and (2) this right was clearly established at the time the conduct at issue occurred. <em>Amundsen, </em>533 F.3d at 1198. If Plaintiff makes this showing, the burden shifts back to the Federal Officers to demonstrate no genuine issues of material fact exist and they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>The Federal Officers prevail, however, if Plaintiff fails to carry the initial twofold burden. <em>Id. </em>To be clear, a \u201cqualified immunity defense is only available to parties sued in their individual capacity.\u201d <em>Beedle v. Wilson, </em>422 F.3d 1059, 1069 (10th Cir.2005); <em>Hammons v. Saffle, </em>348 F.3d 1250, 1257 (10th Cir.2003). Hence, on summary judgment, official capacity claims for prospective injunctive relief are subject to normal Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c) standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Plaintiff first argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the Federal Officers on his Eighth Amendment failure to protect claim (Claim 2). Claim 2 averred that the Federal Officers failed to act in accordance with prescribed medical treatment or exposed Plaintiff to an unreasonable risk of harm by not moving him to a low-altitude and smoke-free prison assignment. Plaintiff contends that, contrary to the district court\u2019s conclusion, he marshaled sufficient evidence to withstand summary judgment. The Federal Officers, however, maintain Plaintiff failed to demonstrate their conduct violated Plaintiffs constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">To establish an Eighth Amendment inadequate medical care claim, Plaintiff must establish that the Federal Officers acted with \u201cdeliberate indifference to an inmate\u2019s serious medical needs.\u201d <em>Mata v. Saiz, </em>427 F.3d 745, 751 (10th Cir.2005); <em>see Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 103, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). Deliberate indifference in the Eighth Amendment context encompasses an objective and subjective prong. Namely, \u201cthe plaintiff must show that he is incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm, the objective component, and that the prison official was deliberately indifferent to his safety, the subjective component.\u201d <em>Smith v. Cummings, </em>445 F.3d 1254, 1257 (10th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted). Hence, to satisfy the objective prong, Plaintiff must demonstrate that the medical needs he avers the Federal Officers neglected are \u201csufficiently serious\u201d to satisfy the objective element. <em>Self v. Crum, </em>439 F.3d 1227, 1231 (10th Cir.2006). Meeting the subjective prong requires Plaintiff demonstrate \u201csufficiently culpable\u201d states of mind on the Federal Officers\u2019 part. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>\u201cA medical need is serious if it has been diagnosed by a doctor or is one that has been diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment or one that is so obvious that even a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor\u2019s attention.\u201d <em>Riddle v. Mondragon, </em>83 F.3d 1197, 1202 (10th Cir.1996) (quotation omitted) (\u201cConduct which, at most, is medical malpractice redressable in state court does not represent cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d). Failure to act in accordance with or intentional interference with <em>prescribed </em>medical treatment or instructions can give rise to an Eighth Amendment claim. <em>Estelle, </em>429 U.S. at 104-05, 97 S.Ct. 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">First, Plaintiff has failed to satisfy the objective prong regarding ADX\u2019s altitude. Like the district court, our review of the record reveals no evidence that the Federal Officers contravened medical instructions by placing and continuing to house him at ADX, rather than at a low-altitude prison. A 1998 \u201cTransfer Summary\u201d\u2014 signed by a psychiatrist and psychologist at BOP\u2019s medical facility in Springfield, Missouri, following Plaintiffs left pneumo-nectomy \u2014 is not to the contrary. That record provides: \u201c[Plaintiff] will experience limited exercise capacity at facilities more than 2,000 feet above sea level and <em>should be considered </em>for facilities with elevations lower than that.\u201d App. at 593 (emphasis added). While the 1998 record recommended Plaintiff be considered for a low-altitude housing assignment, the physicians in no way indicated that such a placement was medically <em>necessary </em>or otherwise required. Hence, Plaintiffs placement and continued confinement at ADX does not contravene medical instructions or pose an unreasonable risk of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Indeed, Plaintiffs treating physician at ADX never indicated that Plaintiffs health required a low-altitude housing placement. Although BOP authorized Plaintiff to undergo pulmonary function testing by an independent pulmonologist, the procedure yielded normal results, indicating that Plaintiff was \u201cadequately compensating at [ADX\u2019s] altitude.\u201d App. at 588. Other medical records reveal that Plaintiffs treating physician at ADX considered him to generally be in \u201cexcellent health.\u201d App. at 579; <em>see also id. </em>at 555-56, 626-27. Finally, Plaintiffs own medical expert opined in his deposition testimony that he \u201cd[id] not believe [Plaintiff] need[ed] to be moved to a lower altitude.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> App. at 729 (deposition testimony of Dr. Dennis Clifford). As such, the Federal Officers are entitled to qualified immunity in regard to Plaintiffs Eighth Amendment claim related to ADX\u2019s altitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">Second, even assuming without deciding Plaintiff sufficiently evidenced that his exposure to second-hand or environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) at ADX, before it became a smoke-free facility, was sufficiently serious to meet the objective prong of the Eighth Amendment test, qualified immunity in regard to this claim is also appropriate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Hasan, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>526 F.3d 653, 663 (10th Cir.2008) (noting that we may \u201caffirm a district court for any reason supported by the record\u201d). Plaintiff simply has not shown the Federal Officers acted with deliberate indifference to his requests for a smoke-free environment. Undoubtedly, the record evidences medical instructions that Plaintiff should be placed in non-smoking housing. <em>See </em>App. at 556, 569-70, 579, 591; <em>see also id. </em>at 729. In response to Plaintiffs complaints of smelling ETS in his cell, his treating physician at ADX, Dr. Leyba, was unable to confirm or disprove Plaintiffs symptoms of reactions to ETS. He recommended Plaintiff be moved to a nonsmoking unit in ADX. <em>Id. </em>Though not dispositive, given ADX\u2019s unique role in the federal prison system, we believe the fact Dr. Leyba never sought a medical transfer for Plaintiff out of ADX on Plaintiffs behalf notable.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Further, far from ignoring Plaintiffs complaints, or the recommendations of Dr. Leyba, the Federal Officers responded by investigating Plaintiffs complaints and trying to accommodate his needs, within the high-security ADX setting. App. at 417 (noting that ADX \u201cis the most secure prison in the federal system\u201d with \u201cunique security and control procedures\u201d). For instance, Defendant Duncan, an ADX Associate Warden, testified that he responded to Plaintiffs complaints by coordinating with ADX\u2019s facilities personnel and Plaintiffs ADX physician. With their aid, Defendant Duncan undertook an investigation into whether Plaintiff could \u2014 as he maintained \u2014 be exposed to ETS and, if so, how to minimize any such exposure. App. at 587. Defendant Duncan testified that the investigation revealed that ADX\u2019s air filtration system was such that Plaintiff could be exposed to ETS. App. at 587 (explaining that four cells are connected together and that ETS could pass between the cells). Accordingly, Duncan stated no inmates who smoked were housed in any of the three cells adjoining Plaintiffs cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Additionally, in early 2003, ADX installed air filters in Plaintiffs cell. Plaintiffs Unit Manager noted in a memo to Defendant Burrell that Plaintiff told the ADX Facilities Manager that, although he continued to complain about ETS, \u201cthe filter had helped him.\u201d App. at 667. Further, Defendant Hood testified to the best of his knowledge Plaintiff was placed \u201con a range which either no smokers or, if any, [Plaintiff was placed] at the far end of the range\u201d where the cells\u2019 configuration precluded his exposure to ETS. App. at 650. True, a June 2004 memo from a BOP official to an ADX administrator continued to draw attention to this issue. But the document reflects that the official\u2019s concern, regarding Plaintiff not having been assigned to a smoke-free unit, was driven more by Plaintiffs litigiousness than by concern for his ETS exposure. <em>Id. </em>at 588; <em>see generally Self v. Crum, </em>439 F.3d 1227, 1232 (10th Cir.2006) (\u201cA claim is ... actionable only in cases where the need for additional treatment ... is <em>obvious.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">In short, the record adduces no indication the Federal Officers disregarded \u201ca known or obvious consequence\u201d of their actions, <em>Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs of Bryan County v. Brown, </em>520 U.S. 397, 410, 117 5. Ct. 1382, 137 L.Ed.2d 626 (1997), nor \u201can excessive risk to [Plaintiffs] health or safety.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); <em>see also Estelle, </em>429 U.S. at 105-06, 97 S.Ct. 285 (inadvertence does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>satisfy the subjective prong of an Eighth Amendment claim regarding federal officers\u2019 conduct); <em>cf. Self, </em>489 F.3d at 1232 (subjective deliberate indifference would be demonstrated where <em>\u201ce.g., </em>a patient complains of chest pains and the prison official, knowing that medical protocol requires referral or minimal diagnostic testing ... [nevertheless] sends the inmate back to his cell.\u201d). As such, Plaintiff cannot satisfy the subjective prong of our Eighth Amendment analysis and the Federal Officers are entitled to qualified immunity on this claim. <em>See Self, </em>439 F.3d at 1232-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Plaintiff also appeals the district court\u2019s sua sponte dismissal of his claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act (Claim 1). In support of his position, Plaintiff points to medical instructions that stated he \u201cwould function better\u201d in a low-altitude environment and should be assigned to smoke-free housing. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 33. The district court dismissed Claim 1 sua sponte, deeming it premised on the same facts as Claim 2. <em>Ajaj, </em>2006 WL 3797871, at *12; <em>see also supra </em>Part.UI. Whether the district court made this determination under the motion to dismiss standard, or pursuant to the summary judgment standard, is unclear from the district court\u2019s cursory ruling. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Under the FTCA, the law of the place where the allegedly negligent or wrongful act occurred \u201cdetermines the legal basis for liability.\u201d <em>See Gundy v. United States, </em>728 F.2d 484, 487 (10th Cir.1984). Here, Colorado law governs and directs that, as with any common law negligence claim, \u201ca claimant alleging negligence of another party must establish the existence of a duty, a breach of that duty, causation, and damages.\u201d <em>Redden v. SCI Colo. Funeral Servs., Inc., </em>38 P.3d 75, 80 (Colo.2001) (en banc). We have previously stated that while \u201cColorado courts have not yet addressed whether prison officials owe a duty of care to inmates regarding their medical needs,\u201d if specifically presented with the question, we believe Colorado law would impose a duty of care on prison officials to \u201cprotect[] inmates\u2019 health and safety.\u201d <em>Kikumura v. Osagie, </em>461 F.3d 1269, 1301 (10th Cir.2006), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007); <em>see also </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 314(a)(4) (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">Regarding Plaintiff\u2019s need for a low-altitude placement, as discussed above, the record is devoid of medical records recommending such an accommodation. In contrast, the record reflects that Plaintiffs treating physician at AJDX clearly recommended Plaintiff reside in a smoke-free unit. As a general matter, prison administrators do not breach their duty of care when an inmate is placed in an environment where that inmate will be exposed to ETS in reasonable quantities. <em>See Friedman v. United States, </em>87 Fed.Appx. 459, 462 (6th Cir .2003) (finding no negligence in prison officials\u2019 failure to prevent inmate\u2019s exposure to ETS where no evidence existed that exposure to smoke exacerbated inmate\u2019s pre-existing medical condition). But where an inmate possesses an obvious medical need for housing in a smoke-free environment, and prison administrators fail to respond to that need, the inmate may have a viable negligence claim as a result of the alleged breach of care. As such, an FTCA inmate-plaintiff alleging a particular medical need for smoke-free housing, like Plaintiff, may potentially demonstrate a breach of the duty of care when the United States fails to place that inmate in a completely smoke-free environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Here, Plaintiff alleges the United States breached that duty when he was not placed in a completely smoke-free environment, and that this breach was the \u201cdirect and proximate cause of serious, permanent and continuing injuries to Mr. Ajaj.\u201d Third Am. Compl. \u00b6 70; <em>see also id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 63-64, 66. The record reflects ADX personnel attempted to discern and minimize Plaintiffs exposure to ETS. <em>See supra </em>Part. III. But the record was only developed in relation to Plaintiffs other claims <em>(ie., </em>the claims at issue in the Federal Officers\u2019 summary judgment motion), not his FTCA claim. Further, whether the district court\u2019s short and vague sua sponte dismissal of Claim 1 employed the motion to dismiss standard, or the summary judgment standard, remains unclear. In any event, concluding that these alternative steps foreclose Plaintiffs claim, at this juncture, would ignore the basic allegation Plaintiff asserts in his FTCA claim regarding ETS, <em>ie., </em>that regardless of any other accommodations the prison administrators made, the United States breached its duty of care by not placing Plaintiff in <em>completely </em>smoke-free housing. <em>See </em>Third Am. Compl. \u00b6 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">The district court may ultimately conclude ADX personnel acted reasonably, and find that by investigating Plaintiffs complaints, placing nonsmoking inmates in the cells adjoining Plaintiffs, and installing a special air filter, the United States satisfied the duty owed to Plaintiff. But whether anything short of placing Plaintiff in a completely smoke-free environment was a breach of Defendants\u2019 duty of care may not be adjudged at this early stage of litigation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We therefore conclude Plaintiffs allegations are adequate to warrant further proceedings on Claim 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Next, Plaintiff appeals the district court\u2019s ruling on his Eighth Amendment conditions of confinement claim (Claim 3(A)). Claim 3(A) asserts that the following conditions of Plaintiffs ADX confinement amount to \u201catypical and significant hardships,\u201d as compared to the general population: (1) limitations on his property rights, mail, access to telephones, and recreation; (2) lock-down for 23 hours per day in extreme isolation; (3) imposition of discipline for minor offenses; (4) noise; (5) lights which remain on in his cell 24 hours per day; and (6) his indefinite confinement at ADX.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">\u201cThe Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment imposes a duty on prison officials to provide humane conditions of confinement, including adequate food, clothing, shelter, sanitation, medical care, and reasonable safety from serious bodily harm.\u201d <em>Tafoya v. Salazar, </em>516 F.3d 912, 916 (10th Cir.2008). As stated above, Plaintiff bears the burden of showing, first, that his conditions of confinement are, objectively, sufficiently serious, and, second, that the Federal Officers were deliberately indifferent to his safety. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number><em>See id. </em>The district court granted summary judgment to the Federal Officers, concluding Plaintiff failed to show that the conditions of his ADX confinement are sufficiently serious. Specifically, the district court noted that, although Plaintiff took issue with numerous conditions of his confinement, his summary judgment response referenced record evidence only in regard to his limited ability to exercise outdoors and his indefinite confinement at ADX. <em>Ajaj, </em>2006 WL 3797871, at *9. The district court ultimately deemed Plaintiffs evidence of these conditions inadequate to withstand summary judgment. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">On appeal, Plaintiff contends that his deposition testimony, which he submitted as an attachment to his summary judgment response, evidenced all the conditions of confinement set forth in Claim 3(A). Principally, Plaintiffs briefing underscores his restricted access to outdoor exercise and the indefinite nature of his detention at ADX. The Federal Officers respond that the conditions of confinement Plaintiff complains of are not, as a matter of law, sufficiently serious to maintain his Eighth Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Undoubtedly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">It is important to consider the conditions of confinement as a whole because several deprivations \u201cin combination\u201d may constitute a constitutional violation \u201cwhen they have a mutually enforcing effect that produces the deprivation of a single, identifiable human need such as food, warmth, or exercise-for example, a low cell temperature at night combined with a failure to issue blankets.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-8\"><em>Mitchell v. Maynard, </em>80 F.3d 1433, 1442 (10th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 304, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991)). But equally true is that \u201c[njothing so amorphous as \u2018overall conditions\u2019 can rise to the level of cruel and unusual punishment when no specific deprivation of a single human need exists.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>501 U.S. at 305, 111 S.Ct. 2321; <em>accord Gillis v. Litscher, </em>468 F.3d 488, 493 (7th Cir.2006) (\u201cSome conditions of confinement may establish an Eighth Amendment violation in combination when each alone would not do so. This is true when the deprivations have a mutually enforcing effect which produces the deprivation of a single, identifiable human need, such as food or warmth.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">Quite simply, save Plaintiffs allegations regarding his access to exercise, the conditions of confinement he avers do not, even taken together, constitute the sort of \u201csignificant departure from the healthy habilitative environment the state is required to provide its inmates.\u201d <em>See Mitchell, </em>80 F.3d at 1442; <em>see, e.g., Ramos v. Lamm, </em>639 F.2d 559, 568 (10th Cir.1980) (inmate must be provided with \u201creasonably adequate ventilation, sanitation, bedding, hygienic materials, and utilities (i.e., hot and cold water, light, heat, plumbing).\u201d). <em>Compare Gillis, </em>468 F.3d at 493 (ruling qualified immunity inappropriate on Wisconsin supermax inmate/plaintiffs Eighth Amendment claim where conditions of his confinement included: \u201cdenial of shelter, heat, and hygiene items implicated an inmate\u2019s constitutional rights\u201d), <em>with </em>Third Am.

But this deprivation of outdoor recreation is not sufficiently serious to implicate the Eighth Amendment. <em>See Fo-gle, </em>435 F.3d at 1260 (holding that \u201ca fact-finder might conclude that the risk of harm from <em>three years </em>of deprivation of any form of outdoor exercise was obvious and that [prison] officials disregarded that risk by keeping Fogle in administrative segregation\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>see also Bailey, </em>828 F.2d at 653 (recognizing that courts have not deemed the denial of fresh air and exercise to be a \u201cper se\u201d Eighth Amendment violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">Plaintiff also argues that, even after his first year at ADX, he is inconsistently afforded outdoor recreation. He asserts outdoor recreation is regularly cancelled due to inclement weather or staffing issues. Even assuming such allegations implicate the Eighth Amendment, the record clearly reflects that Plaintiff regularly declined opportunities to recreate outdoors. App. at 736, 739-805.

Therein, Plaintiff argues that his protected liberty interest in avoiding assignment to ADX was clearly established in 2002, thus entitling him to some form of legal process before his transfer. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 485-86, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995). Defendant Hood counters that Plaintiffs transfer to ADX, even assuming ADX affords less amenable and more restrictive quarters than those Plaintiff had at FCI Edgefield\u2019s administrative segregation unit, does not implicate a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause. In any event, the Federal Officers maintain such a liberty interest was not clearly established in 2002 as evidenced by <em>Wilkinson v. Austin, </em>545 U.S. 209, 125 S.Ct. 2384, 162 L.Ed.2d 174 (2005), decided over two years <em>after </em>Plaintiffs 2002 transfer. Plaintiff replies that <em>Wilkinson </em>did not change the law, but rather applied the clearly established law of <em>Sandin. </em>Because we conclude that any protected liberty interest Plaintiff might have in avoiding transfer to ADX was not clearly established in 2002, Defendant Hood is entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">\u201cThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause protects persons against deprivations of life, liberty, or property; and those who seek to invoke its procedural protection must establish that one of these interests is at stake.\u201d <em>Wilkinson, </em>545 U.S. at 221, 125 S.Ct. 2384. \u201cA liberty interest may arise from the Constitution itself, by reason of guarantees implicit in the word \u201cliberty,\u201d or it may arise from an expectation or interest created by state laws or policies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he Constitution itself does not give rise to a liberty interest in avoiding transfer to more adverse conditions of confinement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Mea-chum v. Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 225, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976)). But \u201ca liberty interest in avoiding particular conditions of confinement may arise from state policies or regulations, subject to the important limitations set forth in <em>Sandin [v. Conner].\u201d Id. Sandin </em>clarified that, in determining whether state policies and regulations give rise to a liberty interest, courts must focus on the nature of \u201cthe interests allegedly created by the State.\u201d <em>Sandin, </em>515 U.S. at 480, 115 S.Ct. 2293 (disavowing the approach taken in a series of previous cases in which the Court \u201cwrestled with the language of ... prison guidelines to determine whether mandatory language and substantive predicates created an enforceable expectation that the State would produce a particular outcome with respect to the prisoner\u2019s conditions of confinement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\"><em>Sandin </em>addressed whether a Hawaii prison inmate had a protected liberty interest in avoiding thirty days\u2019 confinement in segregation as punishment for disruptive behavior. In considering the issue, the Supreme Court focused on whether thirty days in segregation \u201cimposefd] atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d <em>Sandin, </em>515 U.S. at 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293. Therein, the Court undertook a \u201ccomparison between inmates inside and outside disciplinary segregation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486, 115 S.Ct. 2293. Ultimately, the <em>Sandin </em>Court concluded that the thirty days in segregation \u201cdid not work a major disruption in his environment,\u201d nor did it \u201cinevitably affect the duration of his sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486-87, 115 S.Ct. 2293. As such, the Court held that the conditions \u201cdid not present the type of atypical, significant deprivation in which a State might conceiv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>ably create a liberty interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486, 115 S.Ct. 2293 (noting that at the time of one inmate\u2019s punishment \u201cdisciplinary segregation, with insignificant exceptions, mirrored those conditions imposed upon inmates in administrative segregation and protective custody\u201d). To the contrary, thirty days in segregation was \u201cwithin the range of confinement to be normally expected for one serving an indeterminate term of 30 years to life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487, 115 S.Ct. 2293.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Seeking to show his right to process before his transfer to ADX, a supermax facility, Plaintiff relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s 2005 <em>Wilkinson </em>decision, which considered what process (if any) an inmate is entitled to upon being considered for placement at the Ohio State Penitentiary supermax facility (OSP). <em>See Wilkinson, </em>545 U.S. at 220-22, 125 S.Ct. 2384 (addressing the threshold inquiry of whether the inmates established a constitutionally protected liberty interest and concluding that they had, but later holding that the inmates received due process). According to Plaintiff, we may look to <em>Wilkinson </em>even though it was handed down after his 2002 transfer because it simply applied <em>Sandin\u2019s </em>clearly established rule to the supermax context. <em>Wilkinson </em>expressly provides otherwise. The <em>Wilkinson </em>court recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">In Sandin\u2019s wake the Courts of Appeals have not reached consistent conclusions for identifying the baseline from which to measure what is atypical and significant in any particular prison system. This divergence indicates the difficulty of locating the appropriate baseline, an issue that was not explored at length in the briefs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-6\"><em>Wilkinson, </em>545 U.S. at 223, 125 S.Ct. 2384 (collecting cases); <em>accord Jordan v. Fed\u2019l Bureau Prisons, </em>191 Fed.Appx. 639, 650-51 (10th Cir.2006) (\u201c[T]he circuit courts are split on which baseline comparison\u201d\u2014 <em>ie., </em>whether conditions, duration or restrictions of confinement are atypical as compared with other inmates \u201cin the same segregation\u201d or the \u201cgeneral prison population\u201d \u2014 \u201cto use.\u201d). Indeed, we have acknowledged that our own opinions have \u201cinconsistently used comparisons either with inmates in the same segregation or those in the general prison population.\u201d <em>Jordan, </em>191 Fed.Appx. at 650 (citation omitted). Furthermore, regardless of the baseline employed, like the majority of our sister Courts of Appeal, we have \u201cnever held the conditions, duration or restrictions of the detentions presented on appeal created a liberty interest....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 650-51 &amp; nn. 9-10 (collecting cases). This confusion and divergence evidences that Sandin\u2019s rule continues to evolve, even after <em>Wilkinson. </em>Thus, we have no qualm in concluding that the law was not clearly established as to whether Plaintiff had a protected liberty interest in avoiding transfer to ADX in 2002. <em>See Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001) (acknowledging that the \u201cdispositive inquiry\u201d in determining whether a right was clearly established \u201cis whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the [particular] situation\u201d); <em>see also Jiron v. City of Lakewood, </em>392 F.3d 410 (10th Cir. 2004) (qualified immunity \u201cis designed to \u2018protect all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law5 \u201d (citation omitted)). Defendant Hood is therefore entitled to qualified immunity regarding Plaintiffs transfer to ADX.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">Next, Plaintiff maintains he has an extant official capacity claim for injunctive relief regarding his initial transfer to ADX. Nothing in the evidence suggests, however, that the district court ever ruled on the merits of this claim. <em>See, e.g., Ajaj, </em>2006</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>WL 3797871, at *9-11 (although in considering Claim 3(B) the district court expressly stated Plaintiff \u201cretain[ed] his official capacity claim\u201d against Defendants Hood, Nalley, and Wiley, the district court never expressly referenced, analyzed, or ruled on Plaintiffs official capacity claim related to his 2002 transfer to ADX). The district court, quite reasonably, may have assumed Plaintiff had abandoned this claim. For instance, though the district court granted the Federal Officers leave to file a summary judgment motion only as to qualified immunity during a July 2006 hearing, Plaintiff gave no indication that he maintained an official capacity claim for injunc-tive relief. <em>See </em>App. at 176-77; <em>see generally Simmat, </em>413 F.3d at 1231 (\u201cThere is no such animal as a <em>Bivens </em>suit against a public official tortfeasor in his or her official capacity.\u201d); <em>Beedle, </em>422 F.3d at 1069 (\u201c[Qualified immunity] is only available to parties sued in their individual capacity\u201d). Nor did Plaintiffs summary judgment response make substantive arguments in support of, or otherwise make clear that he continued to prosecute, an official capacity claim related to his ADX transfer under Claim 3(B). <em>See </em>App. 480-504. In any event, and most importantly, our review of the record indicates that \u2014 despite having ample opportunities to do so\u2014 Plaintiff has never challenged the district court\u2019s view that its December 22, 2006 Order disposed of \u201call claims\u201d save Claim 3(B) as to the step-down program. An \u201cissue must be presented to, considered by, and decided by a trial court before it can be raised on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). <em>See Tele-Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>104 F.3d 1229, 1232-33 (10th Cir.1997) (\u201cIn order to preserve the integrity of the appellate structure, we should not be considered a \u2018second-shot\u2019 forum ... where secondary, back-up theories may be mounted for the first time.\u201d). This principle\u2019s import is particularly pronounced here where the claim at issue is one for injunctive relief arising out of the penal context. <em>See generally Jones v. Salt Lake County, </em>503 F.3d 1147, 1153-54 (10th Cir.2007) (recognizing significant deference to the \u201cinformed discretion of corrections officials\u201d is warranted when accommodating an inmate\u2019s asserted constitutional right will materially effect other inmates or prison staff). Put simply, because Plaintiff failed to preserve his official capacity claim for injunctive relief related to his 2002 transfer to ADX for appeal, we will not address it here for the first time on appeal. <em>See Simmat, </em>413 F.3d at 1240.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s is AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED for further proceedings as stated here in.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b602-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.

The government\u2019s assertion that a prisoner, even one in administrative segregation, may not make out an Eighth Amendment claim by alleging a one-year deprivation of outdoor exercise is challenged by our caselaw.

However, as a general rule, prisoners are entitled to some out-of-cell exercise. In <em>Housley v. Dodson, </em>we held that an inmate alleged an Eighth Amendment violation by claiming to have been afforded only thirty minutes of out-of-cell exercise over the course of three months. 41 F.3d 597, 599 (10th Cir.1994), <em>overruled on other grounds by Lewis v.

According to BOP regulations, even inmates housed in \u201ccontrol <em>units\u201d </em>\u2014 ie., inmates \u201cwho are unable to function in a less restrictive environment,\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.40 \u2014 must have an \u201copportunity to receive a minimum of seven hours weekly recreation outside of the cell.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 541.46(e). The regulations also provide that \u201cstaff [in control units] may offer outdoor recreation to inmates, weather permitting.\u201d Federal Bureau of Prisons, Program Statement No. 5212.07 (Control Unit Programs), at 12 (supplying commentary for 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.46(e)(1)), <em>available at </em>http://www. bop.gov/DataSource/execute/dsPolicyLoc. The American Correctional Association\u2019s <em>Standards for Correctional Institutions, </em>a publication referenced in the BOP regulations governing the recreation of general population prisoners,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> recommends that inmates be provided with ample space for indoor and outdoor recreation. <em>See </em>American Correctional Association, Standards for Adult Correctional Institutions 43, 74 (4th ed.2003); Federal Bureau of Prisons, Program Statement No. p5370-70, Inmate Recreation Programs 3 (June 25, 2008), <em>available at </em>http://www.bop.gov/ DataSource/execute/dsPolicyLoc (citing American Correctional Association, Standards for Adult Correctional Institutions (3d ed.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Though BOP regulations do not appear to <em>require </em>outdoor recreation for all inmates under all circumstances, our cases demonstrate that a deprivation of outdoor exercise may amount to an Eighth Amendment violation, even when an inmate is afforded some measure of indoor exercise. This is because, as the majority opinion in this case notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">There is substantial agreement among the cases in this area that some form of regular <em>outdoor exercise </em>is extremely important to the psychological and physical well being of inmates, and some courts have held a denial of <em>fresh air and exercise </em>to be cruel and unusual punishment under certain circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">Maj. Op., at 583-84 (quoting <em>Fogle v. Pierson, </em>435 F.3d 1252, 1260 (10th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Bailey v. Shillinger, </em>828 F.2d 651, 653 (10th Cir.1987) (quoting <em>Spain v. Procunier, </em>600 F.2d 189, 199 (9th Cir.1979) (Kennedy, J.) (collecting cases)))); <em>see also Keenan v.

In <em>Bailey, </em>for example, we acknowledged that \u201ca convicted murderer who had murdered another inmate and represented a major security risk <em>was entitled to outdoor exercise.\u201d Housley, </em>41 F.3d at 599 (emphasis added) (citing <em>Bailey, </em>828 F.2d at 653). We did not find an Eighth Amendment violation in <em>Bailey, </em>but we observed that the inmate was permitted to exercise in an outdoor facility for one hour per week. <em>Bailey, </em>828 F.2d at 653. In fact, we cabined our holding in <em>Bailey, </em>avoiding a suggestion that a more complete deprivation would be permissible: <em>\u201cAlthough this amount of exposure to exercise and fresh air is still restrictive, </em>we cannot say, without more, that it fails to satisfy the demands of the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">In <em>Perkins v. Kansas Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>165 F.3d 803, 809-10 (10th Cir.1999), which the government did not address before this court, we held that a one-year deprivation of outdoor exercise <em>did </em>give rise to an Eighth Amendment claim. There, a prisoner was \u201cpermitted to leave his cell for thirty minutes each day, to take a shower ... [and was not] permitted to exercise outside his cell for over a year.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 810 (emphasis added). While the prisoner had been deprived of all out-of-cell exercise, we labeled Mr. Perkins\u2019s argument a \u201cclaim for deprivation of <em>outdoor </em>exercise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Relying on then-Judge Kennedy\u2019s discussion of fresh air and outdoor exercise in <em>Spain, </em>we found that Mr. Perkins\u2019s alleged deprivation of outdoor exercise was sufficient to state an Eighth Amendment claim. <em>Id. </em>(holding that the \u201cdistrict court erred when it held that plaintiffs allegations about the <em>extended deprivation of outdoor exercise </em>showed no excessive risk to his well-being\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Similarly in <em>Fogle, </em>we held that a prisoner who had been placed in administrative segregation after repeated escape attempts articulated an Eighth Amendment claim when he alleged he had been \u201cdenied all outdoor exercise for the three years he was in administrative segregation.\u201d 435 F.3d at 1259-60. In that case, the prisoner acknowledged that he was \u201callowed access to a cell with a pull-up bar a few times each week.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1260 n. 4. However, consistent with <em>Perkins, </em>we observed that \u201cthe district court erred as a matter of law in concluding that a prisoner must allege denial of all exercise, not just outdoor exercise, to present an arguable claim\u201d under the Eighth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 1260 (citing <em>Perkins, </em>165 F.3d at 810).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">While our cases recognize that prisoners are generally entitled to outdoor exercise, a denial of outdoor exercise is not an Eighth Amendment violation per se. <em>See Bailey, </em>828 F.2d at 653. As we have recognized, \u201c[t]he Eighth Amendment does not provide a fixed formula for determining whether the effect of particular conditions constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The length of a deprivation of outdoor exercise necessary to trigger an Eighth Amendment violation may vary, depending the government\u2019s justifications for the deprivation. <em>See Perkins, </em>165 F.3d at 810 n. 8 (observing that \u201cwhat constitutes adequate exercise will depend on the circumstances of each case\u201d including \u201cpenological considerations\u201d); <em>cf. You-sef v. Reno, </em>254 F.3d 1214, 1219 (10th Cir.2001) (noting that prisoners convicted of terrorist activities may be subjected to Special Administrative Measures, \u201cin 120 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>day increments,\u201d including administrative detention and limited contact with others).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Particularly in light of the principle that \u201cwhat constitutes adequate exercise will depend on the circumstances of each case,\u201d <em>Perkins, </em>165 F.3d at 810 n. 8, the government has offered this court surprisingly little factual analysis in this case. The government has instead supplied us with the broad assertion that Mr. Ajaj \u201cfail[ed] to state a[n Eighth Amendment] claim,\u201d Aple\u2019s Br. at 25, by alleging that he had been deprived of outdoor exercise for one year. The government cited two opinions, our decision in <em>Bailey </em>and one case from the Fifth Circuit, but neither provides any support for the government\u2019s contention. First, <em>Bailey </em>actually supports the position that an alleged one-year deprivation of all outdoor exercise could amount to an Eighth Amendment claim, as the <em>Bailey </em>court carefully observed that one hour of outdoor exercise per week was \u201crestrictive,\u201d even if it was not in violation of the Eighth Amendment under those circumstances. 828 F.2d at 653. Similarly, in <em>Wilkerson v. Maggio, </em>703 F.2d 909, 911-12 (5th Cir.1983), the government\u2019s second case, the court held that prison officials were entitled to qualified immunity, notwithstanding the prisoner\u2019s contention that he had been denied outdoor recreation for approximately five years. However, the court reasoned that Mr. Wilkerson was permitted to exercise regularly in a room that was \u201cabout thirty yards long\u201d and was \u201clined with windows which permitted fresh ah' to enter the cell block area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 912. Unlike Mr. Wilkerson, Mr. Ajaj alleged \u2014 although he ultimately did not support the claim with particularized factual assertions \u2014 that he was denied access to fresh air and sunlight for one year.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">While I disagree with the government\u2019s apparent contention that Mr. Ajaj failed to allege an Eighth Amendment violation when he asserted that he was denied outdoor exercise for one year, I agree that the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. As the majority correctly observes, the record generated before the district court \u2014 which the government did not address in depth before this court\u2014 demonstrates that Mr. Ajaj was offered, but refused, outdoor exercise on several occasions during his first year at ADX. The record also suggests, and Mr. Ajaj does not dispute, that prison officials afforded him regular solitary indoor exercise opportunities (as seems warranted by these facts). Therefore, I join the majority\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">Nonetheless, as noted above our cases clearly suggest that failure to allow adequate exercise (in most cases with an outdoor component) for a period of a year raises real constitutional concern. As federal prisons aspire to the standards of the ACA and must follow Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, I am perplexed that the government did not explicitly discuss the facts that allowed it to prevail.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-6\">. The government adds, \u201d[T]he record demonstrates that the main reason he has had less outdoor exercise is that he has refused it.\u201d Aple's Br. at 25. This opaque reference to the record concludes the government's short discussion of Mr. Ajaj's alleged deprivation of outdoor exercise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b615-6\">. The American Correctional Association (ACA) offers accreditation to correctional institutions that comply with its standards. According to the Department of Justice (DOJ), \"[T]he BOP utilizes ACA to obtain an external assessment of its ability to meet the basics of corrections.\u201d The United States Department of Justice, <em>Strategic Plan 2000-2005, </em>Strategic Objective 5.3, Strategies to Achieve the Objective, available at http://www.usdoj.gov/ archive/mps/strategic2000_2005/goal5.htm.

The government\u2019s opening brief also discussed <em>In re Long Term Segregation of Inmates Designated as Five Percenters, </em>174 F.3d 464 (4th Cir. 1999), which it characterized as \"the most analogous published decision\u201d addressing an Eighth Amendment conditions of confinement claim involving an inmate housed in administrative segregation. Aple\u2019s Br. at 24. Although the government did not cite this case for the proposition that a one-year deprivation of outdoor exercise could not violate the Eighth Amendment, I note that the <em>In re Long Term Segregation </em>court did not discuss outdoor recreation; it appears that the prisoners did not raise the issue. Rather, the court simply noted that approximately five hours of exercise per week did not violate the Eighth Amendment under the facts of that case. <em>See id. </em>at 471-72.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
