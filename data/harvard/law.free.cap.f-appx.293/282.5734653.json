The BIA concluded that Garza was not eligible for a waiver because he was found removable as an aggravated felon as that term was defined in \u00a7 101(a)(43)(F) of the INA and because \u00a7 101(a)(43)(F) did not have a \u201ccomparable ground\u201d of inadmissibility under \u00a7 212(a) of the INA.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-15\">Garza argues that the BIA\u2019s application of the comparable grounds test to deny him a \u00a7 212(c) waiver violates his right to equal protection because it treats him differently than other similarly situated aliens. This argument is foreclosed under the law of this circuit. <em>See Vo v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 363, 371-72 (5th Cir.2007). Garza\u2019s assertion that this court should adopt the equal protection analysis set forth by the Second Circuit in <em>Blake v. Carbone, </em>489 F.3d 88 (2d Cir.2007), would require that <em>Vo </em>be overruled. \u201cAbsent an en banc or intervening Supreme Court decision, one panel of this court may not overrule a prior panel\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Rod\u00f1guez-Jaimes, </em>481 F.3d 283, 288 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b309-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
