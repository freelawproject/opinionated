We affirm because Ac\u00e1ntara has not shown any abuse of discretion by the district court. <em>See United States v. McInnis, </em>429 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2005) (discussing the appellate review standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-11\">On appeal, Ac\u00e1ntara first raises a narrow challenge to the district court\u2019s revocation decision. He appears to argue that the district court erroneously determined that by not registering as a sex offender after his release from prison, A-c\u00e1ntara had violated a statutorily mandated supervised release condition that the court should have, but did not, impose in its criminal judgment. In our view, his argument essentially misconstrues the record. The district court actually found that Ae\u00e1ntara had violated his supervised release conditions \u201cby engaging in new criminal conduct, to wit: Failing to register as a sex offender as mandated by both Federal and local Government statute.\u201d Ac\u00e1n-tara quotes this exact ruling in his counseled brief, but does not claim that <em>this ruling </em>was erroneous. Athough the district court did not specify the exact supervised release condition that had been violated, there could have been no doubt which condition the court meant. The criminal judgment expressly stated that one supervised release condition was that Ac\u00e1ntara not commit \u201canother federal, state or local crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-14\">In his pro se brief, Ac\u00e1ntara also presses Fifth Amendment objections to the district court\u2019s revocation decision. As argued on appeal, however, his claims lack merit. The probation officer was not obliged to warn Ac\u00e1ntara in advance that his statements at the revocation hearing could be used against him. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 32.1(b)(2)(A) (requiring only that written notice of \u201cthe alleged violation\u201d be given). Nor has Ac\u00e1ntara explained why his seemingly voluntary statements at the hearing were involuntary or compelled, so as to implicate the Fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Amendment. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>299 F.3d 103, 110-11 (2d Cir.2002) (concluding that a person charged with a supervised release violation who voluntarily chooses to testify at a revocation hearing cannot later claim that his testimony was compelled); <em>see also United States v. Mel\u00e9ndez, </em>228 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir.2000) (rejecting a claim that <em>Miranda </em>warnings are generally required before a person is subjected to \u201cin-court questioning\u201d). In addition, Alc\u00e1ntara seeks to exclude his statements only on the ground that they implicated him in conduct for which his supervised release term could be revoked. He has not argued for exclusion on the ground that his statements implicated him in new criminal conduct for which he might later be prosecuted. <em>See United States v. Roy, </em>438 F.3d 140, 144 (1st Cir. 2006) (rejecting a Fifth Amendment claim under similar circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Finally, Alc\u00e1ntara suggests that, in its revocation sentence, the district court could not impose a supervised release condition on him that requires him to register as a sex offender. Alc\u00e1ntara waived this claim at the revocation hearing by expressly telling the court\u2014twice\u2014that he would obey its direct order instructing him to register as a sex offender and by failing to object when the court later imposed the condition on him. The supervised release condition he now objects to is essentially a direct order that will become effective when Alc\u00e1ntara\u2019s supervised release term begins.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b29-12\">. By the time the appeal was briefed, Alc\u00e1ntara had completed the nine-month prison term that the court had imposed, but his appeal is not moot. After his revocation prison term expired, he was immediately arrested and detained for a new offense, and so he still faces the 12-month supervised release term imposed by the court. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>529 U.S. 53, 57-58, 120 S.Ct. 1114, 146 L.Ed.2d 39 (2000) (concluding that a supervised release term begins on the day on which an inmate is \"in fact freed from confinement\u201d to the supervision of a probation officer which may not coincide with the expiration date of the prison term) (analyzing the first two sentences of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(e)); <em>United States v. DeLeon, </em>444 F.3d 41, 55 (1st Cir.2006) (\u201cIt is well settled that a convict\u2019s claim is not moot if he has finished his prison term but still faces supervised release[.]\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
