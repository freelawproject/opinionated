Although the petition is not entirely clear, it appears that Talley would like this Court to order the defendants in the underlying district court case (D.N.J. Civ. No. 04-cv-01146) to \u201cshow cause\u201d for their refusal to comply with a district court order and for their motion for sanctions (which the District Court granted).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">Mandamus is an appropriate remedy in extraordinary circumstances only. <em>See In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., </em>418 F.3d 372, 378 (3d Cir.2005). Traditionally, it has \u201cbeen available to a court of appeals only \u2018to confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so.\u2019 \u201d <em>Madden v. Myers, </em>102 F.3d 74, 77 n. 3 (3d Cir.1996) (citing <em>Will v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 90, 95, 88 S.Ct. 269, 19 L.Ed.2d 305 (1967)). To obtain a writ of mandamus, the petitioner must establish that he has \u201cno other adequate means to attain ... relief,\u201d and that he has a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right to issuance of the writ. <em>In re Diet Drugs, </em>418 F.3d at 378-79. Talley has not established that he has a \u201cclear and indisputable\u201d right to the relief he requests, and we will thus deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">Furthermore, if Talley is actually attempting to appeal from the District Court\u2019s July 10, 2007 order granting the defendants\u2019 motion for sanctions and/or its September 6, 2007 order granting the defendants\u2019 motion for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, we first note that a petition for mandamus \u201cmust not be used as a mere substitute for appeal.\u201d <em>Madden, </em>102 F.3d at 77 (internal citation omitted). Even if we did review the mandamus petition as an appeal, we would lack jurisdiction to consider it because it was not filed until June 3, 2008 \u2014 long after the deadline for appealing from the orders had expired. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App. P. 4(a)(1); <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 2366, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">Accordingly, we will deny Talley\u2019s petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
