The district court held that the officers indeed violated the rule, but that suppression was not mandated because the record did not establish deliberate disregard of the rule or prejudice. <em>See United States v. Gantt, </em>194 F.3d 987, 994 (9th Cir.1999), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. W.R. Grace, </em>526 F.3d 499 (9th Cir.2008). This conclusion was not clearly erroneous. Grubbs also argues that the officers violated the Fourth Amendment by refusing the requests he and his wife made to see the warrant. Grubbs did not raise this argument in the Opening Brief, however, so we do not consider it. <em>See Officers for Justice v. Civil Serv. Cormn\u2019n of the City and County of San Francisco, </em>979 F.2d 721, 725-26 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"ARa\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>With these amendments, the panel has voted to deny the petition for panel rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The petition for rehearing is DENIED.
