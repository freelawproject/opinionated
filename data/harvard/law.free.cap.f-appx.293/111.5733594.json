We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-26\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-27\">A federal jury found Miyares guilty of three counts on which he was indicted: (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1); (2) possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of crack cocaine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(B)(iii); and (3) carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i). Miyares was sentenced to concurrent 120 month and 135 month terms on the first two counts and a consecutive 60 month term on Count Three \u2014 a total sentence of 195 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Miyares contends the District Court here \u201cfailed to exercise its discretion in giving meaningful consideration to the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), in particular to the differential between advisory sentencing guidelines for crack cocaine and powder cocaine.\u201d Miyares Br. at 21-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\"><em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), rendered the sentencing guidelines advisory. Following <em>Booker, </em>the sentencing court, after accurately calculating the guidelines range and ruling on any possible departures, exercises its discretion by considering all of the relevant sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) before determining the appropriate sentence. <em>United States v. Gunter, </em>462 F.3d 237, 247 (3d Cir.2006). Miyares\u2019 argument is based on <em>Gunter, </em>where we held <em>\u201cpost-Booker </em>a sentencing court errs when it believes that it has no discretion to consider the crack/powder cocaine differential incorporated into the Guidelines.\u201d 462 F.3d at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\"><em>Gunter </em>was premised on a finding that \u201cthe [District] Court viewed the crack/powder cocaine differential in the Guidelines as mandatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239. Miyares contends the District Court here similarly viewed the crack/powder cocaine differential in the guidelines as mandatory. He bases this assertion primarily on two statements made by the District Court during his sentencing hearing. First, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-12\">Congress has clearly manifested its intent that offenses involving crack cocaine are to be treated differently than those involving powder cocaine in both Title 21 of the United States Code, Section 841, and in the sentencing guideline Congress has indicated that possession with respect \u2014 that possession with the intent to distribute crack cocaine warrants a sentence greater than that warranted for possessing with the intent to distribute an equivalent amount of powder cocaine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-13\">Subsequently, after considering relevant jurisprudence from this court and others,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-14\">The weight of the law ... supports a finding that the differences in sentencing factors between crack cocaine and powder cocaine do not warrant a sentence outside of their recommended range. The Court agrees and will not vary from the guideline sentencing range on this ground.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-15\">Miyares contends these statements demonstrate the District Court treated the Guidelines as mandatory. We disagree. Rather than showing the District Court believed it had no authority to consider the crack/powder cocaine disparity in its \u00a7 3553(a) analysis, these statements indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>cate the District Court properly considered congressional intent and relevant case law in sentencing Miyares.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Significantly, the District Court explicitly recognized that the guidelines, post-<em>Booker, </em>were not mandatory. It stated: \u201cIn light of <em>Booker ... </em>the Court has authority to, for good reason, impose a sentence outside of the guideline range.\u201d Nevertheless, the District Court, properly exercising its discretion, chose to follow the crack/powder cocaine guideline. <em>See </em>Gunter, 462 F.3d at 249 (\u201c[W]e do not suggest (or even hint) that the Court categorically reject the 100:1 ratio.... The limited holding here is that district courts may consider the crack/powder cocaine differential in the Guidelines as a factor, but not a mandate, in the <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing process.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">We also review the sentence for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Wise, </em>515 F.3d 207, 218 (3d Cir.2008) (citing <em>Gall v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). \u201cAs long as a sentence falls within the broad range of possible sentences that can be considered reasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we must affirm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">The District Court closely considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the \u201ctotality of the circumstances of this case,\u201d including: (1) Miyares\u2019 submissions for leniency based on \u201cage, family ties, and alleged attempts at rehabilitation\u201d; (2) the \u201cnature, circumstances and seriousness of ... [the] offenses\u201d; (3) Miyares\u2019 \u201chistory, characteristics, educational, vocational, and corrective needs\u201d; (4) the \u201cneed for just non-disparate punishment and deterrence and protection of the community\u201d; and (5) Miyares\u2019 prior criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">Miyares acknowledges the District Court considered \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but he argues that \u201ca general recognition of the 3553(a) sentencing factors does not render a sentence reasonable if the sentencing court believed that it was bound by the 100:1 ratio.\u201d Miyares Br. at 26. But we have already determined the District Court did not believe it was bound by the crack/powder cocaine differential. Accordingly, we cannot say the sentence in this case was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-14\">Miyares also challenges the imposition of the statutory maximum sentence, 120 months, for his conviction on Count One. Miyares contends the guidelines require a shorter sentence for this conviction and that the District Court failed to give independent consideration to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors for this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-15\">But Miyares overlooks the fact that Count One and Count Two, as related offenses, were properly \u201cgrouped\u201d and considered together under the guidelines. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(c). Under the guidelines, a combined offense level is determined based on \u201cthe highest offense level of the counts in the Group.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3D1.3(a). And the District Court sentenced Miyares to a term of 135 months\u2019 imprisonment for his conviction on Count Two \u2014 the minimum of the applicable advisory guideline range. Miyares\u2019 120-month sentence on Count One was to be served concurrently with his sentence on Count Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-16\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-17\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment of sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>tence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-8\">. The District Court cited, <em>inter alia: United States </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>450 F.3d 270 (7th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Pho, </em>433 F.3d 53 (1st Cir. 2006); and <em>United States v. Cawthorn, </em>429 F.3d 793 (8th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b140-17\">. On November 1, 2007, the Sentencing Commission adopted Amendment 706, which decreased the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses by two levels. <em>United States v. Wise, </em>515 F.3d 207, 219 (3d Cir.2008) (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 (Nov. 1, 2007); U.S.S.G. Supp. to App\u2019x C, Amend. 706). Amendment 706 went into effect on March 3, 2008, and we found the amendment is not applied retroactively. <em>Id. </em>at 220. However, we have found that appellants may obtain what is, in effect, retroactive relief under Amendment 706 by filing an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion in the District Court after March 3, 2008. <em>Id. </em>at 220-21. Accordingly, while we affirm the sentence, Miyares may seek relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in District Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
