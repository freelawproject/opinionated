Quite simply, we do not believe any objectively reasonable officer in the same circumstances and possessing the same knowledge as Chief Wright could have believed that even arguable probable cause existed for arresting Ellis for violating Florida Statute Section 810.09 or 877.03. Having determined Chief Wright is not entitled to qualified immunity against Ellis\u2019s claim of unlawful arrest under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, we, therefore, also conclude he is not entitled to qualified immunity against Ellis\u2019s claim of excessive force.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-24\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b660-17\">. Ellis's motion for attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 is denied. Section 1988 only authorizes fee awards to \"prevailing parties.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. A party is not a prevailing party until they have prevailed on the merits of at least one of their claims. <em>Hanrahan v. Hampton, </em>446 U.S. 754, 758, 100 S.Ct. 1987, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>64 L.Ed.2d 670 (1980). Ellis has only succeeded on an interlocutory appeal, which will allow her suit to proceed to an adjudication of the merits; therefore, she is not a prevailing party.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
