Petitioner admitted the charge\u2019s factual allegations (contained in a Notice to Appear) and filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b), 1231(b)(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his application, Petitioner alleged a fear of persecution in Cambodia related to his past political activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-22\">Following a hearing at which Petitioner testified at length, the Immigration Judge (IJ) found him not credible. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii),(iii) (establishing framework for credibility determinations). Based on blanket findings, the IJ first concluded Petitioner was not eligible for asylum. The IJ explained that Petitioner did not meet his burden of establishing he was a \u201crefugee\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42), <em>i.e., </em>one having a well-founded fear of persecution based on, among other things, \u201cpolitical opinion.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1158(b) (requiring applicant for asylum to establish refugee status). The IJ further concluded Petitioner was not entitled to withholding of removal because he did not meet his burden of establishing his life or freedom would be threatened on account of \u201cpolitical opinion\u201d if removed to Cambodia. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1231(b)(3). The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>missed Petitioner\u2019s appeal, agreeing with the IJ\u2019s \u201cdecision for the reasons stated therein.\u201d The BIA explained that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1008.1(d)(3)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">In <em>Jiang v. Gonzales, </em>474 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir.2007) we set forth the standard of review applicable to the present Petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV\">This court reviews findings of fact in immigration proceedings, including findings with respect to credibility, to determine whether those findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record. Under that standard, an adverse credibility determination may stand if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AI\">(internal quotations and citation omitted). We need not repeat Petitioner\u2019s story here. We have carefully reviewed the entire record and the parties\u2019 briefs, and conclude the IJ and BIA reached a permissible result under the applicable law. We have repeatedly opined that \u201c \u2018when a lower court accurately takes the measure of a case and articulates a cogent rationale, it serves no useful purpose for a reviewing court to write at length.\u2019 \u201d <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Zaldivar, </em>413 F.3d 119, 120 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Seaco Ins. Co. v. Davis-Irish, </em>300 F.3d 84, 86 (1st Cir.2002) (citing cases)). Because substantial evidence supports both the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s respective decisions, we deny the Petition for Review for substantially the reasons set forth in those decisions. <em>See Lin v. Mukasey, </em>521 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir.2008) (\u201cWhere the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s ruling, but also engages in discussion of its own, we review the decisions of both together.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-18\">. Petitioner also unsuccessfully sought relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT). Because Petitioner has not argued his CAT claim in his appellate brief, that claim is not before us on the Petition for Review. <em>See United States v. Zannino, </em>895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (recognizing \"settled appellate rule that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
