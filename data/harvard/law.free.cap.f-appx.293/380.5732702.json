Comp. Laws \u00a7 37.2101 <em>et seq., </em>alleging that she had been fired because she was pregnant. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Dollar Tree, holding that, even if Bilak-Thompson had established a prima facie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>case of pregnancy discrimination, she had failed to show that Dollar Tree\u2019s proffered non-discriminatory reason for terminating her \u2014 violating the company\u2019s payroll and timekeeping policies \u2014 was mere pretext. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Risa Bilak-Thompson was manager of a Dollar Tree store in Dearborn, Michigan from 2001 until her termination on December 22, 2004. Approximately two months before she was fired, in October 2004, Bilak-Thompson informed her immediate supervisor, District Manager Cheri Noble, that she was pregnant. She also presented a doctor\u2019s note that stated that she should \u201clighten [her] load some.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">In early November, Noble met with Bilak-Thompson to discuss problems with the store\u2019s timekeeping and payroll practices. Bilak-Thompson does not recall this meeting, but does not deny that it took place. At any rate, Bilak-Thompson admits that the store had a spotty track record of compliance with Dollar Tree\u2019s timekeeping policies. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 2-3. She testified at deposition that her employees would frequently neglect to clock in and out properly for work and for breaks using the company\u2019s computerized timekeeping system. Specifically, Bilak-Thompson recalled that, while employees of her store were supposed to fill out and initial a paper \u201ctime clock worksheet\u201d whenever they needed to correct erroneous time entries on the computerized system, \u201c[v]ery rarely did it ever happen.\u201d She testified, \u201cI would check for time clock worksheets. If they were ever filled out, they were filled out very sparingly.\u201d Indeed, in October (the same month she informed Noble she was pregnant), she called a mandatory meeting to discuss the issue with her store employees because \u201cthe time clock edits were so horrible.\u201d As store manager, Bilak-Thompson was responsible for ensuring that payroll was submitted for processing by 9:30 a.m. on Monday. Her employees\u2019 failures to account for their time properly made it difficult for Bilak-Thompson to submit payroll by the deadline. At the deposition, she essentially admitted to violating company policy by processing payroll without all the required documentation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">Q: If an employee did not clock in or out ... how would that problem be fixed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-10\">A: They were supposed to fill out a time clock worksheet, but inevitably if they did not fill one out and the error had to be corrected, if no one else corrected it, come Monday morning when I had to finalize payroll by 9:30 or be terminated, <em>I would have to correct the issue. </em>There would be no other way for me to finalize.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-11\">Q: And if you could not find any time clock worksheets, what would you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-12\">A: [W]e would always call the associate if we could get ahold <em>[sic] </em>of them.... If not, I would have to go by what is on the schedule.... If Monday morning came and there was no time clock report, but I had to process that, <em>I would have to figure it out mainly myself.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-13\">Q: Do you recall ... telling [your employees] that they needed to sign in and out, and that they needed proper documentation in order to get paid for all time worked?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-14\">A: Yes, I had several meetings on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-15\">Q: And did you understand that proper documentation at that time meant that the employee had to initial any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>time edits on the time clock worksheet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\">A: If they filled them out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\">Q: And if they didn\u2019t fill them [out], what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">A: We tracked them down like a dog to get them to fill them out before 9:30 Monday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">Q: And if they weren\u2019t filled out by 9:30 Monday, what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">A: Payroll had to be approved. The only way payroll could be approved was to pay them for them time worked.... Come Monday morning at 9:30, if there was no time clock worksheets presented to me, <em>I went by what they were scheduled on the schedule, </em>because all associates had to be paid for all time worked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">J.A. 73-75, 91-92 (emphasis added). Bilak-Thompson understood that Dollar Tree had a \u201czero tolerance policy\u201d for editing employees\u2019 time without proper documentation \u2014 i.e., changing the hours for which an employee would be paid without an employee-initialed time clock worksheet \u2014 and that \u201cDollar Tree required 100 percent compliance with its policies.\u201d Nevertheless, she characterized this policy as a \u201ccatch-21\u201d <em>[sic]: </em>\u201cI either did my job and finalized and approved payroll by 9:30, or I left everyone unpaid and did not finalize payroll by 9:30 Monday morning.\u201d Bilak-Thompson also admitted that she failed to follow company policy requiring timekeeping errors to be corrected on a daily basis, which failure she attributed to her employees\u2019 intractability. Regardless of whoever was more to blame for the store\u2019s payroll difficulties, Bilak-Thompson acknowledged that, as manager, she was \u201csolely responsible for making sure all timekeeping errors were corrected by the time payroll was due at 9:30 am each Monday.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">For her part, Noble \u201cwas concerned that [Bilak-Thompson] was not complying with Dollar Tree\u2019s policies on timekeeping and payroll, and in particular the editing of time records,\u201d and so reported her concerns to upper management. Dollar Tree\u2019s Compliance Manager, Patricia Doss, conducted an audit of the store\u2019s timekeeping and payroll entries for a two-week period in November 2004. That audit concluded that most of the store\u2019s associates \u201chad anomalies or irregularities in time entry and time entries appeared to have been done by someone other than the timekeeping associate.\u201d Doss concluded that five associates had been underpaid, though two of these associates (both of whom were related to Bilak-Thompson) denied in affidavits having been shorted any pay. Noble reported the results of her investigation and Doss\u2019s audit to her superiors and requested guidance. Noble stated in her affidavit that upper management instructed her to terminate Bilak-Thompson\u2019s employment, which she did on December 22, 2004. Bilak-Thompson was replaced by a woman who was (apparently) not pregnant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">In July 2005, Bilak-Thompson filed a one-count complaint against Dollar Tree Stores in Wayne County Circuit Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>alleging that her firing violated Michigan\u2019s Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act (ELCRA). The case was removed to federal district court on diversity grounds (Dollar Tree Stores is incorporated in Virginia), and Dollar Tree moved for summary judgment. Bilak-Thompson then supplemented her deposition testimony by filing an affidavit in which she stated, \u201cI did not violate company policies and practices regarding editing associates^] time clock work sheets. I deny improperly editing any of the store associates!]] time keeping records in November, 2004. All store associates were paid for all time actually worked in November, 2004.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The district court granted Dollar Tree\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>Bilak-Thompson v. Dollar Tree Stores, Inc., </em>No. 05-CV-73195, 2006 WL 3313790 (E.D.Mich. Nov.15, 2006). The court offered two alternative bases for so holding: (1) Bilak-Thompson had failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under Michigan law, and (2) even if she had, Dollar Tree had successfully rebutted the presumption of discrimination by giving a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for her termination, which reason Bilak-Thompson had failed to show was mere pretext for discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at *5-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">As to its first reason, the court examined relevant state case law on the topic of pregnancy discrimination, and concluded that \u201csummary judgment is appropriate where the only theory that a female plaintiff presents in a pregnancy discrimination claim is that she was replaced by a non-pregnant female. [Michigan case law] makes clear that ... \u2018pregnant women\u2019 have not been recognized as a distinct class, separate from all women.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *6. We express no view on the correctness of the district court\u2019s interpretation of Michigan law on this point. Rather, as explained more fully below, we affirm the district court based on its alternative holding \u2014 that Dollar Tree is entitled to summary judgment because Bilak-Thompson admitted in her deposition testimony to violating company policy regarding timekeeping and payroll practices, which violations constituted a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for her termination. Bilak-Thompson\u2019s failure to show that this reason was pretextual is fatal to her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">This court \u201creviews a grant of summary judgment de novo, using the same Rule 56(c) standard as the district court.\u201d <em>Cox v. Ky. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>53 F.3d 146, 149 (6th Cir.1995). Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In deciding a motion for summary judgment, this court views the factual evidence and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party, here Bilak-Thompson. <em>See Nat\u2019l Enters., Inc. v. Smith, </em>114 F.3d 561, 563 (6th Cir.1997). The plaintiff, however, must present more than a mere scintilla of evidence; to survive a motion for summary judgment, \u201cthere must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Klepper v. First Am. Bank, </em>916 F.2d 337, 341-42 (6th Cir.1990) (quoting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">Because this case involves only a state law claim under Michigan\u2019s ELCRA, the district court was required to apply that law as it has been interpreted by the Mich<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>igan courts. <em>See Brocklehurst v. PPG Industries, Inc., </em>123 F.3d 890, 894 (6th Cir. 1997) (\u201cBecause [the plaintiff] filed this ... claim pursuant to Michigan\u2019s Elliott-Larsen Act, Michigan substantive law governs this action.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The ELCRA states, in relevant part, \u201cAn employer shall not ... discharge, or otherwise discriminate against an individual with respect to employment, compensation, or a term, condition, or privilege of employment, because of religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, or marital status.\u201d Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 37.2202 (2001). The term \u201c \u2018sex\u2019 includes, but is not limited to, pregnancy, childbirth, or a medical condition related to pregnancy or childbirth....\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 37.2201(d). Where, as here, there is no direct evidence of discrimination, Michigan applies the same burden-shifting analysis to claims under the ELCRA as that laid out by the Supreme Court for Title VII claims. <em>See Sniecinski v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mich., </em>469 Mich. 124, 666 N.W.2d 186, 193 (2003) (\u201cIn cases involving indirect or circumstantial evidence [of discrimination], a plaintiff must proceed by using the burden-shifting approach set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">To establish a rebuttable prima facie case of discrimination, a plaintiff must \u201cpresent evidence that (1) she belongs to a protected class, (2) she suffered an adverse employment action, (3) she was qualified for the position, and (4) the job was given to another person under circumstances giving rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination.\u201d <em>Hazle v. Ford Motor Co., </em>464 Mich. 456, 628 N.W.2d 515, 521 (2001) (citing <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817). Once a prima facie case is made, the \u201cdefendant may rebut the presumption [of unlawful discrimination] by articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employment decision.\u201d <em>Sniecinski, </em>666 N.W.2d at 193-94. If the defendant does so, the burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to establish that the defendant\u2019s proffered reason is \u201cpretext for unlawful discrimination.\u201d <em>Hazle, </em>628 N.W.2d at 522 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">As noted earlier, we will assume, without deciding, that Bilak-Thompson established a prima facie case of pregnancy discrimination. We further agree with the district court that Dollar Tree proffered a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for her termination \u2014 violating company policy by making changes to payroll without proper documentation and failing to correct payroll errors on a daily basis. The question remaining, then, is whether Bilak-Thompson met her burden of raising a genuine issue of material fact as to whether this proffered reason was a pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Under Michigan law, a plaintiff may establish that an employer\u2019s proffered reason is mere pretext by showing \u201c(1) ... that the reason(s) had no basis in fact, (2) if the reason(s) had a basis in fact, ... that they were not actual factors motivating the decision, or (3) if the reason(s) were motivating factors, ... that they were jointly insufficient to justify the deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>sion.\u201d <em>Meagher v. Wayne State Univ., </em>222 Mich.App. 700, 565 N.W.2d 401, 411 (1997); <em>see also Smith v. Mosaica Educ., Inc., </em>2007 WL 677755, at *5 (Mich.Ct.App. Mar.6, 2007) (pretext established \u201cby showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence\u201d) (quoting <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000)); <em>Staunch v. Continental Airlines, </em>511 F.3d 625, 631 (6th Cir.2008) (pretext in Title VII case may be demonstrated by showing that \u201cproffered reasons (1) have no basis in fact; (2) did not actually motive the action; or (3) were insufficient to warrant the action\u201d). Bilak-Thompson relies on the first of these methods to show pretext\u2014 that the reasons given by Dollar Tree have no basis in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">In support of her argument, Bilak-Thompson attempts to draw a fine distinction between that to which she admitted in her deposition, \u201ccorrect[ing] time cards to reflect the actual time worked by the associates,\u201d and that for which she was fired, \u201cfalsifying] time cards [such] that associates were not paid for time worked.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 11. She admits to the former, but steadfastly maintains that she never did \u2014 nor admitted to \u2014 the latter. But contrary to Bilak-Thompson\u2019s assertion that she was not fired \u201csimply ... for not following time card policies,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>a failure to adhere to company policy unquestionably formed at least part of the reason Dollar Tree fired her.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The record shows that the company accused Bilak-Thompson of having \u201cfailed to obtain the proper documentation before editing the time records of her store associates\u201d and having \u201cfailed to correct the errors in her store employees\u2019 timekeeping entries on a daily basis.\u201d Bilak-Thompson admitted to both of these failures, and both were violations of company policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Bilak-Thompson attempts to explain the lack of documentation by blaming her employees, noting that \u2014 despite her best efforts \u2014 they almost never filled out the time clock worksheets, and that she thus had no choice but to process payroll without the requisite documentation. But whether Bilak-Thompson, as store manager, could properly be held to account for her employees\u2019 failures is not for us to decide. It is enough that the company\u2019s cited reason for firing Bilak-Thompson can hardly be said to have had \u201cno basis in fact\u201d when she admitted to the very violations for which she was (at least in part) terminated. This is especially so where Bilak-Thompson \u201cunderstood that Dollar Tree had a zero tolerance policy for editing time cards without proper documentation.\u201d J.A. 168 (Dollar Tree\u2019s Statement of Material Facts Not in Dispute), 280 (Bilak-Thompson\u2019s corresponding admission). It is ultimately irrelevant, then, whether any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>of her actions actually resulted in employees being short-changed pay; the company was well within its rights to terminate her simply for not following its timekeeping and payroll policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Perhaps if Bilak-Thompson could show that a non-pregnant store manager who engaged in similar violations of company policy was not disciplined, we might reach a different conclusion. <em>See Hedrick v. Western Reserve Care Sys., </em>355 F.3d 444, 460 (6th Cir.2004) (pretext may be shown through \u201cevidence that other employees, particularly employees not in the protected class, were not fired even though they engaged in substantially identical conduct to that which the employer contends motivated its discharge of the plaintiff\u2019) (quoting <em>Manzer v. Diamond Shamrock Chems. Co., </em>29 F.3d 1078, 1084 (6th Cir.1994)). In fact, Bilak-Thompson makes an effort along these lines, arguing that her male assistant manager engaged in similar time-card violations but was not terminated. But Bilak-Thompson\u2019s own affidavit states that her assistant manager quit on November 12, 2004, nearly a week before Noble requested the audit of Bilak-Thompson\u2019s store and about six weeks before Bilak-Thompson was terminated. There is no indication or even an allegation as to what would have happened to the assistant manager if he had not quit. Moreover, as a subordinate employee, it is doubtful whether he and Bilak-Thompson were even similarly situated. <em>See Seay v. Tenn. Valley Auth., </em>339 F.3d 454, 479 (6th Cir. 2003) (\u201c[A] plaintiff must \u2018prove that all of the relevant aspects of his employment situation were \u2018nearly identical\u2019 to those of [the non-protected individual\u2019s] employment situation.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Pierce v. Commonwealth Life Ins. Co., </em>40 F.3d 796, 802 (6th Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">As store manager, Bilak-Thompson acknowledged that she was ultimately responsible for ensuring that timekeeping and payroll were handled properly. She failed. Consequently, justly or unjustly, she was terminated. Even when viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Bilak-Thompson, there is simply no evidence that her pregnancy had anything to do with the company\u2019s decision. She has failed to present any affirmative evidence that Dollar Tree\u2019s explanation for her termination either had \u201cno basis in fact,\u201d <em>Meagher, </em>565 N.W.2d at 411, or was otherwise \u201cunworthy of credence,\u201d <em>Smith, </em>2007 WL 677755, at *5. Without such evidence of pretext, there is no genuine issue of material fact that would allow her claim to proceed to trial, and summary judgment was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The decision of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-10\">. The only evidence Bilak-Thompson offers that her replacement was not pregnant is an affidavit from an employee who stayed on at the store after Bilak-Thompson was replaced. The employee claims that the new store manager \"had previously been on maternity leave as a result of giving birth ... several months earlier\u201d and that she was not pregnant when she replaced Bilak-Thompson. Dollar Tree argues that this affidavit is not admissible evidence because it is not based on personal knowledge as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c). Because it makes no difference to the outcome, we will assume <em>arguendo </em>that Bilak-Thompson's replacement was not pregnant at the time she assumed the store manager position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b410-5\">. This court has noted, however, that the EL-CRA is substantively similar to its federal counterpart \u2014 Title VII of the Civil Rights Act \u2014 and that the Michigan courts often look to federal law in adjudicating ELCRA claims. <em>See ibid. </em>(\"[T]he Michigan courts look to federal law when reviewing claims of ... discrimination under the Elliott-Larsen Act.\u201d); <em>DeBoer v. Musashi Auto Parts, Inc., </em>124 Fed.Appx. 387, 391 (6th Cir.2005) (noting that the evidence required to establish a pri-ma facie case under Title VII will suffice to establish a prima facie case under the EL-CRA).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b411-6\">. Bilak-Thompson points to her termination notice as evidence that she was not fired simply for failing to adhere to company policies, but specifically for falsifying documents. Indeed, Noble did check a box on the termination notice that indicated that Bilak-Thompson was being fired for \u201cfalsifying records/reports,\u201d but Noble also specified (in the \u201cdetails\u201d section of that form) that this was in relation to Bilak-Thompson's \u201cedit[ing] time cards.\" J.A. 204. Ultimately, we think that this distinction \u2014 between falsifying records and failing to adhere to company policy more generally \u2014 is largely one of semantics and not particularly significant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b411-11\">. Bilak-Thompson\u2019s contradictory affidavit is of no consequence, and was properly ignored by the district court. <em>See Penny v. United Parcel Service, </em>128 F.3d 408, 415 (6th Cir. 1997) (\u201cWe do not consider [plaintiff\u2019s] affidavit ... because a party cannot create a genuine issue of material fact by filing an affidavit, after a motion for summary judgment has been made, that essentially contradicts his earlier deposition testimony.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
