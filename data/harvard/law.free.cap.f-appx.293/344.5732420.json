Rojas argues that his sentence should be vacated as procedurally unreasonable because at the time of sentencing the district court was precluded by this court\u2019s precedent from considering mitigation evidence in support of a below guidelines sentence. He further contends that this court\u2019s precedent following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), effectively made the Guidelines mandatory and prevented the district court from considering all of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. He asserts that the decisions in <em>Rita v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), <em>Gall v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), make it clear that the Guidelines \u201c \u2018are only one factor to consider when imposing [a] sentence,\u2019\u201d and that a district court should impose an individualized sentence that is sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to achieve the purposes of sentencing under \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">This court reviews a sentencing decision for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which is the equivalent of abuse-of-discretion review. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 594. At the sentencing hearing, Rojas did not offer any argument or mitigation evidence to support a downward departure. The court heard the arguments of counsel and the comments by Rojas regarding the disputed facts contained in the presentence report, specifically referred to circumstances affecting consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and concluded that a sentence within the guidelines range was appropriate in light of those considerations. Nothing in the record suggests that the district court was in any way inclined to deviate below the guidelines ranges. In fact, after imposing Rojas\u2019s within guideline sentence, the district court specifically informed Rojas that his sentence was based on a consideration of \u201call the applicable [\u00a7 ] 3553(a) factors.\u201d The district court further informed Rojas that the 97-month sentence was a \u201cgenerous sentence\u201d given the amount of cocaine involved, Rojas\u2019s actions at the time of the offense, and the way Rojas had conducted himself at the sentencing hearing. The district court\u2019s decision to sentence Rojas within the guidelines range is entitled to deference and a presumption of reasonableness that Rojas has failed to overcome. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-16\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b371-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
