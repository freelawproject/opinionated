Nov. 30, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">As a preliminary matter, in his petition for review, Zheng challenges the BIA\u2019s decision on appeal, in addition to the underlying agency decision denying his family planning-based asylum application. Despite Zheng\u2019s attempt to challenge the underlying merits decision, our jurisdiction is limited to the BIA\u2019s November 2007 order denying his third motion to reopen. <em>See Paul v. INS, </em>348 F.3d 43, 45 (2d Cir.2003); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">When the BIA denies a motion to reopen, this Court reviews the BIA\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted). In reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of motions to reopen, this Court has remained mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that motions to reopen are \u201cdisfavored.\u201d <em>See Ma-ghradze v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 150, 154 (2d Cir .2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">Here, The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Zheng\u2019s June 2007 motion to reopen \u2014 his third such motion and the fifth motion he filed since his order of removal became final in 1997. First, it is beyond dispute that Zheng\u2019s motion was both untimely and numerically barred. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-13\">In addition, the BIA properly determined that Zheng was not eligible for an exception to the time limitation for motions to reopen because he failed to submit any evidence establishing a change in country conditions in China. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Zheng asserts in his brief to this Court that he has been promoting the China Democratic Party (\u201cCDP\u201d) in the United States since November 1996, by sending out e-mails, publishing essays, and attending protests. He states that another CDP member was arrested in China and sentenced to eight years in prison for similar activities, as detailed in a Sichuan Province appellate decision characterizing the CDP as a \u201chostile\u201d overseas organization. Because Zheng does not argue, as he did before the BIA, that this characterization in itself is a changed circumstance in China, any such argument is deemed waived. <em>See Yueqiug Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005)</p>\n<p id=\"b859-14\">Furthermore, while Zheng asserts that his wife sent him a letter indicating that he is wanted by the Chinese government due to his activities with the CDP, the Government correctly notes that he failed to raise this assertion before the BIA. Thus, we decline to review as unexhausted any argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>ment that Zheng has established changed country conditions on the basis of the alleged letter. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 121-22, 124 (2d Cir.2007) (describing issue exhaustion as \u201cmandatory\u201d); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A) (providing that \u201cthe court of appeals shall decide the petition only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">The BIA also properly found that reopening was not warranted to the extent Zheng\u2019s motion was based on his participation in the CDP in the United States alone. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(e)(3)(ii); <em>Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 273 (2d Cir.2006). It is well-established that such a change in. personal circumstances does not suffice to except a motion from the applicable time and numerical limitations. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, the BIA\u2019s refusal to reopen Zheng\u2019s case <em>sua sponte </em>under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) was entirely discretionary, and any challenge to that decision is beyond our review. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006). Accordingly, the BIA\u2019s denial of Zheng\u2019s motion to reopen was not an abuse of discretion, <em>see Kaur, </em>413 F.3d at 233, and we need not reach the BIA\u2019s alternate finding that Zheng failed to establish <em>p?ima facie </em>eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
