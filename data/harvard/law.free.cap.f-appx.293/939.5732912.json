The plaintiffs, who represent a putative class of renters that opted for the waiver, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>seek damages under New Jersey\u2019s Consumer Fraud Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 56:8-2, because they allege that it was \u201cworthless\u201d because it \u201cadd[ed] no protection not already provided by Home Depot\u2019s standard rental agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> PI. Br. at 2. After considering the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments, the District Court granted summary judgment in Home Depot\u2019s favor. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that \u201c[tjhere is ... no situation in which the Damage Waiver will ever apply; it excludes coverage for the only exposure the renter has under the contract, which is liability for damage caused by improper use,\u201d and therefore Home Depot was not entitled to summary judgment. Pl. Br. 4. To assess their claims, we must construe the Rental Agreement and Damage Waiver, read as a whole and informed by the ordinary meaning of the words they contain, to determine whether there is a question of fact as to the extent of the agreements\u2019 protections <em>vis a vis </em>each other, and thus whether the Damage Waiver provides any protection above and beyond that offered by the Rental Agreement. <em>Vanguard Telecommc\u2019ns, Inc. v. S. New England Tel. Co., </em>900 F.2d 645, 651 (3d Cir.1990); Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">The Rental Agreement places the risk of loss on the renter in every instance, though it excuses that renter from paying for the \u201creasonable wear and tear resulting from proper use.\u201d By comparison, the Damage Waiver relieves the customer of \u201cliability for accidental damage to [the tool], but not for any losses or damages due to theft, burglary, misuse or abuse, theft by conversion, intentional damage, disappearance or any loss due to [the renter\u2019s] failure to care properly for such equipment in a prudent manner.\u201d Although the plaintiffs argued that these provisions are essentially two ways of saying the same thing, the District Court disagreed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-10\">First, plaintiff incorrectly equates reasonable wear and tear resulting from proper use with damage that occurs during ordinary use of a rented tool.... A carpet cleaner could be damaged during proper use besides \u2018wear and tear\u2019 such as damage occurring from the machine accidentally hitting a wall or falling down a stairway ... [T]he plaintiffs agreed that if the compactor was struck by lightning[,] that may be an instance where the Damage Waiver would provide coverage. Similarly, plaintiffs conceded that if the tool was damaged in the course of transportation <em>(ie., </em>fell off a truck)[,] the Damage Waiver would also provide coverage in that instance .... This would be an accidental damage that does not occur during use. As a result, the Court finds that the Damage Waiver does provide coverage for certain types of losses and[,] accordingly, the Damage Waiver does have value [because] it modifies the broad allocation of risk ... by relieving the renter from liability for accidental damage to the tool \u2014 both when the tool is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>being used properly and when the tool is not being used at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Supp.App. 34-85 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">The plaintiffs claim that the Rental Agreement\u2019s \u201cRepair or Replacement\u201d clause undermines the District Court\u2019s conclusion because it expressly calls for renters\u2019 liability when damage is caused by an improper use. The clause provides: \u201c[I]f [the tool] is unsafe or in disrepair because of my improper use or maintenance, I will bear the expense of such replacement repair.\u201d Accordingly, to credit the plaintiffs\u2019 construction, we must read the word \u201conly\u201d into this provision, as in <em>\u201conly </em>if the tool is unsafe ... because of my improper use ..., I will bear the expense.\u201d If we were to do so, it would change the clause from one highlighting an instance where the renter is liable into one broadly limiting the renter\u2019s liability to only those instances \u2014 even though the contract read as a whole shows no such intention. We are not prepared to take this tack.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">Because we agree with the District Court\u2019s reasoning, we affirm the entry of summary judgment in favor of Home Depot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b966-8\">. The New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act prohibits \u201d[t]he act, use or employment by any person of any unconscionable commercial practice, deception, fraud, false pretense, false promise, misrepresentation, or the knowing ... concealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact with the intent that others rely upon such concealment.\u201d N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 56:8-2. This includes the sale of worthless products. <em>Kugler v. Romain, </em>58 N.J. 522, 279 A.2d 640, 651 (1971). Because the parties are sufficiently diverse, the District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
