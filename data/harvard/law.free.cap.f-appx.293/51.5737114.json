We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-24\">On appeal, Osorio claims that the District Court erred both procedurally and substantively in imposing a term of incarceration of 87 months. First, he asserts a procedural error in that the District Court failed to \u201cstate in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence, as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c).\u201d Next, he claims that the imposition of an 87-month prison term was substantively unreasonable because it was \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d to accomplish the goals of section 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-25\">We review a district court\u2019s sentencing decision for both substantive and procedural reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number><em>States,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The procedural inquiry focuses primarily on the sentencing court\u2019s compliance with its statutory obligations to consider the factors detailed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), while the substantive inquiry assesses the length of the sentence imposed in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"Acq\"><em>United States v. Verkhoglyad, </em>516 F.3d 122, 127 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">However, Osorio failed to raise his procedural objections at the sentencing proceeding. Therefore, this Court reviews such objections on appeal for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Carter, </em>489 F.3d 528, 537 (2d Cir.2007) (\u201cBecause objections to the sentence were not raised before the district court, we review for \u2018plain error.\u2019 \u201d). The plain error standard requires (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects the substantial rights of the defendant. <em>See Carter, </em>489 F.3d at 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">A district court\u2019s statement of reasons for sentencing need not be exhaustive, particularized, or uniform. <em>See Rita v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2467-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). \u201cThe appropriateness of brevity or length, conciseness or detail, when to write, what to say, depends on the circumstances. Sometimes a judicial opinion responds to every argument; sometimes it does not.... The law leaves much, in this respect, to a judge\u2019s own professional judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2468. To satisfy the judicial burden under section 3553(c), \u201c[t]he sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision-making authority.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">This Court has never required any particular or formulaic language by district judges with respect to sentencing explanations. <em>See United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 30 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201c[N]o \u2018robotic incantations\u2019 are required to prove the fact of consideration and we will not conclude that a district judge shirked her obligation to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors simply because she did not discuss each one individually or did not expressly parse or address every argument relating to those factors that the defendant advanced.\u201d). Furthermore, as expressed by the Supreme Court in <em>Rita, </em>\u201c[wjhere the defendant or prosecutor presents nonfrivo-lous reasons for imposing a different sentence ... the judge will normally go further and explain why he has rejected those arguments.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct at 2468. The breadth of that explanation also depends on the circumstances before the court. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">The District Court, in imposing Osorio\u2019s sentence, adequately explained (1) why it rejected his argument for a downward departure and a non-Guidelines sentence notwithstanding Osorio\u2019s alleged \u201cminor role\u201d; and (2) why it was imposing a sentence at the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range. <em>See id. </em>The District Court further demonstrated that it considered the supporting evidence set forth in the Presen-tence Report and the parties\u2019 respective submissions. Thus, given the straightforward and conceptually simple arguments before the court, \u201cthe judge\u2019s statement of reasons here, though brief, was legally sufficient\u201d to satisfy the requirements of section 3553(c). <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468. In this respect, the District Court \u201cset forth enough to satisfy [this Court] that [it] ha[d] considered the parties\u2019 arguments and ha[d] a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We therefore reject Osorio\u2019s procedural challenges to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Furthermore, the record demonstrates that the District Court fully understood its authority to depart or vary from the Guidelines and carefully considered all the relevant arguments and section 3553(a) sentencing factors in determining the appropriate sentence and in rejecting Oso-rio\u2019s claim that the court should apply a non-Guidelines sentence. The court acknowledged that Osorio participated from \u201cbeginning to end\u201d in a drug deal involving 30 kilograms of cocaine with a financial profit of $10,000 for Osorio. The court also explained that because Osorio\u2019s role was important and critical to the success of the transaction, it agreed with the recommendation of the Presentence Report that a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The District Court then granted Osorio relief under the \u201csafety valve\u201d provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, which allowed for a sentence at the low end of the applicable Guidelines range (87-108 months); specifically, a sentence of 87 months, as opposed to the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 120 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In sum, we find no basis to conclude that Osorio\u2019s sentence was procedurally or substantively unreasonable. <em>See Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 26-27. For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
