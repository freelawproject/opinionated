During Brown\u2019s sentencing hearing, the district court denied Brown\u2019s Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 motion, sustained a portion of Brown\u2019s objections to the calculation of his guidelines range, and sentenced Brown to two concurrent sixty-month sentences. Brown timely noted his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">On appeal, Brown first contends that the district court erred in denying his Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal because the evidence was insufficient to support the finding that the correctional officers sustained \u201cbodily injury\u201d. This court reviews a district court\u2019s decision to deny a Rule 29 motion de novo. <em>United States v. Midgett, </em>488 F.3d 288, 297 (4th Cir.2007). Where, as here, the motion was based on a claim of insufficient evidence, \u201c[t]he verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>Midgett, </em>488 F.3d at 297. \u201c[Substantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable fact finder could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Delfino, </em>510 F.3d 468, 471 (4th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc)). This court \u201ccan reverse a conviction on insufficiency grounds only when the prosecution\u2019s failure is clear.\u201d <em>United States v. Moye, </em>454 F.3d 390, 394 (4th Cir.2006) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-13\">Prior to submitting the case to the jury, the district court instructed the jury that the term bodily injury \u201cmeans any cut, abrasion, bruise, burn or disfigurement, physical pain, illness, impairment of a bodily ... member, organ, or mental faculty, or any other injury to the body no matter how temporary.\u201d Assuming that the district court properly instructed the jury,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, established the correctional officers suffered \u201cbodily injury\u201d sufficient to sustain Brown\u2019s conviction on Count One. At trial, Correctional Officer Bolling testified that when Brown punched him in the face he was dazed and stunned to the point that he did not know what happened. Additionally, he had pain, redness, and a headache that lasted for a few days for which he took Tylenol. Also, Correctional Officer Meade testified that he had pain when hit by Brown and had noticeable redness on his jaw. In interpreting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242 (2000), this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>has stated that \u201cphysical pain alone or any injury to the body, no matter how fleeting, suffices\u201d to establish bodily injury. <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>470 F.3d 150, 161 (4th Cir.2006). Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Brown\u2019s Rule 29 motion as the evidence was sufficient to sustain his conviction on Count One.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">Brown next argues that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence two levels for bodily injury pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.4. A determination by a district court concerning whether a victim sustained bodily injury is a factual finding reviewable under a clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Isaacs, </em>947 F.2d 112, 114 (4th Cir.1991). This deferential standard of review requires reversal only if this court is \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Stevenson, </em>396 F.3d 538, 542 (4th Cir.2005)(quoting <em>Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">The <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>defines \u201cbodily injury\u201d as \u201cany significant injury; e.g., any injury that is painful and obvious, or is of a type for which medical attention ordinarily would be sought.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(B). In <em>United States v. Lancaster, </em>6 F.3d 208 (4th Cir.1993), this court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1014-6\">whether an injury is \u201csignificant\u201d thus should not be determined by a precise standard meted out at the appellate level and mechanically applied by the district court. Rather, it should be determined by a very factually-specific inquiry which takes into account a multitude of factors, some articulable and some more intangible, that are observable in hearing the evidence presented on the injury. Because the district court hears this evidence, it is by far best-situated to assess these myriad factors and determine whether a \u201csignificant injury\u201d has occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\"><em>Lancaster, </em>6 F.3d at 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-9\">After reviewing the record, we cannot conclude that the district court committed clear error in enhancing Brown\u2019s sentence. According to the evidence presented at trial, Meade experienced pain when hit by Brown and had redness where he was struck. Similarly, Bolling was dazed when hit by Brown and experienced pain, redness and a headache that lasted for several days. These injuries were sufficient to meet the definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(B). <em>See United States v. Isaacs, </em>947 F.2d 112, 114-15 (4th Cir.1991). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1013-11\"> Although Brown challenged the accuracy of the jury instructions in the district court, he has not raised this issue on appeal. Rather, on appeal, we read his brief on this point as contending only that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to permit the jury to find that the definition of \"bodily injury\" contained in the jury instructions had been satisfied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
