Korman, of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b105-13\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b105-14\">Petitioner Paul Pierrilus, a native of Haiti, filed the instant petition, seeking review of (1) a June 1, 2004 order of an Immigration Judge (\u201cU\u201d) denying petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture and ordering him removed; and (2) an August 25, 2005 order of the BIA, affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the removal order. He also challenges the length of his detention by the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) from February 2004 to August 2006.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-20\">We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review two of petitioner\u2019s claims, and we deny the petition insofar as it challenges the BIA\u2019s August 2005 order. First, we cannot review the IJ\u2019s 2004 order because petitioner failed to appeal the order to the BIA. Generally, we \u201cmay review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). In this ease, our authority to examine the IJ\u2019s order is foreclosed because \u201cthe requirement that petitioners appeal to the BIA [pursuant to] \u00a7 1252(d)(1) is jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Grullon v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 107, 112 (2d Cir.2007). Second, petitioner\u2019s challenge to the length of his detention is moot as a result of his release from DHS custody. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, the habeas statute under which petitioner challenged his detention, we retain jurisdiction so long as the petitioner is \u201cin custody.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c). However, it is not in dispute that petitioner has not been in DHS custody since August 2006. Finally, while petitioner\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>2005 order is more properly the subject of a separate petition for review, <em>see Zhao v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 89-90 (2d Cir.2001) (observing that a challenge to a removal order and a challenge to the denial of a motion for reconsideration of that order require two separate petitions for review), we nonetheless find no error in the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED insofar as it challenges the IJ\u2019s June 2004 order and petitioner\u2019s detention, and it is DENIED insofar as it challenges the BIA\u2019s August 2005 order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AIT\">. This claim began as a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York but was transferred to this Court in June 2005, pursuant to section 106 of the REAL ID Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
