Oberdorfer, United States District Judge for the District of Columbia, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b867-10\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">Defendant-Appellant Garfield Douglas appeals from the district court judgment sentencing him to a twenty-seven-month term of imprisonment after his conviction for conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 846, 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(D), and possession with intent to distribute more than five grams of marijuana within one thousand feet of a public elementary school in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 860(a) and 841(a)(1). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and proceedings in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d or \u201cUSSG\u201d). <em>See United States v. Fuller, </em>426 F.3d 556, 562 (2d Cir.2005). We find no merit in Douglas\u2019s argument that the district court made insufficient findings to support the application of the firearm enhancement, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), to his base offense level. It is well established that \u201c[t]he applicability of a specific offense characteristic such as section 2Dl.l(b)(l) depends on whether the conduct at issue is relevant to the offense of conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Pellegrini, </em>929 F.2d 55, 56 (2d Cir.1991) <em>(per cu-riam </em>)(internal quotation marks omitted). With respect to narcotics conspiracies the relevant conduct includes the possession of a dangerous weapon, which results in a two-level enhancement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The Guidelines specifically provide for the application of this enhancement where \u201cthe weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 Commentary, Application Note, n. 3. Finally, a district court is required to determine facts relevant to Guidelines enhancements by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>413 F.3d 201, 220 n. 15 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-18\">In this case, the district court\u2019s factual determinations were sufficient to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that it was not \u201cclearly improbable\u201d that the firearm discovered in Douglas\u2019s vehicle was involved in the offense. At sentencing, the court noted that Douglas had tossed the firearm into the vehicle after he had fled from police. The court referenced testimony elicited at trial that the weapon had been discovered in the vehicle where the officers had also discovered the quantity of marijuana that formed the basis for Douglas\u2019s conviction for narcotics conspiracy. Douglas argues that the district court erred in failing to find specifically that he, as opposed to his co-defendant, had actual<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>ly possessed the weapon. No such finding was necessary, however, as the district court could properly apply the enhancement provided it was not \u201cclearly improbable\u201d that the weapon was involved in this defendant\u2019s offense. Accordingly, Douglas\u2019s argument presents no basis upon which to disturb the district court\u2019s judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">We dispose of Douglas\u2019s remaining claims, and those of his co-defendant God-fried Martin, both of which challenge the Government\u2019s burden of proof under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 860(a), in an opinion filed simultaneously with this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
