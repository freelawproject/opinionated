Saffold, </em>536 U.S. 214, 122 S.Ct. 2134, 153 L.Ed.2d 260 (2002), the federal statute of limitations was statutorily tolled while he sought collateral review in the state courts of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-18\">Assuming that the mailbox rule applies, Samad\u2019s contentions still lack merit. Samad\u2019s petition filed on November 7, 2002, was denied by the California Superior Court as \u201csuccessive\u201d and \u201cuntimely.\u201d Therefore, his petition was not \u201cproperly filed\u201d and did not toll the federal statute of limitations. <em>See Pace v. DiGuglielmo, </em>544 U.S. 408, 417, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 161 L.Ed.2d 669 (2005). Consequently, Samad\u2019s federal petition filed on June 21, 2004, was untimely.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-19\">Our recent decision in <em>Harris v. Carter, </em>515 F.3d 1051, 1057 (9th Cir.2008), applying equitable tolling where the Petitioner relied on our <em>pre-Pace </em>precedent to determine when to file his federal petition, does not alter our holding in this case. In <em>Harris, </em>the Petitioner expressly argued his reliance on our precedent. <em>Id. </em>at 1052. No similar argument was made by Samad.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-20\">We decline to address the uncertified issues in this case because Samad has not satisfied his burden of showing \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right ...\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b505-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b505-24\">. Because the untimeliness of the petition filed in November, 2002, renders statutory tolling unavailable, we need not address Sa-mad\u2019s subsequent state court petitions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
