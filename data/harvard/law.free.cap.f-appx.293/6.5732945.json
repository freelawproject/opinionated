Petitioner admitted the charge\u2019s factual allegations (contained in a Notice to Appear) and filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b), 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16. In his application, Petitioner alleged a fear of persecution at the hands of Syrians based upon his Christian religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-29\">Following a hearing at which Petitioner testified at length, the Immigration Judge (IJ) first found Petitioner\u2019s application for asylum untimely under 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>\u00a7 1158(a)(2). Subsection (a)(2)(B) provides that, absent changed or extraordinary circumstances, an alien is not eligible for asylum \u201cunless the alien demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d Based on blanket findings, the IJ alternatively concluded that Petitioner was not eligible for asylum because his testimony was not credible. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii),(iii) (establishing a framework for credibility determinations). The IJ explained that Petitioner did not meet his burden of establishing he was a \u201crefugee\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42), <em>i.e., </em>one having a well-founded fear of persecution based on, among other things, religion. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i) (requiring applicant for asylum to establish refugee status). The IJ further concluded Petitioner was not entitled to withholding of removal because he did not meet his burden of establishing his life or freedom would be threatened on account of religion if removed to Lebanon. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1231(b)(3). Finally, the IJ concluded Petitioner had not proven \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he would be tortured upon returning to Lebanon as required for protection under CAT. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2). The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) agreed with the IJ\u2019s decision in all respects and dismissed Petitioner\u2019s appeal. In doing so, the BIA explained that Petitioner\u2019s application for asylum was time-barred, and the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">At the outset, we note our lack of jurisdiction to review Petitioner\u2019s asylum claim. Subsection (a)(3) of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158 plainly states \u201c[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General under paragraph (2),\u201d relating to time limits for filing an application for asylum. <em>See Guillaume v. Gonzales, </em>504 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir.2007). Thus, we possess jurisdiction only to review the BIA\u2019s denial of relief based on withholding of removal and CAT. In <em>Jiang v. Gonzales, </em>474 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir.2007) we set forth the standard of review applicable to those claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-7\">This court reviews findings of fact in immigration proceedings, including findings with respect to credibility, to determine whether those findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record. Under that standard, an adverse credibility determination may stand if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">(internal quotations and citation omitted); <em>see also Settenda v. Ashcroft, </em>377 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir.2004) (explaining the substantial evidence standard \u201capplies both to the asylum and withholding claims as well as to claims brought under CAT\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">Applying this standard, we need not repeat Petitioner\u2019s story here. We have carefully reviewed the entire record and the parties\u2019 briefs, and conclude the BIA reached the correct result under the applicable law. We have repeatedly opined that \u201c \u2018when a lower court accurately takes the measure of a case and articulates a cogent rationale, it serves no useful purpose for a reviewing court to write at length.\u2019 \u201d <em>Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Zaldivar, </em>413 F.3d 119, 120 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Seaco Ins. Co. v. Davis-Irish, </em>300 F.3d 84, 86 (1st Cir.2002) (citing cases)). Because substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision, we deny the Petition for Review for substantially the reasons set forth in that decision. <em>See Lin v. Mukasey, </em>521 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir.2008) (\u201cWhere the BIA does not [expressly] adopt the IJ\u2019s find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>ings, we review the BIA\u2019s decision rather than the IJ\u2019s.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED IN PART, AND DISMISSED IN PART FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
