We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>The BIA correctly determined that Alas\u2019 conviction under Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 288(a) constitutes \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d and an aggravated felony. <em>See United States v. Baron-Medina, </em>187 F.3d 1144, 1146-47 (9th Cir.1999). His expunged conviction is not analogous to a first-time drug possession offense. <em>Cf. Ramirez-Castro v. INS, </em>287 F.3d 1172, 1174 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201cPetitioner must demonstrate that his case falls within the exception created by <em>[Lujan-Armendariz v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 728 (9th Cir.2000) ], or show that some other, yet unrecognized, exception applies.\u201d). In addition, we reject Alas\u2019 contentions regarding the circumstances of his conviction as we cannot collaterally revisit a criminal proceeding. <em>See Ortega de Robles v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1355, 1358 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Alas failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution based on an enumerated ground because he failed to show that his feared harm would result from anything other than criminal activity. <em>See Bolshakov v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1279, 1281 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Alas failed to present evidence that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured by El Salvadoran officials or anyone acting with their consent or acquiescence. <em>See Azanor v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1013, 1018-19 (9th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Alas\u2019 contention that the IJ violated his due process rights by denying his motion for a change of venue and preventing his mother and wife from testifying is unpersuasive because he was afforded a full and fair opportunity to present his case. <em>Vargas-Hernandez v. Gonzales, </em>497 F.3d 919, 926-27 (9th Cir.2007); <em>cf. Baires v. INS, </em>856 F.2d 89, 92-93 (9th Cir.1988). Moreover, Alas has not established that the IJ\u2019s conduct may have affected the outcome of his proceedings. <em>See Baballah v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1067, 1075 n. 8 (9th Cir.2004) (requiring a showing of prejudice to prevail on a due process challenge).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b491-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
