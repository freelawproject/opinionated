At sentencing, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rejected Willis\u2019s position that her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>base offense level should be 6 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2E1.2(a)(l). Rather, finding that the seized currency ($100,950) was the proceeds of marijuana sales, the court converted the currency into 36.6 kilograms of marijuana to arrive at a base offense level of 18. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2E1.2(a)(2) (use offense level applicable to underlying unlawful activity in respect to which travel was undertaken), \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3), (c)(ll). The court then sentenced Willis to 41 months in prison. She appeals, arguing that the district court\u2019s findings of fact for an upward adjustment under section 2E1.2(a)(2) were clearly erroneous because insufficient evidence existed of any underlying offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that the seized currency represented the proceeds of marijuana distribution for purposes of applying section 2E1.2(a)(2). Likewise, we see no clear error in the court\u2019s conversion of the currency into a drug quantity. <em>See United States v. King, </em>518 F.3d 571, 575 (8th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b452-5\">.
