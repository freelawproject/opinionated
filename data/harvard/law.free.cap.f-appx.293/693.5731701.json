Alderman, a Georgia death row inmate, appeals the dismissal of his claim, brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, challenging Georgia\u2019s three-drug lethal injection method.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court dismissed Alderman\u2019s complaint because it held that the claim was time-barred and the lethal injection protocol was substantially similar to the one upheld by the Supreme Court in <em>Baze v. Rees,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 1520, 170 L.Ed.2d 420 (2008) (plurality opinion). We do not address Alderman\u2019s substantive arguments because we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claim under the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-15\">Actions brought under \u00a7 1983 are subject to the statute of limitations governing personal injury actions in the state \"where the claim has been brought. <em>McNair v. Allen, </em>515 F.3d 1168, 1173 (11th Cir.2008). Alderman brought his claim in Georgia, with a governing limitations period of two years. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-3-33 (1964); <em>Crowe v. Donald, </em>528 F.3d 1290, 1292 (11th Cir. 2008). \u201c[A] method of execution claim accrues on the later of the date on which state review is complete, or the date on which the capital litigant becomes subject to a new or substantially changed execution protocol.\u201d <em>McNair, </em>515 F.3d at 1174. Alderman conceded in oral argument before this panel that, pursuant to McNair, his claim is time-barred because it accrued in October 2001 when the Georgia General Assembly adopted lethal injection as Georgia\u2019s method of execution of death sentences. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-10-38 (2000); <em>Dawson v. State, </em>274 Ga. 327, 554 S.E.2d 137, 143-44 (2001) (holding execution of death sentences by electrocution violates the Georgia constitution); <em>see also Crowe, </em>528 F.3d at 1292 (denying motion to stay execution because plaintiff did not timely file challenge to Georgia\u2019s lethal injection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>protocol).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Thus, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b720-11\">. In 1975, Alderman was sentenced to death by electrocution for the first-degree murder of his wife. His conviction became final on direct review in 1985. <em>Alderman v. Georgia, </em>474 U.S. 911, 106 S.Ct. 282, 88 L.Ed.2d 245 (1985). Details of Alderman\u2019s crime and the winding procedural history spanning the 33 years since his conviction are contained in our opinion affirming the district court\u2019s denial of Alderman\u2019s petition for federal habeas relief. <em>See Alderman v. Terry, </em>468 F.3d 775 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 67, 169 L.Ed.2d 17 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b721-16\">. Alderman also conceded that the district court did not err by denying Alderman\u2019s request to equitably toll the statute of limitations. We agree with the district court that Alderman did not provide sufficient reason for equitable tolling based on his argument that he could not have brought his complaint until after the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Hill v. McDonough, </em>547 U.S. 573, 126 S.Ct. 2096, 165 L.Ed.2d 44 (2006). <em>Crowe, </em>528 F.3d at 1293-94; <em>Grayson v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.2007); <em>Jones v. Allen, </em>485 F.3d 635, 640 (11th Cir.2007). Nothing precluded Alderman from filing a \u00a7 1983 action prior to the decision in <em>Hill </em>and, even if Alderman had been required to wait until the <em>Hill </em>decision, he delayed filing until ten months after <em>Hill </em>was issued. <em>Id. </em>Alderman's argument that it is inequitable to apply <em>McNair </em>retroactively is equally unavailing because \"judicial decisions presumptively apply retroactively to all pending cases.\" <em>Foster v. Bd. of School Comm\u2019rs, </em>872 F.2d 1563, 1566 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
