Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 545\u201447, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The magistrate judge\u2019s orders denying Cain\u2019s motions for a stay and for sanctions are neither final orders nor appealable interlocutory or collateral orders. Accordingly, we dismiss Cain\u2019s appeal from those orders for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In addition, this court may only exercise jurisdiction over the judgments or issues that are specifically referred to or impliedly intended for appeal, as designated in the notice of appeal. <em>Foster v. Tandy Corp., </em>848 F.2d 184 (4th Cir.1987); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.App.P. 3(a)(1). Cain\u2019s only notice of appeal\u2014filed before the entry of the district court\u2019s order denying him leave to proceed in forma pauperis\u2014specifically states that he is appealing from the magistrate judge\u2019s April 25, 2008 order denying his motion for a stay. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal from the May 14, 2008 order denying leave to proceed in forma pauperis for lack of jurisdiction as well. We note that this rationale also independently supports dismissal of the appeal from the order denying sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Finally, we deny Cain\u2019s motion filed in this court to proceed in forma pauperis. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
