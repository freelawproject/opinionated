Kluge (\u201cKluge\u201d) appeals from a final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d). The Board affirmed a decision of the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) denying petitioner\u2019s application for disability retirement benefits under the Federal Employees Retirement System (\u201cFERS\u201d). Because we are barred from reviewing the Board\u2019s factual findings on disability, we <em>affinn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">Kluge was a grade PS-5 City Carrier for the United States Postal Service in Houston, Texas. Kluge applied to OPM for disability retirement on July 27, 2006. In his application, Kluge stated that he had become disabled due to heart problems, bleeding ulcers, emphysema, Reiter\u2019s syndrome (arthritis, conjunctivitis, and urethritis), migraines, stomach and colon problems, uncontrollable diarrhea, depression, bipolar disorder, panic attacks, and psychiatric problems. Apparently while Kluge\u2019s disability retirement application was pending, the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) found that he had become disabled under its rules as of September 1, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-15\">OPM disallowed Kluge\u2019s disability retirement application on October 24, 2006. After reconsideration at Kluge\u2019s request, OPM affirmed the disallowance on March 14, 2007. Kluge then appealed to the Board and did not request a hearing. The Administrative Judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) affirmed OPM\u2019s reconsideration decision on August 7, 2007, finding that the medical evidence provided by Kluge did not demonstrate that he was entitled to receive FERS disability retirement benefits. <em>Kluge v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>No. DA-844E070325-1-1 (M.S.P.B. Aug.7, 2007) (\u201cInitial Decision\u201d), at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-16\">Kluge petitioned the full Board for review of the AJ\u2019s decision, arguing, inter alia, that the AJ had erred in not considering the SSA\u2019s determination that Kluge was disabled. On September 24, 2007, the full Board ordered Kluge to file several documents related to his SSA disability benefits. On January 31, 2008, the full Board denied Kluge\u2019s petition for review, making the initial decision of the AJ final. <em>Kluge v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>107 M.S.P.R. 693 (2008) (\u201cFinal Order\u201d). The full Board noted in a footnote that, although it was unclear whether the AJ had considered Kluge\u2019s SSA benefit evidence, the full Board had considered it on review. Board member Sapin dissented, stating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>that Kluge\u2019s medical, subjective, and SSA evidence established his entitlement to disability retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Kluge timely appealed to our court, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">In FERS disability retirement benefits cases, the scope of our judicial review is limited by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8847. We cannot review \u201cthe factual underpinnings of physical disability determinations, but may address whether there has been a \u2018substantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some like error \u201cgoing to the heart of the administrative determination.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Anthony v. Office of Pers. Mgmt, </em>58 F.3d 620, 628 (Fed.Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Lindahl v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>470 U.S. 768, 791, 105 S.Ct. 1620, 84 L.Ed.2d 674 (1985) (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">An applicant for FERS disability retirement must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) the applicant completed at least 18 months of creditable civilian service; (2) while employed in a FERS position, the applicant became disabled because of a medical condition, resulting in deficient performance, conduct, or attendance, or if there is no such deficiency, the condition is incompatible with either useful and efficient service or retention in the position; (3) the disabling medical condition is expected to continue for at least one year from the date of the application for disability retirement; (4) accommodation of the disabling medical condition in the position held is unreasonable; and (5) the applicant has not declined an offer of reassignment to a vacant position. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.56(a)(2); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 844.103(a). Evidence usually must describe how a medical condition affects an applicant\u2019s ability to perform specific job requirements, unless \u201cthe position description and the medical evidence unambiguously and without contradiction indicate that the appellant cannot perform the duties of the position.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>96 M.S.P.R. 299, <em>\u00b6 </em>17 (M.S.P.B.2004), aff'd, 120 Fed.Appx. 320 (Fed.Cir.2005); <em>see also Mullins-Howard v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>71 M.S.P.R. 619, 627 (M.S.P.B.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">Kluge asserts that the Board reached an incorrect result and accorded his evidence insufficient weight. \u201c[W]e may only address the critical legal errors, if any, committed by the MSPB in reviewing OPM\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Vanieken-Ryals v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>508 F.3d 1034, 1038 (Fed.Cir.2007). Kluge \u201cdoes not assert that the Board\u2019s disability findings implicated any procedural, legal, or other fundamental error.\u201d <em>Anthony </em>at 626. We do not have authority to review the Board\u2019s factual findings. Accordingly, the decision of the Board is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
