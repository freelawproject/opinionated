Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), has occurred?</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">On October 7, 1993, Officer Kevin Turner of the Baltimore City Police Department received a tip from a confidential informant that a black male dressed in a black hat, a black, purple and green sweatsuit, black pants, and Fila tennis shoes was selling drugs in the area of Fayette and Monroe streets in Baltimore City. This informant was registered with the Police Department and had supplied reliable information in the past. Officer Turner, in plain clothes, responded to Fayette and Monroe streets and began conducting covert surveillance of the area from his unmarked vehicle. While there, he observed several persons approach a juvenile, later identified as Tyrice Hawkins, and give him cash. Hawkins, in turn, gave this money to a man, who fit the description given to Turner by the informant. Turner then observed Hawkins walk across <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>the street, retrieve glass vials of a white substance from an alley, and give the vials to the persons who had given him money.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">After observing two or three such transactions take place, Turner went to the police station and returned approximately five minutes later with two uniformed officers. Hawkins and appellant (the man earlier observed by Turner) were placed under arrest. The police found one hundred and fifty five dollars in appellant\u2019s possession. A brown bag containing twelve vials of cocaine was recovered from the alley. Appellant was charged with use of a minor to distribute cocaine, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, possession of cocaine, conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute, and conspiracy to possess cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Prior to trial, appellant\u2019s attorney moved to suppress the money that was recovered from appellant. Defense counsel also requested that the identity of the confidential informant be disclosed, invoking the exception to the non-disclosure privilege which permits release of the informant\u2019s identity when the identity of the suspect is at issue. Appellant\u2019s attorney argued to the court that although appellant was wearing clothing similar to that described by the informant, he was not the individual who the informant saw selling drugs. The trial court refused to permit disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity and denied appellant\u2019s motion. Appellant was convicted by a Baltimore City jury (Ross, J., presiding) on all charges and was sentenced to fourteen years imprisonment. In this appeal, appellant presents the following three questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">I. Did the trial court err in refusing to hold an <em>in camera </em>hearing on the. issue of whether to order disclosure of the confidential informant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">II. Did the trial court err in ruling that- <em>Batson </em>was violated by defense counsel when striking five white persons from the jury panel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>III. Did the trial court err in reseating the stricken jurors?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">I. Disclosure of Informant\u2019s Identity</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Appellant argues first that the trial court erred in refusing to permit disclosure of the confidential informant\u2019s identity and refusing to at least hold an <em>in camera </em>hearing on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Roviaro v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957), the Court of Appeals has adopted a balancing test for determining whether disclosure of an informant\u2019s identity is warranted in a particular case. <em>Warrick v. State, </em>326 Md. 696, 699-700, 607 A.2d 24 (1992). This test balances the State\u2019s interest in maintaining the anonymity of its informers against the due process and confrontation rights of the accused. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">As the Supreme Court has instructed, in applying this test, the trial court must look to \u201cthe particular circumstances of each case, taking into consideration the crime charged, the possible defenses, the possible significance of the informer\u2019s testimony, and other relevant factors.\u201d <em>Roviaro, </em>353 U.S. at 62, 77 S.Ct. at 628. A \u201ckey element\u201d is \u201cthe materiality of the informer\u2019s testimony to the determination of the accused\u2019s guilt or innocence.... \u201d <em>Warrick, </em>326 Md. at 701, 607 A.2d 24. Stated differently, disclosure of an informant\u2019s identity may be permitted \u201cwhenever the informer was an <em>integral pavt </em>of the illegal transaction.\u201d <em>McCoy v. State, </em>216 Md. 332, 337, 140 A.2d 689, <em>cert. denied, McCoy v. Pepersack, </em>358 U.S. 853, 79 S.Ct. 82, 3 L.Ed.2d 87 (1958) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">It has been held, for instance, that an informant\u2019s identity should be disclosed when the informant introduced the police to the suspect, was present during a drug buy, or otherwise played an active role in the transaction. <em>See Roviaro, </em>353 U.S. at 64-65, 77 S.Ct. at 629-30 (informant participated in undercover buy); <em>Warrick, </em>326 Md. at 705-06, 607 A.2d 24 (informant introduced undercover police officer to drug dealer); <em>Brooks v. State, </em>320 Md. 516, 519, 578 A.2d 783 (1990) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>(informant introduced seller of cocaine to officers and was present during entire transaction). In these instances, the informant\u2019s ability to identify the suspect \u201cmay be relevant and helpful to the defense or essential to a fair determination of the case.\u201d <em>Warrick, </em>326 Md. at 706, 607 A.2d 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The Court of Appeals has cautioned, however, that the particular role played by the informant in apprehending the defendant is not necessarily dispositive of whether or not the privilege of non-disclosure applies. <em>Gibson v. State, </em>331 Md. 16, 23, 626 A.2d 44 (1993); <em>Brooks, </em>320 Md. at 525, 578 A.2d 783 (holding that \u201ctrial courts must apply the <em>Roviaro </em>balancing test in each case, regardless of the labels attached to the informer\u2019s role\u201d). On the other hand, there are some \u201cmore rudimentary\u201d cases where the informant\u2019s testimony clearly has such limited relevance that disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity would be of no appreciable help to the defendant and would be outweighed by the State\u2019s interest in maintaining the confidentiality of its informants.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">In <em>Brooks, </em>320 Md. at 525, 578 A.2d 783, the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">Clearly, the practical application of the balancing test is more rudimentary in some cases. For example, we recognize that the privilege ordinarily applies where the informer is a mere \u2018tipster,\u2019 who supplies a lead to law enforcement officers but is not present at the crime, while disclosure is usually required when the informer is a participant in the actual crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">This case presents the classic example of the informant as a mere \u201ctipster.\u201d Officer Turner received a telephone call from the informant notifying him that someone wearing a black hat, a black, purple, and green sweatsuit, black pants, and Fila tennis shoes was selling drugs in a specified area. Turner responded to the scene within one-half hour and saw an individual matching this description selling drugs. The informant did not accompany Turner to the scene and did not witness the drug sales; he was, therefore, a mere \u201ctipster.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Moreover, whether the informant identified appellant as the individual he had seen earlier selling drugs in the same area is irrelevant; the fact remains that Officer Turner himself witnessed appellant doing so. We agree with the trial court\u2019s rationale in refusing to permit disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">I think the record before this Court is abundantly clear that the issue raised by the Defendant is whether or not the person arrested is the person whom the witnesses saw on the day the offense was committed and the informant was not there. The informant is not an eyewitness to anything on the day of the crime. So that the fact finder in this case, with respect to anything\u2014and even if we assume, even if we assume for the purposes of the Court\u2019s ruling on this issue that the informant informed on a totally different person, it is not this Defendant that he informed on[,] [i]t is irrelevant because the testimony is that the Defendant was seen committing the crime and the person who saw the crime committed arrested him on the same day. The fact that the informant may have had someone else in mind would be a red herring in the factual context we have in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Still, appellant maintains that the record is unclear as to exactly what role the informant played in the transaction and that an <em>in camera </em>hearing on the matter should have been held. Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertions, however, there was clearly testimony at the suppression hearing clearly revealed that the informant\u2019s involvement in apprehending appellant was limited to the telephone call he or she made to Officer Turner.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">Q Officer Turner, at the time you were there making your observations, was your Cl present on that particular block?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am7\">A No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-8\">Q And you received that information from the Cl, were you on the phone with him or back at the station or\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At6\">A In my office on the telephone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-9\">Q Back at Western District?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-10\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Q Did he accompany you at all back to that scene?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">A No, sir.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">We hold, therefore, that the trial court properly refused to permit disclosure of the informant\u2019s identity. The relevance of his or her testimony is clearly limited under the facts of this case and is far outweighed by the State\u2019s interest in maintaining the anonymity of its informant. As the Supreme Court has noted, the privilege afforded the State in not disclosing its informants is particularly important \u201cin the enforcement of ... narcotics laws, [since] it is all but impossible to obtain evidence for prosecution save by the use of decoys. There are rarely complaining witnesses.\u201d <em>Lewis v. United States, </em>385 U.S. 206, 210-211 n. 6, 87 S.Ct. 424, 427 n. 6, 17 L.Ed.2d 312 (1966) , <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>386 U.S. 939, 87 S.Ct. 951, 17 L.Ed.2d 811 (1967) (quoting Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.10, cmt., p. 16 (Tent. Draft No. 9, 1959)).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">II. Jury Selection</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">During jury selection, appellant\u2019s attorney exercised four peremptory strikes of white jurors. The State objected on the basis that the strikes were discriminatory and violated the principles set forth in <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). In response to the court\u2019s request for the reasons why he struck the jurors, appellant\u2019s attorney explained that he did so because of the area in which the prospective jurors resided, and not because they were white. He explained that, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that they will be able to relate to my client and his environment.\u201d The court accepted counsel\u2019s explanation and jury selection continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">After twelve jurors and two alternates were selected, the State renewed its <em>Batson </em>challenge to the four peremptory strikes exercised by appellant\u2019s attorney, as well as a fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>strike of another white juror. The State argued that the five white jurors stricken by appellant were from the same geographical location as black members of the jury panel who <em>were </em>accepted by him. The trial judge agreed, noting that he \u201cwas stretching it before [in overruling the <em>Batson </em>challenge] in spite of the warning and the closeness of it.... \u201d The trial judge commented that, \u201cif I would permit this to go on, we would totally undercut <em>[Batson </em>]....\u201d The court did, however, permit appellant\u2019s attorney to repeat his reasons for striking the five white jurors. The following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">THE COURT: I want you to address each one of them\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Let\u2019s go through.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">THE COURT: \u2014each one of them separately and I want you to make your record and say everything you want to about them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. Where are we?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-9\">THE COURT: We are starting at the top of the list. 009, Ms. Hall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: 009, I explained Tonesa Hall, Vancouver Road is an area\u2014I am not familiar with it. It places itself in zone 29. Was not struck because the person was white, was struck because of age as well. The age, that age is not close to my client\u2019s age, what I consider the age, and the location of this person, I don\u2019t believe the person will connect with my client and will be, as I see it, a peer. I struck the person for those reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-11\">THE COURT: Number 10.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Number 10, George Athas who is a broker. I don\u2019t think a person who is a broker is going to connect with my client and from the area in which he lives, I chose to strike him for that reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-13\">THE COURT: Number 16.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Number 16 is a 35 year-old from zone 18. She\u2019s a customer service rep, a person again who I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>don\u2019t believe is going to connect with my client or his \u2022witnesses who will testify. ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">THE COURT: Number 49....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes. Number 49 was James Rineheart who is an accountant in zone 11 on Buena Vista Avenue. Based on my knowledge of the area, it is an area where they would not have the same type of problems that my client would encounter day to day and in his life would not connect with him. I don\u2019t believe someone who is an accountant by experience would connect with him as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzP\">THE COURT: Number 55.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: 55. John Carra who is a scientist. Again, Gilman Terrace, zone 11, which is an area that is a little\u2014much more affluent than the area in which my client resides and who is a person\u2014is a scientist. Look at things, in my belief, scientifically and I believe will then tend to believe the police officers merely because they\u2019re policemen. I believe those are the strikes, Judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">The trial court found that the reasons given by defense counsel were \u201cpure simple subterfuge\u201d and that the real reason the jurors were stricken was solely because of their race. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-10\">After reviewing the characteristics of the African/American members of the jury, and other members of the jury who have passed muster in this Defendant\u2019s eye, I do not find the explanations given to be justified and I again find it\u2019s a subterfuge and that the real reason those persons were struck was solely because of their race and, therefore, we will re-seat, we will re-seat all of them and then we will proceed from there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">The court invalidated each of appellant\u2019s peremptory strikes and reinstated the five white jurors to the jury panel. The court further ruled that during the re-selection process, appellant would not be permitted to strike 'any of the previously stricken jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Appellant claims that the trial court erred in three respects during the selection of the jury. He argues that the court erred in the first instance by failing to recognize that <em>Batson </em>does not apply to the discriminatory removal of white persons from a jury panel. Second, appellant contends that he offered adequate, race-neutral reasons for striking the five white jurors. Finally, he argues that the court erred in reinstating the five jurors on the panel rather than striking the entire venire.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">A. Applicability Of <em>Batson </em>To White Persons</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Despite appellant\u2019s assertions to the contrary, Maryland has now joined those jurisdictions that hold that the Fourteenth Amendment is violated when a white person is struck from a jury panel solely on the basis of his or her race. <em>Gilchrist v. State, </em>97 Md.App. 55, 75-76, 627 A.2d 44, <em>cert. granted, </em>332 Md. 741, 633 A.2d 102 (1993); <em>Brashear v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 709, 715, 603 A.2d 901, <em>cert. denied, </em>327 Md. 523, 610 A.2d 796 (1992). <em>See also Brogden v. State, </em>102 Md.App. 423, 431-32, 649 A.2d 1196 (1994). As we noted in <em>Gilchrist, Batson </em>\u201capplies with equal force to the exercise of peremptory challenges in a manner discriminatory to blacks or whites.\u201d 97 Md.App. at 75-76, 627 A.2d 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">B. The Striking of Juror Numbers 9, 10, 16, 49, and 55</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Appellant next challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling that juror numbers 9, 10, 16, 49, and 55 were struck by appellant solely because of their race.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">The record reveals that appellant\u2019s attorney struck juror number 9 because she was from an area that he was not familiar with and because her age, 45, was not close to appellant\u2019s. He explained to the court that he did not believe juror number 9 \u201cwill connect with my client and will be, as I see it, a peer.\u201d Juror number 10 was also struck, according to appellant\u2019s attorney, because of the area in which he lived. Appellant\u2019s attorney explained that he did not believe that a broker would be able to identify with appellant. Juror number 16 was thirty-five years old and was employed as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>customer service representative. She was struck because appellant\u2019s attorney did not believe she \u201cis going to connect with my client or his witnesses who will testify.\u201d Juror number 49 was an accountant and lived in an area \u201cwhere they would not have the same type of problems that my client would encounter day to day and in his life would not connect with him. Lastly, juror number 55 was struck because he was a scientist and lived in a \u201cmuch more affluent\u201d area than that in which appellant lived. Defense counsel stated further that a scientist, he believed, would \u201ctend to believe the police officers merely because they\u2019re policemen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s ruling on these strikes, we are mindful of our limited role in this regard. We \u201cdo not presume to second-guess the call by the \u2018umpire on the field\u2019 either by way of <em>de novo </em>fact finding or by way of independent constitutional judgment.\u201d <em>Bailey v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 323, 328, 579 A.2d 774, <em>cert. denied, </em>321 Md. 225, 582 A.2d 531 (1990). Instead, we must determine only if the trial court was clearly erroneous in its ruling. <em>Id. </em>at 329, 579 A.2d 774; <em>Aiken v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 557, 563, 647 A.2d 1229 (1994). In <em>Bailey, </em>we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">It is the trial judge who is in close touch with the racial mood, be it harmonious or be it tense, of the local community, either as a general proposition or with respect to a given trial of high local interest. The trial judge is positioned to observe the racial composition of the venire panel as a whole, a vital fact frequently not committed to the record and, therefore, unknowable to the reviewing court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-7\"><em>Id., </em>84 Md.App. at 328, 579 A.2d 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">In our view, the circumstances surrounding the exercise of peremptory strikes by defense counsel clearly support the trial court\u2019s finding that <em>Batson </em>was violated. The reasons advanced by counsel, namely, the location of the jurors\u2019 residences, were, we find, merely a pretext for excluding white jurors from the panel on the basis of their race. Appellant\u2019s attorney, for example, did not strike juror number 44, an insurance underwriter, or juror number 32, a clerk, both of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>whom lived in the same zone as juror number 9, who was struck by appellant\u2019s attorney on the basis of where she lived. Moreover, while juror number 9 was struck on the basis of her age, jurors 32 and 44 were not, despite the fact that they also were several years older than appellant. Appellant\u2019s failure to strike \u201csimilarly situated\u201d jurors supports the trial court\u2019s ruling that the race-neutral reasons advanced by him for striking the five jurors were pretextual in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Also, we find it significant that counsel for appellant voiced to the court the fact that he disagreed with the principles set forth in <em>Batson. </em>At trial, the following ensued between the defense counsel and the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">THE COURT: ... [I]f I would permit this to go on, we would totally undercut the Batson law as the Supreme Court of the United States\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I don\u2019t agree with the law. I absolutely don\u2019t agree with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-8\">THE COURT: I understand it though.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I think the Defendant has the right to have a jury of his peers. [I] [t]hink it\u2019s ridiculous. When I represent my client I try to select individuals who are going to be close to his peers, understands his situation as close as possible. I try to narrow that as well as I can knowing areas that I\u2019m familiar with and my client is familiar with. If that is something that the courts find to be incorrect, then the Court will have to strike every panel that I\u2019m part of because I proceed in this fashion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">This exchange apparently indicated to the trial court, and indicates to us as well, that defense counsel not only entertained doubts as to the correctness of the <em>Batson </em>decision, but also that he had at least a propensity to flout the principles set forth in that case. In <em>Bailey, </em>84 Md.App. at 328-29, 579 A.2d 774, we explained the relevance of counsel\u2019s demeanor during the jury selection process and the importance of respecting the trial court\u2019s ability to observe that demeanor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-11\">The trial judge is able to get the \u2018feel\u2019 of the opposing advocates\u2014to watch their demeanor, to hear their intona<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>tions, and to spot their frequently unspoken purposes. It is a total process in which nonverbal communication may often be far more revealing than the formal words on the typewritten page.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">We hold, therefore, that the trial court was not clearly erroneous in sustaining the State\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge to the striking of juror numbers 9, 10, 16, 49, and 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">C. Proper Remedy When <em>Batson </em>Violation Occurs</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">We next address appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in reseating the five jurors after finding that defense counsel had violated <em>Batson. </em>Appellant claims that the court should have struck the entire venire instead and begun the jury selection process anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">The issue of what action should be taken by a trial court when a <em>Batson </em>violation has occurred is one of first impression in this State. The Supreme Court has provided us with no guidance in this regard. Indeed, the Court acknowledged in <em>Batson </em>that it was leaving this issue for another day:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-9\">In light of the variety of jury selection practices followed in our state and federal trial courts, we make no attempt to instruct these courts how best to implement our holding today. For the same reason, we express no view on whether it is more appropriate in a particular case, upon a finding of discrimination against black jurors, for the trial court to discharge the venire and select a new jury from a panel not previously associated with the case, or to disallow the discriminatory challenges and resume selection with the improperly challenged jurors reinstated on the venire.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">476 U.S. at 99, n. 24, 106 S.Ct. at 1725, n. 24 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">The appellate courts in other states appear to be genuinely split on this issue. Several states favor striking the entire panel upon a finding of purposeful discrimination. These states include: California (see <em>People v. Wheeler, </em>22 Cal.3d 258, 148 Cal.Rptr. 890, 583 P.2d 748 (1978); <em>People v. Smith, </em>21 Cal.App.4th 342, 25 Cal.Rptr.2d 850 (1993)); Florida (see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number><em>State v.

State, </em>539 N.E.2d 464, 466 (Ind.1989) (implying that remedy is to strike entire jury by holding that trial court erred when it failed to grant mistrial upon prosecutor\u2019s <em>Batson </em>violation)); and North Carolina <em>(see State v. McCollum, </em>334 N.C. 208, 433 S.E.2d 144, 159 (1993), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>112 N.C.App. 390, 436 S.E.2d 163, <em>rev. denied, </em>335 N.C. 561, 441 S.E.2d 124, <em>aff'd, </em>339 N.C. 606, 453 S.E.2d 165 (holding that the fairer approach is to dismiss the entire panel and begin jury selection anew because \u201c[t]o ask jurors who have been improperly excluded from a jury because of their race to then return to the jury to remain unaffected by that recent discrimination, and to render an impartial verdict without prejudice toward either the State or the defendant, would be to ask them to discharge a duty which would require near superhuman effort and which would be extremely difficult for a person possessed of any sensitivity whatsoever to carry out successfully\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Other states permit a trial judge to reseat the improperly stricken juror and continue jury selection. These states include: Georgia <em>(see Ellerbee v. State, </em>215 Ga.App. 312, 450 S.E.2d 443, 448 (1994)), <em>recons. denied, </em>\u2014 S.E.2d \u2014 (Ga.1994); Mississippi <em>(see Conerly v. State, </em>544 So.2d 1370, 1372 (Miss.1989) (holding that trial court was obligated to seat juror on the jury where prosecutor did not articulate a race neutral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>reason for striking her)); Missouri <em>(see State v. Grim, </em>854 S.W.2d 403, 416 (Mo.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 114 S.Ct. 562, 126 L.Ed.2d 462 (1993) (\u201cproper remedy for discriminatory use of peremptory strikes is to quash the strikes and permit those members of the venire stricken for discriminatory reasons to sit on the jury if they otherwise would\u201d); <em>State v. Shelton, </em>871 S.W.2d 598, 600 (Mo.Ct.App.1994)); and Wisconsin <em>(see State v. Walker, </em>154 Wis.2d 158, 453 N.W.2d 127, 135 n. 12 (Wis.), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 962, 111 S.Ct. 397, 112 L.Ed.2d 406 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"AvF\">The Supreme Court of Missouri, in <em>State v. Parker, </em>836 S.W.2d 930, 936 (Mo.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 113 S.Ct. 636, 121 L.Ed.2d 566 (1992), offered two rationales for reseating improperly stricken jurors. First, quashing the entire venire does not correct the <em>Batson </em>violation because while the parties are able to select from a new venire, the excluded jurors have still been subjected to discrimination. <em>Id. </em>Second, judicial resources are conserved by not having to go through the time and expense of selecting an entirely new venire. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">In Texas, the legislature has enacted a statute that requires trial courts to dismiss the entire jury panel and call a new array when a <em>Batson </em>violation has occurred. Tex.Code Crim. Proc.Ann. art. 35.261 (West 1989). Despite the seemingly unambiguous language of this statute, the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas as well as the Court of Appeals of Texas have held that its terms are not mandatory and that a trial court .in a given case may reinstate a -wrongfully excluded juror. <em>State v. Bowman, </em>885 S.W.2d 421, 424-25 (Tex.Crim.App.), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 115 S.Ct. 184, 130 L.Ed.2d 118 (1993); <em>Sims v. State, </em>768 S.W.2d 863, 864 (Tex.Ct.App.1989), <em>pet. dismissed, </em>792 S.W.2d 81 (Tex.Crim.App.1990) (statute \u201cdoes not require in all cases that a new array be called, but that the trial judge has the discretion to apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>either remedy\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">In New York, the appellate courts have held that the proper remedy when a juror is struck in violation of <em>Batson </em>\u201cdepend[s] upon the point in the proceedings when the issue is raised and the action taken in response thereto.\u201d <em>People v. Irizarry, </em>165 A.D.2d 715, 560 N.Y.S.2d 279, 281 (1990). Where an objection to peremptory strikes is raised at an early stage in the selection of the jury, the appropriate remedy is to recall and reseat the stricken juror. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">There are also federal court decisions indicating that an appropriate remedy upon a <em>Batson </em>violation is to reseat the stricken juror. <em>See United States v. Forbes, </em>816 F.2d 1006, 1011 (5th Cir.1987); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>421 F.Supp. 467, 474 (D.Conn.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">As mentioned, Maryland\u2019s appellate courts have not broached this important subject. In <em>Stanley v. State, </em>313 Md. 50, 62-63 n. 8, 542 A.2d 1267 (1988), the Court of Appeals declined to address the issue, but noted that \u201c[wjhich remedy to apply may well be within the discretion of the trial court, depending on the circumstances of the particular case.\u201d We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>agree that the proper approach is to permit the trial court to determine, in its discretion, whether a wrongfully excluded juror should be stricken altogether from the venire or should be reseated. The guiding factor in this determination should be the likelihood of the juror harboring any prejudice to the violating party as a result of being improperly excluded from the panel. For example, when a <em>Batson </em>challenge is made in the jury\u2019s presence and the violating party offers his nondiscriminatory reason for striking the juror in front of that juror, there is the risk that the juror will bear animosity toward the party who exercised the strike. When, on the other hand, counsel explains his reasons for striking a particular juror at a bench conference, and the circumstances otherwise do not indicate to the juror that he was struck for improper reasons, the likelihood of prejudice is not present or is minimal. The potential for prejudice is important, of course, because at risk are the rights of the parties to a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In the instant case, appellant\u2019s attorney explained his reasons for exercising his peremptory strikes during a bench conference, and assumedly out of the ear shot of the jury. There is, as a result, no reason to believe that the jurors were aware of the reasons forwarded by him and no reason to believe they harbored any prejudice towards him as a result. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court did not err in reseating juror numbers 9, 10, 16, 49, and 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Our holding, we believe, is consistent with the principles underlying <em>Batson, </em>and is grounded in both pragmatic and principled concerns. If, for instance, we were to require that an entirely new venire be called every time there is a <em>Batson </em>violation, this would unfairly reward counsel for his improper conduct and give him' exactly what he wanted, namely, a different jury panel. The party who has gone too far should not, as a matter of principle, be allowed to wipe the slate clean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>and start anew.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, there is the practical realization that, if we were to require the trial court to strike the entire panel in every case of discrimination, then there might be those parties who would purposefully discriminate in exercising strikes for the sole purpose of getting a new panel.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the words of one commentator:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">[I]n some situations, the remedy [of discharging the entire panel] might give the prosecutor [or defense] a broader <em>de facto </em>peremptory challenge than any provided by law. A prosecutor or [defense attorney] dissatisfied with an initial panel of prospective jurors\u2014perhaps because this panel contained an unusual number of minorities\u2014might seek to reduce the presence of minorities through the exercise of peremptory strikes. Were these strikes upheld, the prosecutor [or defense attorney] would gain a victory; and were they declared unlawful and the jury selection process begun anew, the prosecutor might regard this defeat as a great victory still.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">The prosecutor [or defense attorney] would have gained not only the exclusion of the prospective jurors whom he or she wrongfully challenged but also the exclusion of all other members of the p\u00e1nel. The prosecutor [or defense attorney] would in effect have been afforded a power to strike the entire panel peremptorily.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Albert W. Alschuler, <em>The Supreme Court and the Jury: Voir Dire, Peremptory Challenges, and the Review of Jury Verdicts, </em>56 U.Chi.L.Rev. 153, 178 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Also, it should not be forgotten that the exclusion of a juror on the basis of race is a violation of the juror\u2019s constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>rights. While a prospective juror does not have a right to sit on a particular jury, he or she does have a constitutional right under the Equal Protection Clause not to be excluded from serving on a jury on the basis of his or her race. <em>Powers v. Ohio, </em>499 U.S. 400, 409, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 1369, 113 L.Ed.2d 411 (1991) (White, J., concurring); <em>Holland v. Illinois, </em>493 U.S. 474, 488, 110 S.Ct. 803, 811, 107 L.Ed.2d 905 (1990). Requiring discharge of the juror in every instance would not only reward the party who has violated the Constitution but would serve to punish the juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The harm inflicted by a <em>Batson </em>violation is not \u2018only upon the stricken juror but also upon the community as a whole. The Supreme Court has stated that when \u201ca court allows jurors to be excluded because of group bias, it is a willing participant in a scheme that could only undermine the very foundation of our system of justice\u2014our citizens\u2019 confidence in it.\u201d <em>Georgia v. McCollum, </em>505 U.S. 42, 49, 112 S.Ct. 2348, 2354, 120 L.Ed.2d 33 (1992). The Court similarly remarked in <em>Powers, </em>499 U.S. at 407, 111 S.Ct. at 1369:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">Jury service preserves the democratic element of the law, as it guards the rights of the parties and ensures continued acceptance of the laws by all of the people. It \u2018affords ordinary citizens a valuable opportunity to participate in a process of government, an experience fostering, one hopes, a respect for the law.\u2019 Indeed, with the exception of voting, for most citizens the honor and privilege of jury duty is their most significant opportunity to participate in the democratic process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">(quoting <em>Duncan v. Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 187, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 1469, 20 L.Ed.2d 491, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>392 U.S. 947, 88 S.Ct. 2270, 20 L.Ed.2d 1412 (1968) (Harlan, J., dissenting) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Stated differently, \u201cthe purpose of a <em>Batson </em>challenge is not to replace an entire panel, which would effectively deny the wrongly struck jurors their opportunity to serve, but to quash only the prejudice or wrongful strike.\u201d <em>Christensen v. State, </em>875 S.W.2d 576, 579 (Mo.Ct.App.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Lastly, we note that concerns for judicial economy support reseating the stricken juror. Starting the jury selection process over every time there is a <em>Batson </em>violation would be both burdensome and costly. The remedy of reseating the juror is a sensible, efficacious way of protecting both the rights of prospective jurors and the parties in the case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b286-12\">. This testimony was elicited by the State during re-direct examination of Officer Turner. We question the sincerity of appellant\u2019s request for an <em>in camera </em>hearing in light of the fact that defense counsel had every opportunity at the suppression hearing to question Officer Turner regarding the extent of the informant\u2019s participation in the arrest, but failed to make any effort to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b293-8\">. It is interesting that in both California and Florida, lower appellate courts have questioned the wisdom of the highest court in holding that the entire venire panel should be stricken upon a <em>Batson </em>violation. <em>See Carter, </em>550 So.2d at 1131, n. 1 (\u201cWe believe that a trial court should have the discretion to cure a discriminatory challenge by means other than dismissal of the entire panel. However, this court and the trial courts are bound by the clear language of <em>Neil, </em>absent directions otherwise from the Florida supreme court\u201d); <em>Smith, </em>21 Cal.App.4th at 346, 25 Cal.Rptr.2d 850 (\u201cThe <em>Wheeler </em>solution allows a prosecutor to push the limit and, if found to have gone too far, to have the slate wiped clean and start over with a new venire. But unless and until the United States Supreme Court mandates a contrary remedy, or the California Supreme Court changes its mind, we have no option but to follow the <em>Wheeler </em>remedy\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\">. Indeed, in a recent case, the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas interpreted the statute as permitting the dismissal of one \"array\u201d of jurors, to which the improperly stricken juror belonged, instead of the entire venire. <em>Butler v. State, </em>872 S.W.2d 227, 233 (Tex.Crim.App.1994), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 115 S.Ct. 1115, 130 L.Ed.2d 1079 (1995). The trial court in that case had employed a voir dire procedure in which it split the venire into several separate, smaller groups or \"mini-panels.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">The Court of Appeals of Texas, however, in a decision by the Tyler Circuit, held that this statute is constitutional and its provisions mandatory, rather than directory. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tunnell, </em>768 S.W.2d 765, 767 (Tex.Ct.App.1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b295-11\">. In addition, various trial courts in New York have issued written opinions approving the remedy of reinstating the improperly stricken juror. <em>Siriano v. Beth Isreal Hosp. Ctr., </em>161 Misc.2d 512, 614 N.Y.S.2d 700, 703 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1994); <em>People v. Moten, </em>159 Misc.2d 269, 603 N.Y.S.2d 940, 946-48 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1993); <em>People v. Piermont, </em>143 Misc.2d 839, 542 N.Y.S.2d 115, 118 (1989) (noting that \u201c[djischarging the whole panel would mean that the time of approximately three dozen jury panel members, two lawyers, one court reporter, several court officers and one judge would have been wasted\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b297-9\">. We also recognize, however, that if the entire venire were struck, this might, under some circumstances, work to penalize the violating party, since the result might be that some of the jurors he did not strike, and very much wanted on the jury, would be dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b297-10\">. Any skepticism of the bar, however, does not go so far as to foresee that counsel might purposefully state the reasons for his or her objection to a particular juror, whether warranted or not, in the jury's presence so that entire panel could be stricken.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b299-11\">. Our holding does not mean, however, that if a trial court does strike an entire venire panel and begin jury selection anew, that the court has committed reversible error. If the trial court chooses such a remedy, then it must still be established that such error caused prejudice to the objecting party. Otherwise, the error is harmless. <em>See Jefferson v. State, </em>595 So.2d 38, 40 (Fla.1992); Aldret <em>v. State, </em>610 So.2d 1386, 1389 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
