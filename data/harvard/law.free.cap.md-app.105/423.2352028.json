Appellant challenges the public nature of the use to which the condemned land will be put and proffers the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">I. Was the Commissioners\u2019 decision to condemn an unconstitutional, unlawful grant of a private remedy for the sole benefit and economic advantage of a single property owner, and not for a public purpose or benefit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-9\">II. Was High Ridge Drive, as originally designed and approved, deliberately designed to terminate within the subdivision\u2019s property and not to extend into the subdivision\u2019s pedestrian-open space area to the boundary of Mr. Green\u2019s property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-10\">III. Was the Commissioners\u2019 decision to condemn unconstitutional due to lack of any necessity to condemn?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">High Ridge Drive runs in an easterly direction through High Ridge Estates and terminates fifteen feet from the common boundary of the subdivision and property now owned by one Aaron Green and his wife, Ruth. The property sought to be condemned is a strip of land fifty feet wide extending from High Ridge Drive fifteen feet to the Greens\u2019 property. This strip now serves as a pedestrian right of way. Condemnation proceedings were instituted pursuant to the Greens\u2019 recent proposal to develop their property with residential lots, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>which, if condemnation were successful, would be situate along the proposed extension of High Ridge Drive that would then run into their property. Notably, several other access points, which terminate at other boundaries of the Greens\u2019 property, are available. Extension of any of these other streets would provide the necessary public road access for the Greens\u2019 proposed development. The Greens\u2019 desire for access by way of High Ridge Drive is seen as having been motivated by financial considerations; the alternative access routes would have been \u201cmore expensive and not as economically practical for ... development of [their] property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">The initiation of condemnation proceedings occurred after, and as a result of, the Greens, through counsel, contacting the County Commissioners by letter on January 25, 1991, suggesting that an \u201capparent error on the record plat [of High Ridge Estates] ... complicated] the plan to extend High Ridge Drive into the Green property,\u201d and that the County might consider exercising its power of eminent domain to resolve the \u201cproblem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The Greens submitted a Concept Plan for development of their property on September 30, 1991, which included the lots proposed to be created on the extension into their property of High Ridge Drive over the parcel suggested to be condemned. A Special Report to the Carroll County Planning and Zoning Commission, prepared by Brace Waldron, recommended acceptance of the concept Plan, conditioned upon the Greens\u2019 ability to \u201cgain in-fee access to High Ridge Drive or demonstrate the ability to build a County road across the fifteen-feet-wide Homeowners Association strip to High Ridge Drive.\u201d The Report also stated the following with respect to High Ridge Estates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">The approved Preliminary Plan of High Ridge Estates shows, by the absence of a permanent cul-de-sac, that the roads were intended to provide access for future development into adjacent properties. These temporary cul-desacs were meant to be removed as the roads were extended. The approved Preliminary Plan of High Ridge <em>shows a separate parcel over the old road and right-of-way that ran </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number><em>parallel to the common property line between Aaron Green and the subdivision.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-4\">In accordance with the practice at that time, the existing old right-of-way was placed on a separate parcel to keep it off the proposed lots. During the Final Plans Review of the subdivision, the right-of-way parcel was included with the open space parcel for use as a pedestrian pathway. The open space areas, as well as the fifteen-feet-wide parcel, are now owned by the High Ridge Homeowners Association.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">There was other evidence also presented relating to preexisting rights of ways from which inferences could be made that, in fact, no error (as suggested by the Greens) had occurred. There was apparently a law in effect at the time that the High Ridge plat was recorded that prohibited the platting of a subdivision street over a pre-existing recorded right of way. Because a pre-existing right of way was believed to exist, High Ridge was not permitted to extend High Ridge Drive to the property line. That law apparently was later changed. Thus, appellant contends the termination short of the property line could not have been a mistake because, in the first instance, it was required by statute. At the Planning and Zoning Commission\u2019s November 19, 1991 meeting, the Commission made the following decision after considering Waldron\u2019s Report and arguments made by the Greens\u2019 representative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">Decision:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">The Commission .'.. approves the concept plan as presented and as conditionally recommended.... In taking this action, the Commission on review finds, that the road in question as detailed and approved, on the approved preliminary subdivision plan was clearly laid out to extend to \u00e1nd intersect with the adjoining property line of the Aaron Green property; and further that the final plat prepared for record, deviated from the approved plan and was therefore in error in that it did not reflect what had been intended and approved (the eventual extension of the street into adjoining property).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>The County Commissioners met on February, 27, 1992, and voted \u201cto condemn such property as necessary to implement the Planning and Zoning Commission recommendation with respect to the construction of a street <em>to serve the Aaron Green Subdivision </em>which will intersect with an existing culdesac in High Ridge Subdivision.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Commissioners then quoted the Planning and Zoning Commission\u2019s recommendation and decision in its entirety. Appellant notes that the County Commissioners addressed only the alleged error to which the Planning and Zoning Commission referred: \u201cIt is completely silent as to any statement of public purpose served by condemning [appellant\u2019s property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">On July 27, 1992, the County Commissioners filed a Complaint for condemnation in respect to appellant\u2019s land. On November 17, 1992, the trial court granted appellant\u2019s Motion for Separate Trial of Issues of Law. This allowed for the bifurcation of the Commissioners\u2019 authority to condemn from the remaining issues. Trial was held on December 2, 1992. On December 16, 1993, the trial court found in favor of the County on its right to exercise eminent domain against the subject property. A hearing regarding appellant\u2019s damages was then scheduled. On June 28, 1994, a stipulation of fair market value by the parties was presented to the trial court and judgment in accord therewith was entered.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant filed this timely appeal therefrom. Ultimately, the County Commissioners chose not to participate in the appeal. The Greens were permitted to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The Constitutionality of the Condemnation</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">We answer appellant\u2019s first question in the affirmative and shall reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Carroll County. In light of this decision, we do not address the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>remaining issues or propriety <em>vel non </em>of the County Commissioners\u2019 Election to Abandon and the Greens\u2019 Motion to Intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Maryland Rule U6 states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">A proceeding for condemnation shall be commenced by filing a petition complying with Rules 2-303 through 2-305 as to form and contents and containing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">(4) \"A statement of the purposes for which the property is sought to be condemned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\u201cThe reason for this is plain. Without such a statement courts and litigants would not be able to determine whether a condemnation was proposed for a public purpose.\u201d <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Beard, </em>266 Md. 83, 96, 291 A.2d 636 (1972). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the County provided the following averment in its Complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">4. That the property ... is needed for the proposed future public road....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">While this bald assertion may appear to satisfy technically the requirements of Rule U6, it does not provide a basis upon which meaningful judicial review of the constitutionality of the condemnation proceeding may be conducted. <em>See Beard, </em>266 Md. at 95-96, 291 A.2d 636 (\u201cA legislative body can not make a particular use either public or private merely by so declaring it, for if it could do so the constitutional restraint [imposed by Maryland Constitution, Art. Ill \u00a7 40] would be utterly nugatory.\u201d (citation omitted)). A mere recital that a proposed property is needed for a particular public use is insufficient when dealing with the deprivation of private property rights. Indeed, the County provides no explanation other than the aforementioned allegation to substantiate its conclusory and self-serving declaration of the need for a \u201cproposed future public road.\u201d One is left to wonder whether the use is buttressed by increased traffic flow, changing traffic patterns, and the like. \u201cFor us to hold on such a record that a public use has been established would be to hold, in essence, that a public body may condemn private property for any purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>which suits its convenience.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96, 291 A.2d 636. Despite having a \u201cfull opportunity to spell out the use it propose[d] making of the property <em>and all the details surrounding that use,\u201d id. </em>(emphasis added), the County Commissioners failed to do so. \u201cIn order for a court to perform its judicial function,\u201d the <em>Beard </em>Court stated, <em>\u201cthe [proposed] plan should ... be comprehensive.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). Based on our review of the record, we find no such plan of public use, much less a detailed one. Moreover, we find no evidence to support a finding that <em>any </em>public use could be gleaned from a condemnation of the property at issue. We explain, but first we address the legal standards that apply in respect to condemnation in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The power to exercise eminent domain is indeed an awesome one that must be adequately bridled lest \u201cthe rights of property [be] ... solely dependant upon the will of a legislative body, without restraint.\u201d <em>New Central Coal Co. v. George\u2019s Creek Coal &amp; Iron Co., </em>37 Md. 537, 559 (1873), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>40 Md. 425 (1874). The exercise of eminent domain is predicated upon due process of law. A taking for a use that is not imbued with a public interest \u201cis such a violation of the basic and essential features of constitutional government that it amounts to a taking without due process of law....\u201d 2A Nichols, <em>The Law of Eminent Domain </em>\u00a7 7.01[3] (3d ed. rev. 1990) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In the nascent stages of our nation\u2019s development, uncompensated takings for any use to which the government saw fit to put the property <em>were </em>sanctioned. \u201c[T]he constitutional framers of post-colonial days perceived uncompensated takings as feudal redistributions of private property back to the government, <em>i.e., </em>the king.\u201d <em>Offen v. County Council, </em>96 Md.App. 526, 548 n. 7, 625 A.2d 424 (1993), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part, </em>334 Md. 499, 639 A.2d 1070 (1994). Indeed, \u201c[i]t was not until the introduction of improved methods of transportation operated by private corporations and the general extension of the activities of municipal governments ... that the limits of the power of eminent domain with respect to the purposes for which it could lawfully be exercised\u201d arose. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Nichols, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 7.01. Even then, takings for the benefit of private interests were not expressly prohibited; \u201cit had apparently never occurred to anyone that it might be attempted.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\">After it became ... accepted ... that the courts could not set aside an act of the legislature unless it violated some specific provision of the constitution, ... [t]he theory ... put forward [to justify a refusal to permit a taking for private use] was that the ... \u201ceminent domain\u201d clause[ ], by [negative] implication prohibited the taking of property for uses not public with or without compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-5\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7.01[2].<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The \u201cTakings\u201d Clause first appeared in the Federal Constitution upon the ratification of the Fifth Amendment on December 15, 1791. That clause only permits, provided that due process is afforded, \u201cprivate property [to] be taken <em>for public </em>use.... \u201d (Emphasis added.) U.S. Const, amend V.

Authorities differ, however, as to the precise meaning of \u201cpublic use.\u201d \u201cHowever \u2018public use\u2019 may be defined, for a use to be public it is not necessary that the entire community or any considerable portion of it should enjoy it---- [I]t is enough if the people of a particular locality receive the benefit.\u201d Nichols, <em>supra </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>\u00a7 7.07 (citing <em>Prince George\u2019s County v.

Despite this uncertainty, however, it remains clear that a governmental entity\u2019s ability to condemn property is limited in scope to the nature of the public use supporting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">The exercise of eminent domain must also be grounded upon public necessity. 26 Am.Jur.2d <em>Eminent Domain </em>\u00a7 2 (1966).

Moreover, the public character <em>vel non </em>of the use to which the condemned property will be put is not affected by the fact that, although the public may have a right to use it, it seldom does. <em>Burnopp, </em>300 Md. at 350, 478 A.2d 315. <em>See also </em>26 Am.Jur.2d <em>Eminent Domain </em>\u00a7 46 (1966) (\u201cThe public character of a road does not depend on the degree of public necessity or convenience that requires it, the extent to which the public uses it, or the number of persons that it accommodates.\u201d (footnote omitted)); Nichols, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 7.22[1] (\u201cIf a road is to be open for public travel the purpose for which the public may wish travel is not material, and land may be taken by eminent domain for a road which is intended solely for driving for pleasure ... or to furnish a view of beautiful natural scenery.\u201d (footnote omitted)). There must, however, be a <em>bona fide </em>public necessity for the public use and that use and necessity must be evidenced by more than <em>bald </em>assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Moreover, whether the use contemplated by the condemnation is public or private is a matter for the courts to determine. <em>Chertkof, </em>293 Md. at 43, 441 A.2d 1044; <em>Beard, </em>266 Md. at 95, 291 A.2d 636; <em>Perellis v.

A use cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>be made public by mere declaration of the Legislature. <em>Chertkof, </em>293 Md. at 43, 441 A.2d 1044; <em>Beard, </em>266 Md. at 96, 291 A.2d 636 (citing <em>Arnsperger v.

In reviewing a public body\u2019s decision to condemn private property, courts are limited in the scope of their scrutiny. Indeed, it lies in the discretion of the Legislature \u201cto determine to what extent, on what occasions, and under what circumstances th[e] power shall be exercised. The Courts have no right to review or control its decisions on these points....\u201d <em>Van Witsen, </em>79 Md. at 411-12, 29 A. 608. \u201cAlthough the legislature, <em>in the first instance, </em>has the power to determine the question of public use, it has no power to determine <em>finally </em>the extent of its own authority over private property. The question whether a use ... is really public is ultimately a judicial one.\u201d Nichols, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 7.16 and Maryland cases cited therein (footnotes omitted). The public use <em>vel non </em>for which the private property is sought is a question for the determination of the court, <em>Beard, </em>266 Md. at 95, 291 A.2d 636,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018... to be controlled by the facts, circumstances and necessities of th[e] case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Collington Crossroads, 275 </em>Md. at 184, 339 A.2d 278 (quoting <em>Pitznogle, </em>119 Md. at 678, 87 A. 917). <em>See also </em>Nichols, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 7.16[1].</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">When the condemnation centers around the use of a street or road, the extension of which is sought by a private individual or entity, the inquiry remains the same\u2014public interest must permeate the taking or it will fail for want of validity. While \u201c[t]he act of opening, widening and closing streets, is an exercise of the right of <em>eminent domain, </em>\u201d <em>State ex rel. McClellan v. Graves, </em>19 Md. 351, 369 (1863), it <em>must </em>be done in conjunction with public purpose and necessity. With these considerations in mind, we turn to the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Appellant challenges the validity of the condemnation, stating that its \u201ctruly private purpose is overwhelming.\u201d It is for this reason that appellant claims that the County Commissioners\u2019 action is constitutionally improper. We agree. In neither the legislative proceedings authorizing the filing of the Complaint for Condemnation nor the Complaint itself does the County, other than by a bald claim of public purpose, proffer any public purpose objectives or necessity or proffer any <em>evidence </em>of any such purpose or necessity to justify condemnation of the private pedestrian path located in High Ridge Estates. There is nothing to indicate how the public will benefit from extension of High Ridge Drive <em>per se </em>or how the extension inures to the public benefit. Moreover, given the evidence that development along a route other than High Ridge Drive would prove very costly for the Greens, that the Greens precipitated the condemnation for their private purposes, and that there is a virtual absence of any reasons providing a foundation for the stated public purpose, or evidence of same, we perceive the condemnation to have been clearly intended to inure solely to the benefit of the Greens, in derogation of the very well settled principle that, absent a <em>bona fide </em>public purpose for which the condemned land is sought, property may not be subject to the exercise of eminent domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">In so deciding, we are cognizant of several cases that, though they appear factually close, are inapposite. In <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Beard, supra, </em>266 Md. 83, 291 A.2d 636, the Court of Appeals was faced with a similar set of circumstances. At issue was a quantity of real property sought to be condemned for use as an airport facility. Following enactment by the Maryland General Assembly of enabling legislation properly condemning the land, a County ordinance declared the effort abandoned; later efforts to reacquire the land through eminent domain were found to be lacking in the requisite public nexus to support the taking. The appellee challenged the validity of the condemnation petition on constitutional grounds, alleging that its sole purpose was private in nature. Following its decision to remand for further proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>ings as to the inclusion <em>vel non </em>of the project within the capital budget adopted by the County Council, the Court addressed the eminent domain facet of the case. The Court remanded on this issue as well, as it was unable to discern from either the petition or the record the public use for which the land was sought; \u201ceven the County Executive is unable to say what use will be made of the property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96, 291 A.2d 636. The Court went on to reject any invitation to speculate and hold that a public use had been established on such a deficient record; to do so \u201cwould make the rights of property solely dependent upon the will of a legislative body without restraint. Such is not the law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we perceive a conspicuous deficiency in the record. There is no evidence in the record supporting the County\u2019s declaration of public purpose. The evidence is not weak; it is simply not there. The record is replete with support for the fact that condemnation in the instant case inures solely to the benefit of the Greens and was so intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">We find <em>Anne Arundel County v. Burnopp, supra, </em>300 Md. 343, 478 A.2d 315, to be equally unavailing as well as factually distinguishable. There, the Court of Appeals stated that the fact that a piece of land sought to be condemned is a dead end or a cul de sac does not prevent it from being for a public use. Quoting Nichols, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 7.22[1], the Court said: \u201c \u2018[IJt is no legal objection that a proposed highway will be a <em>cul de sac, </em>or that it will lead to the residence or place of business of but one individual, for the public may desire to visit or do business with him....\u2019\u201d 300 Md. at 352, 478 A.2d 315. Be that as it may, the public use in <em>Burnopp, </em>unlike the case <em>sub judice, </em>was clearly established by legislative enactment, was described in the petition, and a public purpose could, at least, be inferred from the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The Commissioners\u2019 decision to initiate condemnation in the case at bar was clearly and solely made to enhance the private interests of the Greens. In essence, the County was using its powers of eminent domain to give Green access to and through appellant\u2019s private property. That is an inappropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>ate use of the condemnation power. The County\u2019s action was thus oppressive, arbitrary and unreasonable. The trial court erred in upholding the condemnation. On the basis of the record in the case <em>sub judice, </em>no rational inferences of a genuine public purpose are possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">We conclude and acknowledge that the Commissioners\u2019 attempt to abandon the proceeding was a belated good faith attempt to rectify that which should not have been commenced in the first instance. Thus, no costs shall be assessed against the County Commissioners of Carroll County, Maryland. All costs shall be assessed against the Greens.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE INTERVENORS/APPELLEES (GREENS).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-12\">.
