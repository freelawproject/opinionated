Cabreras, Prudential\u2019s agent. The Vicentes raise two issues on appeal, which we have rephrased for clarity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-11\">1. Whether the circuit court properly dismissed the third amended complaint based on appellants\u2019 failure to exhaust their administrative remedies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-12\">2. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that some exhaustion was required, under the doctrine of \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d should this case be remanded to the circuit court to be tried on its merits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>We answer \u201cyes\u201d to the first question and \u201cno\u201d to the second and shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">In their third amended complaint, the Vicentes allege that they purchased a policy of health insurance issued by the National Independent Business Association (\u201cNIBA\u201d), based on Mr. Cabrera\u2019s representation that NIBA was licensed and authorized to do business in Maryland. According to the third amended complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-6\">NIBA was not licensed or authorized to do business in the State of Maryland which is in violation of the Maryland Annotated Code, Art. 48A, Section 1. Such licensing required that the insurer meet certain capital requirements and other standards to protect the public and in fat [sic] the sale of such insurance was illegal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">The Vicentes alleged that Mr. Cabrera represented to them that he was an \u201cagent and registered representative of ... Prudential\u201d and that Mr. Cabrera\u2019s false representations were made \u201con behalf of\u2019 Prudential.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">The Vicentes further alleged that, but for the representation by Mr. Cabrera that NIBA was both authorized to do business in Maryland and adequately capitalized, they would not have purchased the NIBA policy. According to the third amended complaint, the misrepresentations resulted in damages because, while the NIBA policy was in effect, the Vicentes were hospitalized and incurred medical expenses of $25,273.01, of which NIBA was required to pay $23,181.40. After appellants submitted their claim to NIBA, they were advised that NIBA was in receivership, and no part of their claim was paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">The third amended complaint purported to state causes of action for negligent misrepresentation (Count I), fraud (Count II), constructive fraud (Count III), and negligent supervision (Count IV). Each cause of action was predicated on Mr. Cabrera\u2019s (alleged) \u201cfalse representation\u201d to insurance applicants (the Vicentes) that NIBA was licensed in Maryland and adequately capitalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>\n<em>EXHAUSTION OF REMEDIES</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">The general exhaustion of remedies rule is that, \u201cwhere a statute provides a special form of remedy, the plaintiff must use that form [of remedy] rather than any other.\u201d <em>Bits </em>\u201cN\u201d <em>Bytes v. C &amp; P Telephone, </em>97 Md.App. 557, 573, 631 A.2d 485 (1993), <em>citing Soley v. State Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, </em>277 Md. 521, 526, 356 A.2d 254 (1976). The central issue here presented is whether any section of the Insurance Code of Maryland provides a \u201cspecial form of remedy\u201d available to the Vicentes.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Subtitle 15 of the Insurance Code of Maryland<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> encompasses \u00a7\u00a7 212-240J of Art. 48A, which address unfair trade practices in the insurance industry. As used in the insurance code, \u201cUnfair Trade Practices Act\u201d means practices prohibited by \u00a7\u00a7 212 through 234, inclusive, of Art. 48A. One of the categories of unfair trade practices, set forth in Subtitle 15, is titled \u201cfraudulent acts.\u201d Such acts are defined in \u00a7 233 of the Unfair Trade Practices Act. Section 233(d) reads, in pertinent part, \u201cIt shall be a fraudulent insurance act for a person to: (1) Knowingly or willfully make any false or fraudulent statement or representation ... with reference to any application for insurance....\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The insurance code, \u00a7 4, defines \u201cper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>son\u201d as \u201cincludfing] an individual, insurer, ... and any other legal entity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">Section 233(e)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">Penalties.\u2014A person who violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and is subject to a fine up to $10,000 or imprisonment for up to 3 years or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Section 55A of Art. 48A provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-7\">\n<em>Penalty in lieu of or in addition to revocation or suspension; restitution.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-8\">In lieu of or in addition to revocation or suspension of an insurer\u2019s certificate of authority the Commissioner may (1) impose a penalty of not less than one hundred dollars ($100) or more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) for each violation of this article on any insurer whose certificate of authority is subject to revocation or suspension under the provisions of this article, and (2) <em>require that restitution be made by such insurer to any person who has suffered financial injury or damage as a result of such violation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ai\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">In <em>Veydt v. Lincoln Nat. Life Ins. Co., </em>94 Md.App. 1, 6, 614 A.2d 1318 (1992), the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-10\">Maryland Annotated Code article 48A, section 55A, is the penalty provision of the Insurance Code. By Chapter 755 of the Laws of 1971, the Legislature reiterated its intention that the Commissioner be fully charged with the responsibility to remedy violations of Article 48A when it increased the maximum penalty the Commissioner can impose from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>$25,000 to $50,000 and, more important, added to section 55A provisions authorizing the Commissioner to <em>\u201crequire that restitution be made by such insurer to any person who has suffered \u00f1nancial injury or damaye as a result of such violation. \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Appellants\u2019 counsel, in oral argument, admitted that the wrongs alleged in the third amended complaint are prohibited by the Unfair Trade Practices Act. Appellants assert, however, that in the case <em>sub judice </em>\u201cit appears that there was concurrent jurisdiction\u2014the Insurance Commissioner as to Violation of the Insurance Code and the Courts as to the tort action.\u201d (Brief, p. 10). Appellants maintain that, although the Insurance Commissioner has jurisdiction, appellants were not required to exhaust administrative remedies before instituting suit. Relying entirely on \u00a7 215, appellants argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">In this case, the legislature cannot have been clearer. It has specifically stated that it is not an exclusive remedy <em>by statiny that with reyard to the remedies provided by the Insurance Code for unfair trade practices </em>that as to a cease and desist order of the Commissioner, \u201cNo order of the Commissioner pursuant to this section or order of court to enforce it shall in any way relieve or absolve any person affected by such order from any other liability, penalty, or forfeiture under the law.\u201d Art. 48A, \u00a7 215(c), MD.ANN. CODE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-7\">What language could be clearer than to say that no one is absolved from other liability or penalty by the remedy provided in this case? This language makes it clear that the legislature did not intend to make this an exclusive remedy which would preclude other common law or even statutory remedy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">Section 215 reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-10\">\n<em>Cease and desist orders for prohibited practices.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-11\">(a) <em>When </em>issued.\u2014If, after a hearing thereon of which notice of such hearing and of the charges against him were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>given such person, the Commissioner finds that any person in this State has engaged or is engaging in any act or practice defined in or prohibited under this subtitle, the Commissioner shall order such person to cease and desist from such acts or practices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-4\">}{: <em>% % </em>$ sfs #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-5\">(d) <em>Effect of order on other liability, penalty or forfei</em>ture.\u2014No order of the Commissioner pursuant to this section or order of court to enforce it shall in any way relieve or absolve any person affected by such order from any other liability, penalty, or forfeiture under law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">(e) <em>Violation of </em>order.\u2014Violation of any such desist order shall be deemed to be and shall be punishable as a violation of this article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\">(f) <em>Penalties provided by other laws not </em>affected.\u2014This section shall not be deemed to affect or prevent the imposition of any penalty provided by this article or by other law for violation of any other provision of this subtitle, whether or not any such hearing is called or held or such desist order issued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">As mentioned above, appellants argue, based on \u00a7 215, that remedies in the Insurance Code for unfair trade practices \u201care not exclusive remedies.\u201d Three cases refute this contention: <em>Muhl v. Magan, </em>313 Md. 462, 545 A.2d 1321 (1988) <em>(Magan I); Veydt, supra; </em>and <em>Magan v. Medical Mutual, </em>81 Md.App. 301, 567 A.2d 503 (1989) <em>(Magan II).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">In <em>Muhl v. Magan (Magan </em>I), <em>supra, </em>the Court was faced with an allegation by Dr. Michael Magan that Medical Mutual Liability Society of Maryland (Medical Mutual) had wrongfully refused to insure him. 313 Md. at 469, 545 A.2d 1321. Dr. Magan contended that Medical Mutual\u2019s refusal to provide coverage constituted a violation of Art. 48A, \u00a7 234A. That claim, if proven, was \u201cone of the unfair trade practices addressed in Subtitle 15.... \u201d 313 Md. at 465, 545 A.2d 1321. Dr. Magan filed a complaint with the Insurance Commissioner and requested a hearing pursuant to \u00a7 35(2), but the request was denied. An appeal was filed to the circuit court. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>circuit court, both the Insurance Commissioner and Dr. Magan agreed that the court should decide the merits of the case, <em>ie., </em>whether, under applicable law, Medical Mutual was required to issue a policy to Dr. Magan. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the circuit court should not have decided the merits of the case before administrative remedies were exhausted by Dr. Magan. 313 Md. at 478-80, 545 A.2d 1321. The lower court appropriately should have decided only if Dr. Magan was entitled to a preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">In <em>Magan I, </em>313 Md. at 465, 545 A.2d 1321, the Court of Appeals discussed the comprehensive legislative insurance regulatory scheme set forth in Subtitle 15:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\">With respect to unfair trade practices defined in Subtitle 15, the Commissioner is authorized to issue a cease and desist order against the violator upon a finding of violation after a hearing on notice, including notice of the charges. \u00a7 215(a). With respect to undefined unfair trade practices the Commissioner is authorized by \u00a7 216 to conduct a hearing, after notice, including notice of charges, and upon finding of violation which is not discontinued, to cause the Attorney General to seek an injunction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">In explaining why the circuit court should not have decided the merits of Dr. Magan\u2019s case, the Court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK\">The remedy which the General Assembly has created for situations involving insurers who decline to accept a particular risk lies under 234A and related provisions and is enforced through the procedures <em>applicable to that type of unfair trade practice under the Insurance Code.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">Where the General Assembly has provided a special form of remedy and has established a statutory procedure before an administrative agency for a special kind of case, a litigant must ordinarily pursue that form of remedy and not bypass the administrative official. <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Blumberg, </em>288 Md. 275, 418 A.2d 1155 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1083, 101 S.Ct. 869, 66 L.Ed.2d 808 (1981). So strong is this public policy that this Court will, <em>sua sponte, </em>vacate judgment and order an action dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>missed where the litigants have not followed the special statutory procedure. <em>See Secretary, Department of Human Resources v. Wilson, </em>286 Md. 639, 409 A.2d 713 (1979); <em>Commission on Medical Discipline v. Bendler, </em>280 Md. 326, 373 A.2d 1232 (1977). <em>[Oxtoby v. McGowan, </em>294 Md. 83, 91, 447 A.2d 860, 865 (1982).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">313 Md. at 480-81, 545 A.2d 1321 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">While <em>Magan I </em>was pending in the Court of Appeals, Dr. Magan filed a tort suit against Medical Mutual and certain of its officers and directors. Dr. Magan alleged that Medical Mutual had \u201cbreached its duty\u201d to insure licensed physicians in Maryland by denying his application for insurance and violated the trial court\u2019s order to insure him at standard rates by seeking to impose a surcharge on him. <em>Magan II, </em>81 Md.App. at 305, 567 A.2d 503. The suit sought compensatory and punitive damages. The trial court dismissed the suit on the basis that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Dr. Magan had failed to exhaust administrative remedies. In <em>Magan II, </em>this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">In <em>Secretary, Maryland Department of Human Resources v. Wilson, </em>286 Md. 639, 409 A.2d 713 (1979), the Court of Appeals explained the public policy behind the exhaustion of administrative remedies rule. The Court said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AY\">\u201cThus, this Court recognized that when the Legislature enacts a comprehensive remedial scheme in which a claim is to be determined by an administrative agency and reviewed in an administrative appeal before judicial review is available, it establishes, as public policy, that such a procedure produces the most efficient and effective results. In order to effectuate this public policy, trial courts generally should not act until there has been compliance with the statutory comprehensive remedial scheme.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\"><em>Wilson, </em>286 Md. at 645, 409 A.2d 713 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-8\">In the instant case, the complaint, filed in the circuit court, was grounded upon Medical Mutual\u2019s refusal to underwrite Magan, an alleged violation of the Maryland Insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>anee Code. The Insurance Code provides a comprehensive administrative structure and established a uniform method of appeal for an individual aggrieved by an insurer\u2019s violation of the Maryland Insurance Code, Md.Code Ann. Art. 48A (1957, 1986 Repl.Vol., 1989 Cum.Supp.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">81 Md.App. at 306-07, 567 A.2d 503 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"Av2\">Later the <em>Magan II </em>Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\">Here, Magan attempts to circumvent these administrative procedures by pursuing a separate claim for damages in the circuit court. <em>Magan maintains that he can do this because his claim sounds in tort.' This argument fails, however, since the factual predicate for his tort claims is founded on a statutory violation which carries with it a statutory remedy. </em>In essence, what Magan is attempting to do is supplement his statutory remedy for damages by pursuing an action for tort damages in the circuit court. In order for Magan to maintain a separate action in the circuit court, he must pursue a recognized alternate remedy under common law principles. <em>See White v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>282 Md. 641, 650-51, 387 A.2d 260 (1978).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 308, 567 A.2d 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">In <em>Magan II, </em>the Court concluded by flatly rejecting Dr. Magan\u2019s contention that he could bring a common law tort action and held that \u201cthe Legislature intended \u00a7 55A to be an exclusive remedy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">In <em>Veydt, supra, </em>an insurance agent (Veydt) sued Lincoln National Life Insurance Company (the insurer) after the insurer terminated an at-will insurance agency agreement with him. The agent sued for \u201cfalse light\u201d (a type of invasion of privacy) and \u201cTortious Interference with Business Relationships.\u201d The trial court dismissed the suit, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-9\">The verbal [written] communications, which form the predicate for Veydt\u2019s claims, are so intricately bound up with the act of termination ... that they cannot be made the basis for a separate tort claim....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>If a common law tort claim may be asserted on the basis of verbal acts forming a necessary and appropriate part of the process of [agency] contract termination, as regulated under sec. 234B(d), then that subsection would have no vitality whatsoever....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-4\">It is difficult to <em>imagine </em>how the Commissioner\u2019s legislatively-created primary jurisdiction over \u25a0 terminations that are \u201carbitrary, capricious, unfair or discriminatory\u201d would survive the artful pleading of skillful advocates. Here, the amended complaint\u2019s heavy reliance upon Lincoln\u2019s <em>communications </em>does not obscure the reality that Lincoln\u2019s act (of contract termination) is the gravamen of the alleged harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">94 Md.App. at 5-6, 614 A.2d 1318.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">In <em>Veydt, </em>this Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">We see no substantial difference from <em>Magan </em>and what appellant attempted to do in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Appellant pursued an administrative appeal under Section 234B in respect to the termination of the agency contract, and he has filed this separate tort claim in the circuit court. Article 48A, section 234B provides a complete procedure and remedy. Subsection (d) contains express provisions prohibiting arbitrary, capricious and unfair cancellation of agency agreements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-8\">As we have said, section 234B must be read in conjunction with section 55A. The penalty provision in section 55A confers authority on the Commissioner to \u201crequire that restitution be made\u201d by an insurer for any \u201cfinancial injury\u201d or \u201cdamage\u201d caused to any person as a result of a violation ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-9\"><em>Id., </em>94 Md.App. at 19, 614 A.2d 1318.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">The common thread running through <em>Magan I, Veydt, </em>and <em>Magan II </em>is that all three cases involved claims covered by the Unfair Trade Practices Act, and in both <em>Magan II </em>and <em>Veydt </em>the Court flatly held that the Legislature intended the remedies set forth in \u00a7 55A to be exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>The obvious meaning of \u00a7 215(d) and (f) is that a cease and desist order is not to be interpreted as an exclusive remedy. Section 215, by its terms, is silent as to whether the remedies set forth elsewhere in Art. 48A are exclusive. Appellants\u2019 interpretation starts off with the implied assumption that, despite the remedies set forth in \u00a7 55A, there is still \u201csome other liability\u201d that may be imposed on the insurer at common law when the insurer violates a section of the code dealing with unfair trade practices. For the reasons stated in <em>Magan I, Veydt, </em>and <em>Magan II, all supra, </em>we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\n<em>PRIMARY JURISDICTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">In <em>Bits \u201cN\u201d Bytes, </em>97 Md.App. at 574, 631 A.2d 485, this Court explained: \u201cPrimary jurisdiction \u2018is a judicially created rule designed to coordinate the allocation of functions between the court and administrative bodies.\u2019 \u201d <em>Citing Maryland Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>282 Md. 588, 602, 386 A.2d 1216 (1978). In <em>Bits \u201cN\u201d Bytes, </em>we held that the doctrine applies only when a court and an administrative agency have concurrent jurisdiction over the same matter and there is no statutory provision to coordinate the work of the court and the agency. <em>Id. </em>The circuit court and the Insurance Commissioner do not have concurrent jurisdiction over violations of the Unfair Insurance Trade Practices Act (Subtitle 15), such as violation of 233(d). Before resorting to the court, an insured must exhaust administrative remedies. <em>Magan II, </em>81 Md.App. at 311-12, 567 A.2d 503 (holding that the circuit court jurisdiction was not concurrent with that of the Insurance Commissioner). When the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is applicable, there is no right to \u201can independent Civil action after the administrative decision.\u201d <em>Id., </em>97 Md.App. at 572, 631 A.2d 485. Also, in regard to violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act, there <em>are </em>statutory provisions for the coordination of the work of the court and the agency. A party who suffers from an unfair trade practice may ask the Commissioner to conduct an examination or investigation (\u00a7 243); ask the Insurance Commissioner to conduct a hearing (\u00a7 35); and obtain, <em>inter alia, </em>restitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>under \u00a7 55A. Thus, the \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d doctrine is not here applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b38-6\">.
