State, </em>331 Md. 549, 552, 629 A.2d 633 (1993), referred to as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>\u201cthe classic evidentiary problem of the turncoat witness.\u201d The appellant is Jerry S. Tyler, who was convicted by a Prince George\u2019s County jury, presided over by Judge Arthur M. Ahalt, of murder in the first degree and other related offenses. The turncoat witness was Gerald Eiland, the erstwhile codefendant with Tyler for the same murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">On this appeal, Tyler has raised eight contentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">1) that Judge Ahalt erroneously admitted the prior testimony of Eiland given at Eiland\u2019s earlier trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">2) that Judge Ahalt erroneously granted an eighteen-day continuance in an effort to compel Eiland to testify;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">3) that the evidence was not legally sufficient to sustain the convictions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-9\">4) that Judge Ahalt erroneously instructed the jury that the appellant could be convicted as an aider and abetter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-10\">5) that Judge Ahalt committed plain error in instructing the jury on first-degree murder;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-11\">6) that Judge Ahalt committed plain error in not instructing the jury that its verdict must be unanimous;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-12\">7) that Judge Ahalt erroneously admitted irrelevant and prejudicial testimony from the witness Michael McCutchen; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-13\">8) that Judge Ahalt erroneously excluded testimony from the appellant\u2019s mother.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-14\">\n<em>The Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b521-15\">On the afternoon of December 4,1990, in what turned out to be a highly publicized murder case, James \u201cJay\u201d S. Bias, III, the younger brother of former University of Maryland basketball star Len Bias, was senselessly gunned down in cold blood as he was leaving the Prince George\u2019s Plaza Mall. In <em>Eiland and Tyler v. State, </em>92 Md.App. 56, 64-66, 607 A.2d 42 (1992), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, Tyler and Eiland v. State, </em>330 Md. 261, 623 A.2d 648 (1993), this Court recited fully the evidence leading up to the shooting of Jay Bias:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Jay Bias worked at the Hyattsville Branch of the Sovran Bank. On the afternoon of December 4, 1990, two of his coworkers, Andre Campbell and Tydus Mathis, decided to drive to the nearby Prince George\u2019s Plaza Mall during their lunch hour. Hearing their plans, Bias asked to accompany them. He had recently purchased from Kay Jewelers, located in the mall, a ring, which was being sized for him and which he wanted to show to his coworkers. The three drove to the mall in Mathis\u2019s car. While Mathis went off to browse in another part of the mall, Bias and Campbell went to Kay Jewelers, where they were waited on by Shaunelle Tyler, an employee of the store and the wife of the appellant Jerry Tyler. Bias spoke to Shaunelle Tyler about the ring and showed it to Campbell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">At approximately the same time ... Jerry Tyler and Gerald Eiland, arrived at the mall in a green Mercedes Benz, owned by Tyler\u2019s father but driven by Eiland. The two of them headed directly for Kay Jewelers. As Bias and Campbell were leaving the jewelers, Jerry Tyler entered. He apparently believed that his wife had been flirting with Jay Bias. A turbulent argument ensued between Tyler and his wife, culminating in Tyler\u2019s hurling a stapler at her. The manager of Kay Jewelers thought it prudent to end the dispute by escorting Tyler out of the store.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">Bias and Campbell, now rejoined by Tydus Mathis, were standing just outside when Tyler was escorted to the exit. Visibly agitated, Tyler turned to Bias and said, \u201cYou can have her.\u201d Bias replied \u201cthat he didn\u2019t want [Tyler\u2019s] girl\u201d and that \u201che was just buying a ring.\u201d Tyler, his agitation persisting, challenged Bias to \u201c[c]ome on outside, we can take care of this outside.\u201d Bias initially started toward Tyler but was stopped by Mathis. During the entire verbal encounter ... Eiland was standing just two to three steps away from Tyler.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">Heeding Mathis\u2019s advice of restraint, Bias, with Campbell and Mathis, walked toward the mall exit leading to the rear parking lot. [Eiland and Tyler] were making their way toward another exit, leading to the front parking lot, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>[one of the two] again yelled to Bias to \u201cstep outside,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019ve got something for you outside; I\u2019ll cap you.\u201d At that time, Eiland was still standing within two to three feet of Tyler.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\">As they prepared to leave the parking lot, Mathis was in the driver\u2019s seat of his car, Campbell was in the rear passenger compartment, and Bias sat in the front passenger seat. As they approached the exit leading onto Toledo Terrace, they came to a stop in a left-turn lane as they waited for two cars in front of them to make a left turn. At that point, Mathis noticed a green Mercedes \u201cspeed\u201d toward them from the opposite side of the parking lot. As the Mercedes pulled abreast of them in the lane to their immediate right, Mathis noticed that Eiland was driving the car and that Tyler was sitting in the front passenger seat. Because the flow of traffic on Toledo terrace was heavy, Mathis was not able to proceed immediately to exit the parking lot. Indeed, when the Mercedes first pulled abreast of Mathis\u2019s Toyota, the Toyota was \u201cstacked up\u201d behind two other cars waiting to make a left-hand turn. The right-hand lane was free, however, and there was nothing to impede the Mercedes, driven by Eiland and occupied by Tyler, from going forward. Eiland, nonetheless, brought the Mercedes to a stop parallel with Mathis\u2019 Toyota. When, a few seconds later, the Toyota was able to \u201cinch\u201d forward one automobile length before stopping again, Eiland moved the Mercedes proportionately forward to maintain the parallel relationship between the two cars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">Mathis noticed that the left front window of the Mercedes was open. He saw Eiland press backward against the driver\u2019s seat as Tyler stretched across in front of him and yelled out the window. As Eiland pressed his body back against his seat, allowing Tyler to lean across in front of him, his hands were on the low arc of the steering wheel. The testimony was clear that they were not high on the steering wheel or even at midpoint but were as low as they could be without actually releasing the wheel. Campbell, who also observed this, noticed that Tyler had his right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>hand placed below his knee. Tyler initially appeared \u201cscared\u201d but then became very angry. Because the windows of the Mathis vehicle were closed, neither Mathis nor Campbell could hear the words being yelled by Tyler. As the Mathis vehicle moved slightly forward toward the intersection, Eiland kept the Mercedes parallel with it. As Campbell was briefly turning his head away from the direction of the Mercedes, between seven and ten bullets were fired into the right side of the Mathis vehicle. Two of those bullets struck and mortally wounded Jay Bias.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">The Mathis vehicle made an immediate left-hand turn onto Toledo Terrace and drove toward the Leland Memorial Hospital, where Bias was rushed to the emergency room. Shortly thereafter, Bias was pronounced dead by the hospital\u2019s attending physicians. Immediately after the shooting, Eiland drove the Mercedes away in an opposite direction from that taken by the Toyota. (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">In several regards, Andre Campbell\u2019s testimony at the trial now under review was slightly stronger than it had been in the original version. The last remark shouted at Jay Bias as the first confrontation broke up and all parties began to leave the inside of the mall for the parking lot was, \u201cI\u2019ll cap you,\u201d meaning \u201cI\u2019ll shoot you.\u201d Although not looking in the direction from which the shout came, Campbell testified that the voice resembled the voice of Tyler.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Campbell was also slightly more precise about Tyler\u2019s actions immediately prior to the shooting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">A Okay. At that point, you can see Tyler reaching down towards his leg on the right side, and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">Q Were you looking down into the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-11\">Q Okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-12\">A And, as I saw him reaching, I told him I think he had a gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>THE WITNESS: Before I could get the word gun out, that\u2019s when the shooting began.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">\n<em>The Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AHVu\">\n<em>A. The First Trial and Its Aftermath</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Notwithstanding their motions to have their trials severed, Eiland and Tyler were tried together and were both convicted by a Prince George\u2019s County jury of murder. Tyler was convicted of murder in the first degree and of the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder and to a consecutive term of twenty years for the handgun violation. Eiland was convicted of murder in the second degree and of the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. He was sentenced to a term of thirty years for the murder, ten of which were suspended, and to a consecutive term of twenty years for the handgun violation, ten of which were also suspended, for a total of thirty years to be served.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">At that first trial, neither Eiland nor Tyler took the stand in his own defense. Their separate attorneys, however, effectively asserted their respective defenses. Tyler\u2019s attorney argued forcefully that their positions in the Mercedes, from which the shots were fired, and the position of the Mercedes <em>vis-a-vis </em>the Toyota, in which the victims were riding, made it highly probable, based on the law of physics, that Eiland, the driver closest to the Toyota, had to be the gunman and that Tyler, therefore, was a mere passive passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">Eiland\u2019s lawyer, on the other hand, argued equally forcefully that it was Tyler who had the motive, Tyler who was exploding with anger, Tyler who had leaned across Eiland\u2019s body to shout something out of the driver\u2019s side window, and Tyler who had been seen to reach down to retrieve something, from approximately waist or upper-leg level, just before the shooting. Every circumstance, therefore, pointed to Tyler as the inevitable gunman. Each defendant, through his legal surrogate, pointed his finger unequivocally at the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>On May 26, 1992, this Court, in a published opinion, affirmed the convictions of both Eiland and Tyler. <em>Eiland and Tyler v. State, </em>92 Md.App. 56, 607 A.2d 42 (1992). Following a grant of <em>certiorari </em>on October 8,1992, the Court of Appeals, in a split, 4-3 decision, reversed the decision of this Court and directed that the cases against both Eiland and Tyler be remanded to Prince George\u2019s County for a new trial. <em>Tyler and Eiland v. State, </em>330 Md. 261, 623 A.2d 648 (1993). The Court of Appeals opinion did not deal with the merits of the case but only with the issue of whether the Maryland Constitution forbade the use of peremptory challenges based on gender.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">\n<em>B. The Trial Severance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Before proceeding to retrial, both Eiland and Tyler moved again to have their trials severed. Tyler moved for a.trial severance on July 19, 1993. He filed on September 20 a 14-page memorandum in support of the motion for severance. Ironically, he assigned as his reasons the very reasons both defendants had assigned in their first such motion before their joint trial. That first motion for severance had been denied and both defendants strenuously argued the impropriety of that denial in the course of the first appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">At 92 Md.App. 72-79, 607 A.2d 42, we held expressly that the denial of the severance had not been improper. The Court of Appeals opinion did not disturb our holding with respect to the severance issue. We held that neither defendant would suffer \u201cprejudice\u201d as that term of art is used in severance law. The evidence admissible against one would have been equally admissible against the other. Neither defendant, moreover, would suffer the exclusion of helpful evidence by virtue of being tried with his codefendant. In looking at this primary thrust of the severance argument, we concluded, 92 Md.App. at 74, 607 A.2d 42, \u201c[T]he appellants did not remotely qualify for a trial severance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">The appellants then attempted to establish, as an alternative rationale for severance, a \u201chostility between the defenses.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>We observed that the law of Maryland had never recognized this notion as an independent basis for granting a trial severance. <em>Lipscomb v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 500, 248 A.2d 491 (1968) <em>cert. denied, </em>253 Md. 734 (1969); <em>Sye v. State, </em>55 Md.App. 356, 468 A.2d 641 (1983) <em>cert. denied, </em>299 Md. 427, 474 A.2d 219 (1984); <em>Moore v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 165, 578 A.2d 304, <em>cert. denied, </em>321 Md. 385, 582 A.2d 1256 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Finally, Tyler argued on that first appeal, as he did subsequently in his second and more successful motion for a severance, that \u201cthe jury was so confused that it returned a verdict which was inconsistent ... as between the defendants.\u201d We pointed out, 92 Md.App. at 78, 607 A.2d 42, that the allegedly inconsistent verdicts on which he premised his notion of jury confusion were, indeed, not inconsistent at all. <em>See Oates v. State, </em>97 Md.App. 180, 627 A.2d 555 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Notwithstanding the seal of approval that we had placed on the denial of severance, Eiland and Tyler, on their second try, succeeded on October 18 in having their trials severed. The ground was thereby laid for each to point the finger at the other, not simply through the mouths of counsel but from the witness stand without fear of contradiction by the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">No single jury, of course, would ever have permitted both defendants, one of whom at least was indisputably a murderer, to point fingers reciprocally at each other and then to walk out of the courtroom with mutual acquittals. With separate juries, however, that possibility became very real.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">\n<em>C. The Retrial of Eiland</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">At the separate retrial of Eiland in December 1993, the possibility was realized. Eiland, without fear of contradiction by Tyler, took the stand and, under oath, laid the entire blame on Tyler. Eiland was merely the innocent companion of Tyler on the trip to the Prince George\u2019s Plaza Mall. Eiland was the passive observer of Tyler\u2019s jealous rage over the flirtatious behavior, real or imagined, of his wife, Shaunelle, with Jay Bias. Eiland was only an observer of Tyler\u2019s mounting rage as first they exited the mall and then as they prepared to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>drive away from the parking lot. Eiland was shocked by Tyler\u2019s totally unanticipated behavior as Tyler pulled a gun and let loose with a fusillade of bullets.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Eiland was secure in the knowledge that Tyler would not contradict him, for Tyler, still untried, would remain mute behind his privilege against compelled self-incrimination and was not a compellable witness. Eiland\u2019s jury gave him the benefit of a complete acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">\n<em>D. The Retrial of Tyler</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">At the separate retrial of Tyler, the possibility at least loomed that uncontradicted finger-pointing at an absent former codefendant might again succeed in creating, at least, a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Tyler took the stand. He described his trip, to the jewelry store where he encountered Jay Bias, whom he had not known before. Bias gave Tyler \u201ca hard stare,\u201d which Tyler promptly mirrored. Tyler remembered being \u201chighly upset\u201d with his wife and exchanging \u201ca few words\u201d with Bias, but he could not remember the exact words spoken. Tyler further testified that when the Mercedes, in which he was the passenger, came to a stop next to the Toyota, carrying Bias, Mathis, and Campbell, \u201chard looks\u201d were again exchanged and that he, Tyler, indeed, said something to the occupants of the other car. He testified that during this exchange of \u201chard looks\u201d and while making a comment or two to the occupants of the Toyota, he was not paying attention to Eiland.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">The critical testimony was that he was then totally surprised when he heard shots being fired and realized that Eiland had fired at the occupants of the other vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">That testimonial gambit by Tyler was not a precise replicate of the one earlier performed by Eiland. Eiland had been relatively secure from contradiction by Tyler, for Tyler would have been recklessly imprudent to have jeopardized his privilege against compelled self-incrimination by testifying against Eiland. By virtue of Eiland\u2019s trial having gone first, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>and having resulted, moreover, in an acquittal, Tyler had no apparent shield against contradiction by Eiland.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The two surviving occupants of the Toyota had been unable to say with certainty whether it was Eiland or Tyler who actually pulled the trigger. Their testimony, however, was absolutely certain that it had been one of the two. There was, of course, circumstantial evidence as to which of the two had the motive, displayed the anger, and was actively involved in the confrontation just seconds before the shooting. As to which of the two actually pulled the trigger, however, only Eiland and Tyler could say with certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The question became whether Eiland would say with certainty at Tyler\u2019s trial what Eiland had earlier said with certainty at his own trial. There was no reason for the State to fear that he would not. His trial testimony had been under oath. Nothing in that testimony, moreover, was in any way inconsistent with anything he ever said about the crime before his retrial or with anything he ever said about it after his retrial. The only apparent obstacle to be overcome was the privilege against compelled self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">\n<em>Eiland\u2019s Testimonial Performance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">To say the least, Eiland\u2019s testimonial performance was a \u201cbust.\u201d Eiland is a resident of the District of Columbia. Accordingly, a subpoena to appear in Prince George\u2019s County as a witness was obtained and served on him pursuant to the provisions of the Uniform Act to Secure the Attendance of Witnesses from Without a State in Criminal Proceedings. Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. \u00a7 9-303; <em>State v. Breeden, </em>333 Md. 212, 222-28, 634 A.2d 464 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Following service of that subpoena, Eiland\u2019s lawyers filed on February 22, 1994, a written motion to have the subpoena quashed on the ground that Eiland\u2019s compelled testimony would violate his Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination. After argum\u00e9nt from Eiland\u2019s lawyers and the State, Judge Ahalt ruled that there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>residual danger of further incrimination and that Eiland was a compellable witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">After that ruling, Eiland\u2019s lawyers indicated for the first time that, notwithstanding the order of the court, Eiland might still refuse to testify because of some intimidating conduct that had been directed toward him as he drove to court the day before. One of his attorneys narrated for the court what he had learned first from Eiland\u2019s sister and later from Eiland himself. Eiland had been subpoenaed to be present in court on the preceding day. He was to meet with his attorney at the attorney\u2019s office at 9:15 A.M. At 8:45 A.M., the attorney\u2019s office received a telephone call from Eiland\u2019s sister, Cynthia. The attorney described the substance of that call:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">Ms. Pearson indicated that she had received a telephone call from Gerald Eiland, that on his way to our office, after leaving his mother\u2019s home, where he spent the night, he saw a brown automobile with tinted windows that he had seen before. The car followed him, caught up with him. He tried to pull away from the car. He saw the car with tinted windows come down. He immediately had a great fear as to the fact that this might be\u2014that some violence might be done to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">He tried to get away. The car struck the back of his vehicle, in what he perceived was an effort to cut him off and bring him to the side of the road. He did get away. We have learned that from Mr. Eiland, who we did not speak to in person until this morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">Mr. Eiland has indicated, and I expect that based upon what has occurred in this situation, that he feels that his safety cannot be guaranteed and that he is in great danger if he testifies in this case, and that it is his decision, I believe he will take the position, that the Court, having denied our motion to quash, he will take the position that he is unable to answer questions put to him by either side.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">In an effort by all parties to confirm whether Eiland\u2019s refusal to testify would truly come to pass, Eiland was called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>to the stand. He was sworn in as a witness and willingly answered preliminary questions that did not concern the shooting of Jay Bias. He refused to answer, however, any question touching on the crime or on the reason he felt he could not answer such questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-5\">Gerald Eiland, a witness on call of the State, after having been duly sworn was examined and testified as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">Direct Examination</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">By Mr. Jackson:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">Q: Mr. Eiland, would you please state your name for the record, and spell your last name for the Court Reporter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azd\">A: Gerald Eiland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">Q: Please state your full name and address.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-10\">A: Gerald Eiland, 4317 29th Street, Southeast.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-11\">By Mr. Jackson:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-12\">Q: Mr. Eiland, did you shoot Jay Bias?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-13\">A: I can\u2019t answer that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-14\">By Mr. Jackson:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-15\">Q: Mr. Eiland, are you the same Mr. Eiland that testified in a previous proceeding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-16\">A: I can\u2019t answer that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-17\">Mr. Jackson: Your Honor, I would ask the Court to direct the witness to answer the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-18\">The Court: Mr. Eiland, Pm going to order you to answer the questions that have been directed to you by Mr. Jackson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-19\">The Witness: I can\u2019t answer that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-20\">By Mr. Jackson:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-21\">Q: Mr. Eiland, did you shoot Jay Bias?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-22\">A: I can\u2019t answer that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-23\">Q: Why can\u2019t you answer that question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>A: I can\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">Q: Were you in the car when Jay Bias was shot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALR\">A: I can\u2019t answer that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">Q: Why can\u2019t you answer that question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">A: I can\u2019t answer that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-8\">The Court: I think you need to continue further.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-9\">By Mr. Jackson:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-10\">Q: Were you in the Prince George\u2019s Mall on December 4, 1990?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-11\">A: I can\u2019t answer that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-12\">Q: And why can\u2019t you answer that question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-13\">A: Because, I can\u2019t. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-14\">Q: Were you driving a green Mercedes that was occupied with Jerry Tyler at the Prince George\u2019s Mall on December 4, 1990?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-15\">A: I can\u2019t answer that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-16\">Q: And why can\u2019t you answer that question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-17\">A: Because, I can\u2019t answer the question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-18\">At that point, Judge Ahalt took over the questioning of Eiland. In the course thereof, he sternly advised Eiland that Eiland risked jail for contempt of court if he continued in his obstinacy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-19\">The Court: Mr. Eiland, you understood the questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZl\">The Witness: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-20\">The Court: You understood that you have previously testified under oath in this courthouse concerning the issues and the facts to which the questions the State has asked are directed.

The State moved to have Judge Ahalt find Eiland in contempt of court. In the course of the ensuing discussion between Judge Ahalt and counsel, the question arose as to whether Eiland\u2019s counsel deemed it beneficial to talk further with his client before the ultimate ruling was made. Counsel indicated that there was no purpose to be served:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">Your Honor, I don\u2019t believe that any further opportunity for us to consult with the client will provide any benefit. I have made the proffer earlier that is under seal as to the client\u2019s reasons for saying what he has and for taking the position that he is taking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">He understands that the court does have the power, based upon the prosecutor\u2019s request to incarcerate him. Based upon the events of the past 24 hours and his continuous concerns about the situation, it\u2019s his election to respond to the questions as he did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Before making his finding of contempt, Judge Ahalt asked if counsel could provide him with any additional details with respect to the automotive attack made on Eiland two days before. Counsel indicated that it occurred on Wheeler Road in- the District as Eiland was driving toward Alabama Avenue in the general direction of the Bolling Air Force Base and his lawyer\u2019s office. He indicated further that there was a discernible dent on the ear and that the car would be produced by a friend if anyone wanted to examine the dent.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">Eiland\u2019s lawyers did reveal one other fact that may be of significance to us. When one of them had spoken to Eiland on the immediately preceding Tuesday afternoon about his scheduled court appearance on Wednesday morning, every indication was that he was ready to comply with whatever his testimonial obligation might be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-9\">So as to Tuesday evening, he was ready to come to court, and [we] had every indication that he would, and [he] had told us that he would.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">Judge Ahalt found Eiland to be in contempt of court. He ordered Eiland to be detained until he purged himself of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>contempt by being willing to testify. The State, at that juncture, offered as an exception to the Rule Against Hearsay the Prior Recorded Testimony of Eiland given under oath at his December 1993 trial. Tyler objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">In an effort to obtain Eiland\u2019s live testimony, if at all possible, Judge Ahalt considered examining the jurors as to their availability and then continuing the trial for eighteen days to see if the pressure on Eiland would persuade him to comply with the court\u2019s order to testify. The State readily agreed to Judge Ahalt\u2019s suggestion. Tyler, however, despite having formally summoned Eiland as a defense witness, lost all apparent interest in encouraging him to testify at all. He strenuously opposed the continuance. Tyler\u2019s complaint that, with the lapse of two weeks, there would be \u201csome fading of the testimony\u201d seems contrived in that all of the testimony had been from the State\u2019s witnesses and the fading of memory, therefore, would almost certainly have been to the benefit of Tyler.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Tyler seemed certain, moreover, that no amount of jail time would succeed in persuading Eiland to change his mind. Tyler continued, despite the clear ruling of Judge Ahalt to the contrary, to characterize Eiland\u2019s reason for refusing to testify as one based on the Fifth Amendment privilege and not on the fear and intimidation proffered by Eiland\u2019s counsel. The trial was then recessed from March 3 until March 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">On March 21, Eiland was again put on the stand and placed under oath. He gave his name for the record and then responded to ten questions from the prosecutor with five replies of \u201cI can\u2019t answer that question\u201d interspersed with five alternating replies of \u201cBecause I can\u2019t.\u201d Judge Ahalt sought to be of help and received three replies of \u201cNo.\u201d Tyler\u2019s counsel then received two replies of \u201cI can\u2019t answer that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">\n<em>The Evidentiary Ruling</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">Based on the necessity occasioned by Eiland\u2019s contemptuous refusal to answer questions, Judge Ahalt ruled that the State could introduce the transcript of Eiland\u2019s testimony from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Eiland\u2019s own trial in December 1993. The State then read that testimony to the jury. The propriety of that evidentiary ruling is now the key issue on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Coincidentally, Judge Ahalt determined that the transcript qualified as the \u201cfirmly rooted exception\u201d to the Rule Against Hearsay generally known as Former Testimony, sometimes referred to as Prior Recorded Testimony. Judge Ahalt determined, in the alternative, that even if the transcript should not automatically qualify under the aforesaid \u201cfirmly rooted exception,\u201d it would nonetheless qualify even as generic hearsay because it bore \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness,\u201d <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. 530, 543, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 2063, 90 L.Ed.2d 514, 528 (1986), and was, therefore, \u201cat least as reliable as evidence admitted under a firmly rooted hearsay exception,\u201d <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 821, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 3149, 111 L.Ed.2d 638, 656 (1990). <em>See Chapman v. State, </em>331 Md. 448, 456-58, 628 A.2d 676 (1993); <em>Simmons v. State, </em>333 Md. 547, 558-59, 636 A.2d 463 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">As we undertake our analysis, let it be clear what we are reviewing. We are reviewing the ruling that the evidence was admitted\u2014and nothing more. If the ruling was correct for the reasons advanced by the trial judge, it will be affirmed. If it turns out to have been correct for any other reason, it will also be affirmed. We are not scrutinizing the trial court\u2019s reasoning in arriving at his decision. We are scrutinizing the naked decision itself. <em>State v. Breeden, </em>333 Md. 212, 227 n. 5, 634 A.2d 464 (1993); <em>Robeson v. State, </em>285 Md. 498, 502, 403 A.2d 1221 (1979); <em>Aubinoe v. Lewis, </em>250 Md. 645, 649, 244 A.2d 879 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">\n<em>Former Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">We agree with Tyler that the transcript did not qualify as the \u201cfirmly rooted exception\u201d of Former Testimony. Although Maryland Rule of Evidence 5-804(b)(l), effective on July 1, 1994, was not in effect, as such, at the time of Tyler\u2019s trial, it accurately reflects the pre-existing Maryland case law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>on the classic Hearsay Exception known as Former Testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-4\">(b) Hearsay Exceptions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">(1) Former Testimony</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">Testimony given as a witness in any action or proceeding or in a deposition taken in compliance with law in the course of any action or proceeding, <em>if the party against whom the testimony is now offered, </em>or, in a civil action or proceeding, a predecessor in interest, <em>had an opportunity </em>and similar motive <em>to develop the testimony by </em>direct, <em>cross, </em>or redirect <em>examination. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Although every other criterion for admissibility as Former Testimony was indisputably satisfied, Tyler, as a non-party, had no opportunity to examine Eiland at Eiland\u2019s separate trial in December 1993. The State\u2019s interest in cross-examining Eiland at that trial was not remotely <em>in pari materia </em>with what Tyler\u2019s interest would have been. Eiland was in the act of laying off all of the blame on Tyler. Tyler\u2019s interest would have been to forfend that transference of blame <em>in toto </em>and to pile all of it on Eiland alone. The State was content to have Eiland unload the lion\u2019s share of the blame onto Tyler, just so long as it could keep some subsidiary or accomplice-level blame on Eiland. The State was not positioned to serve as a surrogate cross-examiner for Tyler. The transcript, therefore, did not qualify as Former Testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">\n<em>The Larger Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">We share the outlook on this trial, indeed on this whole series of three trials over a four-year period, expressed by Judge Ahalt as he first encountered the contemptuous recalcitrance of Eiland in his refusal to abide by the judge\u2019s order and to answer the questions put to him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>I further conclude that he has been asked relevant questions of inquiry in the trial that we are presently in the process of conducting; that he has no justified reason for not testifying. He has testified fully and openly and completely in a prior proceeding concerning these same events.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">I further conclude that his failure to testify could result in a substantial interference with the right of the public to proceed in a public adjudication and a full revelation of all facts, and the truth of the matter that is in question before this Court, and. because of his unfounded, unjustified refusal and unarticulated refusal, there is a substantial public safety concern with respect to the abilities of our community to bring justice in an orderly open fashion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Judge Ahalt then repeatedly stated that his primary interest was in discovering a way \u201cwhere <em>substantial justice </em>[could] be done <em>for the community\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) Whatever may be the ability of lawyers to appreciate the procedural niceties that can produce aberrational results, the commonsense-oriented perception of the public contains a hard kernel of countervailing validity. A senseless killing shocked a community. It is undisputed that the lethal bullets were fired by Tyler or Eiland. Largely through the procedural device of obtaining a trial severance to which they were not necessarily entitled, each might point an uncontradicted finger of blame at the other and thereby walk out of the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">In the public eye, two clever and manipulative defendants, one of whom at the very least was necessarily guilty, would thereby make a laughingstock out of the criminal justice system. Judge Ahalt was loathe to let that happen. Under these circumstances, we are loathe to hold that he abused his discretion in a heroic effort \u201cto keep the balance true.\u201d Whatever the formal issues on this appeal may be, there looms the larger and transcendent question, \u201cCan the law allow Tyler and Eiland, individually or collectively, to get away with this?\u201d The answer may turn out to be \u201cYes,\u201d but only after we have exhausted every effort to see if Judge Ahalt\u2019s evidentiary ruling can reasonably be sustained, either on the basis advanced by him or on some other basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>\n<em>Nance v. State</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">The promise of a redeeming affirmance may lie in <em>Nance v. State, </em>331 Md. 549, 629 A.2d 633 (1993), with a plausible \u201cpushing out of the envelope\u201d at one of Nance\u2019s edges. In <em>Nance, </em>the Court of Appeals wrought a dramatic change in the Maryland law of evidence. If one sought to capture the central meaning or core significance of that change in an identifying label or incisive title, that label or title would inevitably be something closely resembling \u201cCounteracting the Turncoat Witness.\u201d Indeed, in the opening bar of the <em>Nance </em>opinion, Judge McAuliffe sounded its <em>leitmotif: </em>\u201cThis case presents the classic evidentiary problem of the turncoat witness.\u201d 331 Md. at 552, 629 A.2d 633. The threshold question becomes, \u201cDoes Gerald Eiland qualify for the category \u2018Turncoat Witness\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\"><em>A. </em>Was <em>Eiland a Turncoat Witness?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Gerald Eiland was a quintessential turncoat witness. At his separate trial in December, 1993, he took the stand and, under oath, narrated in exquisite detail the events of December 4, 1990, at the Prince George\u2019s Plaza Mall immediately before the fatal shooting. He then expressly and articulately described how Tyler reached across his body and fired a number of shots into the Toyota in which Jay Bias was riding.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Eiland never at any time, before or after that testimony, took a different position or espoused a different version of the events. At the initial joint trial of himself and Tyler, to be sure, he did not take the stand, but the legal theory forcefully championed by his defense team was punctiliously consistent with his 1993 trial testimony. At no time did he ever give a different version to the police; to the prosecution; or, for all we know, to Tyler. Saving only the hurdle of whether he was legally entitled to invoke a testimonial privilege, there was every reason to believe that at Tyler\u2019s trial Eiland would testify (if not privileged) exactly as he had testified at his own separate trial. His own lawyers indicated, in a colloquy with Judge Ahalt, that as of Tuesday evening, the night before he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>was scheduled to appear in court, they had \u201cevery indication\u201d that \u201che was ready to come to court.\u201d No one, with the possible exception of Tyler, had any reason to anticipate his defiant silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Indeed, under circumstances far less compelling than those presented by Eiland\u2019s sworn testimony, we found in <em>Devan v. State, </em>17 Md.App. 182, 190-91, 300 A.2d 705 (1973), that the State had every reason to anticipate favorable testimony against the defendant in that case from a former codefendant who had earlier entered a plea of guilty. Although the would-be witness there had not, at his own appearance before the court, taken the stand or given sworn testimony, he had stood acquiescently by when a statement of facts was recited. That acquiescence was deemed by us to be circumstantial evidence that the witness would subsequently testify in a manner consistent with that statement of facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">Hargrove stood mute. His plea of guilty before Judge Liss; the statement of facts recited in his and his counsel\u2019s presence; the trial judge\u2019s comments about Devan\u2019s connection with the robbery and expressed belief that Hargrove would so testify, constituted, by circumstantial evidence, acknowledgment by Hargrove that the statements were true and that he would testify in accordance with their tenor. Thus, by standing mute, his conduct naturally would be interpreted by the State as his statement that Devan participated in the robbery and that Hargrove would so testify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">17 Md.App. at 190-91, 300 A.2d 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Labelling the disappointing witness as a turncoat, however, requires, in addition to the element of testimonial disappointment, some consideration of the modality by which the witness turned his coat. The common denominator predicate would be that the initially promising, witness, by virtue of 1) some earlier statement to the police or the prosecutor or others or 2) some earlier testimony before a grand jury or in the course of a trial, had given some indication that his trial testimony would be helpful to the party calling him. Eiland\u2019s earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>trial testimony gave just such promise. The modalities for becoming a \u201cturncoat\u201d might then include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">1) Assuming the stand, taking the oath, and then repudiating the earlier statements<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and also, perhaps, testifying to the contrary<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">2) Assuming the stand, taking the oath, and then, without repudiating the earlier statements <em>per se, </em>casting those earlier statements in a far different interpretative light<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, effectively repudiating them without formally doing so;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">3) Assuming the stand, taking the oath, and then professing selectively a convenient lapse of memory as to certain critical events<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and also, perhaps, a convenient lapse of memory as to ever having made the earlier statements<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>4) Assuming the stand, taking the oath, and then professing a total lapse of memory as to the entire criminal episode and also, perhaps, a total lapse of memory about making any earlier statements<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">5) Assuming the stand, taking the oath, and then refusing to answer any critical questions even when ordered to do so by the trial judge<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and also, perhaps, refusing to give a reason for refusing to answer the questions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">We see no principled distinction between modalities No. 3 and No. 4, selective or total lapse of memory, on the one hand, and modality No. 5, refusing to answer questions, on the other hand. Edward W. Cleary, <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>755 (3rd ed. 1984), considered the case of the witness who \u201cseeks refuge in forgetfulness\u201d and noted \u201cthe parallel to the witness who simply refuses to testify\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">The witness who falsely asserts loss of memory is simply refusing to testify in a way that he hopes will avoid a collision with the judge. He is present in court, by definition, and subject to cross-examination. If his claim is false, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>he is in principle at least liable to contempt proceedings, though perhaps less effectively than in cases of simple refusal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">There is no functional difference between the witness on the stand who responds with the litany \u201cI can\u2019t remember,\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t remember,\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t remember\u201d and another witness on the stand who responds with the essentially indistinguishable litany \u201cI can\u2019t answer that question,\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t answer that question,\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t answer that question.\u201d To permit a turncoat witness to gain some tactical advantage by employing one modality of resistance rather than another strikes us as imprudent policy. We choose, to borrow a phrase from Kipling, \u201cto treat those two impostors both the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">\n<em>B. The Turncoat Witness vs. the Turncoat Non-Witness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">In Maryland, at least, the entire evidentiary phenomenon epitomized by <em>Nance </em>is so new that inevitably we are operating, in instance after instance of considering Nance\u2019s possible applicability, in still unmapped borderlands of the law. <em>See, </em>however, <em>Stewart v. State, 104 </em>Md.App. 273, 655 A.2d 1345 (1995) and <em>Makell v. State, </em>104 Md.App. 334, 656 A.2d 348 (1995). The whole <em>Nance </em>arsenal, of course, is aimed at the turncoat witness, not at the turncoat non-witness. The immediate threshold problem is presented, therefore, of whether Eiland\u2019s testimonial defiance of Judge Ahalt\u2019s order qualified him, within the contemplation of <em>Nance, </em>as a turncoat witness rather than as a turncoat non-witness. It is a close question and although the equities are by no means unmixed, we conclude that Eiland was a \u201cwitness,\u201d as <em>Nance </em>uses that term of art.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">At the outset, we would distinguish the situation in this case from that in <em>Simmons v. State, </em>333 Md. 547, 636 A.2d 463 (1994). The difference is critical, even though slight. In <em>Simmons, </em>the recalcitrant witness \u201crefused even to take the stand much less testify.\u201d 333 Md. at 554, 636 A.2d 463. He publicly declaimed, \u201cI\u2019m not taking an oath. I\u2019m not going to testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the present case, by contrast, Eiland took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>the witness stand and took the oath. In response to question1 ing, he not only gave his name and address but showed a willingness to respond to various questions that he deemed to be innocuous. He only responded with \u201cI can\u2019t answer that question\u201d on an <em>ad hoc, </em>question-by-question basis. It seemed that his refusals to answer may have been triggered by his own assessment of what might be self-incriminating and that he was invoking, albeit contemptuously, his own privilege against compelled self-incrimination notwithstanding the judge\u2019s ruling that he was not entitled to do so. In the case of Eiland, there was nothing to prevent the fact finders from looking upon him, listening to him, observing his demeanor as he answered or refused to answer, and assessing him in some meaningful fashion. None of this occurred in <em>Simmons v. State.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Another critical difference between this case and <em>Simmons v. State </em>should also be carefully noted. <em>Simmons </em>was dealing, 333 Md. at 559, 636 A.2d 463, with an individual\u2019s status of \u201cunavailability\u201d as a witness. It was dealing with that status, however, in the liberalized context of facilitating the admissibility of hearsay evidence. One\u2019s \u201cunavailability\u201d as a witness in the <em>Nance </em>context, by way of dispositive contrast, would serve as a bar to the admissibility of evidence. As will be discussed far more fully later in this opinion and has been firmly established by the Supreme Court, \u201cunavailability\u201d for one evidentiary purpose is by no means \u201cunavailability\u201d for all evidentiary purposes. In terms of facilitating the admission of evidence, the finding of \u201cunavailability\u201d in <em>Simmons </em>and a finding of \u201cunavailability\u201d in this case would point in diametrically opposite directions. Of this, however, more anon.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Before alluding again to the functional similarity between the respective responses, \u201cI can\u2019t answer the question\u201d and \u201cI can\u2019t remember,\u201d we would note that even a refusal to answer a question, in the view and hearing of the jury, can have communicative content and substance. On this question, we find at least oblique support from the excellent and thought-provoking analysis of Judge Bloom in <em>Kulbicki v. State, </em>102 Md.App. 376, 649 A.2d 1173 (1994). Although the procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>postures of that case and of this differ significantly, there is a small but hard kernel of similarity that we find especially helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">In <em>Kulbicki, </em>the resolution of a key issue before this Court depended on the assessment and characterization of the testimony of a defense witness, Darryl Marciszewski. The precise issue was whether that witness\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with the testimony of two State\u2019s rebuttal witnesses so as to trigger the State\u2019s entitlement even to offer those witnesses in rebuttal. If the defense witness had truly communicated the message, as he did in so many words, that he did not kill the victim, there was nothing for the State\u2019s rebuttal witnesses to rebut and the decision to permit them to testify would have been error. 102 Md.App. at 383-84, 649 A.2d 1173.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The State, however, argued that although the witness\u2019s spoken words had conveyed one message, the combination of his demeanor and his initial refusal to answer the critical question conveyed a diametrically different \u201cunspoken message.\u201d Judge Bloom summed up the thrust of the State\u2019s argument that the witness had managed to convey, though not in so many words, a message that was inconsistent with the testimony offered by the rebuttal witnesses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">[The State] argued that, although the testimony of Ms. Czajkowski and Ms. Dean did not rebut Marciszewski\u2019s spoken testimony, it did rebut the unspoken message that he was conveying. In other words, the State asserts that Marciszewski\u2019s testimony consisted not only of what he said but also the manner in which he said it. The State contends that the unspoken message conveyed by Marciszewski was that he, not the appellant, committed the murder, so the testimony of Ms. Dean and Ms. Czajkowski concerning Marciszewski\u2019s plan to exonerate appellant was proper rebuttal evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">102 Md.App. at 384, 649 A.2d 1173.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">At the outset, this Court, through Judge Bloom, confirmed the validity of the State\u2019s position that testimonial or commu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>nicative content is not to be derived solely from the- words a witness speaks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">We recognize that, although a person\u2019s spoken words may technically convey one message, the implied message that is actually conveyed can contradict the spoken words.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">102 Md.App. at 385, 649 A.2d 1173.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">In support of its position that the alternative and. unspoken message had actually been the one delivered, the State offered four items. Two were peripheral bits of circumstantial evidence, one acknowledging anger toward the murder victim and the second linking the' witness as well as the defendant with an arguably incriminating jacket. The third item was the witness\u2019s inability to remember his whereabouts on the day of the crime. The fourth item, of particular significance for us, was the initial refusal to answer a critical question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">The State also relies on the fact that Marciszewski, during cross-examination, twice refused to answer when the State asked him whether he killed Ms. Neuslein, and answered only after the trial judge threatened to hold him in contempt of court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">102 Md.App. at 384-85, 649 A.2d 1173.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">We held that the unspoken message had been the one actually delivered and that the rebuttal witnesses, who contradicted and impeached that message, had been properly permitted to testify. The communicative content of that unspoken message, moreover, was derived, at least in part, from the refusal of the witness on two occasions to answer the critical question. Judge Bloom explained the reasons for our conclusion in that regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-11\">His prior direct testimony, <em>coupled with the fact that he twice refused to answer when asked on cross-examination whether he murdered Ms. Nueslein, </em>could have led, and was perceived by the court as designed to lead, the jury to infer that he was guilty of murdering her ... (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">102 Md.App. at 385, 649 A.2d 1173.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-13\">It is true, to be sure, that the refusal of the witness to answer a question in the <em>Kulbicki </em>case did not occur in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>vacuum but in conjunction, rather, with other testimonial behavior, whereas in the case before us Eiland\u2019s refusal stands essentially alone. The common denominator, however, is that <em>a refusal to answer is </em>nonetheless <em>testimonial behavior that possesses, </em>in and of itself, <em>possible communicative content. </em>If, qualitatively speaking, a refusal to answer is, as <em>Kulbicki </em>has established, a legitimate factor in a larger communicative equation, it is not utterly bereft of communicative significance even when standing alone. What was sufficiently inconsistent in <em>Kulbicki </em>to permit rebuttal testimony was sufficiently inconsistent in this case to permit the introduction of the prior inconsistent statement. The refusal to testify that contributed to the triggering inconsistency in <em>Kulbicki </em>constituted the triggering inconsistency in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The bottom line is that a hearsay declarant who is present in the courtroom, who takes the witness stand, who is administered the oath, who answers some innocuous questions, but who then refuses to answer more critical questions is not in the same category as other hearsay declarants who are dead or missing beyond the seas.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The appellant argues that even if Eiland was present in the courtroom and on the witness stand and under oath and vulnerable to have questions put to him, there could be no meaningful cross-examination or confrontation if the answer to every non-innocuous question was probably going to be, \u201cI can\u2019t answer the question.\u201d The complaint in this regard is essentially indistinguishable from what it would be if the probable answers were consistently going to be, \u201cI can\u2019t remember.\u201d It is, therefore, to the cases, both from the Supreme Court and from this Court, dealing with the effect of loss of memory on the availability for cross-examination that we must look for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">In <em>Delaware v. Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. 15, 106 S.Ct. 292, 88 L.Ed.2d 15 (1985), the loss of memory by a critical expert witness was significant, albeit not total. The Supreme Court held that that did not deny the defendant the opportunity to cross-examine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>[I]t does not follow that the right to cross-examine is denied by the State whenever the witness\u2019 lapse of memory impedes one method of discrediting him ... Generally speaking, the Confrontation Clause guarantees an <em>opportunity </em>for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish. (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">474 U.S. at 19-20, 106 S.Ct. at 294. <em>See also Kentucky v. Stincer, </em>482 U.S. 730, 739, 107 S.Ct. 2658, 2664, 96 L.Ed.2d 631, 643 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">In <em>California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970), the Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, against a Confrontation Clause challenge, on other grounds and, therefore, did not find it necessary to decide the admissibility of a key witness\u2019s out-of-court statement to a police officer concerning events that at trial he was unable to recall. The scholarly concurring opinion of Justice Harlan, however, would have addressed that issue and would have concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">The fact that the witness, though physically available, cannot recall either the underlying events that are the subject of an extra-judicial statement or previous testimony or recollect the circumstances under which the statement was given, does not have Sixth Amendment consequence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKc\">399 U.S. at 188, 90 S.Ct. at 1951. (Concurring opinion by Harlan, J.). That concurring opinion by Justice Harlan became the law of the land eighteen years later in <em>United States v. Owens, </em>484 U.S. 554, 559, 108 S.Ct. 838, 842, 98 L.Ed.2d 951, 957 (1988):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">Here that question is squarely presented, and we agree with the answer suggested 18 years ago by Justice Harlan. \u201c[T]he Confrontation Clause guarantees only \u2018an <em>opportuni-. ty </em>for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-9\"><em>United States v. Owens </em>is a strong case in point. The victim of a brutal assault was unable to recall the identity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>his assailant and was largely unable to recall the circumstances of a hospital room interview in which he identified the defendant as his assailant. At issue was the admissibility of a third party\u2019s testimony to the effect that the victim had, from the hospital room, made such an identification. Justice Brennan, in dissent, described the inability of the defendant to conduct a meaningful cross-examination because of the memory loss as being virtually as abject as would have been the case if the declarant had been dead or had asserted a testimonial privilege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">The principal witness against respondent was not the John Foster who took the stand in December 1983\u2014that witness could recall virtually nothing of the events of April 12, 1982, and candidly admitted that he had no idea whether respondent had assaulted him. Instead, respondent\u2019s sole accuser was the John Foster who, on May 5, 1982, identified respondent as his attacker. This John Foster, however, did not testify at respondent\u2019s trial; the profound memory loss he suffered during the approximately 18 months following his identification prevented him from affirming, explaining, or elaborating upon his out-of-court statement just as surely and completely as his assertion of a testimonial privilege, or his death, would have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">484 U.S. at 566, 108 S.Ct. at 846. (Dissenting opinion by Brennan, J.). Notwithstanding the argument that the memory loss was an effective bar to any meaningful status as a witness subject to cross-examination, the Supreme Court approved the reception of the out-of-court identification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">The weapons available to impugn the witness\u2019s statement when memory loss is asserted will of course not always achieve success, but successful cross-examination is not the constitutional guarantee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">484 U.S. at 560, 108 S.Ct. at 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">In <em>Bullock v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 85, 543 A.2d 858 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>313 Md. 688, 548 A.2d 128 (1988), this Court dealt with a memory loss more severe than that suffered by the victim in <em>United States v. Owens. </em>On the critical question of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>identity of the defendant as the assailant, the victim\u2019s memory loss was total. The robbery victim had suffered a serious beating. He could not identify the defendant at trial. Although he had identified the defendant to a police officer in a street show-up shortly after the crime, the victim suffered a total memory blackout as to even have participated in that extrajudicial identification procedure. In his analysis, Judge Alpert pointed out that the memory loss in the <em>Bullock </em>case was total:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\">This case is one step removed from <em>Owens, </em>however. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the identifying witness could no longer remember having identified the appellant as his assailant and, consequently, the State did not attempt to identify appellant through the victim\u2019s testimony. Instead, the State had Deputy Chambers testify that Mr. Reinert had identified the appellant as his assailant at the show-up at the shopping center.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">76 Md.App. at 92, 543 A.2d 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">In <em>Bullock, </em>the victim\u2019s total lack of memory as to the identity of his assailant was such that the State did not even question him as to the defendant\u2019s criminal agency. Even under those circumstances, we held that the defendant\u2019s entitlement to call the victim as his own witness was fully as effective as would have been his opportunity to cross-examine him had the State used him as a witness on the issue of criminal agency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">Mr. Reinert was available in the courtroom to be examined concerning his identification of appellant at the shopping center. We understand appellant\u2019s concern that he was not in a position where he could cross-examine Reinert about the show-up ... Under Maryland law, however, the opportunity to call Reinert as a witness and question him about the identification is sufficient to satisfy appellant\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">76 Md.App. at 93, 543 A.2d 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">Relying primarily on <em>United States v. Owens, </em>we held that the police officer\u2019s testimony as to the victim\u2019s identification of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>the defendant was admissible as substantive evidence. The victim was present in court and subject to being called as a witness, notwithstanding the essential futility of trying to get anything out of him by way of meaningful cross-examination. Judge Alpert expressed the holding of the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">[Ijnsofar as Reinert\u2019s lack of memory is concerned, as we noted <em>supra, </em>the Supreme Court held in <em>Owens </em>that a witness\u2019s testimony that he had previously identified the defendant as the perpetrator of a crime was admissible even though he could not then identify the defendant as his attacker. We recognize that in this case, unlike in <em>Owens, </em>Reinert could no longer remember identifying the defendant. We believe, however, that this also bears only on the weight to be given the identification by the trier of fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">76 Md.App. at 94, 543 A.2d 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Eiland was present in the courtroom, just as was the robbery victim in <em>Bullock. </em>Eiland took the oath and was subject to being questioned, just as did the robbery victim in <em>Bullock. </em>In neither case was there any realistic likelihood of getting anything out of the witness, either on direct or cross-examination. We see no distinction between Eiland\u2019s status as a witness and that of the robbery victim in <em>Bullock.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">In terms of satisfying one of the threshold requirements of <em>Nance </em>and of Md.Rule 5-802.1, our narrow focus for the moment is on the isolated question of whether Jerry Eiland was a \u201cwitness\u201d or a \u201cnon-witness.\u201d There is a subtle but critically dispositive difference between the <em>recalcitrant non-witness </em>and the <em>recalcitrant witness. </em>Neither, to be sure, is willing to answer a question, but they manifest their noncooperation in different ways and in different places. It is the recalcitrant <em>non-witness </em>who refuses even to take the stand, <em>Simmons v. State, </em>333 Md. 547, 636 A.2d 463 (1994), or, perhaps, even to come to the courthouse. It is, by way of contrast, the recalcitrant <em>witness </em>who, on the stand and under oath, refuses to answer certain questions even when directed to do so by. the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Eiland in this case was present in the courtroom, voluntarily took the witness stand when called, voluntarily took the oath, voluntarily answered certain questions, and then contemptuously declined to answer other questions. His recalcitrance and his contempt, therefore, was that of a witness, not that of a non-witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">His unprivileged refusal to answer certain questions did not, <em>ipso facto, </em>transform him from a witness into a non-witness. The case law holds that even a refusal by a witness to answer questions may still have evidentiary significance. <em>Kulbicki v. State, </em>102 Md.App. 376, 649 A.2d 1173 (1994); <em>United States v. Hearst, </em>563 F.2d 1331, 1341-42 (9th Cir.1977) (\u201cTherefore, it was permissible for the Government to ask questions about this period, even though they led to 42 assertions of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d); <em>United States v. Beechum, </em>582 F.2d 898, 909 (5th Cir.1978) (\u201cMoreover, in that instance the Government would have been entitled to comment on Beechum\u2019s refusal to answer, notwithstanding the prohibition on such comment where the privilege is properly invoked.\u201d) Whatever other threshold requirements must be satisfied, Eiland was a \u201cwitness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">\n<em>C. The Threshold of \u201cAvailability\u201d and Its Shifting Meaning</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Nance\u2019s threshold requirement that the hearsay declarant be a \u201cwitness\u201d and its threshold requirement that the hearsay declarant be \u201cavailable for cross-examination\u201d may be completely co-terminous. Each may, on the other hand, largely overlap the other but still retain some subtle and unique quality of its own. In either event, we shall utilize the rubric of \u201cavailability for cross-examination\u201d to analyze one important aspect of the threshold requirement not yet discussed. <em>Nance </em>provides, 331 Md. at 560, 629 A.2d 633:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">It is well settled in Maryland that a court may admit, as substantive proof, evidence of a third party testifying as to an extrajudicial identification by an eyewitness.... <em>where the out-of-court declarant is present at trial and subject to cross-examination. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>As to the use of prior inconsistent statements as substantive evidence, <em>Nance, </em>331 Md. at 565, 629 A.2d 633, characterized the \u201cmodern rule\u201d as sanctioning the substantive use of the statements \u201cprovided the declarant is present at trial and subject to cross-examination.\u201d The intermediate position championed by five states and adopted by <em>Nance </em>requires that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\">statement was reduced to a writing signed or adopted by the declarant, and the declarant is a witness at trial and subject to cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">331 Md. at 567-68, 629 A.2d 633. Its final holding in this regard, 331 Md. at 569, 629 A.2d 633, is that the prior inconsistent statement is substantive evidence if the declarant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABS\">is subject to cross-examination at the trial where the prior statement is introduced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">With respect to the admissibility of prior grand jury testimony, <em>Nance, </em>331 Md. at 571, 629 A.2d 633, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">The declarant must also, of course, be present as a witness at trial to be tested by cross-examination in regard to the former grand jury appearance and its contents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">The crucial question becomes that of defining the notion of \u201cunavailable for cross-examination\u201d or \u201cunavailable as a witness.\u201d The law dealing with the <em>admissibility </em>of evidence pursuant to those hearsay exceptions that require the unavailability of the declarant, on the one hand, defines \u201cunavailability\u201d liberally. Both Federal Rule of Evidence 804(a) and Maryland Rule of Evidence 5-804(a) treat, in <em>verbatim </em>language, as \u201cunavailable\u201d declarants not only those who are dead, insane, absent beyond the seas, of whereabouts unknown, or shielded by a testimonial privilege, but also a declarant who</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-10\">(2) persists in refusing to testify concerning the subject matter of the declarant\u2019s statement despite an order of the court to do so<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>(3) testifies to a lack of memory of the subject matter of the declarant\u2019s statement;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The law of evidence, however, has made a subtle but critical distinction between the meaning of \u201cunavailability\u201d in that context and the meaning of \u201cunavailability\u201d in the very different context presented by this case. Both new Maryland Rule of Evidence 5-804(a)(3) .and Federal Rule of Evidence 804(a)(3), for instance, treat the forgetful witness as sufficiently \u201cunavailable\u201d for the purpose of promoting the freer admissibility of certain hearsay exceptions. <em>Nance, </em>on the other hand, does not treat the forgetful witness as \u201cunavailable\u201d for the diametric purpose of <em>barring </em>the admissibility of evidence. \u201cUnavailability\u201d as a key and \u201cunavailability\u201d as a bar are not treated the same way.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">As the <em>Nance </em>case illustrates, there is a decided liberalizing trend in the law of evidence favoring the freer admissibility of evidence. One manifestation of that trend is the facilitating of the <em>admissibility </em>of evidence under those hearsay exceptions that are contingent on the unavailability of the hearsay declarant, or more precisely the unavailability of the testimony of the hearsay declarant. Involved here, of course, is the small cluster of exceptions collected under Federal Rule of Evidence 804 and under Maryland Rule of Evidence 5-804, featuring such prominent members as Dying Declarations, Former Testimony, and Declarations Against Interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">With the Dying Declaration, of course, the requisite showing of unavailability remains as' morbid as it always has been. With regard to the other exceptions in this group, however, the law of evidence is quick to find \u201cunavailability,\u201d as a key to <em>admissibility, </em>in a number of circumstances. Let it be carefully noted, however, that that is a context in which a finding of unavailability is the necessary avenue for <em>admissibility. </em>Everything that suffices to get evidence in does not necessarily suffice to keep evidence out. That is a far cry from a situation, such as in <em>Nance, </em>where a finding of unavailability for cross-examination triggers not a liberalizing <em>admissibility </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>but a foreclosing <em>inadmissibility. </em>Whereas admissibility is favored, inadmissibility is disfavored.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\"><em>Nance </em>is a good illustration of how attitude may shift with changing context and changing purpose. The lapse of memory by a witness, which would easily have constituted the necessary unavailability to permit the introduction of Former Testimony or a Declaration Against Interest, was held not to constitute unavailability so as to bar the introduction of the prior inconsistent statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The Supreme Court, moreover, has never found a witness\u2019s loss of memory to represent the unavailability for cross-examination that will <em>bar </em>the introduction of evidence. <em>Cf. Delaware v. Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. 15, 19-22, 106 S.Ct. 292, 294-96, 88 L.Ed.2d 15, 19-21 (1985); <em>California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The apparent anomaly that a witness might be deemed \u201cunavailable for cross-examination\u201d so as to facilitate admissibility under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(a)(3) or Maryland Rule of Evidence 5-804 under circumstances that would not be deemed \u201cunavailable for cross-examination\u201d so as to bar admissibility under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(C) or Maryland Rule of Evidence 5-802.1(a) was dealt with squarely in <em>United States v. Owens, </em>484 U.S. 554, 108 S.Ct. 838, 98 L.Ed.2d 951 (1988). A federal prison counselor suffered a brutal beating to the head with a metal pipe. His skull was fractured and he was hospitalized for almost a month. His memory was severely impaired. While in the hospital the victim was interviewed by an FBI agent and identified Owens as his assailant. He selected a picture of Owens from a photographic array. At trial, however, the victim had almost a total lapse of memory as to both the initial attack and as to the hospital visits and interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">A prerequisite to the admissibility of the photographic identification, under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(C), is that the victim be available for cross-examination. The Supreme Court, through Justice Scalia, held that the memory loss did not render the victim \u201cunavailable for cross-examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>tion\u201d and that the evidence of identification was, therefore, admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Justice Scalia freely acknowledged, however, that the memory loss that did not represent \u201cunavailability\u201d under Rule 801(d)(1)(C) would nonetheless represent \u201cunavailability\u201d under Rule 804(a)(3). He explained that the more liberal' attitude taken under Rule 801(d)(1)(C) was because the admissibility of the evidence is favored:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">The premise for Rule 801(d)(1)(C) was that, given adequate safeguards against suggestiveness, out-of-court identifications were generally preferable to courtroom identifications .... [DJespite the traditional view that such statements were hearsay, the Advisory Committee believed that <em>their use was to he fostered rather than discouraged. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">484 U.S. at 562, 108 S.Ct. at 844. Owens leaped on the inconsistency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">Respondent argues that this reading is impermissible because it creates an internal inconsistency in the Rules, since the forgetful witness who is deemed \u201csubject to cross-examination\u201d under 801(d)(1)(C) is simultaneously deemed \u201cunavailable\u201d under 804(a)(3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">484 U.S. at 563, 108 S.Ct. at 844. In dismissing the significance of the apparent inconsistency, Justice Scalia explained that the two rules serve two very different policies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-9\">It seems to us, however, that this is not a substantive inconsistency, but only a semantic oddity resulting from the fact that Rule 804(a) has for convenience of reference in Rule 804(b) chosen to describe the circumstances necessary in order to admit certain categories of hearsay testimony under the rubric \u201cunavailability as a witness.\u201d These circumstances include not only absence from the hearing, but also claims of privilege, refusals to obey a court\u2019s order to testify, and inability to testify based on physical or mental illness or memory loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-10\"><em>Id. </em>The very different treatment of the concept of unavailability for cross-examination simply</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>presents the verbal curiosity that the witness is \u201csubject to cross-examination\u201d under Rule 801 while at the same time \u201cunavailable\u201d under Rule 804(a)(3). <em>Quite obviously, the two characterizations are made for two entirely different purposes and there is no requirement or expectation that they should coincide. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">484 U.S. at 563-64, 108 S.Ct. at 845.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\"><em>California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970), also demonstrates that \u201cunavailability\u201d for one purpose is not necessarily \u201cunavailability\u201d for all purposes. A 16-year-old accomplice testified against the defendant at a preliminary hearing. At the trial, two months later, the witness was sworn but then proved to be \u201cmarkedly evasive and uncooperative on the stand.\u201d 399 U.S. at 151, 90 S.Ct. at 1931. He claimed that he was on \u201cacid\u201d (LSD) at the time of the crime and \u201cwas unable to remember the events.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He asserted that \u201cthe drugs he had taken prevented his distinguishing fact from fantasy.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The Supreme Court held that the Former Testimony from the preliminary hearing was admissible. It pointed out that \u201cthe State here has made every effort to introduce its evidence through the live testimony of the witness; it produced Porter at trial, swore him as a witness, and tendered him for cross-examination.\u201d 399 U.S. at 167, 90 S.Ct. at 1940. It then essentially equated inconsistent testimony, a claimed loss of memory, the invoking of a testimonial privilege, and the refusal to answer questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-8\">Whether Porter then testified in a manner consistent or inconsistent with his preliminary hearing testimony, claimed a loss of memory, claimed his privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, or simply refused to answer, nothing in the Confrontation Clause prohibited the State from also relying on his prior testimony to prove its case against Green.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">399 U.S. at 167-68, 90 S.Ct. at 1940. The Court further observed that a loss of memory is classically a sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>showing of \u201cunavailability\u201d to open the gate for the Former Testimony hearsay exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-4\">The hearsay exception itself has generally recognized that a witness is \u201cunavailable\u201d for purposes of the exception where through lapse of memory or a plea of the Fifth Amendment privilege, the State cannot secure his live testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">399 U.S. at 168 n. 17, 90 S.Ct. at 1940 n. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">In addition to the Former Testimony from the preliminary hearing, the State also introduced as substantive evidence prior inconsistent statements given to a police officer under the \u201cmodern rule\u201d which goes even further than <em>Nance. </em>The California Supreme Court had not found it necessary to consider whether the witness\u2019s memory loss rendered him \u201cunavailable for cross-examination\u201d or not for purposes of that evidentiary ruling. The United States Supreme Court remanded so that California might consider that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">For our present purposes, the significance of the Supreme Court remand is that its holding that the witness was \u201cunavailable\u201d so as to legitimate the admission of the transcript from the preliminary hearing under the Former Testimony hearsay exception by no means automatically or <em>ipso facto </em>settled the different \u201cunavailability\u201d question for prior inconsistent statements. The separate contexts required separate resolutions of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Similarly, case law as to what constitutes unavailability under Maryland Rule of Evidence 5-804 and its predecessor law, <em>see, e.g., Gaskins v. State, </em>10 Md.App. 666, 677-78, 272 A.2d 413, <em>cert. denied, </em>261 Md. 724 (1971), has little bearing on the very different question of unavailability for cross-examination under Maryland Rule of Evidence 5-802.1(a) and <em>Nance v. State. </em>A trial judge is vested with wide discretion when it comes to a ruling to admit evidence. A reviewing court is enjoined to reverse only in cases of clear abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">\n<em>D. Nance\u2019s Response to Turncoat Witnesses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">Once the threshold requirement (or requirements) has been satisfied that the hearsay declarant is both 1) a witness and 2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>available for cross-examination, Nance\u2019s restorative antidotes are available for use. <em>Nance\u2019s </em>response to the turncoat witnesses in that case was three-fold. The first third of the response was unremarkable. Two of the witnesses had been eyewitnesses to the fatal shooting. Within twenty-four hours of the commission of the crime, both witnesses had identified, from photographic arrays, the defendant Nance as one of the perpetrators. One of those witnesses identified the codefendant Hardy as well. At trial, both witnesses repudiated, in effect, their pretrial identifications by claiming that they had only identified the photographs as being photographs of persons they knew and recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">With respect to the admissibility as substantive evidence of those extrajudicial identifications, the Court of Appeals reaffirmed preexisting Maryland law that such evidence was both admissible and legally sufficient to support a conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">It is well settled in Maryland that a court may admit, as substantive proof, evidence of a third party testifying as to an extrajudicial identification by an eyewitness when made under circumstances precluding the suspicion of unfairness or unreliability, where the out-of-court declarant is present at trial and subject to cross-examination. An extrajudicial identification is sufficient evidence of criminal agency to sustain a conviction, even though the declarant is unable to identify the accused at trial. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">331 Md. at 560-61, 629 A.2d 633. Indeed, <em>Bullock v. State </em>was a classic application of this aspect of the <em>Nance </em>Rule five years before the <em>Nance </em>opinion was handed down.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">It was in the second of its three responses to the problem of the turncoat witness that the <em>Nance </em>opinion broke dramatic new ground. All three of the ultimate turncoat witnesses in that case had been interviewed by the police about events which they had observed first-hand. They had all provided full and descriptive answers. All of their prior statements had been reduced to writing, were read and vouched for by the witnesses, and were then signed by the witnesses. When the witnesses recanted at trial, either by direct repudiation or by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>claimed lapse of memory, the trial judge admitted the prior \u25a0written statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Judge McAuliffe began his analysis by pointing out, 331 Md. at 564, 629 A.2d 633, that Maryland traditionally permitted the use of a prior inconsistent statement only in its non-hearsay capacity for the limited purpose of impeaching the testimonial credibility of the witness on the stand. He further observed that \u201cMaryland is one of only a handful of states to adhere to the orthodox rule barring use of prior inconsistent statements as probative evidence.\u201d 331 Md. at 565, 629 A.2d 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">After a thorough analysis of the merits and demerits of the so-called \u201cmodern rule,\u201d already adopted by sixteen states, whereby prior inconsistent statements are broadly admissible as substantive evidence, the <em>Nance </em>Court took the more cautious approach, adopted by five other states, of moving part-way toward the \u201cmodern rule.\u201d It held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">We hold that the factual portion of an inconsistent out-of-court statement is sufficiently trustworthy to be offered as substantive evidence of guilt when the statement is based on the declarant\u2019s own knowledge of the facts, is reduced to writing and signed or otherwise adopted by him, and he is subject to cross-examination at the trial where the prior statement is introduced. (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">331 Md. at 569, 629 A.2d 633. <em>See also Sheppard v. State, </em>102 Md.App. 571, 650 A.2d 1362 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">The third prong of <em>Nance\u2019s </em>tridentate response to the turncoat witness also has major new significance. It deals with a prior inconsistent statement given by a witness in some formal setting and under oath. It followed the lead of Fed. R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(A) in deeming statements given under such circumstances to be sufficiently reliable to be received as substantive evidence. Judge McAuliffe explained the reliability rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-10\">The requirement of a formal context such as a judicial hearing or grand jury proceeding assures that the declarant did indeed make the prior statement. There will be no doubt that it was accurately recorded and transcribed. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>requirements of an oath and testimony given under penalty of perjury discourage lying, reminding the declarant of punishment by both supernatural and temporal powers. The formal setting, oath, and the reminder of perjury all convey to the declarant the dignity and seriousness of the proceeding, and the need to tell the truth. (Citation omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">331 Md. at 571, 629 A.2d 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">In the <em>Nance </em>case itself, the three turncoat witnesses had all recanted, by direct repudiation or by lapse of memory, their earlier grand jury testimony. Transcripts of their grand jury testimony were admitted. In affirming that ruling by the trial judge, the <em>Nance </em>opinion noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">[A] statement given before a grand jury is made in an atmosphere of formality impressing upon the declarant the need for accuracy; and it will be memorialized in a manner that eliminates concerns about whether the statement was actually made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">The second and third of Nance\u2019s responses to the turncoat witness have since been brought together under the umbrella of the new Md. Rule of Evidence 5-802.1(a). Although the new Rule of Evidence did not take effect until July 1, 1994, after Tyler\u2019s trial in this case had been completed, the new Rule simply reflects the changes made in Maryland law by the <em>Nance </em>opinion. Rule 5-802.1(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-10\">The following statements previously made by a witness who testifies at the trial or hearing and who is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement are not excluded by the hearsay rule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-11\">(a) A statement that is inconsistent with the declarant\u2019s testimony, if the statement was (1) given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at trial, hearing, or other proceeding or in a deposition; (2) reduced to writing and signed by the declarant; or (3) recorded in substantially verbatim fashion by stenographic or electronic means contemporaneously with the making of the statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>The three qualifying conditions spelled out by subsection (a) are in the disjunctive. It is clear that Eiland\u2019s sworn testimony at his December, 1993 trial would redundantly qualify under either (1) or (3). It was testimony given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial. It was also recorded in <em>verbatim </em>fashion by stenographic means at the very time it was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Subsection (a) begins with the more general condition that the trial testimony being offered be \u201cinconsistent with the declarant\u2019s testimony.\u201d At Tyler\u2019s trial, Eiland was in court in answer to a subpoena. He took the stand and was administered the oath. He answered certain innocuous questions. His earlier testimony, of course, had been that he was in the Mercedes with Tyler when Tyler fired the lethal shots. For purposes of establishing inconsistency, we focus in on two sets of questions and answers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">Q: Mr. Eiland, did you shoot Jay Bias?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">A: I can\u2019t answer that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">Q: Were you in the car when Jay Bias was shot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\">A: I can\u2019t answer that question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">We hold that those responses were just as inconsistent with Eiland\u2019s earlier trial testimony as those responses would have been had they taken the following form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-11\">Q: Mr. Eiland, did you shoot Jay Bias?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-12\">A: I can\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-13\">Q: Were you in the car when Jay Bias was shot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-14\">A: I can\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-15\">In <em>Nance, </em>the argument was made by the defendants that the claimed loss of memory on the part of the witnesses denied the defendants any chance of cross-examining the witnesses. The Court of Appeals rejected the defense argument. Inferring that the claimed lapses of memory were not genuine, the Court of Appeals treated the selective and conve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>nient gaps in memory as if they were nothing less than devious ways of refusing to answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">All of the variations upon the rule permitting probative use of out-of-court identifications and statements require that the defendant be present at trial for cross-examination. Petitioners argue that the witnesses\u2019 claimed loss of memory at trial about past events effectively denied the defense any real chance to cross-examine them about their out-of-court identifications and statements. Both the facts and the law refute that argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">Harris, McCormick, and Brown did not uniformly testify that they had no memory of their sessions with police or the grand jury in which they made the identifications or statements. Instead, they remembered some parts of these earlier events, did not remember others, and outright denied or repudiated other parts. Their lapses of memory conspicuously occurred whenever the questions at trial approached matters potentially implicating Nance and Hardy in the murder. The tendency of unwilling or untruthful witnesses to seek refuge in forgetfulness is well recognized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">331 Md. at 571-72, 629 A.2d 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">The Court would not permit such responses to be treated as the denial of an opportunity for cross-examination which would thereby compel the rejection of the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">When witnesses display such a selective loss of memory, a court may appropriately admit their prior statements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">331 Md. at 572, 629 A.2d 633. There is no principled difference between what the witnesses did there and what Eiland did here.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">In <em>California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 153-64, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 1932-38, 26 L.Ed.2d 489, 494-501 (1970), the Supreme Court placed its constitutional imprimatur, as non-violative of the Confrontation Clause, not only on the more cautious approach to greater substantive admissibility represented by <em>Nance </em>and adopted by five other states, but also on the even broader \u201cmodern rule\u201d generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>\n<em>E. Cross-Examination \u201cConcerning the Statement\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">In yet another regard, the appellant is procedurally handicapped in contending that Eiland was not available for cross-examination. The contention is pure speculation, for the appellant never made the slightest effort to cross-examine Eiland.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Let it be noted initially that Md. Rule 5-802.1, which essentially codifies the holding in <em>Nance v. State, </em>does not condition the admissibility, for substantive purposes, of the prior inconsistent statement on the fact that the out-of-court declarant is available or subject to cross-examination generally. The literal threshold requirement is that the out-of-court declarant be one \u201cwho is subject to cross-examination <em>concerning the statement.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The appellant may well make the argument that, in terms of Eiland\u2019s live testimony, the appellant had neither opportunity nor desire to cross-examine until Eiland had given testimony adverse to the appellant\u2019s cause. That is not the type of cross-examination, however, of which the rule speaks. It speaks exclusively of cross-examination \u201cconcerning the statement.\u201d Once the testimony from Eiland\u2019s earlier .trial had been introduced, there was abundant subject matter for the appellant to explore on cross-examination. That, indeed, was the specific type of cross-examination contemplated by <em>Nance v. State. </em>After the witnesses had been subjected to direct examination in <em>Nance, </em>their prior statements, to police and grand jury alike, were introduced for their substantive content. It was at that juncture that the availability of those witnesses for cross-examination with specific reference to those statements became critical:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">All three witnesses were extensively cross-examined by the defense at trial ... They testified that police had misinterpreted their prior remarks, falsely recorded them, or elicited them by coercion....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-9\">. In brief, the witnesses\u2019 testimony served largely to cast doubt on the State\u2019s evidence and thereby to exculpate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>defendants at trial, which is the aim of effective cross-examination by the defense in criminal cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">331 Md. at 573, 629 A.2d 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Once Eiland\u2019s trial testimony had been introduced, there was much that the appellant might seek to do by way of cross-examining Eiland. Eiland had been present in the courthouse and had taken the stand twice, once before his eighteen-day travail and once afterward. On both occasions, he had been willing to assume the witness chair, take the oath, and answer certain questions. After his earlier trial testimony had been introduced, he was still available, presumably in the courthouse or, at most, in some nearby holding facility. Had the appellant requested the opportunity to put questions to Eiland, the court certainly would have accommodated him. The critical procedural factor, however, is that the appellant never made such a request.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">He suggests that any effort to cross-examine would have been futile. We must point out that if for no other reason, it would not have been futile in terms of preserving the issue for appellate review. More significantly, the appellant was positioned for precisely the sort of cross-examination that was conducted in <em>United States v. Hearst, </em>563 F.2d 1331 (9th Cir.1977). The cross-examination in <em>Hearst </em>consisted of forty-two consecutive questions followed by forty-two consecutive assertions of the Fifth Amendment privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">The appellant\u2019s purpose, of course, was to lessen the impact and impeach the credibility of Eiland\u2019s earlier trial testimony. A question to Eiland such as \u201cIs it not true that you lied in your earlier trial testimony and placed the blame on Tyler simply to save yourself?\u201d followed by a response of \u201cI can\u2019t answer that question,\u201d would have had significant impact in casting doubt on that earlier testimony. A series of forty-two such questions and responses, as in <em>Hearst, </em>might have blown Eiland\u2019s earlier trial testimony right out the window. The point is that the effort to cross-examine Eiland might have been anything but futile, but the appellant never made the effort. We can only surmise that the appellant may have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>in some state of delicate detente with Eiland that he did not wish to jeopardize by aggressive cross-examination. The decision to forego that cross-examination, for whatever reason, was his alone, and he must live with its procedural consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">\n<em>Responsibility for Unavailability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">There is a second, and totally independent, reason why we cannot say that Judge Ahalt clearly abused his discretion. It is hornbook law that a party may not reap the benefit of a potential witness\u2019s unavailability if that party bears any responsibility for that unavailability. Edward W. Cleary, <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>754 (3rd ed.1984) observes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">[T]he witness may be physically present in court but his testimony nevertheless unavailable. Of course if the unavailability is by procurement of the party offering the hearsay statement, the requirement ought not to be regarded as satisfied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Lynn McLain, 6 <em>Maryland Evidence </em>445 describes the same principle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">The unavailability must not be due to efforts to prevent the witness from testifying.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-9\"><em>And see Bartell v. Bartell, </em>278 Md. 12, 22-24, 357 A.2d 343 (1976); <em>Bryant v. State, </em>207 Md. 565, 587, 115 A.2d 502 (1955); <em>Howell v. State, 62 </em>Md.App. 278, 289, 489 A.2d 55 (1985). In dealing with those hearsay exceptions that require a showing that the declarant be unavailable as a witness, Federal Rule of Evidence 804(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-10\">A declarant is not unavailable as a witness if his exemption, refusal, claim or lack of memory, inability, or absence is due to the procurement or wrongdoing of the proponent of his statement for the purpose of preventing the witness from attending or testifying.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">Maryland Rule of Evidence 5-804(a) similarly provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-12\">A statement will not qualify under section (b) of this Rule if the unavailability is due to the procurement or wrongdo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>ing of the proponent of the statement for the purpose of preventing the witness from attending or testifying.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">In the <em>Nance </em>setting, of course, the benefit of a showing of unavailability flows in the opposite direction. In a Rule 804 setting, the beneficiary of the showing of unavailability is the proponent of the hearsay exception. In a <em>Nance </em>setting, by contrast, the beneficiary of such a showing is the opponent of the prior inconsistent statement. The principle, however, is the same. As either a proponent or an opponent of hearsay evidence, a party may not benefit from the declarant\u2019s unavailability if that party bears, even inferentially, any responsibility for the unavailability.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">In reviewing discretionary evidentiary rulings, we do not impose formal burdens of production or persuasion on what are, by their very nature, judgment calls. If there was in the surrounding circumstances some support for an evidentiary ruling\u2014by reasonable inference, by logical deduction, by process of elimination, by some even non-verbal sense or \u201cfeel\u201d of the trial mood\u2014we would not label that ruling as a clear abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">In the present case, several different intimations, collectively if not individually, could have given rise to a permissible inference that Tyler, or perhaps his friends and adherents, bore some responsibility for Eiland\u2019s unavailability for cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">Time was when Tyler and Eiland were, if not exactly Damon and Pythias, at least fast friends. When they went to the Prince George\u2019s Plaza Mall together on December 4, 1990, Tyler and Eiland were already companions of long standing. For some time, Tyler, stripped of his driving privileges, had turned the use of his Mercedes over to Eiland. It was Tyler who wanted to go to the mall on December 4 and it was Eiland who accommodated him by serving as his chauffeur. Throughout the several confrontational episodes with Jay Bias and his friends, Tyler and Eiland presented a united front. The inference at least raises its head that Eiland might have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>resorted to any reasonable measure, short of convicting himself, to keep from damaging testimonially his erstwhile friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">As at least a modest additional makeweight, Tyler\u2019s strenuous insistence on a trial severance diminished the likelihood that he would ever be able to cross-examine Eiland. But for the trial severance, Tyler\u2019s determination to take the stand would almost certainly have triggered a reciprocal decision by Eiland. In such an eventuality, Tyler cohld have cross-examined Eiland with a will.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">When on March 3, 1993, a possible trial recess was in the offing with an eye to compelling Eiland\u2019s live testimony, moreover, Tyler strenuously resisted the effort. Judge Ahalt considered and ultimately chose that course of action. The State was fully supportive of any device likely to produce Eiland\u2019s live testimony. Tyler, of course, had protected himself by issuing his own subpoena for Eiland to appear as a witness. To what end, it is hard to figure out. When strategies were being considered, however, to coerce Eiland to be a witness, Tyler strenuously resisted those strategies. He went out of his way to point out to Judge Ahalt the likely futility of even making the effort. A longer continuance, had Tyler not opposed it, might well have turned the tide in favor of Eiland\u2019s live testimony. The inference that Tyler thereby contributed to Eiland\u2019s continuing, even if not initial, unavailability for cross-examination would not have been irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">There finally looms the specter of witness intimidation. Tyler, of course, was in jail, but his friends and adherents were not. There is no direct evidence, to be sure, linking the \u201cTyler camp\u201d to the alleged intimidation. The apparent victim of the intimidation would not reveal even that much. The process of elimination, on the other hand, overwhelmingly pointed in that direction. As one party to the trial, Judge Ahalt enjoyed an infallible vantage point to eliminate himself as the possible culprit. The State, for its part, had everything to lose and nothing to gain from scaring off a key State\u2019s witness. If it was to be believed that the intimidation actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>occurred (and there was a reasonable basis for so believing) Eiland would have had no need to intimidate himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">By process of elimination, whom does that leave? Tyler obviously had much to gain. If he had fended off first Eiland\u2019s live testimony and then the transcript of Eiland\u2019s earlier trial testimony, Tyler might have walked out of the courtroom with a not-guilty verdict. Of all the parties with a possible interest in Eiland\u2019s testimony, only Tyler (or Tyler\u2019s supporters) had a motive to derail it.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\"><em>Nance </em>took a particularly dim view of witness intimidation. It described how one of the turncoat witnesses, Harris, \u201chad been approached by one Ernest Barnes, a friend of the third suspect\u201d and \u201cfeared Barnes would retaliate if he testified.\u201d 331 Md. at 555, 629 A.2d 633. It explained that Harris \u201cwas afraid, \u2018Cause every time he [Barnes] has a problem, about two days or a day after somebody\u2019s always getting beat up or hurt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Another turncoat witness, Brown, had informed the police that a possible codefendant had warned him, \u201cYou don\u2019t know nothing,\u201d and had further informed the police that \u201che was afraid of the men he saw.\u201d 331 Md. at 556, 629 A.2d 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Despite subsequent testimonial denials by the witnesses that they had been threatened or that they were \u201cdeliberately pretending to forget the prior events out of fear,\u201d 331 Md. at 557, 629 A.2d 633, the Court of Appeals duly noted, \u201cThere was evidence that an atmosphere of fear and threats of reprisals existed in the interim between the crime and the trial.\u201d 331 Md. at 567, 629 A.2d 633. Similarly, there was evidence of such an atmosphere here.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">A permissible inference could have been drawn by Judge Ahalt that Tyler, or those supporting him, were at least partially responsible, in one or more of these various ways, for Eiland\u2019s unavailability for cross-examination. Tyler, of course, may not benefit from that unavailability. Under the circumstances, the decision to admit the evidence was not a clear abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>\n<em>A Responsive Comment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The dissenting opinion argues that <em>Nance v. State </em>was not satisfied in this case in two regards: 1) that Eiland\u2019s trial testimony was not inconsistent with the testimony he gave at his own trial in December, 1993; and 2) that Eiland was not available for cross-examination by Tyler at Tyler\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The dissent attempts to drive a wedge of distinction between the answer, \u201cI can\u2019t remember,\u201d and the answer, \u201cI won\u2019t say.\u201d The dissent finds the necessary inconsistency in the lapse of memory that it balks at recognizing in the refusal to testify. With respect to the inconsistency inherent in the claimed loss of memory, the dissent reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">At its core, nearly all testimony at any trial is memory testimony. When a witness says, \u201cI saw [Jerry] Tyler shoot Jay Bias,\u201d this means, \u201cI remember that [Jerry] Tyler shot Jay Bias.\u201d Therefore, if a witness says at a second trial, \u201cI can\u2019t remember who shot Jay Bias,\u201d the two answers <em>are </em>inconsistent. (Footnote omitted.) (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXH\">By parity of reasoning, we see the same inconsistency in the refusal to testify. When the witness at his own trial said, \u201cI saw Jerry Tyler shoot Jay Bias,\u201d that meant, \u201cI will testify that Jerry Tyler shot Jay Bias.\u201d Therefore, if the witness says at a second trial, \u201cI won\u2019t testify that Jerry Tyler shot Jay Bias,\u201d the two answers are similarly inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">In terms of the availability of the out-of-court declarant for cross-examination, we see no difference between this case and <em>California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970). The sixteen-year-old juvenile, Melvin Porter, was neither more nor less available for cross-examination by the defendant in that case than was Gerald Eiland in this case. Although the Supreme Court majority found it unnecessary to decide the admissibility of Melvin Porter\u2019s out-of-court declaration given to the police, Justice Harlan, in his concurring opinion, squarely addressed the issue and was of the opinion that the witness\u2019s essentially total failure of memory did not render him unavailable for cross-examination. As discussed more fully <em>supra, United States v. Owens, </em>484 U.S. 554, 108 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>S.Ct. 838, 98 L.Ed.2d 951 (1988), adopted Justice Harlan\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>California v. Green. </em>The majority opinion of Justice Scalia first noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-5\">Justice Harlan, in a scholarly concurrence, stated that he would have reached the issue of the out-of-court statement and would have held that <em>a witness\u2019s inability to \u201crecall either the underlying events that are the subject of an extrajudicial statement or previous testimony or recollect the circumstances under which the statement was given, </em>does not have Sixth Amendment consequence.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">484 U.S. at 558, 108 S.Ct. at 842. The <em>Owens </em>majority then placed its <em>imprimatur </em>on Justice Harlan\u2019s concurring opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4qW\">Here that question is squarely presented, and <em>we agree with the answer suggested 18 years ago by Justice Harlan. </em>\u201c[T]he Confrontation Clause guarantees only \u2018an <em>opportunity </em>for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis supplied.) (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">484 U.S. at 559, 108 S.Ct. at 842. What substantively can be extracted from a witness is the same regardless of whether the witness consistently answers, \u201cI can\u2019t remember,\u201d or answers \u201cI can\u2019t say.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">At the most fundamental level, <em>Nance </em>was a policy response to the recognized and recurring problem of the \u201cturncoat witness.\u201d When <em>Nance </em>used the phrase \u201cturncoat witness,\u201d there is no disguising the fact that the adjective \u201cturncoat\u201d was used in a starkly pejorative sense. Permeating the opinion was the sense that a witness\u2019s claimed loss of memory was frequently feigned rather than genuine. In no uncertain terms, Nance\u2019s response was that a wilfully uncooperative witness was not going to be allowed to thwart the trial process by feigning a loss of memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">It would undercut the strategic purpose behind the <em>Nance </em>opinion for us now to permit an obstructionist witness, by altering his modality of non-cooperation ever so slightly, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>commit the very testimonial sabotage that <em>Nance </em>was designed to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">We feel compelled to make one other response to the dissenting opinion. It properly characterizes a prior inconsistent statement of a witness offered for its substantive content as hearsay. It properly points out that a hearsay statement, to be admissible, must bear adequate indicia of reliability. It points out further that hearsay is deemed to be reliable if it is based upon a \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d hearsay exception, but that the prior statement in issue here is not a firmly rooted exception. The dissenting opinion then concludes that if the hearsay is not a \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d exception, it may only be deemed admissible if it has \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness,\u201d quoting <em>Nance v. State, </em>331 Md. at 560, 629 A.2d 633. It goes on to conclude that the out-of-court statement here in issue lacks such \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">What the dissent overlooks is that Md. Rule 5-802.1(a), codifying <em>Nance v. State, </em>spells out explicitly what those \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d shall be in the case of a turncoat \"witness. Those express guarantees are that the statement be one:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">(1) given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding or in a deposition; (2) reduced to writing and signed by the declarant; or (3) recorded in substantially verbatim fashion by stenographic or electronic means contemporaneously with the making of the statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Even if the out-of-court statement here in issue were, as the dissent characterizes it, self-serving, it nonetheless expressly passed muster in terms of its trustworthiness by satisfying both the first condition and the third condition spelled out by the Maryland Rule and by <em>Nance v. State. </em>Putting aside any quarrel the dissent may have with whether the threshold conditions of <em>Nance </em>and the Maryland Rule were satisfied, its distinct quarrel with the ultimate reliability of the prior statement is fraught with dire implications. Although it may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>continue to insist that the prior statement was unreliable, it cannot dispute the fact that the statement satisfied fully the only guidelines spelled out by both <em>Nance </em>and the Maryland Rule. If the dissent were correct, therefore, in its assertion that earlier trial testimony, such as that in this case, lacks particularized guarantees of trustworthiness, it would amount to a declaration that the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Nance v. State </em>and Md.Rule 5-802.1(a) are both unconstitutional under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. We do not agree that that is the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The dissenting opinion also relies heavily on the Supreme Court decision of <em>Douglas v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 13 L.Ed.2d 934 (1965), which we find to be completely inapposite. In <em>Douglas, </em>a witness invoked the privilege against compelled self-incrimination. The invocation of the privilege was apparently proper although the <em>Douglas </em>decision does not hinge on that fact. The prosecutorial tactic which the Supreme Court condemned was the reading of an earlier statement given by the witness, sentence-by-sentence, followed intermittently by the question, \u201cDid you make that statement?\u201d The modality for revealing the substance of the statement to the jury consisted exclusively of the prosecutor\u2019s questions, which modality the Supreme Court condemned as being \u201cunder the guise of cross-examination to refresh Lloyd\u2019s recollection.\u201d 380 U.S. at 416, 85 S.Ct. at 1075.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">By contrast, there was no such subterfuge in the present case. Eiland\u2019s earlier sworn testimony at his separate trial was formally and overtly offered and received for its substantive content. There was no subterfuge employed. In the present case, moreover, there is no hint of impropriety in asking questions of one who improperly refuses to answer. As the <em>post-Douglas </em>cases of <em>United States v. Hearst, </em>563 F.2d 1331 (9th Cir.1977), and <em>United States v. Beechum, </em>582 F.2d 898 (5th Cir.1978), make clear, there is a critical distinction between the impermissible continued questioning of one who <em>properly </em>invokes the privilege against compelled self-incrimination and the perfectly permissible continued ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>tioning of one who <em>improperly </em>invokes the privilege or otherwise refuses to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">\n<em>An Alternative Rationale</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">As we acknowledged at the very outset of this opinion, our overriding purpose is, in the spirit of <em>Nance v. State, </em>331 Md. 549, 629 A.2d 633 (1993), to prevent an undisputed \u201cturncoat\u201d from manipulating and impeding the processes of criminal justice. As we further acknowledged, our approach would be to take the basic principles and axioms announced by <em>Nance </em>and then, construing <em>Nance </em>liberally to serve its salutary purpose, to \u201cpush out the envelope\u201d to explore the limits of Nance\u2019s logic. We think we have done so plausibly. For the benefit, however, of those who might be timorous at probing the outer limits of a principle\u2019s logic, we offer an alternative and more modest rationale which does, in our judgment, also serve to sustain the conviction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The dispute over the admission of Eiland\u2019s earlier trial testimony, when reduced to its essence, is not a dispute involving the great bulk of that testimony at all, but only one concerning a very small, albeit critically important, fragment of it. That changes the focus of our analysis as we zero in on the only part of the disputed trial transcript that really matters. The rest is dross. Eiland\u2019s trial testimony, to be sure, consisted of a full narrative account of all of the events of the afternoon of December 4, 1990, leading up to the shooting of Jay Bias. Almost all of that testimony was, when introduced at the appellant\u2019s trial, redundant, cumulative, and undisputed. What Eiland had to say about the preliminary confrontation at the Prince George\u2019s Plaza Mall, about the drive that he and Tyler made across the parking lot in the Mercedes driven by Eiland, and about pulling up in the adjacent lane beside the Toyota occupied by Jay Bias, Andre Campbell, and Tydus Mathis, was indistinguishable from the sworn trial testimony given by the appellant Tyler himself. It matched, moreover, in every significant detail the testimony of Andre Campbell and Tydus Mathis. It added nothing to the State\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>The accounts of Eiland and of Tyler only diverged when they came to the last split second before the shooting. Each claimed total surprise when the other unexpectedly opened fire at the Toyota. It was only on this question of <em>identifying ivho fired the murder weapon </em>that Andre Campbell and Tydus Mathis were of little help, because they had both ducked down a split second before the gun was fired. Shorn, therefore, of its insignificant detail, Eiland\u2019s testimony from his own trial, when offered at the appellant\u2019s trial, established only one critical <em>fact\u2014the identification of the shooter. </em>Campbell, Mathis, and the appellant Tyler himself had already established the fact that the universe of eligible gunmen consisted of only two candidates, the appellant Tyler himself and Eiland. The nub of the case was the identification of the criminal agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">What the transcript from the earlier trial actually represented, as a content-neutral algebraic term, was third-party evidence of a pretrial (extrajudicial) identification. Eiland had been a witness to a shooting. He was able to identify the shooter. In a pretrial (extrajudicial) setting (meaning some forum other than and prior to the trial of this case), he identified the shooter. The modality of the identification was by naming Tyler rather than by pointing a finger at him or at his photograph, but that is a distinction without a difference. He knew Tyler by name and a selection process was unnecessary to the identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Eiland was, moreover, present in the courtroom at the appellant\u2019s trial and available to be called as a witness by the appellant, had the appellant chosen to do so. The third-party witness to Eiland\u2019s pretrial identification of the appellant was, instead of the policeman who is most often cast in the role, the court reporter from the earlier trial or the trial transcript itself. With only these inconsequential differences from the more garden-variety or paradigmatic identification scenario, the evidence in issue was, when reduced to algebraic terms, evidence of a pretrial identification. A single event may be viewed through many prisms, but however else we may char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>acterize what he did, Eiland had identified the gunman as Tyler.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">For the law controlling the admissibility of evidence of a pretrial identification, offered as substantive proof of guilt, we turn to <em>Nance v. State. Nance </em>is not a monolithic opinion dealing with a single evidentiary phenomenon. It deals, rather, with three partially related but distinct evidentiary phenomena. It analyzes each separately: 1) extrajudicial identifications, 331 Md. at 560-64, 629 A.2d 633, 2) prior inconsistent and written statements given to the police, 331 Md. at 564-69, 629 A.2d 633, and 3) prior inconsistent statements given to a grand jury or in some other formal procedure, 331 Md. at 569-71, 629 A.2d 633. Though partially overlapping, the guidelines established by <em>Nance </em>for the admissibility of these respective types of evidence are distinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The unusual aspect about the evidence of pretrial identification now before us is that it is subject to analysis in more than one way\u2014either as an instance of Nance\u2019s first evidentiary phenomenon, a pretrial identification; or as an instance of Nance\u2019s third evidentiary phenomenon, prior sworn testimony. Because the guidelines for admissibility are different for those respective evidentiary phenomena, the evidence in issue might arguably qualify under one framework of analysis even if it fails to qualify under another.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">A critical difference between the two frameworks of analysis is that Eiland\u2019s pretrial behavior, viewed as prior testimony, would require a conclusion that at the appellant\u2019s trial Eiland have given testimony inconsistent with his earlier pretrial declaration; Eiland\u2019s pretrial behavior, viewed as evidence of an extrajudicial identification of the shooter as Tyler, by contrast, would encounter no such requirement of inconsistency-</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\"><em>Nance </em>is clear that evidence of an extrajudicial identification is admissible as long as the out-of-court declarant is present at trial and subject to cross-examination. No present testimony at all, let alone inconsistent present testimony, is required. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Such evidence is not only admissible but is sufficient, in and of itself, to sustain a conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">It is well settled in Maryland that a court may admit, as substantive proof, evidence of a third party testifying as to an extrajudicial identification by an eyewitness when made under circumstances precluding the suspicion of unfairness or unreliability, where the out-of-court declarant is present at trial and subject to cross examination. An extrajudicial identification is sufficient evidence of criminal agency to sustain a conviction, even though the declarant is unable to identify the accused at trial. (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">331 Md. at 560-61, 629 A.2d 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\"><em>Nance </em>speaks of \u201c[ajmple authority supporting] the admission of an extrajudicial identification even where the witness recants at trial.\u201d 331 Md. at 562, 629 A.2d 633. It cites with approval <em>United States v. Elemy, </em>656 F.2d 507, 508 (9th Cir.1981) (Rule enacted to remedy problem where before trial witness identifies the defendant and then, because of fear, refuses to acknowledge his previous identification) and <em>People v. Malone, </em>193 Mich.App. 366, 483 N.W.2d 470, 471-72 (1992) (Extrajudicial identification admitted substantively even though witness refused to acknowledge it at trial). <em>See also United States v. Marchand, </em>564 F.2d 983, 996, (2d Cir.1977); <em>United States v. O'Malley, </em>796 F.2d 891, 898-99 (7th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">How far does the fact of identification go? An extrajudicial identification, by its very nature, inevitably has some substantive content. The witness does not identify the culprit simply as \u201ca human being\u201d or as \u201csomeone he had seen before.\u201d Such evidence would be meaningless. The act of identification labels the person identified as the criminal agent in the case under investigation. In <em>Nance, </em>what was found to be admissible were the extrajudicial identifications by two witnesses, <em>identifying the defendants Nance and Hardy \u201cas those responsible for Aaron Carroll\u2019s murder.\u201d </em>331 Md. at 564, 629 A.2d 633. In <em>Basoff v. State, </em>208 Md. 643, 119 A.2d 917 (1956), the admissible evidence of the extrajudicial identification was that an abortion victim <em>identified the defendant as the abor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number><em>tionist. </em>In <em>Judy v. State, </em>218 Md. 168, 146 A.2d 29 (1958), the admissible evidence of the extrajudicial <em>identification was of the defendant as the criminal agent who attempted to commit an armed robbery. </em>In <em>Proctor v. State, </em>223 Md. 394, 164 A.2d 708 (1960), the admissible evidence of the pretrial <em>identification was also of the defendant as one 'who assaulted the victim with intent to rob. </em>In <em>Johnson v. State, </em>237 Md. 283, 206 A.2d 138 (1965), the evidence of extrajudicial identifications was that by two victims who <em>identified the three defendants as the armed robbers in that trial for armed robbery.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">To counter the possible arguments that the identification of the other man in the car with Eiland was not in dispute and that the word \u201cidentification,\u201d as a term of art, refers only to the procedural exercise of selecting one person, on the basis of physical appearance, from a group of possibilities, we refer again to <em>Nance. </em>In <em>Nance, </em>the \u201cidentification\u201d in issue did not involve the classical weighing of reliability factors versus the risk of misidentification as in <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972), or <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977). It was the simple naming, by the two witnesses to a murder, of two known persons as the murderers. That the word \u201cidentification\u201d connotes more than a mere selection process was made clear by <em>Nance:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">Harris and McCormick twice repeated their <em>identifications, </em>once in signed statements and once under oath in a proceeding before the grand jury. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">331 Md. at 563, 629 A.2d 633. The signed statements and the grand jury testimony involved, as the modality of identification, only the <em>naming </em>of <em>Nance </em>and <em>Hardy, </em>and not the selecting of them or their photographs from a group. On the basis of extensive case law, in Maryland and elsewhere, these \u201cidentifications\u201d were properly received as substantive evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">Viewing these facts in light of the cases from Maryland and other jurisdictions cited above, we conclude that the trial court properly admitted, as substantive evidence of guilt, <em>the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number><em>out-of-court identifications of Petitioners as those responsible for Aaron Carroll\u2019s murder. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APQ\">331 Md. at 564, 629 A.2d 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">An identification, moreover, may be made in a courtroom as readily as in a police station. Cited with approval by <em>Nance, </em>331 Md. at 563, 629 A.2d 633, was the opinion of the Supreme Court of California in <em>People v. Lucky, </em>45 Cal.3d 259, 247 Cal.Rptr. 1, 753 P.2d 1052 (1988). In that case, a critical factor was that the identifying witness, as in this case, reiterated (or iterated) the identification under oath at a judicial proceeding. As <em>Nance </em>summarized the California holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-k\">The California court held that a repudiated identification may form the basis for conviction if it was <em>reiterated by the witness under oath at a </em>preliminary examination or other <em>judicial proceeding, </em>and there was evidence from which the factfinder could credit the witness\u2019s prior testimony over his or her failure to confirm the extrajudicial statements at trial. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">331 Md. at 563, 629 A.2d 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Much of the case law explaining why an extrajudicial identification is, subject to certain conditions, admissible as substantive evidence stresses the self-evident truism that memory is fresher at an earlier time than at the later trial, and that the earlier identification, perforce, is more likely to be reliable than the later. That rationale, of course, is inapposite to the present case. There is, however, an additional rationale for admissibility, that <em>is </em>here pertinent. <em>Nance </em>quoted with approval, 331 Md. at 562-63, 629 A.2d 633, from the opinion of the Supreme Court of Virginia in <em>Niblett v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 76, 225 S.E.2d 391, 394 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-9\">[T]he memory of a witness may fade.... It is also not beyond the realm of possibility that an identifying witness may be inhibited by threat or intimidation from making a positive in-court identification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-10\"><em>Bedford v. State, </em>293 Md. 172, 443 A.2d 78 (1982), one of the primary authorities on which <em>Nance </em>relied, also recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>this additional rationale. <em>Nance </em>fleshed out more fully what <em>Bedford </em>had suggested:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">This Court in <em>Bedford, supra, </em>293 Md. at 178, 443 A.2d 78, also implicitly recognized <em>the possibility of witness intimidation: </em>\u201cThe failure may be explained by loss of memory or other circumstances.\u201d <em>Among such other circumstances are threats and fear of retaliation. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-6\"><em>Bedford v. State </em>established indisputably that later inconsistent trial testimony is not a prerequisite to the admissibility of a pre-trail identification. An elderly couple, aged eighty and seventy-seven, were the victims of a daytime housebreaking of their home and of armed robbery at hatchet point. Each, independently, selected a photograph of Bedford as a picture of \u201cthe individual who had robbed them,\u201d 293 Md. at 174, 443 A.2d 78. Having earlier failed to identify Bedford at a pretrial hearing, neither victim was even asked to attempt an identification at trial. The subject of identification was not raised in the trial testimony of the victims and there was no theoretical possibility of an inconsistency between their trial performances and their pre-trial performances.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The testimony of a policeman that each victim had on an earlier occasion selected a photograph of Bedford <em>and indicated that he was the robber </em>was the only evidence in the case bearing on Bedford\u2019s criminal agency. Not only was the evidence admissible; it was sufficient, standing alone, to support the verdicts of guilty for daytime housebreaking and for two armed robberies. The Court of Appeals, 293 Md. at 176-77, 443 A.2d 78, quoted with approval from <em>Johnson v. State, </em>237 Md. 283, 291, 206 A.2d 138 (1965):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">We hold therefore that where, as here, the identifying victims or eyewitnesses were present and subject to cross-examination, the testimony of the police officer as to the extrajudicial identifications was admissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-9\">Even where witnesses do not make a courtroom identification of the indictees, an extrajudicial identification is admissible as evidence over an objection that it is not the best evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>The <em>Bedford </em>opinion also quoted, with approval, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in <em>Commonwealth v. Torres, </em>367 Mass. 737, 739, 327 N.E.2d 871 (1975):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">Even if the witness does not identify the defendant in his or her testimony at trial, any pre-trial identification of the defendant by that witness in constitutionally proper circumstances should be given probative value. <em>See Clemons v. United States, </em>408 F.2d 1230, 1242-1243 (D.C.Cir.1968), <em>cert. den. </em>394 U.S. 964 [89 S.Ct. 1318, 22 L.Ed.2d 567] (1969); Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>(Chadbourn rev.) \u00a7 1130 (1972). Although the probative value of any evidence of such identification is for the jury, that evidence, if believed, tends to prove that the defendant was the perpetrator of the crime. The trend of decisions is to permit such evidence to be introduced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-6\"><em>Bedford\u2019s </em>holding was clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">We hold that an extrajudicial photographic identification of an accused is sufficient evidence of his criminal agency to support a conviction, notwithstanding the fact that the victim may be unable to identify him at the time of trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">293 Md. at 185, 443 A.2d 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">A witness (Eiland) to the murder of Jay Bias made a pre-trial (at his own earlier trial) identification of the murderer as the appellant Tyler. As long as Eiland was available to be called as a witness by the appellant, a third-party (court reporter, trial transcript, etc.) would be permitted, under the authority of <em>Nance </em>and <em>Bedford, </em>to testify as to that earlier identification as substantive evidence of the appellant\u2019s guilt. This would be true whether Eiland 1) took the stand and confirmed his earlier identification of Tyler, 2) took the stand and repudiated that earlier identification, 3) took the stand and denied ever having made the earlier identification, 4) took the stand and claimed a loss of memory as to the shooting, 5) took the stand and refused to discuss the identification of the gunman, or 6) was not even called to the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>\n<em>Our Holding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Under review is the discretionary evidentiary ruling that the hearsay be admitted. Utilizing, as we have done, two separate aspects of <em>Nance v. State </em>and two respective frameworks of analysis, we hold that there was no clear abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">\n<em>\u201cThe Light That Failed\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The appellant complains generally, without reciting any particular doctrinal basis, about the 18-day postponement in the effort to compel Eiland to testify. Our earlier discussion subsumes this issue. Judge Ahalt used every device available to him to obtain the live testimony of Eiland. Far from doing anything to place the appellant at a disadvantage, Judge Ahalt extended himself to avoid the very hearsay problem of which the appellant now complains. It is unnecessary to add that the appellant has not even alleged any resulting prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">\n<em>The Legal Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">At the express direction of the appellant, it is urged that the evidence was not legally sufficient to have permitted Judge Ahalt to submit the case to the jury. We do not agree. Several witnesses testified to the argument that took place between Tyler and Jay Bias when Tyler believed that Bias had been flirting with Tyler\u2019s wife, Shaunelle, as she was working at Kay Jewelers in the Prince George\u2019s Plaza Mall. As the two argued, Tyler was heard to threaten to \u201ccap\u201d Jay Bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">Two passengers in the vehicle wherein Bias was lolled testified that as they were driving from the parking lot of the mall, the Mercedes containing Tyler and Eiland came racing up beside them at a rapid speed. Although neither could say which of the two occupants of the Mercedes fired the lethal shots, they could testify that Eiland was the driver and that Tyler was in the passenger seat. They saw Tyler, moreover, \u201creaching down towards his leg on the right side\u201d just before the shots were fired. The prior testimony of Eiland that was received in evidence stated unequivocally that Tyler was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>shooter. The evidence was abundant to have permitted the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Tyler was guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">\n<em>The Aiding and Abetting Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Tyler objected to the jury\u2019s having been instructed that Tyler could be convicted as an aider and abetter even if the jury did not believe that he was the shooter. He does not now argue that the instruction given was not an accurate statement of the law. Neither does he argue that, in the abstract, it was not supported by the evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">He makes, rather, two bald assertions to the effect that the State was estopped from relying on a theory of guilt based on aiding and abetting. He asserts that the State, in opening statement to the jury, conceded that Tyler was not an aider and abetter. That is hardly the case. The State was recounting for the jury its expectation that the evidence would show that Tyler was the actual gunman. Even if the jury had believed Tyler\u2019s testimony that it was Eiland, and not he, who fired the fatal shots, the jury would not have been precluded from convicting Tyler as an aider and abetter. The State\u2019s expectation, articulated in opening statement, that it could prove a greater level of blameworthiness would not preclude the appellant\u2019s being convicted at a lesser level of blameworthiness, should the jury find partially in his favor. In <em>White v. State, </em>11 Md.App. 423, 430, 274 A.2d 671 (1971), we explained the non-binding effect of an opening statement in a criminal case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-8\">Maryland is clearly in line with this majority position that the office of \u201can opening statement in a criminal prosecution is to apprise, with reasonable succinctness, the trier of facts with the questions involved and what the State or defense expects to prove, so as to prepare said trier of the facts for the evidence to be adduced ... and it generally has no binding force or effect.\u201d <em>Clarke v. State, </em>238 Md. 11, 19-20 [207 A.2d 456 (1965) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>The appellant\u2019s second estoppel theory seems to be based in collateral estoppel, though he never mentions the phrase. Defense counsel represented to Judge Ahalt that at the first trial of Tyler and Eiland together, it was Eiland who was convicted of having been the aider and abetter; The actual verdict against Eiland, however, was simply that he was guilty of murder in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Even if it were otherwise, however, the verdicts of guilty against both defendants were reversed and hardly represented, therefore, \u201ca valid final judgment.\u201d <em>Butler v. State, </em>335 Md. 238, 253, 643 A.2d 389 (1994). There is the further impediment that collateral estoppel requires a material finding of fact \u201cin one\u2019s favor.\u201d Any decision at the first trial to the effect that Eiland was the less guilty of the two and that Tyler, therefore, by a process of elimination was the more guilty of the two, was hardly a finding in Tyler\u2019s favor. The appellant is, in effect, arguing that, once having been found guilty of murder in the first degree, collateral estoppel would bar him, following reversal and remand, from ever being found guilty of murder only in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Since the appellant is invoking, moreover, an allegedly preclusive effect of the verdict in his own (and Eiland\u2019s) first trial for the very same offense, it is not, by definition, an occasion for collateral estoppel analysis. In any event, we are not going to try to construct either a collateral estoppel argument or a direct <em>res judicata </em>argument, even for the purpose of then refuting it, on the appellant\u2019s behalf that he has not even partially made for himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">\n<em>The Plaintive Cry of \u201cPlain Error\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">We may consider the appellant\u2019s fifth and sixth contentions together for the same overarching, if sometimes neglected, principle of appellate review is dispositive of both. In his fifth contention, the appellant claims that Judge Ahalt committed plain error in instructing the jury on first-degree murder. In his sixth contention, the appellant claims that Judge Ahalt committed plain error in not instructing the jury that its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>verdict must be unanimous. We have no idea whether there is substantive merit in either contention and we are not about to take the time or trouble to find out for the obvious reason that no objection was made to either instruction. There is, therefore, nothing preserved for appellate review. Md. Rule 4-325(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The appellant asks us to exercise our discretion by way of noticing \u201cplain error.\u201d We decline. The rule is that an objection, to be considered on appeal, must be preserved. We admonish the defense bar that we are not about to allow the exception to swallow the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">\n<em>The Relevance of a Motive</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Tyler objects to the fact that Michael McCutchen, the manager of Kay Jewelers, was permitted to testify that, as he was ejecting Tyler from the jewelry store following Tyler\u2019s outburst of anger toward his wife, Shaunelle, Tyler was heard to say that \u201che was willing to go back to jail over the situation.\u201d Tyler objects on the ground that this testimony was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Far from it. Whenever a murder occurs, the instinctive question on everyone\u2019s lips, detective and juror alike, is, \u201cWho had a motive?\u201d Tyler\u2019s outburst of jealous anger over Jay Bias\u2019s perceived or imagined attention to Shaunelle was the clear and undisputed motive for the murder of Jay Bias a few minutes thereafter. Michael McCutchen\u2019s testimony helped to establish the high level of that jealous anger.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">The appellant seems to be operating under the assumption that the relevance must be established by McCutchen\u2019s testimony alone. That is not the case. The establishing of the jealous anger came from the combined testimony of McCutchen, Tydus Mathis, and Andre Campbell. Jay Bias and Campbell were just leaving Kay Jewelers when Tyler walked in. Tyler apparently believed that Shaunelle had been flirting with Bias. A turbulent argument ensued between Tyler and Shaunelle, culminating in Tyler\u2019s hurling a stapler at her. It was at that point that the manager, Michael McCutchen, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>intervened and directed Tyler to leave the store. It was as he was leaving that Tyler vented that \u201che was willing to go back to jail over the situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Immediately outside the store, the first confrontation occurred between Tyler and Jay Bias. The subject matter of the confrontation was indisputably Shaunelle. Tyler challenged Bias to \u201ccome on outside, we can take care of this outside.\u201d Their respective friends broke up that immediate confrontation, but Campbell remembered, as he and Bias were leaving the scene, a voice saying \u201cI will cap you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The testimony in issue was an integral part of the episode that supplied the motive for the killing. The testimony was properly ruled to be admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">\n<em>Evidentiary Irrelevance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Tyler\u2019s final contention is that Judge Ahalt erroneously refused to permit Tyler\u2019s mother, Yvonne Tyler, to answer the question, \u201cDuring the entire time that he has been your son, have you ever known him to carry a weapon?\u201d' Although the appellant has failed to proffer what the mother\u2019s answer would have been, we will on this occasion give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that his mother\u2019s answer would have been that she had not known her son to carry a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">Although there may be a number of reasons why the answer sought to be elicited might properly be ruled to be irrelevant, it suffices to point out that no proper foundation was laid for the mother\u2019s testimony. Tyler had been living with his wife, Shaunelle, for at least three years. She was permitted to testify that during those three years, Tyler had not possessed a gun. There was no foundation laid as to the degree of contact between Tyler and his mother or the basis for the mother\u2019s knowledge that he did not carry a gun, if that indeed would have been her answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">In any event, recognizing the wide discretion vested in the trial judge to rule on such evidentiary matters as relevance, we see no abuse of discretion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>\n<em>JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-8\">. \"At trial, the witnesses recanted, ... by disavowing their prior identifications and statements.\u201d <em>Nance, </em>331 Md. at 556, 629 A.2d 633. \"Harris sometimes repudiated his former answers.\u201d 331 Md. at 557, 629 A.2d 633. \u201c[Brown] denied having identified by name any of the participants in the April 3 fight.

State, </em>10 Md.App. 666, 677-78, 272 A.2d 413, <em>cert. denied, </em>261 Md. 724 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b587-4\">MURPHY, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ATN\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">I concur in the judgment and would not change one word in the majority\u2019s analysis of every issue except the admissibility of Eiland\u2019s testimony. I would, however, add the following reasons why (1) Eiland\u2019s testimony at his trial was inconsistent with his refusal to answer any questions in this case, and (2) the introduction of Eiland\u2019s prior testimony did not violate appellant\u2019s right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">An assertion may be express or implied. There is evidentiary significance in an implied assertion. <em>In re Devon T., </em>85 Md.App. 674, 696-697, 584 A.2d 1287 (1991). In this case, we have Eiland\u2019s express assertion, \u201cI cannot answer.\u201d When Eiland testified at his trial, he made the implied assertion, \u201cI can answer.\u201d Those conflicting assertions establish the inconsistency required to trigger the <em>Nance </em>exception to the rule against hearsay.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">The confrontation clause guarantees only an opportunity for effective cross-examination. <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 53, 107 S.Ct. 989, 999, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987). The trial judge did not prohibit either side from questioning Eiland. We must assume that Eiland\u2019s response to each question would have been \u201cI can\u2019t answer.\u201d There is, however, no constitutional right to a truthful answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">There may be cases in which the right of confrontation is violated because a witness\u2014hearsay declarant contumaciously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>refuses to answer the defendant\u2019s questions. Whether the confrontation clause was violated, however, depends on the importance of both the question and the answer. <em>How </em>a witness\u2014declarant reacts to the question is always of consequence to the assessment of that person\u2019s credibility. If <em>what </em>the witness\u2014declarant would answer is of no consequence whatsoever, the confrontation clause is satisfied when the defendant has the opportunity to ask questions of the contumacious witness\u2014declarant in the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">In this case, the right of confrontation was satisfied when appellant was permitted to question Eiland in the presence of the jury. The jurors were in position to observe Eiland\u2019s demeanor as he reacted to the questions. Through able counsel, appellant had a full and fair opportunity to ask questions in support of his argument that Eiland\u2019s prior testimony was as worthless as his \u201cI can\u2019t answer\u201d responses. Such an opportunity is all that the confrontation clause guarantees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-9\">. I do not agree with the proposition that any concessions made by the State during reargument prohibit our reliance on the theory of admissibility set forth in this opinion. We are not required to accept the State\u2019s concession that an appellant is entitled to a new trial. <em>Moten v. State, </em>100 Md.App. 115, 118, 640 A.2d 222 (1994), <em>cert. granted, </em>336 Md. 405, 648 A.2d 991 (1994). We should not reverse a conviction merely because, during argument or reargument, the State appears to abandon a correct theory of admissibility in favor of an incorrect one. Trial judges\u2014and intermediate appellate courts\u2014can be right for the wrong reason. <em>State v. Breeden, </em>333 Md. 212, 227 n. 5, 634 A.2d 464 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b588-6\">WILNER, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AWfc\">dissenting in which BLOOM, J., joins.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">For the reasons so well stated by Judge Moylan in his majority Opinion, this is a \u201chard case.\u201d We must be careful, however, that we do not allow a hard case to make bad law. I cannot join the majority because I believe that it is stretching the law in an unwarranted manner\u2014in a manner that will affect thousands of other cases\u2014simply to avoid what it perceives to be an unfairness to society in this one case. I write separately not because I necessarily disagree with Judge Salmon\u2019s dissent, but because I do not believe it necessary to reach the Constitutional issue or the issue of whether Eiland was \u201cavailable\u201d or \u201cunavailable\u201d as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">This appeal was reargued <em>en banc </em>in order to give the parties an opportunity to explain their theories and explicate the facts underlying those theories to the entire Court. The reargument served to clarify, and greatly narrow, the competing positions. The State conceded that Eiland\u2019s refusal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>answer questions put to him at Tyler\u2019s trial was not based on any actual inability, physical or mental, to answer the questions, but represented simply his unwillingness to answer those questions. That concession is a legitimate one. It is the only reasonable inference that can be drawn from the record and was the necessary underpinning for the court\u2019s finding of contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The State also acknowledged that Eiland\u2019s recorded trial testimony was not evidentially inconsistent with anything he said at Tyler\u2019s trial. That acknowledgement necessarily served to withdraw or negate any contention that the earlier testimony was admissible because of its quality as a prior inconsistent statement. These two concessions effectively destroy the major premise for Judge Murphy\u2019s concurring opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">On the basic hearsay level, the State\u2019s position now rests entirely on the view that <em>Nance v. State, </em>331 Md. 549, 629 A.2d 633 (1993), should be read to permit a prior recorded statement of a witness to be admitted as substantive evidence even if that statement is not inconsistent with the witness\u2019s trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">I do not read <em>Nance </em>as supporting that position; nor can I find any other applicable hearsay exception, at least under the circumstances of this case. For that reason, I would declare the recorded statement inadmissible under the State hearsay rule and not reach the confrontation issue or the question of whether Eiland was available or unavailable at Tyler\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">No one even suggests that Eiland\u2019s recorded trial testimony was not hearsay. It was, in the words of Md. Rule 5-801(e), \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d To be admissible, therefore, it must fall within at least one of the recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule. The statement was not offered, and its admissibility cannot be justified, under any of the express exceptions formerly recognized as part of Maryland common law that are now contained in Md. Rules 5-803 or 5-804. Nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>can it be regarded as admissible under the \u201ccatchall\u201d exceptions stated in Rule 5\u2014803(b)(24) or 5-804(b)(5). Assuming that those broad exceptions existed at common law, the court made none of the requisite findings sufficient to justify admission under those provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">As noted, the State seeks to sustain admission of the statement solely upon an expanded reading of <em>Nance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\"><em>Nance </em>addressed the problem of three witnesses who (1) prior to trial, had made photographic identifications of Nance as one of the persons who shot the victim, (2) also prior to trial had given written statements to the police and testimony to a grand jury naming Nance as one of the killers and describing the circumstances surrounding the shooting, but (3) at Nance\u2019s trial, repudiated both the identifications and the recorded statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The Court of Appeals treated the identifications and the broader pretrial statements separately. With respect to the pretrial identifications, the Court relied on cases such as <em>Bedford v. State, </em>293 Md. 172, 443 A.2d 78 (1982), and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AI1z\">\u201cIt is well settled in Maryland that a court may admit, as substantive proof, evidence of a third party testifying as to an extrajudicial identification by an eyewitness when made under circumstances precluding the suspicion of unfairness or unreliability, where the out-of-court declarant is present at trial and subject to cross-examination, [citations omitted] An extrajudicial identification is sufficient evidence of criminal agency to sustain a conviction, even though the declarant is unable to identify the accused at trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">331 Md. at 560-61, 629 A.2d 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">In <em>Bedford, </em>the defendant was charged with the armed robbery of two elderly victims. The victims provided a description of their assailant, assisted the police in preparing a composite picture, and subsequently made a photographic identification of the defendant Bedford. At a later suppression hearing, howeVer, they were unable to make an identification, and, as a result, they were not even asked to identify Bedford at trial. The pre-trial photographic identification was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>admitted into evidence in default of such testimony and apparently formed the principal basis of Bedford\u2019s conviction. The issue before the Court of Appeals was whether the conviction could rest on that pre-trial identification, in light of the victims\u2019 inability to make a judicial identification. Implicit in that issue was the assumption that the pre-trial identification was admissible as substantive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\"><em>Bedford, </em>as confirmed in <em>Nance, </em>is instructive in two interrelated respects. The first has to do with reliability. The extrajudicial identification was ruled admissible as substantive evidence and declared sufficient to sustain the conviction because (1) it was made under circumstances \u201cprecluding the suspicion of unfairness or unreliability,\u201d and (2) notwithstanding their later inability to make an identification, the witnesses were in court and subject to cross-examination. The second point of interest is that, in <em>Bedford, </em>though not in <em>Nance, </em>the presumed admissibility of the pre-trial identification did not depend on any recantation by the witnesses or on the pre-trial identification being inconsistent with any testimony given at trial. There was, in fact, no recantation or inconsistency in <em>Bedford. </em>The pre-trial assertion was admitted on much the same basis as a past recollection recorded, and, indeed, both situations are now treated together in Md. Rule 5-802.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">In this regard, Rule 5-802.1(c) essentially codifies the <em>Nance </em>and <em>Bedford </em>holdings. It provides, in relevant part, that a statement that is one of identification of a person made after perceiving the person is not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is a witness who testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement. Implicit in the rule, though not expressly stated in the text, is the prerequisite that the identification be made under circumstances precluding the suspicion of unfairness or unreliability. That gloss is necessarily imposed by Rule 5-403, allowing the exclusion of otherwise admissible evidence if the probative value of that evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>The second aspect of <em>Nance </em>concerned the written statements made by the three witnesses to the police and, eventually, to the grand jury. Those statements, the Court noted, \u201cwere repudiated at trial.\u201d 331 Md. at 564, 629 A.2d 633. In most instances, the repudiation was clear and direct. The issue was whether Maryland would continue to adhere to what had become a minority view that such inconsistent statements were admissible only for impeachment purposes. The entire discussion by the Court was in the context of prior <em>inconsistent </em>statements, as was its ultimate holding. At 569, 629 A.2d 633, the Court stated its conclusion thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">\u201cWe hold that the factual portion of <em>an inconsistent out-of-court statement </em>is sufficiently trustworthy to be offered as substantive evidence of guilt when the statement is based on the declarant\u2019s own knowledge of the facts, is reduced to writing and signed or otherwise adopted by him, and he is subject to cross-examination at the trial where the prior statement is introduced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">That limitation is also explicit in Rule 5-802.1(a), which effectively codified the <em>Nance </em>holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The teaching of <em>Nance </em>and <em>Bedford, </em>as currently expressed in Rule 5-802.1 is this: To the extent that the prior out-of-court statement is simply one of identification, it need not be inconsistent with any testimony given by the declarant at trial, but it must have been made under circumstances negating any suspicion of unfairness or unreliability. To the extent the earlier statement concerns matters other than identification, it must be inconsistent with the declarant\u2019s trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Regrettably, in this case, the State fares poorly in both aspects. To the extent that Eiland\u2019s own trial testimony constitutes an identification of Tyler as the actual killer, that testimony was certainly not given under circumstances precluding the suspicion of unreliability. Eiland was on trial for murder; in his first trial, he had been convicted of second degree murder and use of a handgun and had been sentenced to prison for 30 years. There was never much dispute that one or the other of them fired the fatal shots, so the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>reasonable hope that Eiland could possibly have of escaping another conviction was to place all of the blame on Tyler, which is what he succeeded in doing. The fact that his testimony was under oath hardly suffices to wash away that compelling incentive to accuse Tyler. The identification aspect of his trial testimony was therefore inadmissible because it was given under circumstances nine months pregnant with the suspicion of unreliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">That same unreliability would doom the penumbral aspects of his testimony as well, but even if it did not, I can find no warrant whatever for extending the second holding of <em>Nance </em>to include non-inconsistent statements. There is nothing in <em>Nance </em>to suggest such an extension, and there is nothing in Rule 5-802.1 to suggest it. Indeed, were we to construe either <em>Nance </em>or the rule in such an extended manner, we would be creating a new, independent hearsay exception out of whole cloth, barely a year after the Court of Appeals, on the heels of a five-year effort by its Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, comprehensively rewrote the law of evidence in this State. We would, in addition, be creating a very serious Constitutional confrontation issue, at least in criminal cases. Because the State has rightly acknowledged that there was no inconsistency here, those aspects of Eiland\u2019s trial testimony not relating to identification of Tyler were also inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">It is for these reasons that I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b593-7\">DAVIS, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AUq\">dissenting in which BLOOM, J., joins.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">I dissent from that portion of this Court\u2019s opinion holding that the testimony given at Eiland\u2019s December 1993 trial was admissible against Tyler. I fully concur with the dissenting opinion of Judge Salmon. I write separately to articulate my particularized concern that the admission of Eiland\u2019s prior testimony violated Tyler\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Commentators have long associated the Confrontation Clause with the notorious abuses at the trial of Sir Walter Raleigh in 1603. As one commentator explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">The chief evidence against Raleigh was a sworn statement of Lord Cobham, a statement made to royal commissioners who interrogated Cobham in the tower where he was jailed. The accusatory statement may have been coerced; its reliability was certainly undercut because Cobham retracted the statement and then recalled the retraction. Even though Raleigh demanded that Cobham be produced, Cobham was never called as a witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Roger W.

Roberts, </em>36 U.Fla.L.Rev. 207, 208-212 (1984). On the strength of Cobham\u2019s dubious statement, Raleigh was convicted of treason and executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Although the historical association between the Confrontation Clause and Raleigh\u2019s \u201ctrial by affidavit\u201d may be little more than a romantic myth,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the story dramatically illustrates the abuses that once prevailed in English criminal trials:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALv\">At the time of Raleigh\u2019s trial ... the depositions of absent persons were read as the usual course of evidence which had prevailed for centuries in State prosecutions; this mode of proof constituted the general rule, and the oral examination of witnesses was the exception, which was in practice sometimes allowed, but was as often refused, and never permitted but by the consent of counsel for the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A70\">5 D.

Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1364, at 12-28 (Chadbourn Rev.1974) (discussing the history of the rule against hearsay).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">At the outset, I think it essential to note that the prior testimony at issue here was presumptively unreliable. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number><em>Douglas v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415, 419, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 1077, 13 L.Ed.2d 934 (1965), the Supreme Court held that a defendant\u2019s inability to cross-examine an accomplice, with regard to the accomplice\u2019s alleged confession, plainly denied the defendant his right of confrontation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">This holding, on which the Court was unanimously agreed, was premised on the basic understanding that when one person accuses another of a crime under circumstances in which the declarant stands to gain by inculpating another, <em>the accusation is presumptively suspect and must be subjected to the scrutiny of cross-examination.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-7\"><em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. 530, 541, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 2062, 90 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986) (emphasis added). Over the years since <em>Douglas, </em>the Court \u201chas spoken with one voice\u201d in declaring that such statements are \u201cpresumptively unreliable.\u201d <em>Id. See also Wilson v. State, </em>334 Md. 313, 334-35, 639 A.2d 125 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Prior to the decision in <em>Nance v. State, </em>93 Md.App. 475, 613 A.2d 428, (1992), <em>aff'd, </em>331 Md. 549, 629 A.2d 633 (1993), the prior testimony of a witness was not admissible as substantive evidence in Maryland, unless the declarant was unavailable and the statements were made at previous proceedings against the same defendant, wherein the accused had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination. <em>See, e.g., State v. Breeden, </em>333 Md. 212, 222, 634 A.2d 464 (1993); <em>Crawford v. State, </em>282 Md. 210, 214-15, 383 A.2d 1097 (1978). <em>See also </em>Md. Rule 5-804(b)(l). The majority correctly observes that Eiland\u2019s testimony was not admissible under the exception for former testimony. Tyler had no opportunity to cross-examine Eiland during the December 1993 trial, and the State was not positioned to serve as Tyler\u2019s surrogate. Because the testimony at issue here was presumptively (and perhaps notoriously) unreliable, we should not be eager to conclude that Eiland was available for cross-examination. In the absence of a <em>meaningful </em>opportunity for effective cross-examination, the very nature of Eiland\u2019s prior testimony demands that it be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">I do not agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Eiland was \u201cavailable\u201d as required by the <em>Nance </em>exception to the rule against hearsay. <em>See Nance, </em>331 Md. at 571, 629 A.2d 633 (holding that prior inconsistent testimony is not admissible unless the declarant is \u201cpresent as a witness at trial to be tested by cross-examination\u201d). Whether Eiland was \u201cavailable\u201d for the purposes of the Confrontation Clause, of course, is another matter entirely. The Supreme Court has recognized that hearsay rules and the Confrontation Clause are \u201cdesigned to protect similar values,\u201d but the Court has \u201cbeen careful not to equate the Confrontation Clause\u2019s prohibitions with the general rule prohibiting the admission of hearsay statements.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>334 Md. at 322, 639 A.2d 125 (quoting <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 814, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 3146, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990)). Properly understood, the Confrontation Clause is neither \u201ca minor adjunct of evidence law,\u201d nor \u201ca mere vestigial appendix of the hearsay doctrine.\u201d Randolph N. Jonakait, <em>Restoring the Confrontation Clause to the Sixth Amendment, </em>35 UCLA L.Rev. 557, 575, 622 (1988). Even if Eiland was sufficiently \u201cavailable\u201d to satisfy the mandates of <em>Nance, </em>the Confrontation Clause may require that his prior testimony be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Although the Supreme Court has often noted that the Confrontation Clause was intended to advance \u201cthe accuracy of the truth-determining process in criminal trials,\u201d <em>Dutton v. Evans, </em>400 U.S. 74, 89, 91 S.Ct. 210, 220, 27 L.Ed.2d 213 (1970), the fundamental purpose of the right to confrontation runs much deeper. In <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975), the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">The Sixth Amendment includes a compact statement of the rights necessary to a full defense.... [TJhese rights are basic to our adversary system of criminal justice....

In other words, \u201c[t]he right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses contributes to the establishment of a system of criminal justice in which the perception as well as the reality of fairness prevails.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>476 U.S. at 540, 106 S.Ct. at 2062. <em>See also Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 685, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2063, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (noting that a fair trial requires an \u201cadversarial testing\u201d of the State\u2019s evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The right to a fundamentally fair trial requires that the accused be permitted to press a full, vigorous, and adversarial defense. As one commentator has noted, \u201c[T]he adversary system\u2019s real genius ... lies in the use and perfection of cross-examination.\u201d Richard G. Singer, <em>Forensic Misconduct by Federal Prosecutors\u2014And How It Grew, </em>20 Ala.L.Rev. 227, 268 (1968). <em>See also </em>Model Code of Evidence ch. VI, introductory note (1942) (the opportunity for cross-examination \u201cis the very heart of an adversary theory of litigation\u201d). Accordingly, both courts and commentators have concluded that \u201c[t]he main and essential purpose of confrontation is to <em>secure for the opponent the opportunity of cross-examination.\u201d </em>5 Wigmore \u00a7 1395, at 150. <em>See also Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 315-16, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 1109-110, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974) (quoting Wigmore with approval). In Wigmore\u2019s words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">The opponent demands cross-examination, not for the idle purpose of gazing upon the witness, or of being gazed upon by him, but for the purpose of cross-examination, which cannot be had except by the direct and personal putting of questions and obtaining immediate answers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">5 Wigmore \u00a7 1395, at 150. In addition, the Confrontation Clause compels a witness</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">to stand face to face with the jury in order that they may look at him, and judge by his demeanor upon the stand and the manner in which he gives his testimony whether he is worthy of belief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-9\"><em>Mattox v.

The combined effect of the various aspects of confrontation\u2014physical presence, oath, cross-examination, and observation of the witness\u2019 demeanor, \u201cserves the purposes of the Confrontation Clause by ensuring that evidence admitted against an accused is reliable and subject to the rigorous adversarial testing that is the norm of Anglo-American criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>Maryland v. Craig, </em>497 U.S. 836, 846, 110 S.Ct. 3157, 3163, 111 L.Ed.2d 666 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">During trial, the immediate goal of most cross-examination is to produce more information about the witness, including information about \u201cprior statements, inconsistent facts, ability to observe and recollect, bias and prejudice, lack of truth and veracity.\u201d Eleanor Swift, <em>Smoke and Mirrors: The Failure of the Supreme Court\u2019s Accuracy Rationale in White v. Illinois Requires a New Look at Confrontation, </em>22 Cap.U.L.Rev. 145, 151 (1993). Thus, the widely acknowledged purpose of cross-examination is \u201cto test and challenge the evidence in front of the jury so that the jury will have all the information necessary to best assess what weight the evidence should be given.\u201d Jonakait, <em>supra, </em>35 UCLA L.Rev. at 587-88 (footnote omitted). Although the scope of cross-examination is generally limited to those subjects raised on direct examination, within that limit the defendant should be free to cross-examine \u201cin order to elucidate, modify, explain, contradict, or rebut testimony given in chief.\u201d <em>Smallwood v. State, </em>320 Md. 300, 307, 577 A.2d 356 (1990). In the context of the case at hand, the immediate purpose of the right to confrontation is to furnish the jury with \u201ca satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth\u201d of the prior statements. <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. at 161, 90 S.Ct. at 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">It is true that the Confrontation Clause guarantees nothing more than \u201can <em>opportunity </em>for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u201d <em>Delaware v. Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. 15, 20, 106 S.Ct. 292, 294, 88 L.Ed.2d 15 (1985) (per curiam). It is equally true that the mere presence of the witness in the courtroom will not suffice. <em>See Simmons v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number><em>State, </em>333 Md. 547, 559, 636 A.2d 463 (1994) (witness who is physically seated on the stand but refuses to take an oath or answer any questions at all is not available). As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. at 22, 106 S.Ct. at 295 \u201cthe Confrontation Clause is generally satisfied when the defense is given <em>a full and fair opportunity </em>\u201d to probe the testimony of the witness (emphasis added). When the defendant\u2019s opportunity for cross-examination has been neither full nor fair, the right to confrontation has not been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In <em>Douglas, </em>380 U.S. 415, 85 S.Ct. 1074, the Supreme Court held that a witness is not available for full and effective cross-examination when he or she refuses to testify, regardless of whether the refusal to testify is predicated on privilege or punished as contempt. In that case, Douglas and a second man named Loyd were tried separately on charges of assault with intent to murder. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">Loyd was tried first and was found guilty. The State then called Loyd as a witness at petitioner\u2019s trial---- Loyd gave his name and address but, invoking the privilege [against self-incrimination], refused to answer any questions concerning the alleged crime. The trial judge ruled that Loyd could not rely on the privilege because of his conviction, and ordered him to answer, but Loyd persisted in his refusal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 416, 85 S.Ct. at 1075. Under the guise of refreshing Loyd\u2019s recollection, the State then read into evidence the entire contents of a lengthy confession allegedly signed by Loyd, which named Douglas as the person who shot the victim. Loyd did not acknowledge making those statements. <em>Id. </em>at 419, 85 S.Ct. at 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">Under the circumstances, the Court concluded, \u201cpetitioner\u2019s inability to cross-examine Loyd as to the alleged confession plainly denied him the right of cross-examination secured by the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-11\"><em>We need not decide whether Loyd properly invoked the privilege </em>in light of his conviction. It is sufficient for the purposes of deciding petitioner\u2019s claim under the Confronta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>tion Clause that no suggestion is made that Loyd\u2019s refusal to answer was procured by the petitioner____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 420, 85 S.Ct. at 1077 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Although recent Supreme Court decisions have read the right to confrontation more narrowly than earlier cases,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Court has never retreated from the central holding of <em>Douglas. </em>In <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), the Court held that out-of-court statements were not admissible as substantive evidence unless the prosecution can either \u201cproduce, or demonstrate the unavailability of, the declarant whose statement it wishes to use \u00e1gainst the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65, 100 S.Ct. at 2538. The Court characterized this principle as a \u201crule of necessity.\u201d In <em>United States v. Inadi, </em>475 U.S. 387, 106 S.Ct. 1121, 89 L.Ed.2d 390 (1986), the Court mitigated the strict holding of <em>Roberts, </em>and concluded that the rule of necessity did not apply to hearsay statements made by \u00e1 co-conspirator during the course of the conspiracy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 394-96, 106 S.Ct. at 1125-27. The Court emphasized, however, that the <em>Roberts </em>rule of necessity still applied to eases involving prior testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 393-95, 106 S.Ct. at 1125-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">Under current Confrontation Clause doctrine, the prior testimony of a witness is not admissible as substantive evidence unless one of two tests is satisfied. When the declarant is unavailable for cross-examination, the second prong of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number><em>Roberts </em>test requires a showing that the testimony is \u201creliable,\u201d which may be satisfied if evidence falls within a \u201cfirmly-rooted\u201d hearsay exception, or if there are other \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 65-66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539. If the prior testimony is unreliable, <em>as it was in the present case, </em>then the testimony cannot be admitted unless the witness takes the stand, and the defendant is afforded a full and fair opportunity for effective cross-examination. <em>See Douglas, </em>380 U.S. at 419, 85 S.Ct. at 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s cases involving memory loss have not altered those principles. The Court\u2019s decision in <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 90 S.Ct. 1930, for example, clearly illustrates the sort of trial performance that is necessary to satisfy the requirements of the Confrontation Clause. The key witness in that case, Porter, was arrested for selling marijuana to an undercover officer. While in police custody, Porter named Green as his supplier. Porter later testified at a preliminary hearing, and again identified Green as his supplier. During the hearing, Porter was cross-examined extensively by Green\u2019s attorney\u2014the same attorney who represented Green at his subsequent trial. <em>Id. </em>at 151, 90 S.Ct. at 1931.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">At trial, Porter was again the State\u2019s chief witness, but he proved to be evasive and uncooperative. Porter admitted that Green had phoned him, and that the two discussed selling some \u201cstuff.\u201d Porter also admitted that he obtained twenty-nine plastic \u201cbaggies\u201d of marijuana shortly thereafter. He explained, however, that he had taken LSD just prior to the phone call, and could not remember how he obtained the drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 151-52, 90 S.Ct. at 1931-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">At various points during Porter\u2019s direct examination, the prosecution read excerpts from a transcript of Porter\u2019s previous testimony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With his memory thereby \u201crefreshed,\u201d Porter \u201cguessed\u201d that he had obtained the marijuana from the backyard of a home owned by Green\u2019s parents. On cross-examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>tion, however, Porter indicated that the out-of-court statements merely refreshed his memory of the testimony he had previously given, rather than his memory of the events themselves. He continued to assert that he did not remember how he obtained the marijuana. Later in the trial, Porter\u2019s prior statements to police were also admitted as substantive evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 152, 90 S.Ct. at 1931-32.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In holding that Green had an adequate opportunity to cross-examine Porter regarding his former testimony, the Supreme Court emphasized that Porter acknowledged making the prior statements, and that Porter\u2019s prior statements were inconsistent with his trial testimony. The Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">If the witness admits the prior statement is his, or if there is other evidence to show the statement is his ... the jury can be confident that it has before it two conflicting statements by the same witness. Thus ... <em>the witness must now affirm, deny or qualify the truth of the prior statement </em>under the penalty of perjury____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 158-59, 90 S.Ct. at 1935 (emphasis added). The Court explained further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">The witness who now relates a different story about the events in question must necessarily assume a position as to the truth value of his prior statement, <em>thus giving the jury a chance to observe and evaluate his demeanor as he either disavows or qualifies his earlier statement. </em>The jury is alerted by the inconsistency in the stories, and its attention is sharply focused on determining either that one of the stories reflects the truth or that the witness who has apparently lied once, is simply too lacking in credibility to warrant its believing either story.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 160, 90 S.Ct. at 1936 (emphasis added). In short, the obvious inconsistency between Porter\u2019s trial testimony and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>prior testimony required that Porter explain the discrepancy and the reasons for his memory loss.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">A pair of inconsistent statements are \u201c[m]utually repugnant or contradictory,\u201d and so are contrary to one another that both statements cannot be true. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary at 766 (6th ed. 1990). By that definition, as well as the analysis in <em>Green, </em>Eiland\u2019s trial performance was not inconsistent with his prior testimony. Unlike Porter, Eiland did not relate two conflicting stories regarding the events surrounding the death of Jay Bias. He did not acknowledge making the prior statements, and neither affirmed nor denied the truth of those statements. As I noted earlier, the purpose of cross-examination in the present case was to furnish the jury with \u201ca satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth\u201d of Eiland\u2019s prior testimony. <em>See Green, </em>399 U.S. at 161, 90 S.Ct. at 1936. There was nothing at all in Eiland\u2019s performance that might aid the jury with that task.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Justice Harlan, concurring with the result in <em>Green, </em>argued that the Confrontation Clause is satisfied by the physical presence of the witness in court. <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. at 172, 90 S.Ct. at 1942 (Harlan, J., concurring). In <em>United States v. Owens, </em>484 U.S. 554, 559, 108 S.Ct. 838, 842, 98 L.Ed.2d 951 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>(1988), the Court endorsed Justice Harlan\u2019s concurrence, but did so purely as dicta. As I explain below, the prosecution in <em>Owens </em>did more than simply produce the witness, and the defendant did, in fact, have a meaningful opportunity to probe the witness\u2019 out-of-court statement. The Court\u2019s decision in <em>Owens </em>cannot and should not be read as standing for the radical proposition that the right to confrontation is satisfied when the witness takes the stand and answers a few collateral questions, but refuses to testify further.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">In <em>Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. at 22, 106 S.Ct. at 295-96, the Court determined that the Confrontation Clause was not violated when an expert witness testified as to what opinion he formed, but could not recall which one of three methods he used to reach that conclusion. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">The Confrontation Clause includes no guarantee that every witness called by the prosecution will refrain from giving testimony that is marred by forgetfulness, confusion, or evasion. To the contrary, the Confrontation Clause is satisfied when the defense is given a full and fair opportunity to probe and expose these infirmities through cross-examination, thereby calling to the attention of the factfinder the reasons for giving scant weight to the witness\u2019 testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ac6h\"><em>Id. </em>at 21-22, 106 S.Ct. at 295. In <em>Owens, </em>484 U.S. 554, 108 S.Ct. 838, the Court quoted <em>Fensterer. </em>with approval, and added that a full and fair opportunity for effective cross-examination</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">is not denied when a witness testifies as to his current belief but is unable to recollect the reason for that belief. It is sufficient that the defendant has the opportunity to bring out such matters as the witness\u2019 bias, his lack of care and attention, his poor eyesight, and even (what is often a prime objective' of cross-examination, see 3A J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 995, pp. 931-932 (J. Chadbourn rev. 1970)) the very fact that he has a bad memory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 559, 108 S.Ct. at 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">In <em>Owens, </em>a man named Foster had been brutally beaten with a metal pipe. He sustained a fractured skull and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>memory was seriously impaired. When Mansfield, an FBI agent, first attempted to interview Foster, the latter was unable to remember the details of the assault. During a second interview, Foster named Owens as his assailant, and identified him from an array of photographs. <em>Id. </em>at 556, 108 S.Ct. at 840. The Supreme Court\u2019s description of Foster\u2019s trial performance is instructive in its analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">At trial, Foster recounted his activities just before the attack, and described feeling the blows to his head and seeing blood on the floor. He testified that he clearly remembered identifying respondent as his assailant during his May 5th interview with Mansfield. <em>On cross-examination, he admitted that he could not remember seeing the assailant. </em>He also admitted that, although there was evidence that he had received numerous visitors in the hospital, he was unable to remember any of them except Mansfield, and could not remember whether any of these visitors had suggested that respondent was the assailant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Thus, the jury had an opportunity to assess Foster\u2019s recollection of the beating, the circumstances surrounding Foster\u2019s identification of Owens, the extent of Foster\u2019s memory loss, and his general demeanor during cross-examination. In the instant case, by contrast, the jury had no opportunity to test Eiland\u2019s credibility or the truth of his prior testimony. If \u201cthe ability to inquire into these matters suffices to establish the constitutionally requisite opportunity for cross-examination,\u201d <em>Owens, </em>484 U.S. at 559, 108 S.Ct. at 842, then Tyler was not afforded a \u201cfull and fair\u201d opportunity to cross-examine Eiland.,</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The majority suggests that there is no \u201cprincipled distinction\u201d between a witness who cannot remember and one who refuses to testify. To the contrary, in <em>Owens, </em>the Supreme Court both recognized and explained that distinction. Because Foster testified at trial and was \u201csubject to cross-examination,\u201d the Court concluded that his prior identification of Owens was not barred by the rule against hearsay. <em>Id. </em>at 561-62, 108 S.Ct. at 843-44. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(C) (excluding certain prior statements of identification from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>definition of hearsay). In reaching that conclusion, the Court underscored the difference between a witness who refuses to testify and one who claims a memory loss:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\"><em>Just as with the constitutional prohibition </em>... assertions of .privilege by the witness may undermine the process to such a degree that meaningful cross-examination within the intent of the Rule no longer exists. But that effect is not produced by the witness\u2019 assertion of memory loss\u2014which, as discussed earlier, is often the very result sought to be produced by cross-examination, and can be effective in destroying the force of the prior statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-6\"><em>Owens, </em>484 U.S. at 561-62, 108 S.Ct. at 844 (emphasis added). <em>Accord Nance, </em>331 Md. at 573, 629 A.2d 633 (quoting the preceding language from <em>Owens </em>with approval). <em>See also Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. at 19, 106 S.Ct. at 294 (\u201cQuite obviously, an expert witness who cannot recall the basis for his opinion invites the jury to find that his opinion is as unreliable as his memory.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">As in both <em>Owens </em>and <em>Nance, </em>the statement \u201cI don\u2019t remember\u201d is a statement the truth of which can be tested during cross-examination. The defendant can probe the reasons for the memory loss, the extent of the memory loss, and the declarant\u2019s ability to recall the circumstances under which the prior statement was made. The responses to those questions, and the declarant\u2019s demeanor while answering, will afford the jury some basis for assessing the truth of the prior statement. The jury may also assess whether the memory loss is genuine or purposely evasive. As the Court explained in <em>Owens, </em>484 U.S. at 560, 108 S.Ct. at 843:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">The weapons available to impugn the witness\u2019 statement when memory loss is asserted will of course not always achieve success, but successful cross-examination is not the constitutional guarantee. They are, however, realistic weapons, as is demonstrated by defense counsel\u2019s summation in this very case, which emphasized Foster\u2019s memory loss and argued that his identification of respondent was the result of the suggestions of people who visited him in the hospital.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>By comparison, a witness who persistently states \u201cI can\u2019t answer that question\u201d has not made a statement the truth of which can be tested. The statement is a blank, a cipher, a smooth stone wall, a sheer cliff with no footholds for climbing. The defendant may as well confront a mannequin, for all that the process will gain him. The statement itself says nothing about the witness\u2019s ability to recall and relate the events at issue. It says nothing about the credibility of the witness, the truth of the prior statement, or the circumstances under which that statement was made. For the defendant, the statement \u201cI can\u2019t answer that question\u201d is more damaging than mere silence. It invites the jury to speculate on the possibility that the defendant has threatened the witness, or has otherwise procured the refusal to testify.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the absence of hard evidence, such speculation would be both improper and highly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The application of these principles to the case at hand is illustrated by a pair of decisions from state and federal courts. In each case, one or more witnesses' refused to testify without asserting a valid privilege, and the reviewing court concluded that admission of the witness\u2019s out-of-court statements was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">In <em>Mayes v. Sowders, </em>621 F.2d 850 (6th Cir.1980), the defendant was convicted on two counts of robbery and two counts of murder. Mayes confessed to his participation in the robbery with his cousin, Leslie Beecham, but denied doing the actual shooting or stabbing. <em>Id. </em>at 851-52. Beecham also admitted his involvement in the robberies, but claimed that Mayes had done the killings. The shirt that Beecham wore during the second robbery had traces of human blood on it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>but Mayes\u2019s clothing did not. Beecham pled guilty to both the robberies and the murders, and his sentencing was deferred until after Mayes\u2019s trial. <em>Id. </em>at 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">At trial, the prosecution called Beecham as a witness. Beecham \u201cgave his name and address, answered two questions put to him by the prosecutor in the negative, and thereafter refused to testify further,\u201d despite a citation for contempt. The prosecution then called a police officer, who testified as to the \u201cprior inconsistent statements\u201d made by Beecham. <em>Id. </em>at 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">On appeal from a writ of habeas corpus, the Sixth Circuit concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">A witness is not available for full and effective cross examination when he or she refuses to testify.... This is equally true whether the refusal to testify is predicated on privilege or is punishable as contempt, so long as the refusal is not procured by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 856 (citing <em>Douglas, </em>380 U.S. 415, 85 S.Ct. 1074). As in the present case, the Sixth Circuit stressed that Beecham\u2019s prior statements to police were unreliable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">Beecham\u2019s statement that Mayes killed the gas station attendant was not corroborated by Mayes\u2019 own confession, or any other evidence in the case. The oral statement was made during a custodial interrogation of Beecham, <em>after Beecham had been shoum Mayes\u2019 statement that Beecham had been the guilty party. </em>The statement was self-serving.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap6\"><em>Id. </em>at 856 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). Accordingly, the court concluded that the defendant did not have a full and effective opportunity to cross-examine Beecham, and that the introduction of Beecham\u2019s statements violated the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">In <em>People v. Rios, </em>163 Cal.App.3d 852, 210 Cal.Rptr. 271 (1985), the performance of two trial witnesses was remarkably similar to Eiland\u2019s performance. Rios was convicted of a murder that occurred during the course of a burglary. A prosecution witness, Torres, told a police detective that Rios admitted killing the victim. A second man, Carillo, told police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>that Rios had approached him just prior to the crime. Rios spoke about \u201cdoing a job,\u201d and he asked Carillo for a gun. Carillo gave him a .25 caliber automatic pistol. Five minutes later, Carillo heard a gunshot nearby. The victim died of a .25 caliber gunshot wound to the chest. The murder weapon was not recovered. <em>Id. </em>210 Cal.Rptr. at 275-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Torres had been called to testify during a preliminary hearing, refused to answer, and was sentenced to six months\u2019 incarceration for contempt. At the time of trial he was still incarcerated. He informed the trial court that he would again refuse to answer, even though he had no privilege and could face further contempt charges. Carillo had not testified previously, and was granted full immunity from prosecution for the burglary and murder. <em>Id. </em>at 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">At trial, Torres and Carillo both took the stand and refused to testify. Each gave his name, and Carillo added his age. In response to further questions, both witnesses stated repeatedly, \u201cI refuse to answer that question,\u201d \u201cI refuse to answer that question,\u201d \u201cI refuse to answer any question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276-77 n. 2. After extensive argument by counsel, the trial judge ruled that the testimony given by each witness was an \u201cimplied denial\u201d of their earlier statements to police, and that the out-of-court statements were admissible as substantive evidence under a California rule pertaining to prior inconsistent statements.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 276. Accordingly, a police detective was permitted to testify regarding the prior statements that Torres and Carillo had made to police.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">On appeal, Rios challenged the admission of those statements, and the California Court of Appeals reversed. The court concluded that \u201cthe admission of a prior statement made by a witness who stonewalls at trial and refuses to answer any question on direct or cross-examination denies a defendant the right to confrontation which contemplates a meaningful oppor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>tunity to cross-examine the witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279 (footnote omitted). The court also concluded that the witness\u2019s trial testimony was not \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the out-of-court statements. <em>Id. </em>at 278-79. In each instance, the court explained, \u201cthere is simply no \u2018statement\u2019 in the record which is inconsistent, or for that matter consistent, with prior statements; there is no \u2018express testimony\u2019 at all from which to infer or deduce implied inconsistency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court concluded: \u201c[w]here, as here, the witnesses give no testimony, there is no evidence to support a finding of inconsistency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court explained that Rios was given no \u201cmeaningful opportunity\u201d to cross-examine the witnesses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-4\">Observing the demeanor of a totally recalcitrant witness when questioned about matters he refuses to answer \u201cis as meaningless as attempting to gain information as to the truth of unknown facts from his responses. Even <em>California v. Green\u2019s </em>holding rests on the assumption that meaningful trial confrontation will provide \u2018most of the lost protections [of contemporaneous cross-examination]\u2019.... \u201d There was no evidence from which the jury could evaluate the circumstances surrounding the making of the previous statements by Torres and Carillo; no way to test the truth of the statement itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 280 (quoting <em>People v. Simmons, </em>123 Cal.App.3d 677, 177 Cal.Rptr. 17 (1981) (quoting <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. at 158, 90 S.Ct. at 1935)). The situation presented here compels the same conclusion. Because Tyler had no meaningful opportunity to test the truth of Eiland\u2019s prior statements, the admission of those statements violated his right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">I find further support for that conclusion in a plethora of cases dealing with a closely analogous situation. When a prosecution witness who testifies on direct examination subsequently refuses to answer certain questions on cross-examination, a clear majority of state and federal courts have concluded that the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation may be violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>if the trial court refused to strike relevant portions of the witness\u2019s direct testimony. As Wigmore explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">Where the witness, after his examination in chief on the stand, has <em>refused </em>to submit to cross-examination, the opportunity of thus probing and testing his statements has substantially failed, and his direct testimony should be struck out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">5 Wigmore \u00a7 1391(2), at 137. In <em>United States v. Cardillo, </em>316 F.2d 606 (2d Cir.1963), <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 822, 84 S.Ct. 60, 11 L.Ed.2d 55 (1963), the Second Circuit articulated the test to be used in determining whether the Confrontation Clause has been violated by the trial court\u2019s failure to strike the relevant direct testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">Where the privilege has been invoked as to the purely collateral matters, there is little danger of prejudice to the defendant and, therefore, the witness\u2019s testimony may be used against him.... On the other hand, if the witness by invoking the privilege precludes inquiry into the details of his direct testimony, there may be a substantial danger of prejudice because the defense is deprived of the right to test the truth of his direct testimony....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 611. The court noted that a distinction must be drawn between questions that \u201cbear only on the credibility of the witness,\u201d and those which address the substance of the testimony given during direct examination. In the latter situation, the direct testimony \u201cshould be stricken in whole or in part.\u201d <em>Id. See also U.S. v. Zapata, </em>871 F.2d 616, 623 (7th Cir.1989) (\u201cWhen a witness\u2019 refusal to answer prevents [a] defendant from directly assailing the truth of the witness\u2019 testimony, the court should strike at least the relevant portion of the testimony.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">The test annunciated in <em>Cardillo </em>has been followed by nearly all federal circuits and the courts of most states.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number><em>Cardillo </em>and its progeny generally involve a witness who asserts a valid privilege against self-incrimination. As in <em>Douglas </em>and <em>Mayes, </em>however, courts have emphasized that the assertion of a valid privilege is unnecessary. It makes no difference \u201cwhether the refusal to testify is predicated on privilege or is punishable as contempt, so long as the refusal is not procured by the defendant.\u201d <em>See Mayes, </em>621 F.2d at 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">In <em>Klein v. Harris, </em>667 F.2d 274 (2nd Cir.1981), a witness named Rabinowitz testified that he and Klein had gone to the victim\u2019s house together and that Rabinowitz held the victim while Klein stabbed her. After he left the stand, Rabinowitz admitted to defense counsel that he lied on the stand under pressure from the assistant district attorney. He also admit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>ted that he, not Klein, had actually killed the victim. The defense recalled Rabinowitz to the stand, but Rabinowitz invoked the privilege against self-incrimination and refused to answer further questions. <em>Id. </em>at 279-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The Second Circuit held that Rabinowitz\u2019s original testimony resulted in a testimonial waiver of his fifth amendment privilege, and that Rabinowitz should have been ordered to testify under penalty of contempt. <em>Id. </em>at 288-89. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">If the witness thereafter continues to refuse to testify, and if the refusal precludes the defendant from testing the truth of the witness\u2019 prior testimony, the trial judge must strike the prior testimony.. .. The failure of the trial judge to take such corrective action deprives the defendant of his sixth amendment right of confrontation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 289 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">The Eighth Circuit reached a similar conclusion in <em>Carlos v. Wyrick, </em>753 F.2d 691 (8th Cir.1985). McGuire, a prosecution witness, testified that Carlos had hired him to carry out a contract killing. McGuire also stated that he was accompanied by an unidentified companion. On cross-examination, defense counsel attempted to question McGuire about the identity of his companion. <em>Id. </em>at 692. McGuire did not invoke the privilege against self-incrimination, but repeatedly stated \u201cI would rather not answer that.\u201d <em>See Carlos v. Wyrick, </em>589 F.Supp. 974, 977-78 (W.D.Mo.1984) (discussing the facts of the case in greater detail). The Eighth Circuit concluded that McGuire\u2019s refusal to answer questions bearing directly on the circumstances surrounding the murder deprived Carlos of his right of confrontation, and that McGuire\u2019s testimony concerning events at the time and place of the murder should have been stricken. <em>Carlos, </em>753 F.2d at 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">In <em>Thomas v. State, </em>63 Md.App. 337, 492 A.2d 939 (1985), we endorsed and applied the <em>Cardillo </em>test. As in <em>Cardillo, </em>a witness offered by the State asserted his fifth amendment privilege on cross-examination. Judge Karwacki, writing for this Court, explained that the defendant\u2019s right to confronta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>tion had not been violated because the questions that the witness refused to answer were directed to purely collateral matters, including the credibility of the witness. <em>Id. </em>at 345-46, 492 A.2d 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">In the instant case, Eiland\u2019s testimony was anything but collateral\u2014it went to the very heart of the State\u2019s case against Tyler. Had Eiland simply repeated his prior testimony on direct examination, but refused to answer questions during cross-examination, the test we applied in <em>Thomas </em>would compel the conclusion that his direct testimony should be stricken. I see no principled reason why his self-serving, presumptively unreliable testimony from the earlier trial should be accorded more deference. Indeed, Eiland\u2019s personal stake in the outcome of the earlier trial suggests that his testimony from that trial should be treated with less.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Although <em>Cardillo, Klein, Carlos </em>and <em>Thomas </em>do not involve the precise situation presented here, they provide forceful support to the conclusion that Tyler\u2019s right to confrontation was violated by the admission of Eiland\u2019s prior testimony. In each of those cases, the critical witness gave testimony at trial, <em>in the presence of the jury </em>that was charged with the task of deciding the defendant\u2019s fate. Thus, the jury had an opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witness, and had some basis for evaluating the truth of the testimony given. In the present case, of course, the jury had nothing from which it could evaluate Eiland\u2019s credibility or test the truth of his prior testimony. It could neither observe Eiland\u2019s demeanor, nor was there any opportunity for counsel to probe questions of bias, motive, the ability to observe or recollect, or inconsistencies. Moreover, <em>Cardillo, Klein, Carlos </em>and <em>Thomas </em>all demonstrate that the willingness of the witness to answer questions on direct examination is not sufficient to satisfy the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation. ' Something more is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">IY</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s assertion that Tyler failed to preserve the issue for appellate review by failing to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>some attempt at cross-examining Eiland <em>after </em>the introduction of his prior testimony. One must consider the events that transpired before the testimony was introduced. On March 3, the State and the trial judge made extensive efforts to question Eiland, to no avail. Eiland was held in contempt and spent the next eighteen days in jail. On March 21, the State and the judge again attempted to question Eiland, again to no avail. Defense counsel then questioned Eiland, and received two replies of \u201cI can\u2019t answer.\u201d Immediately before the prior testimony was introduced, <em>the trial judge determined that Eiland was unavailable </em>and ruled that Eiland\u2019s trial testimony was admissible under the exception for Former Testimony. The trial judge did not rule that the prior testimony was admissible under <em>Nance; </em>indeed, such a ruling would have been inconsistent with his conclusion that Eiland was not available. Under those circumstances, I think it unreasonable to conclude that Tyler was required to ask questions of an \u201cunavailable\u201d witness. Tyler properly objected to the admission of the testimony. Nothing further was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s assertion that Tyler somehow \u201cprocured\u201d Eiland\u2019s refusal to testify. The majority offers three distinct theories by which the trial judge <em>might </em>have reached that conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">1) Because Tyler and Eiland were \u201cfast friends,\u201d Eiland \u201cmight have resorted to any reasonable measure, short of convicting himself, to keep from damaging testimonially his erstwhile friend.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">2) The alleged intimidation of Eiland might have been orchestrated by Tyler, or by his \u201csupporters,\u201d \u201cfriends,\u201d or \u201cadherents.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-8\">3) Tyler \u201cstrenuously\u201d requested a trial severance, and \u201cstrenuously\u201d objected to the continuance and other efforts designed to compel Eiland\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">At the outset, the State is in complete control of the prosecution\u2019s case under our adversarial system; to somehow attribute to the appellant the ability to orchestrate the intricate scheme proposed by the majority loses sight of the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>that it was the State that made the decision to call a witness that it never had reason to believe would be other than hostile\u2014a decision which put into motion the sequence of events culminating in the improper admission of the transcript of Eiland\u2019s trial testimony. The majority\u2019s thesis appears to proceed on a curious theory of the State\u2019s entitlement to the co-defendant\u2019s testimony. Absent procurement of wrongdoing by appellant or some other act on his part to impede the search for the truth, no such entitlement exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">With regard to the first two theories, the pertinent evidentiary rules provide that a litigant may not <em>procure </em>the unavailability of a witness, or otherwise prevent a witness from testifying. See. Lynn McLain, 6 Maryland Evidence 445; Md.Rule 5-804(A). Thus, Tyler is simply not responsible for the conduct of his \u201cfriends,\u201d \u201csupporters,\u201d or \u201cadherents\u201d unless he somehow \u201cprocured\u201d their conduct. Whether Tyler himself persuaded, induced, prevailed upon, coerced, or otherwise caused his friends, adherents or supporters to do anything at all is a question of <em>fact, </em>to be determined by the trial judge. Judge Ahalt made no such finding, and it is impermissible for this court to speculate on the mere possibility that such a finding might have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The degree of speculation involved is readily apparent from the majority\u2019s opinion. At some points, the majority theorizes that Eiland and Tyler were in cahoots, and that the two men conspired in a clever gambit to win a joint acquittal. At other points, the majority suggests that Tyler, through his supporters, may have threatened Eiland\u2019s life. We may, of course, uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling on <em>legal </em>grounds other than those relied upon by the judge. We may not uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling on the basis of speculation, when the necessary factual findings were not made.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The majority\u2019s suggestion that Tyler\u2019s trial tactics somehow contributed to Eiland\u2019s unavailability is equally untenable. The majority refers to this theory as \u201cat least a modest additional makeweight,\u201d apparently in acknowledgement that this hypothesis is added as a \u201cfiller\u201d without\u2019 any independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>merit or worth. It is axiomatic that no criminal defendant should be penalized for merely <em>requesting </em>relief, even when the request borders on being frivolous. In <em>Johnson v. State, 274 </em>Md. <em>536, 336 </em>A.2d 113 (1975), the defendant pled not guilty to all charges. A jury thereafter convicted Johnson of burglary, and the judge sentenced Johnson to twelve years. During the sentencing hearing, the trial judge told Johnson that \u201cif you had come in here with a plea of guilty ... you probably would have gotten a modest sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543, 336 A.2d 113. The Court of Appeals vacated the sentence, and explained its decision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">[A] price may not be exacted nor a penalty imposed for <em>exercising the fundamental and constitutional right </em>or requiring the State to prove, at trial, the guilt of the petitioner as charged. This is as unallowable a circumstance as would be the imposition of a more severe penalty because a defendant asserted his right to counsel or insisted on a jury rather than a court trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-6\"><em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">A similar principle applies to the case at hand. Tyler had a right to <em>request </em>a trial severance, and a right to request that his trial be completed swiftly, without the delay of an eighteen day continuance. Such requests are routinely made in criminal cases. They are also routinely denied, even when the request is made with great vigor. At best, the majority effectively suggests that Tyler must somehow be blamed or punished simply for making those requests. At worst, the majority effectively suggests that Tyler\u2019s guilt may be inferred from his decision to put forward a vigorous defense. Tyler did not <em>grant </em>his own motion for severance. The trial court granted the motion, and Tyler cannot be penalized for the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">With respect to the majority\u2019s \u201cAlternative Rationale,\u201d it posits that, reduced to its singular significance, the prior testimony of Eiland is but an \u201cidentification of the shooter,\u201d sanctioned by <em>Nance, Bedford v. State, </em>293 Md. 172, 443 A.2d 78 (1982) and other authorities which hold that an extrajudicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>identification may be received as substantive evidence under certain conditions. Citing <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972), the majority correctly points out that \u201c[i]n <em>Nance, </em>the identification in issue did not involve the classical weighing of reliability factors versus the risk of misidentification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">To be sure, we are not here so much concerned with the lighting at the time of the crime, the opportunity to observe and other factors which could result in misidentification. We are, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>concerned with something far more sinister than an eyewitness\u2019s innocent\u2014but mistaken\u2014identification of the criminal agent. We are here concerned with the whole cloth of a co-defendant\u2019s testimony calculated' to achieve a singular purpose\u2014his acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">This is not such a case as that presented when there is an attempt by a witness to a crime, ostensibly in aid of an investigation, to make an identification of the perpetrator in furtherance of the apprehension and prosecution of a suspect and the witness subsequently recants. The theory in such cases is that there is inherent trustworthiness in the initial identification prior to the intervention of some impediment, be it memory loss, intimidation, or other forces. At no point in time could Eiland\u2019s testimony be viewed as rehable. Could Eiland have been expected to testify any differently than he did regardless to whether he was in fact the shooter? Therein lies the inherent unreliability of his prior testimony and the reason why prior decisions allowing extra judicial identifications, where there is no other hearsay exception, require \u201cthe identifying victims or eyewitnesses [to be] present and subject to cross examination,\u201d <em>Johnson v. State, </em>237 Md. 283, 206 A.2d 138 (1965). In fact, the common thread running through virtually all of the identification decisions is that the witness could be tested as to why he or she was unable to identify the defendant at trial. [For in-depth discussion, <em>see Smith and Samuels v. State, </em>6 Md.App. 59, 250 A.2d 285 (1969) ].</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The salient distinction in the case <em>sub judice </em>is that there never was a reliable, trustworthy identification that Eiland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>recanted. At all times, the testimony in question was calculated, not to further a homicide investigation, but to facilitate the acquittal of an accomplice. To reiterate the obvious, <em>Nance </em>addresses the problem of a \u201cTurncoat Witness.\u201d One cannot be a turncoat when he was never cast in the role of a witness for the prosecution in the first instance. I believe the majority, to use its words, has indeed \u201cprobfed] the outer limits of a principle\u2019s logic,\u201d both as to the primary thesis and the Alternative Rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">y</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Had both Eiland and Tyler been acquitted, given the evidence before the jury, it would have indeed been a miscarriage of justice. The overwhelming evidence was that only the two defendants were within the vehicle from which the shots were fired; hence, at least one of the two was necessarily guilty. Accordingly, the trial judge expressed his desire to discover a way \u201cwhere substantial justice [could] be done for the community.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In our appellate review of the lower court proceedings, we must not allow the facts of a given case to cause us to fashion a rule of law that will result in \u201csubstantial [injustice\u201d when applied to subsequent cases. In crafting the rules of constitutional criminal procedure, we must not permit our decision to be fact-driven and we must be cognizant that ofttimes it is the culpable [or more culpable] member of a criminal enterprise who, by his own devices or fortuitously, \u2022winds up pointing his finger at his co-defendant. Bearing that in mind, we must be vigilant that we maintain a system of criminal justice \u201cin which the perception as well as the reality of fairness prevails\u201d for all criminal defendants, regardless of the outcome in any one case. <em>See Lee, </em>476 U.S. at 540, 106 S.Ct. at 2061.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">The grave importance of our task is underscored by the facts of <em>Klein, </em>667 F.2d 274. In that case, the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>convicted of second degree murder on the testimony of a witness who later admitted that he, and not the defendant, had actually killed the victim. <em>Id. </em>at 279-80. The majority\u2019s ruling may one day lead to a similar result. Assume, for a moment, that Tyler had pulled the trigger, and that Eiland was unaware of Tyler\u2019s intentions until the fatal shot was fired. Assume further that <em>Tyler </em>had been tried first, and that he had been acquitted after shifting all blame on Eiland. If Tyler refuses to testify at Eiland\u2019s trial, should the transcript of Tyler\u2019s earlier testimony be admitted against Eiland? The majority\u2019s decision effectively undermines a fundamental right designed to facilitate the search for truth. The net result is the creation of a mechanism whereby a wily killer might succeed in transferring blame onto the shoulders of an unwary subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">There is a second and perhaps more common scenario by which a substantial injustice might be done. One culpable, but not the master mind during a criminal event, might be convicted of the more serious crime than any act that he or she actually committed. Hence, assume that an unplanned murder occurs during the course of a robbery. The triggerman, who acted with malice aforethought, is tried first, and shifts all blame for the killing to his accomplice. The accomplice\u2014 guilty only because of criminal responsibility imputed by felony murder\u2014might then be convicted of second or even first degree murder, on the strength of the real killer\u2019s prior testimony. Effective cross-examination is the only means by which the accomplice can parry such a thrust. <em>Compare Mayes, </em>621 F.2d 850 (wherein two robbers each accused the other of killing the victims). The possibility that a defendant might be convicted of a crime that he or she did not commit must not be taken lightly.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">For the reasons set forth above, I am not persuaded that Tyler had a full, fair, and meaningful opportunity for effective cross-examination, and, consequently, I conclude that the admission of Eiland\u2019s prior testimony violated Tyler\u2019s right to confrontation, under both the Sixth Amendment and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Because the error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>was undoubtedly prejudicial, I would reverse Tyler\u2019s convictions and remand for a new trial. A jury could well find the evidence of the shots having been fired from a vehicle occupied by two men, only one of whom had a motive to kill Bias, sufficient to convict Tyler at a retrial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-9\">. <em>See, e.g., </em>Kenneth W.

This was the reason Judge Ahalt held that Eiland was \u201cunavailable\u201d as a witness. If Eiland had a legally justified reason to remain silent, Eiland\u2019s prior trial testimony would unquestionably have been inadmissible under <em>Douglas v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 13 L.Ed.2d 934 (1965), and <em>Nance v. State, </em>331 Md. 549, 572, 629 A.2d 633 (1993). In <em>Douglas, </em>the Supreme Court held that a defendant\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause were violated when the prosecution was allowed to read into evidence prior testimony of a witness implicating the defendant, after the \u25a0witness had invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. In <em>Nance, </em>the Court said: \u201cWitnesses who are not actually available for cross-examination despite their presence in the court are, for example, those who refuse to testify by asserting the spousal privilege or the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 572, 629 A.2d 633 (citing <em>People v. Redd, </em>135 Ill.2d 252, 142 Ill.Dec. 802, 837, 553 N.E.2d 316, 351 (1990)). <em>See also, 4 </em>Weinstein &amp; Berger, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Weinstein\u2019s Evidence United States Rules, \u00b6 801(d)(l)(A)(01) at 801-144 (1988); McClain, Maryland Rules of Evidence, p. 225 (1994 ed.). Here, Eiland\u2019s refusal was without justification. The question then becomes: For purposes of the implementation of the right to confrontation as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment, does it matter whether Eiland\u2019s refusal was justified? The answer to that question should determine the outcome of this case. Impliedly, the majority - answers, \u201cyes\u201d to that question. In my view, with one exception discussed <em>infra, </em>it does not matter why Eiland refused to testify. Because he would not answer substantive questions, he was not available for cross-examination.-</p>\n<p id=\"Aey\">The purpose of the Confrontation Clause was explained one hundred years ago in <em>Mattox v. United States, </em>156 U.S. 237, 15 S.Ct. 337, 39 L.Ed. 409 (1895):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">The primary object of the constitutional provision in question was to prevent depositions or <em>ex parte </em>affidavits * * * being used against the prisoner in lieu of a personal examination and cross-examination of the witness, in which the accused has an opportunity, not only of <em>testing the recollection and sifting the conscience of the witness, </em>but of compelling him to stand face to face with the jury in order that they may look at him, and judge by his demeanor upon the stand and <em>the manner in which he gives his testimony whether he is worthy of belief.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">More recently, in <em>California v. Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 158, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 1935, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Amv\">Viewed historically, then, there is good reason to conclude that the Confrontation Clause is not violated by admitting a declarant\u2019s out-of-court statements, as long as the declarant is testifying as a witness and subject to <em>full and effective cross-examination.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">This conclusion is supported by comparing the purposes of confrontation with the alleged dangers in admitting an out-of-court statement. Confrontation: (1) insures that the witness will give his statements under oath\u2014thus impressing him with the seriousness of the matter and guarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>against the lie by the possibility of a penalty for perjury; (2) forces the witness to submit to cross-examination, the \u201cgreatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth\u201d; (3) permits the jury that is to decide the defendant\u2019s fate to observe the demeanor of the witness in making his statement, thus aiding the jury in assessing his credibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3R\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">In <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 315-16, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 1110, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974), the Supreme Court explained further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution guarantees the right to an accused in a criminal prosecution \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d This right is secured for defendants in state as well as federal criminal proceedings under <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965). Confrontation means more than being allowed to confront the witness physically. \u201cOur cases construing the [confrontation] clause hold that a primary interest secured by it is the right of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Douglas v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415, 418, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 1076, 13 L.Ed.2d 934 (1965). Professor Wigmore stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">\u201cThe main and essential purpose of confrontation is to <em>secure for the opponent the opportunity of cross-examination. </em>The opponent demands confrontation, not for the idle purpose of gazing upon the witness, or of being gazed upon by him, but for the purpose of cross-examination, which cannot be had except by the direct and personal putting of questions and obtaining immediate answers.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) 5 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1395, p. 123 (3d ed. 1940).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Because, as stated in <em>Davis, supra, </em>cross-examination cannot be had \u201cexcept by the direct and personal putting of questions and obtaining immediate answers,\u201d Tyler had no opportunity to cross-examine Eiland fully and effectively. The fact that Eiland\u2019s refusal to answer questions was unjustified cannot change this reality.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">The majority says, at 522:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>In the case of Eiland, there was nothing to prevent the fact finders from looking upon him, listening to him, observing his demeanor as he answered or refused to answer, and assessing him in some meaningful fashion. None of this occurred in <em>Simmons v. State.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">By analogy: If a prisoner of war gives his interrogator his name, rank, and serial number but refuses to answer any other questions, the questioner may very well assess him in some meaningful fashion (prisoner is brave, clean, alert, fidgety, etc.), but the questioner will not gain any insight into the prisoner\u2019s credibility. Likewise, the jury could gaze upon Eiland while he was on the stand. Because he refused to answer every question regarding Jay Bias\u2019s murder, however, the jury could not possibly accurately judge his credibility on that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The rule that is here applicable was set forth in <em>Mayes v. Sowders, </em>621 F.2d 850, 856 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 922, 101 S.Ct. 324, 66 L.Ed.2d 151 (1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">A witness is not available for full and effective cross-examination when he or she refused to testify. <em>Douglas v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 13 L.Ed.2d 934 (1965); <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968); <em>Nelson v. O\u2019Neil, </em>402 U.S. 622, 91 S.Ct. 1723, 29 L.Ed.2d 222 (1971). <em>This is equally true whether the refusal to testify is predicated on privilege or is punishable as contempt, so long as the refusal to testify is not procured by the defendant. Douglas v. Alabama, supra, </em>380 U.S. at 420, 85 S.Ct. at 1077; <em>Motes v. United States, </em>178 U.S. 458, 471, 20 S.Ct. 993, 998, 44 L.Ed. 1150 (1900); <em>United States v. Mayes, </em>512 F.2d 637, 650-52 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. den., </em>422 U.S. 1008, 95 S.Ct. 2629, 45 L.Ed.2d 670 (1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">(Footnote omitted; emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">In this case, there was no finding that Eiland\u2019s unavailability was procured by the defendant. Thus, the exception mentioned in <em>Mayes </em>is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>In <em>Mayes </em>the defendant was charged with the robbery of a service station. A witness was called by the prosecution who answered two substantive questions. One of the questions was whether he was at the scene of the robbery for which defendant was charged. The witness answered, \u201cNo.\u201d Thereafter, the witness refused to testify further despite a conference in the judge\u2019s chambers and ultimately a contempt citation. The prosecutor called an investigating police officer who contradicted the witness\u2019s testimony that he was not at the scene of the robbery. The officer proceeded to testify, <em>inter alia, </em>that the witness had told him that he and the defendant were at the service station, that he and the defendant robbed it, and that in the course of the robbery defendant shot the service station attendant. The <em>Mayes </em>Court held that the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation was violated by the admission of the witness\u2019s prior statement to the police officer. <em>Id. </em>at 856.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">It is true that the mere fact that a hearsay declarant cannot be cross-examined does not necessarily mean that admission of the hearsay violates the Confrontation Clause. <em>Simmons v. State, </em>333 Md. 547, 556, 636 A.2d 463 (1994). The proponent of the hearsay, however, must prove: 1) the necessity of introducing the out-of-court statement, and 2) the out-of-court statement bears adequate <em>indicia </em>of reliability. <em>Id. </em>Necessity was shown here because Eiland was unavailable as a witness. A hearsay statement bears adequate <em>indicia </em>of reliability if it is based upon a \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d hearsay exception. <em>Id. </em>at 556-557, 636 A.2d 463. No firmly rooted hearsay exception is here applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Even if the hearsay exception is not \u201cfirmly rooted,\u201d the statement may still be admissible if the proponent makes a showing that the statement has \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Nance, </em>331 Md. at 560, 629 A.2d 633. There is a presumption, however, which the State must overcome, that the out-of-court statement is unreliable. <em>Id. </em>at 564, 629 A.2d 633. The <em>mere </em>fact that the statement is made under oath is not enough to guarantee trustworthiness. <em>United States v. Lang, 904 F.2d </em>618, 623 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>498 U.S. 924, 111 S.Ct. 805, 112 L.Ed.2d 258 (1990). The \u201cparticular guarantee of trustworthiness\u201d must be shown by relevant circumstances that \u201csurround the making of the statement and that render the declarant particularly worthy of belief.\u201d <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 819, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 3148, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990). Such circumstances may not include other evidence that would corroborate the veracity of the declarant\u2019s out-of-court statement. <em>Simmons, supra, </em>333 Md. at 561-62, 636 A.2d 463. Eiland\u2019s testimony given at his own trial in December 1993 before Judge Ahalt and a jury was completely self-serving. If convicted at the December 1993 trial, Eiland would have been eligible to receive a prison sentence of thirty years\u2014the same sentence he received from Judge Ahalt after his first conviction. Eiland had the strongest of motives to testify falsely in order to absolve himself of blame and to cast it entirely .on Tyler. The State failed to overcome the presumption that Eiland\u2019s December 1993 trial testimony was unreliable. The admission of Eiland\u2019s prior testimony violated Tyler\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront his accuser.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">\n<em>THE NANCE EXCEPTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">I do not agree that Eiland\u2019s testimony fits within the <em>Nance </em>exception to the rule against hearsay. The State failed to prove two necessary predicates for the application of that rule, .viz: 1) that Eiland\u2019s testimony presented to the jury on March 3, 1994 was inconsistent with the testimony Eiland gave at his own trial in December 1993 and 2) that Eiland was available at Tyler\u2019s trial for cross-examination regarding his prior testimony-</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">In order for a statement to be admissible under the <em>Nance </em>rule, there must be an inconsistency between the prior testimony and the witness\u2019s trial testimony. <em>Nance, supra, </em>331 Md. at 568, 629 A.2d 633. I read the term \u201cinconsistency\u201d as used in the <em>Nance </em>exception to mean self-contradiction. In support of the modern rule allowing use of a prior inconsistent statement as substantive evidence, the <em>Nance </em>Court did not define the term \u201cinconsistent.\u201d It did, however, justify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>modern rule by quoting two authorities\u2014McCormick and Learned Hand. Both of those authorities stress the element of self-contradiction in the witness\u2019s testimony, <em>ie., </em>the fact-finder compares the story the witness told earlier with the story he now tells. The <em>Nance </em>Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">The modern rule is widely supported by the commentators. McCormick asserts that the availability of cross-examining the declarant satisfied the aim of the hearsay rule to exclude untrustworthy evidence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\"><em>[T]he witness who had told one story aforetime and another today has opened the gates to all the vistas of truth which the common law practice of cross-examination and re-examination was invented to explore. </em>It will go hard, but the two questioners will lay bare the sources of the change of face, in forgetfulness, carelessness, pity, terror or greed, and thus reveal which is the true story and which the false. It is hard to escape the view that evidence of a previous inconsistent statement, when the declarant is on the stand to explain it if he can, has in high degree the safeguards of examined testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">C. McCormick, <em>The Turncoat Witness: Previous Statements as Substantive Evidence, </em>25 Tex.L.Rev. 573. 577 (1947). <em>Accord </em>3A Wigmore, <em>supra, \u00a7 </em>1018(b) (because purpose of hearsay rule is satisfied when witness is present and subject to cross-examination, former extrajudicial statement should be granted substantive value).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-8\">Supporters of the modern rule have long rejected the notion that the trier of fact must observe contemporaneously the declarant\u2019s demeanor when making the out-of-court statement. <em>Judge Learned Hand aptly observed that when a jury decides that what a witness says now is not the truth, but what he said before was truthful, they nonetheless are deciding from what they see and hear of that person in court. Di Carlo v. United States, </em>6 F.2d 364, 368 (2d Cir.1925). Some 30 years later Judge Hand returned to this theme:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJI\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>It is one thing to put in a statement of a person not before the jury: that is indeed hearsay bare and unredeemed. But it is quite a different matter to use them when the witness is before the jury, as part of the evidence derived from him of what is the truth, for it may be highly probative to observe and mark the manner of his denial---- Again and again in all sorts of situations we become satisfied, even without earlier contradiction, not only that a denial is false, but that the truth is the opposite.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\"><em>United States v.

Eiland was at no time, in the jury's presence, turned over to the defense for cross-examination. The reason for this, evidently, was that everyone at trial assumed that Eiland\u2019s refusal to testify made him unavailable for either direct or cross-examination. After the 18 day recess, out of the presence of the jury, Tyler\u2019s attorney asked Eiland two questions regarding whether he had been threatened.
