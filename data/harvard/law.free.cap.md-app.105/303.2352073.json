The victim, Kristy Green, was six years old at the time of the incident. In this appeal, appellant presents the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-10\">I. Whether reversal is mandated when the actual results of a lie detector test are unlawfully admitted at trial and when appellant\u2019s credibility is a crucial issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-11\">II. Whether the State made unlawful references to a polygraph test when the issue of voluntariness of confession was not raised by the defendant and when the references were unduly prejudicial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-12\">III. Whether the State violated the Equal Rights Amendment of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>struck two female jurors using peremptory challenges and when the State offered the explanation that the jurors either were not \u201csophisticated enough\u201d or that there were too many women on the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">We answer \u201cyes\u201d to the first two issues presented by appellant and reverse. We need not address the third issue, since it may not arise on retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">On July 20,1993, appellant was babysitting for Kristy Green while his girlfriend, Kristy\u2019s grandmother, went shopping. Appellant took Kristy to a nearby creek to catch crabs. According to Kristy, while they were sitting by the creek, appellant touched her vaginal area. When they returned to the house, Kristy\u2019s mother called. Kristy told her mother what appellant had done. Kristy and appellant then went back to crabbing. When they returned again to the house, Kristy\u2019s parents and several relatives were there. Kristy ran to her father. Appellant denied that he had touched Kristy and stated that all he had done was ask Kristy whether she called her vaginal area a \u201ctweety\u201d or a \u201cbird.\u201d The police were called and appellant was questioned. Appellant told the police that Kristy had been jumping up and down on his lap and that he had merely patted her on the bottom to make her stop. He was not arrested at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">A few months later, appellant was questioned further by Detective John D. Horne of the St. Mary\u2019s County Sheriffs Office. During this meeting, appellant \u201cfailed\u201d a polygraph test administered by Detective Horne. Appellant also gave a statement in which he confessed to touching Kristy in her vaginal area. During his confession, reference was made to the fact that appellant had \u201cfailed\u201d the polygraph test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aft\">[Detective] Horne: Have you told anybody else this story?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmB\">[Appellant]: All to the ah ... [Detective] Shoemaker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmA\">[Detective] Horne: I mean did you ... when you talked to her did you tell her the truth like you talked to me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqW\">[Appellant]: Well, I told it like I told in on there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>[Detective] Horne: I understand that and you told it you told when you took the polygraph.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">[Appellant]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">\n<em>[Detective] Home: You didn\u2019t pass the polygraph but ...</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">\n<em>[Appellant]: I realize that.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">Appellant was arrested on December 9, 1993 and charged with third degree sexual offense, child abuse, and battery. Trial took place on July 19 and 20, 1994. During direct examination of Detective Horne, the prosecutor sought to admit into evidence a transcribed version of appellant\u2019s confession, including that portion of it that referred to appellant failing the polygraph test. Appellant\u2019s attorney objected and moved <em>in limine </em>to have the reference to the polygraph test excised from the statement. Appellant\u2019s attorney also requested that no mention of the polygraph test be made by the State until appellant raised the issue of the voluntariness of his confession. Appellant\u2019s attorney argued that until this issue was raised, any reference to the fact that a polygraph test was taken or any reference to the results of such test would be grounds for a mistrial. The trial court denied these motions and admitted the statement into evidence. The court also permitted Detective Horne to testify regarding his expertise in the administration of polygraph tests, and to testify concerning the waiver form that he witnessed appellant sign prior to taking the polygraph test. Appellant\u2019s attorney objected to each reference to the polygraph test by the prosecution and, at the close of the State\u2019s case, moved for a mistrial. This motion was, likewise, denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">Appellant was found guilty on all charges and sentenced to ten years, with all but eighteen months suspended. He also received five years probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">Admissibility of Polygraph Test</p>\n<p id=\"b330-13\">Appellant argues that it was reversible error for the trial court to have admitted any evidence of the polygraph test. He contends that he was unduly prejudiced by not only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>reference to the results of the test but also by the numerous references during direct examination of Detective Horne to the fact that a test was administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">It is well-settled in Maryland that the results of a polygraph test are inadmissible. <em>Guesfeird v. State, </em>300 Md. 653, 658, 480 A.2d 800 (1984); <em>Lusby v. State, </em>217 Md. 191, 194-95, 141 A.2d 893 (1958).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The principle reason for excluding such evidence is that the polygraph has not attained that degree of general scientific acceptance as an accurate and reliable means of ascertaining truth to justify reliance upon it in a court of law. <em>See Rawlings v. State, </em>7 Md.App. 611, 613-14, 256 A.2d 704 (1969) (holding for the first time that the results of lie detector tests are not admissible in Maryland courts).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, mere references to the fact that a test was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>taken, without mentioning the results of the test, may be grounds for reversal if the results can be inferred from the circumstances or if the references are prejudicial. <em>Guesfeird, </em>300 Md. at 659, 480 A.2d 800 (citing <em>State v. Edwards, </em>412 A.2d 983, 985 (Me.1980)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See also Johnson v. State, </em>303 Md. 487, 513, 495 A.2d 1 (1985); <em>Lusby, </em>217 Md. at 195, 141 A.2d 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">In <em>State v. Hawkins, </em>326 Md. 270, 275, 604 A.2d 489 (1992), the Court of Appeals observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">The reliability of [polygraph] tests has not been established to our satisfaction, and we have consistently refused to permit evidence with regard to them. In our system of criminal justice, the trier of fact is the lie detector, and we have been steadfast in disallowing that function to be usurped by a process we have not found to be trustworthy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Mention at a criminal trial of the results of a polygraph test, or the taking of the test, or the willingness or unwillingness to take the test, raises the specter of reversal. In criminal prosecutions, the polygraph test is a pariah; \u201cpolygraph\u201d is a dirty word.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Here, there is no question that the jury was made aware of the fact that appellant did not pass the polygraph test. In appellant\u2019s confession, a tape of which was played for the jury, it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">[Detective] Horne: You didn\u2019t pass the polygraph but ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHE\">[Appellant]: I realize that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">In addition, as appellant notes, the \u201cfact\u201d that he took a polygraph test was referred to numerous other times during the direct examination of Detective Horne by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">The State argues, however, that an exception to the general rule regarding the admissibility of polygraph tests is applicable in this case. This exception allows evidence of a polygraph test to be admitted where the voluntariness of a confession is at issue. <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>51 Md.App. 347, 353, 443 A.2d 651, <em>cert. denied, </em>293 Md. 617, <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 915, 103 S.Ct. 227, 74 L.Ed.2d 180 (1982). Under this exception, the taking of a lie detector test may be considered by the jury in determining whether a confession, elicited prior to, contemporaneously with, or after the test, was freely and voluntarily given. The rationale for this exception is that the fact that a polygraph test was administered during police questioning of a suspect is no different than any \u201cother potentially coercive condition, person or device present during interrogation.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>31 Md.App. at 309, 355 A.2d 504. \u201cThe jury must have the opportunity to consider <em>all </em>of the evidence pertaining to the voluntariness of a confession before deciding the question of guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">In <em>Johnson, </em>the defendant sought to have the fact that he was subjected to a polygraph test during his interrogation submitted to the jury in order to support his allegation that his confession was involuntary. <em>Id. </em>at 306, 355 A.2d 504. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s request, and on appeal we held that the exclusion of such evidence was reversible error. <em>Id. </em>We noted that the test given to the defendant was a psychological tool used by the police in the interrogation process and was therefore relevant to the voluntariness of his confession. <em>Id. </em>at 307-09, 355 A.2d 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">In <em>Mitchell, </em>51 Md.App. at 350, 443 A.2d 651, it was again the defendant who sought to admit evidence of a polygraph test. There, two polygraph tests were administered in order to verify statements the defendant made to the police. <em>Id. </em>at 353, 443 A.2d 651. The trial court ruled <em>sua sponte </em>that the jury could not be informed that the tests were given to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 350, 443 A.2d 651. We affirmed, holding that the court did not err in excluding such evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 353-54, 443 A.2d 651. We noted that the defendant did not claim that he was coerced into making the statements, but rather sought to have the fact that the tests were administered submitted to the jury in order to demonstrate that the tests \u201cinfluenced the police in their conduct toward the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353, 443 A.2d 651. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">[The voluntariness exception] is limited to situations <em>where the issue of voluntariness of a statement is before a jury, and where it is contended that the administering of a polygraph test is relevant to the question of whether the statement was voluntarily given. </em>Only under these circumstances is the jury entitled to have the facts before it in order to assist them in deciding whether it is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the statements were voluntary. <em>In the absence of such an issue being generated, however, neither the fact that a polygraph test was administered nor the results of the test should be admitted into evidence. </em>To hold differently would encourage the indulgence by a jury in rank speculation to the detriment of either the State or the defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 353-54, 443 A.2d 651 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Thus, we must decide whether the issue of voluntariness was sufficiently raised in this case so as to warrant submitting evidence of appellant\u2019s polygraph test to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Guidelines for raising the involuntariness of a confession are set forth in Maryland Rule 4-252(a). Pursuant to this Rule, it is mandatory that a defendant file a motion to suppress an unlawfully obtained confession prior to trial. Md.Rule 4-252(a)(4). The motion must be filed within 30 days of the defendant\u2019s first appearance in court and must be in writing unless the court otherwise directs. Md.Rule 4-252(b), (d). The failure to file such a motion results in the waiver of this argument by the defendant. Md.Rule 4-252(a). The Rules further require that the court decide the motion \u201cbefore trial and, to the extent practicable, before the day of trial.... \u201d Md.Rule 4-252\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The Court of Appeals has delineated a specific two-tiered process for determining the voluntariness of any confession sought to be admitted at trial. Under this procedure, \u201cthe jury determines voluntariness only after the judge has \u2018fully and independently\u2019 ruled that the confession is voluntary.\u201d <em>Brittingham v. State, </em>306 Md. 654, 662, 511 A.2d 45 (1986) (quoting <em>Dempsey v. State, </em>277 Md. 134, 145, 355 A.2d 455 (1976)). The judge must first conduct a hearing, without the jury present, to \u201cdetermine as a matter of law whether the challenged confession will or will not be admitted into evidence.\u201d <em>Kidd v. State, </em>33 Md.App. 445, 457, 366 A.2d 761 (1976), <em>aff'd, </em>281 Md. 32, 375 A.2d 1105, <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1002, 98 S.Ct. 646, 54 L.Ed.2d 498 (1977). If the judge is convinced from all the evidence that the confession was freely and voluntarily made, it should be admitted as prima facie proof. <em>Brittingham, </em>306 Md. at 663, 511 A.2d 45 (quoting <em>Smith v. State, </em>189 Md. 596, 603-04, 56 A.2d 818 (1948)). The jury then must determine for itself whether the confession was voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Here, the lower court overruled a pre-trial motion by appellant to suppress his statement to the police. We cannot determine from the record before us whether the polygraph issue was raised before the motions judge but shall assume that it was since the docket entry states, \u201cDefendant present with counsel for Suppression hearing ... State\u2019s Ex # 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>(Miranda Card), #2 (Statement), #3 (Waiver form), #4 (Waiver form), # 5 (audio cassette tape), and # 6 (statement) marked for ID and Rec\u2019d----Motion to Suppress is denied.\u201d The State also claims that the voluntariness issue was raised during a colloquy that took pl\u00e1ce at trial between counsel and the court regarding the admissibility of the statement given by appellant. Prior to Detective Horne testifying, the court suggested to counsel that the reference to the polygraph be excised from the statement. When the court asked the prosecutor and appellant\u2019s attorney what they thought of this suggestion, the prosecutor responded that under the voluntariness exception, the \u201cjury is entitled to listen to any and all evidence that involves the voluntariness of the statement made to Corporal Horne.\u201d Appellant\u2019s attorney then explained that it was his impression that if his client decided to take the stand he was going to testify that he was coerced into making the confession:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">I understand Mr. Murphy to tell me that his confession and his admission of touching Kristy\u2019s private parts in the tape recorded statement he gave to Horne ... was an involuntary statement, and is not true, and the only reason he did it [was] because Corporal Horne tricked him and threatened him, tricked him with the polygraph and threatened in the polygraph after the polygraph procedure was over and just the two of them alone. And I expect Mr. Murphy is going to want to testify and tell the jury that that wasn\u2019t a voluntary statement, he tricked me and threatened me and that is the only reason I said that, and I didn\u2019t really touch the girl\u2019s private parts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">* * \u2756 # * #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">And so, therefore, I could be wrong, he could elect to remain silent....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">Appellant\u2019s attorney then requested that the reference to the polygraph test in the statement given by appellant be stricken and that no mention be made of the test until appellant first mentions it in the defense\u2019s case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>I think how it ought to be approached is this, is the State ought not even mention the polygraph until after Mr. Murphy mentions the polygraph, and perhaps they ought to do it in rebuttal, because I think it ought to be\u2014the jury ought not to hear it from anybody until they hear it from Mr. Murphy in the defense\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">}-! # * * #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">Well, that is how I would so move the Court to handle this situation is to have the polygraph excised from the State\u2019s case and [sic] chief. If the defendant brings it up, then they may bring it back up if they deem it necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">The court denied this request by appellant\u2019s attorney, and ruled that the reference to the polygraph test need not be stricken. The transcribed statement was admitted into evidence in its entirety and Detective Horne was permitted to testify that he was qualified to administer polygraph tests, that he advised appellant of his rights prior to the test, and that he witnessed appellant sign a waiver form for the test. Appellant\u2019s attorney objected to the admissibility of the statement and to each reference by Detective Horne to the polygraph test itself. During the defense\u2019s case, appellant chose not to take the stand and did not present any evidence regarding the voluntariness of his confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Evidence of Results of Polygraph Test</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">We hold that it was reversible error for the court to admit the transcript of the confession without excising the reference to appellant\u2019s failing the polygraph test. This reference was clearly prejudicial and should not have been presented to the jury. We foresee very few circumstances under which the \u201cresults\u201d of a polygraph test would ever be admissible. The potential for prejudice resulting from the jury knowing whether a defendant passed or failed a polygraph test would far outweigh any probative value that such evidence might have in determining the voluntariness or involuntariness of a subsequently or previously obtained confession. While the \u201cfact\u201d that the test was taken may be relevant under some circumstances to the voluntariness of a confession, the actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>results of the test would ordinarily have very little, if any, such relevance. It would have been a simple measure for the court to have excised from the confession the one reference to the results of the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Evidence of Taking Polygraph Test</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">We also hold that it was reversible error for the trial court to permit any references to the \u201cfact\u201d that appellant had even taken a polygraph test. The continual references to the test during Detective Horne\u2019s testimony was, in our view, extremely prejudicial to appellant. These references imbedded in the jury\u2019s mind not only that a test was administered to appellant, but, even in the absence of direct evidence, would likely lead the jury to infer that appellant had, in fact, failed the test. The State clearly went beyond what was necessary in order to establish that the confession given by appellant after the test was voluntary. The prejudice suffered by appellant as a result of the court admitting evidence of the polygraph test was not cured by the its instructions to the jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Compare Kelly v. State, </em>16 Md.App. 533, 298 A.2d 470, <em>aff'd, </em>270 Md. 139, 310 A.2d 538 (1973) (holding that inadvertent response by prosecution witness indicating that she had taken a lie detector test was cured by court\u2019s instruction to jury to disregard any reference to the test and not consider it in determining whether witness\u2019 testimony as to what occurred was credible).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>In summary, the voluntariness (polygraph) exception is not applicable here. The remarks of appellant\u2019s attorney during trial regarding his impression of what his client would testify to, if and when he took the stand, were not sufficient to generate the polygraph (as an instrument of coercion) issue in the case. Appellant, in fact, never took the stand and offered no evidence pertaining to the voluntariness of his confession.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The decision to raise the voluntariness issue, predicated on the coercive effect of a polygraph test, is a matter solely within the discretion of the defendant. If he chooses not to do so, no reference whatsoever may be made during trial to the fact that the defendant took a polygraph test. If, on the other hand, a defendant chooses to challenge the voluntariness of a confession due to an allegedly coercive polygraph, he runs the risk that the reference may be made to the test by the State or that he may have to make reference to it himself in order to have the confession suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ST.

The inherent unreliability of polygraph tests and their inadmissibility has long been recognized by commentators and courts alike. In <em>Johnson v. State, </em>31 Md.App. 303, 307-08, 355 A.2d 504 (1976), we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-10\">The reason for excluding the <em>results </em>of a polygraph examination is the questionable reliability of such evidence. Similarly, the admission into evidence of whether an accused agreed or refused to take such a test may give rise to jury speculation as to his reasons for submitting or refusing to submit to the test. In both cases, a determination of guilt or innocence may be affected by an accused's state of mind after the crime, rather than upon evidence produced related to the crime itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">One commentator aptly explained how polygraphy differs from other, accepted fields of criminology:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>A study of the theory and process of the polygraphy examination reveals complexities not present in the fields of fingerprint, handwriting, voice print, ballistics, and neutron activation analysis, all of which are based on the identity or behavior of physical phenomenon. The experts and studies differ as to the capability of the polygraph industry to cope with these complexities, but none would dispute their existence. The distinction is that polygraphy, albeit based on scientific theory, remains an art with unusual responsibility placed on the examiner. The acquainting of the examiner with the subject matter is often a source of improper suggestion, conscious or subconscious. The preparation of the test and discussion with the examinee of the polygraph procedure furnishes additional opportunity for improper subjective evaluation. The construction of the examination further proliferates controversy, for while experts may agree that a particular examination was inconclusive, they often do so for different reasons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Rydstrom, <em>Modem Status of Rule Relating to Admission of Results of Lie Detector (Polygraph) Test in Federal Criminal Trials, </em>43 A.L.R.Fed. at 71 (footnote and citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b332-9\">.
