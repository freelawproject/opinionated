The court sentenced appellant to seven years imprisonment, with all but eighteen months suspended, appellant being placed on supervised probation for a period of five years. One of the conditions of probation was that two and one-half years thereof be served under \u201chouse arrest.\u201d In this appeal from that judgment, appellant presents the following issues for our determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-10\">I. Whether the evidence was sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction of involuntary manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-11\">II. Whether the trial court erred in admitting expert testimony without a proper foundation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-12\">III. Whether the trial court admitted improper rebuttal evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-13\">IV. Whether the trial court imposed an illegal condition of probation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-14\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b302-15\">On an undetermined evening in July 1992, as appellant entered his home in Annapolis, where he lived with Christian Walton, Gene Kirshner, Isaac Kumer, Allan Tucker, and Willis Usilton, he complained about \u201cbums\u201d sleeping in the woods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>nearby. Approximately fifteen minutes later, appellant and Usilton left the house with a baseball bat and a flashlight, entered the woods, and proceeded to get into an argument with one of two men there. Appellant pushed one of the men off of the property, but the other man, Arch Baldwin, who was unconscious and appeared to be severely intoxicated, remained in the woods.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Appellant returned to his house and stated that there was someone \u201cpassed out in the woods.\u201d Usilton, Walton, Theodore Reshetiloff, and appellant then went into the woods to find Baldwin. When they found him, they taunted him, poked him with sticks, urinated on him, and poured paint on him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At one point, Baldwin appeared to open his eyes briefly, but then lost consciousness again. Appellant and his companions rolled Baldwin into a ditch four feet deep, threw stones and a mattress at him, and kicked dirt and trash on him. Baldwin subsequently attempted to crawl out of the ditch but was unsuccessful. Reshetiloff then threw a piece of a cinder block at him. When appellant and the other assailants left Baldwin, he was still alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The following day, appellant and Usilton returned to the woods and observed that Baldwin was dead. Later, appellant, Usilton, Reshetiloff, and Walton dug a hole at a location farther in the woods, transported Baldwin\u2019s body there, and tried to put it into the hole. To get the body to fit, appellant had to break one of Baldwin\u2019s legs with a shovel. After appellant covered the body with dirt, he stated that, if anyone ever told the police what had occurred, he would \u201ctake care of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Near the end of July, Officer Pete Medley of the Annapolis Police Department received a missing persons report for Arch Baldwin, described as a sixty-two year old man who often slept in the woods. On 5 April 1993, the police searched the area near appellant\u2019s home and located Baldwin\u2019s body. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>body appeared to be well preserved and was identified as that of Baldwin through a comparison of fingerprints.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">On 7 April 1993, Baldwin\u2019s body was examined at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore. Mario Golle, Jr., M.D., an assistant medical examiner, supervised the autopsy. The autopsy revealed that portions of Baldwin\u2019s coronary arteries were almost entirely obstructed by atherosclerosis and that the body had several fractures and lacerations, any or all of which may have occurred post mortem. Initially, Dr. Golle was unable to specify the cause of death because he had not yet received copies of the police report and witness statements. After Officer Medley gave Dr. Golle a copy of the police report and witness statements, Dr. Golle concluded that Baldwin had died of severe coronary artery disease and that the manner of death was homicide. According to Dr. Golle\u2019s testimony at appellant\u2019s trial, Baldwin essentially died of a \u201cheart attack while involved in an altercation.\u201d Dr. Golle also testified that Baldwin was a chronic alcoholic, and had a history of cirrhosis of the liver, alcohol liver disease, delirium tremens, seizures, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The grand jury charged appellant, in a five count indictment, with manslaughter, accessory after the fact to manslaughter, assault with intent to maim, reckless endangerment, and assault and battery. Prior to trial, the reckless endangerment and assault and battery charges were dismissed. At the conclusion of the trial, which lasted from 14 February to 4 March 1994, the court found appellant guilty of manslaughter but not guilty of assault with intent to maim. The charge of accessory after the fact was dismissed. On'4 May 1994, sentence was imposed and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Appellant contends that \u201cthe evidence was insufficient to support [his] conviction of involuntary manslaughter\u201d for two reasons. First, he asserts that the State failed to establish that he committed involuntary manslaughter based on the commission of a criminal homicide during the perpetration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>an unlawful act because the State did not prove that appellant committed \u201can unlawful act dangerous to life.\u201d Second, he maintains that the State did not present sufficient evidence establishing that his actions were the legal cause of the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">When reviewing a question of the sufficiency of the evidence, we must determine \u201c \u2018whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wiggins v. State, </em>324 Md. 551, 567, 597 A.2d 1359 (1991) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2788-89, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)); <em>see also Wilson v. State, </em>319 Md. 530, 535, 573 A.2d 831 (1990). \u201cIn this regard, under Maryland Rule 8-131(c), we defer to the factual findings of the trial judge in a non-jury case, unless they are clearly erroneous, giving due regard to the opportunity of the trial judge to observe the demeanor of the witnesses and to assess their credibility.\u201d <em>Wiggins, </em>324 Md. at 567, 597 A.2d 1359. With these considerations in mind, we shall address appellant\u2019s two arguments <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">A. <em>Unlawful Act Dangerous to Life</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Appellant contends that, where a prosecution for involuntary manslaughter is based on the commission <em>of an </em>unlawful act causing death, the act itself must be dangerous to life. Because \u201cthere was no evidence [that he committed] an [unlawful] act inherently dangerous to human life,\u201d appellant argues, the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Under Maryland common law, the crime of involuntary manslaughter is divided into three distinct categories. In <em>Neusbaum v. State, </em>156 Md. 149, 155, 143 A. 872 (1928) (quoting 2 <em>Bishop on Criminal Law. </em>par. 629), the Court of Appeals characterized the crime as including those cases in which one unintentionally kills another without malice \u201c[1] while needlessly doing anything in its nature dangerous to life, [2] or ... causes death by neglecting a duty imposed either by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>law or by contract, [3] or in the course of committing a crime or even a civil wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">These distinct classes of involuntary manslaughter were also set forth in <em>State v. Gibson, </em>4 Md.App. 236, 242, 242 A.2d 575 (1968), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">Involuntary manslaughter at common law has been generally defined as the killing of another unintentionally and without malice (1) in doing some unlawful act not amounting to a felony, or (2) in negligently doing some act lawful in itself, or (3) by the negligent omission to perform a legal duty. See 1 <em>Warren on Homicide </em>(Perm.Ed.1938), 420, 421; 26 Am.Jur. <em>Homicide, </em>Sec. 18, 44; 40 C.J.S. <em>Homicide, </em>Sec. 55, and cases therein cited. To this basic definition other authorities add the qualification, as to the first class of involuntary manslaughter, that the unlawful act be <em>malum in se, </em>and not merely <em>malum prohibitum.... </em>Clark and Marshall, <em>Crimes </em>(Sixth Ed.), Sections 10.04, 10.12-10.14; <em>Perkins on Criminal Law, </em>pp. 34, 57-61; Wharton\u2019s <em>Criminal Law and Procedure, </em>(Anderson Ed.), Vol. 1, Sections 289-292, 296, and cases therein cited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Similarly, in <em>Wilson v. State, </em>28 Md.App. 168, 172, 343 A.2d 537 (1975) (quoting Clark and Marshall, <em>Law of Crimes </em>\u00a7 10.12 (7th ed. 1967)), we delineated the classifications in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">1. Commission of a criminal act not amounting to a felony, nor naturally tending to cause death or grievous bodily harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-9\">2. Omission to perform a legal duty, under circumstances evidencing criminal-culpable negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-10\">3. Performing lawful act with criminal culpable negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Amj\">The first classification of involuntary manslaughter, known as unlawful act involuntary manslaughter or misdemeanor manslaughter, can broadly be stated as occurring where one commits a criminal act not amounting to a felony that unintentionally causes the death of another. This overly simplistic statement of the rule is misleading, however, because the rule\u2019s specific requirements hinge upon whether the unlawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>act was <em>malum in se </em>or <em>malum prohibitum. See United Life and Accident Ins. Co. v. Prostic, </em>169 Md. 535, 539, 182 A. 421 (1935); <em>Gibson, 4 </em>Md.App. at 242, 242 A.2d 575. \u201cAn offense <em>malum in se </em>is properly defined as one which is naturally evil as adjudged by the sense <em>of </em>a civilized community,\u201d <em>Garnett v. State, </em>332 Md. 571, 603 n. 12, 632 A.2d 797 (1993); it is an act that is wrongful in itself \u201cwithout any regard to the fact of its being noticed or punished by the laws of the state.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>959 (6th ed. 1990). Unlawful acts that are wrong only because they are prohibited by statute are considered to be <em>malum prohibitum </em>acts. <em>Garnett, </em>332 Md. at 603 n. 12, 632 A.2d 797 (citation omitted). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellant concedes that he committed \u201cunlawful acts.\u201d We now must determine whether those acts were <em>malum in se </em>or <em>malum prohibitum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">As noted <em>supra, </em>the victim was passed out in the woods near appellant\u2019s home when he was confronted by appellant and his friends. According to Walton\u2019s and Usilton\u2019s testimony, appellant poked the victim with a stick, urinated on him, and kicked dirt and trash on him. These acts clearly establish that appellant committed a common law misdemeanor battery against the victim. <em>See Kellum v. State, </em>223 Md. 80, 85, 162 A.2d 473 (1960) (stating that any unlawful force used against the person of another, no matter how slight, will constitute battery); <em>Taylor v. State, </em>52 Md.App. 500, 504, 450 A.2d 1312 (1982) (stating that a battery may be committed by the indirect application of force or the application of force indirectly). The State\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Golle, testified that the stress induced by the victim\u2019s altercation with appellant directly caused the victim to suffer a fatal heart attack. Thus, there was evidence to the effect that appellant\u2019s criminal battery caused the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">An intentional battery is an unlawful act that is <em>malum in se. See, e.g., </em>LaFave &amp; Scott, <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 7.13, at 681 (2d ed. 1986). Appellant\u2019s acts, however, were not generally what would be considered acts \u201cdangerous to life.\u201d Thus, we must determine whether an unlawful act that is <em>'malum in se </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>but is not itself dangerous to life can support a conviction for involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">That issue was addressed by the Court of Appeals in <em>Worthington v. State, </em>92 Md. 222, 48 A. 355 (1901). In that case, Worthington had been indicted for manslaughter for causing the death of the victim while performing an abortion on her. At that time, performing an abortion was a <em>malum in se </em>common law misdemeanor. <em>Id. </em>at 237, 48 A. 355. Worthington demurred to the indictment, arguing that \u201cthe death of a woman resulting from a criminal abortion upon her, is, at common law, murder, and the indictment ... is defective, because it charges death as the result of the abortion, but charges the defendant with the crime of manslaughter instead of murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235, 48 A. 355. His demurrer was overruled, and he was convicted. On appeal, Worthington challenged the overruling of his demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Initially, the Court of Appeals stated that, because performing an abortion is a misdemeanor, \u201ccausing the mother\u2019s death in attempting an abortion, is only manslaughter at common law, if the attempt is not made in a way that endangers the mother\u2019s life. In that case, it is murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237, 48 A. 355 (quoting <em>Clark\u2019s Criminal Law, </em>p. 161). The Court explained that \u201c[i]f the intent was to kill or grievously injure her the offense is murder. It is manslaughter if the intent was only to produce the miscarriage, the agency not being one from which death or grievous injury would be likely to result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Noting that \u201cdeath is not now the usual ... consequence of an abortion,\u201d and that the recipient is comparatively immune from danger, the Court held that Worthington properly was indicted for manslaughter. <em>Id. </em>at 239, 48 A. 355. In reaching that holding, the Court necessarily concluded that, under Maryland common law, a person could be guilty of what was, in effect, involuntary manslaughter, based on the commission of a criminal act that was <em>malum in se </em>but not considered to be dangerous to human life.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">In <em>United Life and Accident Ins. Co. v. Prostic, </em>169 Md. 535, 539, 182 A. 421 (1935), two robbers beat the victim and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>stole his money while he was working in his shop in Baltimore City. Soon thereafter, the victim apparently suffered a nonfatal heart attack. The pain in his chest continued for several weeks and, approximately five weeks later, he died \u201cdue to a coronary thrombosis induced by the beating.... \u201d 169 Md. at 536-37, 182 A. 421. Prostic, the victim\u2019s beneficiary under an insurance policy that provided double indemnity for accidental death if \u201csuch death shall not result from homicide,\u201d sued for payment under the policy. 169 Md. at 536, 182 A. 421. Appealing from a judgment in favor of Prostic, United Life argued that, because the insured\u2019s death was the result of a homicide, Prostic could not recover under the double indemnity provision of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">Holding that the insured was the victim of a criminal homicide, the Court of Appeals stated that the robbers committed involuntary manslaughter at least, and that they may also have committed first or second degree murder. <em>Id. </em>at 539-40,182 A. 421. In reaching its conclusion that an involuntary manslaughter had occurred, the Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX9\">when the person acting has no intention to injure anybody, but death is a result of unlawful action endangering life, there is manslaughter, at least. \u201cIt is not necessary that he should have intended the particular wrong which resulted from his act. If he intends to do an unlawful and wrongful act, which is punishable because it is wrong in itself, and in doing it he inflicts unforeseen injury, he is criminally liable for that injury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Hawkins, </em>157 Mass. 551, 553, 32 N.E. 862; <em>State v. Lehman, </em>131 Minn. 427, 430, 155 N.W. 399; <em>Killian v. State, </em>184 Ark. 239, 242, 42 S.W. (2nd) 12.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-5\"><em>Id., </em>169 Md. at 539, 182 A. 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The Court\u2019s language in <em>Prostic, </em>albeit dictum, indicates that a defendant who commits an act that is \u201cpunishable because it is wrong in itself,\u201d that is, <em>malum in se, </em>will be criminally liable for the injury caused by his act. The language employed by the Court does not indicate a requirement that the <em>malum in se </em>act be one that is dangerous to life to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>render the actor criminally liable. We note that the Court did state that \u201cwhen the person acting has no intention to injure anybody, but death is a result of unlawful action <em>endangering life, </em>there is manslaughter, at least.\u201d 169 Md. at 539, 182 A. 421 (emphasis added). When viewed in the context of the facts of the case, however, this statement was simply addressing the fact that, by beating the insured \u201cmercilessly,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 536, 182 A. 421, the robbers had committed acts that endangered life.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">We interpret <em>Worthington </em>and <em>Prostic </em>as establishing that a homicide resulting from the perpetration of a <em>malum in se </em>unlawful act not amounting to a felony is manslaughter, regardless of whether the unlawful act was \u201cdangerous to life.\u201d Because appellant\u2019s battery against the victim was a <em>malum in se </em>criminal act, we hold that the State was not required to prove that appellant\u2019s acts were dangerous to life in order to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Appellant relies on <em>State v. Gibson, 4 </em>Md.App. 236, 243, 242 A.2d 575 (1968), <em>aff'd, </em>254 Md. 399, 254 A.2d 691 (1969), in support of his contention that, when a prosecution for involuntary manslaughter is based on the commission of an unlawful act causing death, the act must itself be dangerous to life, even if the act is <em>malum in se. </em>In <em>Gibson, </em>we held that the statutory crime of manslaughter by motor vehicle, Maryland Code (1957, 1967 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 388, preempted charging a defendant with \u201ccommon-law misdemeanor-manslaughter\u201d where the operation of a motor vehicle unintentionally resulted in the death of the victim. 4 Md.App. at 245, 242 A.2d 575. In reaching that holding, this Court recited the following principles governing the common law crime of involuntary manslaughter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">Involuntary manslaughter at common law has been generally defined as the killing of another unintentionally and without malice (1) in doing some unlawful act not amounting to a felony, or (2) in negligently doing some act lawful in itself, or (3) by the negligent omission to perform a legal duty. See 1 <em>Warren on Homicide </em>(Perm.Ed.1938), 420, 421; 26 Am.Jur. <em>Homicide, </em>Sec. 18, 44; 40 C.J.S. <em>Homicide, </em>Sec. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>55, and cases therein cited. To this basic definition other authorities add the qualification, as to the first class of involuntary manslaughter, that the unlawful act be <em>malum in se, </em>and not merely <em>malum prohibitum, </em>and as to the second and third classes of the offense, that the negligence be criminally culpable, <em>ie., </em>that it be gross. Clark and Marshall, <em>Crimes </em>(Sixth Ed.), Sections 10.04, 10.12-10.14; <em>Perkins on Criminal Law, </em>pp. 34, 57-61; Wharton\u2019s <em>Criminal Law and Procedure, </em>(Anderson Ed.), Vol. 1, Sections 289-292, 296, and cases therein cited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">It is likewise clear that the Maryland cases have generally recognized that a charge of involuntary manslaughter at common law could in some circumstances at least be based on the doing of an unlawful act. In <em>Neusbaum v. State, supra, </em>the court, in defining a felonious homicide, characterized the crime so as to include those cases where one takes the life of another unintentionally and without excuse \u201cwhile needlessly doing anything in its nature dangerous to life, or who causes death by neglecting a duty imposed either by law or by contract, or in the course of committing a crime or even a civil wrong.\u201d 156 Md. at page 155 [143 A. 872], To like effect, the court in Insurance <em>Company v. Prostic, </em>169 Md. 535 [182 A. 421], in discussing a felonious homicide, held at page 539 that \u201cwhen the person acting has no intention to injure anybody, but death is the result of unlawful action endangering life, there is manslaughter, at least.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">What appellant relies upon is the following language in <em>Gibson, </em>which he refers to as \u201ca rule\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\"><em>Neusbaum </em>and <em>Prostic </em>seemingly share a common legal thread\u2014that where a prosecution for involuntary manslaughter is based on the commission of an unlawful act causing death, the act must itself be dangerous to life. As the <em>Prostic </em>court observed, if the person causing the death of another \u201cintends to do an unlawful and wrongful act, which is punishable because it is wrong in itself, and in doing it he inflicts an unforeseen injury, he is criminally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>liable for that injury\u201d [since] \u201c[t]here are many acts so heedless and incautious as necessarily to be deemed unlawful and wanton, though there may not be any express intent to do mischief, and the party committing them causing death by such conduct will be guilty of manslaughter.\u201d 169 Md. at page 539 [182 A. 421].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">4 Md.App. at 242-43, 242 A.2d 575 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on that passage in <em>Gibson </em>is misplaced. As stated <em>supra, </em>in <em>Gibson </em>we were concerned with whether the statutory crime of vehicular manslaughter preempted the common law in cases where the operation of a motor vehicle results in an unintentional homicide. We did not address what types of acts are encompassed within the phrase \u201cunlawful act\u201d as that term is used in the definition of involuntary manslaughter. Consequently, the \u201crule\u201d upon which appellant relies is dictum at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Furthermore, we disagree with appellant\u2019s interpretation of that dictum in <em>Gibson. </em>In effect, appellant contends that our statement that the unlawful act \u201cmust itself be dangerous to life,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 243, 242 A.2d 575, refers to all unlawful acts, those unlawful acts that are <em>malum in se </em>as well as those unlawful acts that are <em>malum prohibitum. </em>To give the Court\u2019s language the broad meaning advocated by appellant, however, would conflict with the earlier, more specific, definition of unlawful act involuntary manslaughter enunciated in the case. Specifically, we defined involuntary manslaughter as being \u201cthe killing of another unintentionally and without malice (1) in doing some unlawful act not amounting to a felony,____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242, 242 A.2d 575. We then added the following: \u201cTo this basic definition other authorities add the qualification, as to the first class of involuntary manslaughter, that the unlawful act be <em>malum in se, </em>and not merely <em>malum prohibitum. </em>...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242, 242 A.2d 575 (citations omitted). Viewing the term \u201cunlawful act\u201d in the context of the entire opinion, we interpret it to be referring exclusively to unlawful acts that are merely <em>malum prohibitum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>The dictum in <em>Gibson, </em>upon which appellant relies has been referred to in subsequent cases by both of this State\u2019s appellate courts. <em>See State v.

Like the decision in <em>Gibson, </em>however, these cases never actually addressed what unlawful acts would suffice to sustain a conviction under the category of unlawful act involuntary manslaughter. Thus, the courts rendering these decisions were never required to analyze or apply the language in <em>Gibson </em>that appellant refers to as a \u201crule,\u201d and their citations to <em>Gibson </em>add no support to appellant\u2019s position in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\"><em>Rolfes v. State, </em>10 Md.App. 204, 268 A.2d 795 (1970), is the lone decision in Maryland that involved involuntary manslaughter that was based on a <em>malum in se </em>unlawful act and that cited <em>Gibson </em>for the proposition that an unlawful act must be dangerous to life to support an involuntary manslaughter conviction. In that case, we concluded that Rolfes\u2019s \u201cassault upon her husband with the .knife was an unlawful act dangerous to life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 208, 268 A.2d 795. Because appellant\u2019s unlawful act was one dangerous to life, it fit neatly into the <em>Gibson </em>\u201crule,\u201d whether it was <em>malum prohibitum </em>or <em>malum in se; </em>it was not necessary for us to scrutinize the \u201crule\u201d or distinguish between conduct that is merely unlawful and conduct that is punishable because it is wrong in itself in order to affirm the conviction. Because it quoted and relied on the dictum in <em>Gibson, Rolfes, </em>like <em>Gibson, </em>does not support appellant\u2019s position in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>B. <em>Legal Causation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Having determined that appellant\u2019s unlawful acts did not need to be life threatening in order to form the basis for an involuntary manslaughter conviction under the misdemean- or-manslaughter rule, we shall now address appellant\u2019s contention that the State failed to present sufficient evidence establishing that his actions were the legal cause of the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Based on the results of an autopsy, the State\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Golle, testified that the victim suffered from severe coronary artery disease that rendered him predisposed to a heart attack. That conclusion was supported by the testimony of appellant\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Adams, who testified that the victim \u201chad eighty to ninety percent localized blockage in the two main arteries.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prior to trial, Dr. Golle learned from witness statements contained in the police reports that the victim was involved in an altercation in which appellant and others had poked the victim with sticks, urinated on him, poured paint on him, rolled him into a ditch, threw stones at him, and kicked dirt and trash on him. The fact that the altercation did occur was confirmed by the testimony of witnesses presented at trial. Based on this knowledge, Dr. Golle then established the requisite causal relation between appellant\u2019s acts and the victim\u2019s death by concluding, \u201cwith reasonable medical certainty,\u201d that the victim suffered a fatal heart attack that was caused by the stress brought on by the victim\u2019s altercation with appellant and his friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Although appellant presented expert testimony indicating that there were several possible causes of death other than the theory proffered by the State, that testimony only affected the weight to be given to Dr. Golle\u2019s testimony; it did not detract from the sufficiency of the State\u2019s evidence. The court, sitting as the trier of fact, was free to choose which expert opinion to believe. <em>See Breeden v. State, </em>95 Md.App. 481, 510, 622 A.2d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>160, <em>aff'd, remanded, </em>333 Md. 212, 634 A.2d 464 (1993). Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, we hold that the court rationally could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant\u2019s acts were the legal cause of the victim\u2019s death. <em>See Wiggins, </em>324 Md. at 567, 597 A.2d 1359.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Appellant next contends that the circuit court erred in admitting Dr. Golle\u2019s expert testimony regarding the manner and cause- of Baldwin\u2019s death. Essentially, appellant asserts that Dr. Golle\u2019s opinion lacked an adequate foundation because his conclusion that the victim died of a heart attack during the altercation with appellant was based on information that he gathered from inadmissible police reports instead of being based on facts presented in the form of a hypothetical question or facts adduced through testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">An expert\u2019s conclusions must be based upon a legally sufficient factual foundation. <em>Simmons v. State, </em>313 Md. 33, 41-42, 542 A.2d 1258 (1988) (citing <em>State Health Dep\u2019t v. Walker, </em>238 Md. 512, 520, 209 A.2d 555 (1965)). \u201cAn expert witness, however, need not testify from personal knowledge so long as the opinion is predicated upon facts established in the record.\u201d <em>Shives v. Furst, </em>70 Md.App. 328, 341, 521 A.2d 332, <em>cert. denied, 309 </em>Md. 521, 525 A.2d 636 (1987) (citations omitted); <em>see also Consolidated Mechanical Contractors, Inc. v. Ball, </em>263 Md. 328, 336-37, 283 A.2d 154 (1971). Moreover, \u201ca trial judge is given broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony. Seldom will the decision in this regard constitute grounds for reversal.\u201d <em>Simmons v. State, </em>313 Md. 33, 43, 542 A.2d 1258 (1988) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Dr. Golle testified that, in his opinion, Baldwin was the victim of a homicide. Specifically, Dr. Golle stated that the stress experienced by the victim as a result of the altercation with appellant caused him to suffer a myocardial ischemia, which Dr. Golle said was similar to having a heart attack. Dr. Golle testified that he formulated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>his opinion as to the cause of the victim\u2019s death based on his review of the autopsy and information in the police reports.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When asked on direct examination which portions of the police reports he used to formulate his opinion regarding the cause of the victim\u2019s death, he stated that he relied on the police reports to establish that the victim was alive when he was involved in a stressful altercation with appellant and others and that he was found dead the following day. When the court later asked him the same question, Dr. Golle acknowledged that he was relying on the witness statements in the police reports that the victim was alive at the time of the \u201caltercation.\u201d The court then asked Dr. Golle what he meant by the term \u201caltercation\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">COURT: No, I mean, what was it that you were relying on as being the altercation here and it may be that the word altercation was in the' report.

GOLLE: I think the verbal\u2014verbal abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-11\">THE COURT: In terms of hitting, ... is there something more specific about the hitting that you\u2019re relying upon in ... forming your opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>DR.

GOLLE: That\u2019s correct, Your Honor. As I said, there are injuries that there\u2019s no way to tell if it occurred while he was alive or after he died, because of decomposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">THE COURT: Okay.... [I]s the same thing true about the throwing of rocks, do you know anything more about the throwing of rocks, how many rocks, size of rocks or any of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">DR. GOLLE: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">THE COURT: Okay. Same with pushing? Don\u2019t know the\u2014the frequency of pushing, the manner of pushing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-10\">DR. GOLLE: That\u2019s correct, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-11\">THE COURT: And is it fair to assume the same with regard to the verbal abuse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-12\">DR. GOLLE: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-13\">Appellant has not stated, nor have we found, any evidence demonstrating that Dr. Golle\u2019s opinion as to the cause of the victim\u2019s death was based on facts that were not adduced at trial. Dr. Golle\u2019s responses indicate that he did not rely on the specific version of the events set forth in the police reports in concluding that Baldwin was the victim of a homicide. In other words, he did not conclude that the victim died as a result of injuries that he may have sustained after allegedly being hit with stones, trash, paint, and urine, or as a result of any other of the specific acts mentioned in the police reports. In contrast, Dr. Golle based his conclusion on the simple fact that the victim was involved in a stressful \u201caltercation\u201d with appellant and others; whether the victim suffered any specific injuries as a result of the altercation was immaterial to Dr. Golle. That the victim was involved in such an altercation with appellant the day before he was found dead was estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>lished by evidence at trial, prior to Dr. Golle\u2019s testimony, through witnesses who described the events surrounding the victim\u2019s death. Under these circumstances, we conclude that Dr. Golle\u2019s testimony was supported by a sufficient factual basis and that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Appellant\u2019s third contention is that the circuit court erred in admitting the testimony of Dr. John Smialek, Chief Medical Examiner for the State of Maryland, in rebuttal to the testimony of the defense\u2019s expert witness, Dr. John Adams, a forensic pathologist. Appellant maintains that Dr. Smialek\u2019s testimony concerning the cause of the victim\u2019s death was not proper rebuttal because the evidence proffered by Dr. Adams disputing the State\u2019s theory of the cause of death did not constitute \u201cnew matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">To constitute proper rebuttal evidence, the testimony of Dr. Smialek \u201cmust have \u2018explain[ed], or [been] a direct reply to, or a contradiction of, any new matter that [was] brought into the case by the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kulbicki v. State, </em>102 Md.App. 376, 383, 649 A.2d 1173 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>337 Md. 706 (1995) (quoting <em>State v. Booze, </em>334 Md. 64, 70, 637 A.2d 1214 (1994)). If his testimony did not constitute rebuttal evidence, it was error for the trial court to admit it as such. <em>Id., </em>102 Md.App. at 383-84, 649 A.2d 1173 (citing <em>State v. Hepple, </em>279 Md. 265, 274, 368 A.2d 445 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">During the defense\u2019s case, Dr. Adams testified that, by calculating the rate at which the victim\u2019s body metabolized alcohol, he determined that the victim did not die until at least ten hours after the altercation with appellant. He further stated that he could conclude that the victim did not die as a result of his altercation with appellant, because any stress resulting from the altercation would have caused the fatal heart attack within one hour. Over appellant\u2019s objection, the State was permitted to present, as rebuttal evidence, Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Smialek\u2019s testimony, which refuted Dr. Adams\u2019s method of calculating the time of the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The State had not presented evidence as to the time of the victim\u2019s death during its case-in-chief. Moreover, Dr. Adams\u2019s opinion regarding the time of the victim\u2019s death was based solely on a novel method of calculating the amount of alcohol that was metabolized by the body prior to death.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Dr. Adams\u2019s method required him to make several assumptions that he admitted were not supported by medical literature or studies. Under these circumstances, Dr. Adams\u2019s theory regarding the time of the victim\u2019s death was \u201cnew matter\u201d that the State properly was given an opportunity to rebut.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Our review of the record in this case also reveals that Dr. Smialek was permitted, over appellant\u2019s objections, to testify that he disagreed with Dr. Adams\u2019s conclusions that there were other possible causes of the victim\u2019s death. First, Dr. Smialek testified, over objection, that he found no evidence that esophageal varices was a factor in the victim\u2019s death. Second, he testified over objection that pneumonia was not a possible cause of the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">In the State\u2019s case-in-chief, Dr. Golle had testified that the victim, in effect, died from a heart attack that was caused by the stress that he suffered as a result of being involved in an altercation with appellant. In the defense\u2019s case, Dr. Adams opined that the cause of the victim\u2019s death was \u201cunknown\u201d and the manner of his death was \u201cundetermined.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to Dr. Adams, it was impossible to pinpoint exactly the cause and manner of the victim\u2019s death because the victim was suffering from so many serious maladies at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Dr. Smialek\u2019s testimony refuting Dr. Adam\u2019s conclusions as to the cause of the victim\u2019s death was proper rebuttal evidence. Dr. Adams\u2019s testimony injected into the case a new theory about the cause and manner of the victim\u2019s death, which constituted \u201cnew matter.\u201d Dr. Smialek\u2019s testimony to the effect that esophageal varices and pneumonia were not possible causes of the victim\u2019s death directly replied to and contradicted the new matter presented by Dr. Adams\u2019s testimony. <em>See Willey v. Glass, </em>242 Md. 156, 164, 218 A.2d 212 (1966); <em>Hughes v. United States, </em>633 A.2d 851, 852 (D.C.1993) (holding that court did not abuse its discretion when it allowed police officer to be re-called to testify in rebuttal that a person suggested by defense as being the real guilty party did not sell the drugs and to reiterate that defendant did).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Finally, we note that Dr. Smialek testified on rebuttal, over appellant\u2019s objection that was overruled \u201csubject to a motion to strike,\u201d that he disagreed with Dr. Adams\u2019s testimony that the victim\u2019s coronary artery disease was \u201cmoderately severe,\u201d and that he believed the victim\u2019s coronary artery disease was severe. At the conclusion of Dr. Smialek\u2019s explanation, appellant did not move to have the testimony stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The court was not able to determine whether Dr. Smialek\u2019s testimony, in whole or in part, constituted rebuttal evidence without hearing the testimony. Because the court was sitting as the trier of fact, it was appropriate to admit the testimony, subject to a motion to strike, in order to be able to make the evidentiary determination. We believe, therefore, that appellant was required to move to strike the testimony if he concluded that it was not proper rebuttal evidence. Because appellant failed to move that the testimony be stricken, the issue was not preserved for appellate review. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4-323(a); <em>Davis v. State, </em>189 Md. 269, 274, 55 A.2d 702 (1947) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is that his placement in the house arrest program under the supervision of the Anne <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Arundel County Detention Center constitutes an illegal condition of probation. Appellant argues that being under house arrest as a condition of probation is sufficiently equivalent to being imprisoned and thus is illegal under this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Stone v. State, </em>43 Md.App. 329, 405 A.2d 345 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">In <em>Stone, </em>the trial court imposed the following condition of probation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">18 months to be served at the Anne Arundel County Detention Center on a live-in, work-out basis, concurrent with any other sentence now serving.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 330, 405 A.2d 345. On appeal, we questioned whether the court could impose a sentence of incarceration, suspend execution of all of it, and place the defendant on probation with a condition that he serve eighteen months in jail. Noting that a court\u2019s \u201cbroad grant of discretionary authority to place defendants on probation\u201d under the conditions it deems proper pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 641A is not unlimited, we concluded that, \u201cin the absence of express statutory authority, confinement in a jail-type institution, such as the Anne Arundel County Detention Center, is not an authorized condition of probation.\u201d <em>Stone, </em>43 Md.App. at 335, 405 A.2d 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">We do not dispute the well settled rule in Maryland that, absent statutory authority,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201ca court cannot impose imprisonment as a condition of probation.\u201d <em>Maus v. State, </em>311 Md. 85, 104, 532 A.2d 1066 (1987) (citing <em>Stone, </em>43 Md.App. at 336, 405 A.2d 345). Unlike the appellant in <em>Stone, </em>however, appellant in the case <em>sub judice </em>is not subject to \u201cconfinement in a jail-type institution.\u201d <em>Stone, </em>43 Md.App. at 335, 405 A.2d 345. Instead, he is confined to his own residence whenever he is not working or attending school. Thus, in order to resolve this issue, we must determine whether appellant\u2019s house arrest under the supervision of the Anne Arundel County Deten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>tion Center is equivalent to the imprisonment contemplated in <em>Stone. </em>Under the facts of the present case, we hold that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Although not directly on point, we find this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Balderston v. State, </em>93 Md.App. 364, 612 A.2d 335 (1992), to be instructive. Balderston was convicted of driving while under the influence of alcohol and sentenced to the Montgomery County Detention Center for a period of sixty days, with forty-five of those days suspended in favor of a two year term of probation. As a special condition of his probation, the circuit'court, pursuant to Balderston\u2019s request, ordered him to spend forty-five days in a home confinement program.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After Balderston had completed the forty-five day in home confinement, the court found that he had violated his probation. As a result, the court revoked his probation and reinstated his original sentence without crediting to his sentence the forty-five days spent in home confinement. On appeal, Balderston argued that \u201chome confinement is tantamount to imprisonment, or at least custodial confinement, and that he is entitled to credit against the remainder of his sentence, pursuant to Md.Ann.Code Art. 27, \u00a7 638C,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for the 45 days he spent in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>home confinement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367, 612 A.2d 335 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">This Court rejected Balderston\u2019s assertion and held that his home confinement, as a condition of probation, \u201ccannot be considered \u2018custodial,\u2019 or the equivalent of custody,\u201d because he had freedom of movement and association within his home and could leave his home to attend work and alcoholism treatment meetings. <em>Id. </em>at 370, 612 A.2d 335. We further stated that, contrary to Balderston\u2019s contention, the reason he asked to participate in the home confinement program was because \u201cit is <em>not </em>the equivalent of custody, <em>i.e., </em>he could tend to his responsibilities and maintain his job.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held, therefore, in accordance with cases from several other jurisdictions, that he was not entitled to sentencing credit under Art. 27, \u00a7 638C for the forty-five days that he spent in home confinement. <em>Id.; see also Maus v. State, </em>311 Md. 85, 104, 532 A.2d 1066 (1987) (holding that stay in tightly controlled and supervised drug rehabilitation facility as a condition of probation did not constitute \u201ccustody\u201d within the meaning of Art. 27, \u00a7 638C(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\"><em>Balderston </em>addressed the meaning of the term \u201ccustody\u201d as it is used in Art. 27, \u00a7 6380(a). The legislative policy underlying Art. 27, \u00a7 6380(a) is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">Section 6380(a) demonstrates a legislative policy of fair<em>ness\u2014a desire to give a person the benefit of prison time, or similar incarceration, actually served as a result of conduct for which a, sentence of incarceration is eventually imposed. </em>That policy is commendable in its effort to avoid inequitable stacking of punishment that could result in actual service of a period of <em>imprisonment </em>longer than the sentence imposed by the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-7\"><em>Maus, </em>311 Md. at 107, 532 A.2d 1066 (emphasis added). We believe that the term \u201ccustody\u201d suggests a level of confinement that is analogous to the level of confinement prohibited in <em>Stone v. State, supra. </em>In other words, an offender\u2019s sentence may only be reduced by the amount of time that he has spent in \u201ccustody\u201d in an environment with a level of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>confinement that is commensurate with \u201cprison time or similar incarceration.\u201d We therefore conclude that, if an offender would not receive credit toward his sentence under \u00a7 6380(a) for the time spent under certain restrictive conditions of probation, then those conditions do not amount to incarceration in the \u201cjail-type institution\u201d referred to in <em>Stone.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">In the present case, the circuit court imposed upon appellant thirty months of \u201chouse arrest\u201d in his own residence as a condition of probation. The terms of the probation require appellant to abide by \u201call of the Rules and Regulations of the House Arrest Alternate Sentencing Program\u201d of the Anne Arundel County Detention Center and state that he is to be supervised by the Center, even though he was not actually enrolled in the program.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under the program\u2019s regulations, appellant is required to remain in his residence whenever he is not working or attending school. Appellant will be monitored by \u201ca portable visual telephone which allows program staff to enforce conditions of [his] house arrest sentence by oral and visual contact\u201d and by periodic visits to his residence and place of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Although restrictive, appellant\u2019s confinement to the comfort of his own home significantly differs from confinement in a \u201cjail-type institution,\u201d such as a prison, jail, or county detention center, in several material respects. An offender who is detained at home is not subject to the conditions or regimentation of a penal institution. While at home, an offender enjoys unrestricted freedom of activity, movement, and association. He can eat, sleep, make phone calls, watch television, and entertain guests at his leisure. Furthermore, an offender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>confined to his home does not suffer the same surveillance and lack of privacy that he would if he were actually incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">We conclude that the restrictions placed on appellant\u2019s freedom pursuant to the house arrest program are comparable to, and no more onerous than, the restrictions imposed on the appellant in <em>Balderston. </em>Because we determined in <em>Balderston </em>that such restrictions did not amount to \u201ccustody\u201d for the purpose of granting custody credit under Art. 27, \u00a7 638C(a), we conclude that the restrictions placed on appellant in the present case do not amount to \u201cincarceration\u201d or \u201cconfinement in a jail-type institution\u201d as contemplated in <em>Stone v. State. </em>Accordingly, we hold that appellant\u2019s placement under \u201chouse arrest\u201d is a lawful condition of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-8\">.

Although Dr. Golle acknowledged that he also examined some of the victim's medical records from the Perry Point Medical Center, he stated that they did not affect his opinion as to the manner and cause of the victim's death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b319-8\">. Dr. Adams stated on re-direct that, without using his method of analysis, there would be no way to determine the time of the victim's death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b319-9\">. Dr. Adams testified that the phrase \u2018\u2018[clause of death means the actual process, the disease process, which produced the death.\u201d The manner of death \u201cmeans how did the death occur ... was it a natural phenomenon or was it caused by something unnatural such as suicide, homicide or an accident.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b321-10\">. Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 641(a)(l)(i)2 permits the court to impose a sentence of confinement as a condition of probation in Charles, St. Mary\u2019s, and Calvert counties under certain circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b322-6\">. Pursuant to the home confinement program, Balderston was permitted to go to work and to attend an alcoholism treatment program, but was required to remain in his residence at all other times.

Judge Heller\u2019s written Order granting appellant house arrest as a condition of his probation was adapted from the form used by the Anne Arundel County Detention Center to enter convicts into its House Arrest Alternative Sentencing Program. Normally, the form is used to order offenders into the program as a <em>sentencing </em>measure. Judge Heller, however, crossed out certain provisions on the form and clearly indicated that appellant was being granted house arrest as a condition of his probation, and that any violation of the regulations would constitute a violation of probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
