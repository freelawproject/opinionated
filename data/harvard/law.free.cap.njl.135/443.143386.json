Admittedly there had been a pre-existing hernia which had been operated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>some time before <em>the </em>alleged accident. There was a question of fact as to whether or not application of force directly to the abdominal wall produced the condition for which compensation was sought, and a question of law is presented as to the compensability of an aggravation of a pre-existing condition of this sort. In view of the holdings of our courts on like and similar questions, <em>Furferi </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Railroad Co., </em>117 <em>N. J. L. </em>508; <em>Mandel </em>v. <em>Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., </em>132 <em>Id. </em>513; reversed, 133 <em>Id. </em>311; <em>Fusco </em>v. <em>Cambridge Piece Dyeing Corp., </em>135 <em>Id. </em>160; 50 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>870, we are\"of the opinion that a debatable question is presented and that a writ of <em>certiorari </em>should be allowed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
