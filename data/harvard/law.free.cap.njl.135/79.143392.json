Specifically, the present application is for leave to file such certificate <em>\"nunc pro tunc.\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">We are now asked to disregard the emphatic language of rule 5-e, adopted in its present form after full discussion and careful consideration, which reads as follows: \u201cNo office clerkship shall be deemed to have commenced until such certificate shall have been filed as aforesaid; and the period of office clerkship shall be computed from the <em>actual -1filing </em>of such certificate and not otherwise.\u201d (Italics ours.) This rule is based on important considerations of public policy: in particular, to apprise the public at the outset, of the fact of candidacy and thereby to afford opportunity of making timely objection to that candidacy on proper grounds, before completion of the three years\u2019 clerkship.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The applicant is entitled to credit for office clerkship only \u201cfrom the actual filing of such certificate and not otherwise.\u201d The present application is therefore denied. As to the suggestion that applicant was not acquainted with the rule, the simple answer is that it is in plain type and that \u201che may run that readeth it.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
