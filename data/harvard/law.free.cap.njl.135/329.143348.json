It is also argued that even if the jurisdiction existed, the discretion was improperly exercised: but assuming for present purposes without deciding, that-this court has jurisdiction to- review the administrative acts of the statutory school authorities, we perceive no' illegality calling for judicial interposition, and 'indeed no illegality at all. The jurisdiction of the statutory authorities seems clear, and the closing of an existing school is nothing new. <em>Downs </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>12 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>345, 347; affirmed <em>sub. tit., Flechtner </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>113 <em>N. J. L. </em>401. All that we are asked to review is an exercise of judgment by an administrative body within its jurisdiction, which is not a court function. There is no suggestion of bad faith or dishonesty on the part of the defendants or any of them, and we see no indication of either.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">On the merits the writs will be dismissed, with costs. This result makes it unnecessary to deal with the motion to dismiss them on procedural grounds.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
