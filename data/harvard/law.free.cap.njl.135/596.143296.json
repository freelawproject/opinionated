The point is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">There was evidence tending to show delivery of the automobile on the day of its purchase seemingly in operating condition. But on the following day the motor \u201cwouldn\u2019t start;\u201d and there was a recurrence of this on four or five occasions during the first two and a half weeks of plaintiff\u2019s possession, notwithstanding defendants\u2019 efforts to place the vehicle in running condition. Finally, on the ensuing December 19th, when the motor again failed, defendants undertook to make repairs and they had possession of the vehicle for that purpose until the following May, when they notified plaintiff that the work, had been completed and he would be-charged with. 50% of the cost, or $120. This, plaintiff refused to pay. It is conceded that the car\u2019s mileage while in plaintiff\u2019s possession was much less than 1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">It was plaintiff\u2019s right in these circumstances to rescind the sale, return the automobile to the sellers,'and recover the purchase price. <em>B. S. </em>46:30-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Plaintiff testified on cross-examination that the car motor \u201cwas running perfect\u201d immediately prior to the purchase; and the essence of defendants\u2019 argument is that the vehicle \u201cwas in good operating condition when sold,\u201d and there is no proof that the subsequently appearing \u201cmechanical defects in fact existed at the time of the sale.\u201d \u2022 But it was plainly inferable from the proofs that these mechanical deficiencies pre-existed the sale, and therefore the car was not \u201cin good operating condition\u201d at the time of the sale within the intendment of the warranty. And it was for the jury to determine whether that was the preponderant inference. The warranty plainly contemplated mechanical sufficiency for continuous operation, or substantially that, at least for 1,000 miles. That is obviously the sense of the term \u201cgood operating condition.\u201d The sellers warranted that the car would \u201cremain\u201d in that condition, \u201cunder normal use aird service,\u201d for a period of 30 clays, or 1,000 miles. There being evidence to indicate a breach of the warranty, the motions to take the case from the jury were properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
