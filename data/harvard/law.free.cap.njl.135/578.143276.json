J. L. </em>575.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">On January 1st, 1942, the Board of Chosen Freeholders of the County of Camden appointed Yincent L. Gallaher to .the office of county counsel for the term of three years, commencing on that date. This was a valid exercise of the statutory power. <em>Gallaher </em>v. <em>County of Camden, </em>129. <em>N. J. L. </em>290. Upon the expiration of that term, on January 1st, 1945, Attilio C. Marino was designated by the Board of Freeholders as \u201cActing County Counsel,\u201d without specification of term. On August 19th, 1946, Marino resigned as \u201cActing County Counsel;\u201d and on the ensuing August 27th, the Board of Freeholders appointed John L. Morrissey as county counsel for the term of three years from that date. On December 30th, 1946, Senator Morrissey resigned the office; and thereupon the Board of Freeholders appointed the prosecutor, Cow-gill, as county counsel for the term of three years, commencing on December 31st, 1946. Proceeding upon the hypothesis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>that prosecutor\u2019s appointment did not represent a lawful exercise of the granted power, the Board of Freeholders, on January 1st, 1947, appointed George G. Tartar as county counsel for \u201cthe unexpired term,\u201d commencing on that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">We have no occasion to consider the validity <em>vel non </em>of Senator Morrissey\u2019s appointment, for in either case prosecutor\u2019s designation for the full statutory term was ineffectual; the appointment could have been made for the unexpired term only, whatever that may have been. It is clear the current term had not then expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The writ is accordingly dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
