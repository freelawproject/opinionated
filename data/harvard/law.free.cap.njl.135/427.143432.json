At the hearing no proofs were offered by prosecutor to support the application, despite the fact, as appears from the record, that a prior application for variance was denied by the Board of Adjustment. No witnesses were sworn and only a brief and informal discussion by counsel for prosecutor and statements of some of the adjacent property owners as to reasons for their objection appear in the record of proceedings before the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">This case is on all fours with <em>Montgomery Engineering Co. et al. </em>v. <em>Jersey City et al., </em>134 <em>N. J. L. </em>414; 48 <em>Atl. Rep. (2d) </em>643, in which it was held that nothing being submitted as evidence and nothing appearing in the record of the hearing except an informal discussion, this court will not disturb the decision of the Board. <em>Shaiman </em>v. <em>Mayor, &amp;c., of Newark, </em>15 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>437; 191 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>735; <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Board of Adjustment of Trenton, </em>118 <em>N. J. L. </em>372; 193 <em>Atl.

(2d) </em>779, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Depositions taken on the writ of <em>certiorari </em>do not serve to overcome the failure to present proofs to the Board. <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Mayor, &amp;c., of Palisades Park, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">The writ is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
