Brogan).</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b301-9\">For the defendant, <em>Walter D. Van Riper </em>and <em>Joseph A.

In the interest of the public, the practice of dentistry may be regulated. The public has no interest in the financial arrangements a dentist may make as to his office and equipment. It is requisite that those practicing a profession have skill. A leased chair and drill are as useful in the hands of a skilled dentist as the same articles covered by a chattel mortgage which the act permits. Many a pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>\u00edessional man has his start in the use of another\u2019s office and equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">The legislation in question is an encroachment upon the liberty of the individual which cannot be upheld on the ground of a valid exercise of the police power.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The conviction might be set- aside on other grounds argued, but we have chosen to rest our decision on the single ground that the provision of the statute under which the suspension was had is a violation of the constitutional right to be free of arbitrary interference with a lawful calling. <em>Levin </em>v. <em>State </em>Board, 121 <em>N. J. L. </em>193; <em>Liggett Co. </em>v. Baldridge, 278 <em>U. S. </em>105, 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The suspension is set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
