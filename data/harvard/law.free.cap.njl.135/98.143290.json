J. L. </em>13; <em>Birchwood, Inc., </em>v. <em>Kulik </em>(No. 258 May term, 1940, not reported).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">So far as we can discern, the present factual situation, except .as to ownership, differs in no material respect from that of the previous cases. Indeed, over one-half of the 100 page state of the ease consists of the opinion of this court and the briefs of counsel in the Birchwood case, and a copy of the lease to the present prosecutor. The ownership of the fee seems unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-14\">We find nothing in the present ease to require a recall or modification of our previous decisions. The writ of <em>certiorari </em>will be dismissed; and the rule to show cause in <em>mandamus </em>will be discharged; with costs in both eases.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
