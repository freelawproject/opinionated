ROBERT ORWIN AND SAMUEL ALBAUM, T/A THE WOODEN BOX REPAIR CO., PROSECUTORS, v. WYLIE E. CLARK AND THE DISTRICT COURT OF THE SECOND JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF THE COUNTY OF HUDSON, RESPONDENTS.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b588-5\">Argued May 6, 1947</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AAg0\">Decided June 10, 1947.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b588-8\">Before Justices Bodine, Heher and Wachenfeld.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b588-9\">For the prosecutors, <em>Abraham Alboum.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b588-10\">For Wylie E. Clark, <em>Joseph B. Gallagher.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b588-11\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b588-12\">Bodine, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGG\">The writ of <em>certioram </em>in this case brings up for review a judgment for possession entered in the District Court in an action between landlord and tenant. The defense was that there was an oral lease for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-13\">The case was tried before the court and a jury. So far as pertinent, the court charged the jury as follows: \u201cIf you find that there was an oral lease for a period of two years, then you will bring in a judgment for the defendants. If you find that there was no oral lease, after the old lease expired, then you will bring in a judgment for the plaintiff, or possession for the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-14\">The argument on this appeal is that the verdict as entered was not the verdict of the jury. We think the jury was confused and we cannot tell what their verdict really was. They should have been recharged and sent back to find a verdict according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-15\">After the jury returned from their deliberation and when asked by the clerk if they had agreed upon a verdict, the fore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>man said, \u201cI am so nervous. We have decided that Mr. Wylie Clark should get his property back and the people that is working in his factory that they should get at least six months or a year to get out.\u201d This, of course, was not a verdict in accordance with the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">The court then said, \u201cWe can\u2019t enter a verdict that way. Foreman of the jury: That is how we decided. The court: Well, your verdict entitles him to his property? Foreman of the jury: Yes. He should get it back. There was no written lease.\u201d He did not say there was no oral lease as claimed. \u201cThe court: All right.\u201d Thereupon a judgment for possession was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The jury was then polled. The foreman answered, \u201cI find that Mr. Clark should have his property back because he owns it and maybe he wants it for his own use. I don\u2019t see why he can\u2019t have it.\u201d Humber 2 juror spoke as follows, \u201cI find, too, that they should have had a written contract. I feel that there should have been a written contract. I believe the old gentleman there.\u201d The third and fourth jurors felt the same way. The fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth felt that there should have been a witness to the lease if there really was one.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">It seems to us that the jurors were not in accord as to the fact of there being no two year lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">The only issue in the ease was whether there was a two year lease. Some thought there was not or that it should have been proved differently which was not the finding of a fact question but a determination of law which was a question for the court and not for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">The only object of a poll is to ascertain for a certainty that the jurors approve the verdict as returned and stated by the foreman and that they have not been coerced. <em>Silak </em>v. <em>Hudson and Manhattan Railroad </em>Co., 114 <em>N. J. L. </em>528; <em>affirmed, </em>115 <em>Id. </em>504.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">We think the trial judge instead of sending the jury back for further deliberations found a verdict for them, which is contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">The judgment entered will be set aside to the end that there may be a <em>venire de novo.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
