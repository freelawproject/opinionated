(OWS), owns and operates a regional solid waste disposal facility known as the Columbia Ridge Recycling Center and Landfill. It is located southwest of Arlington in Gilliam County. OWS disposes of waste generated in Oregon and also waste generated outside of Oregon. The operation provides direct and indirect benefits to petitioner Gilliam County as a result of employment in the county and the payment of local fees and taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Petitioner Columbia Resource Company, L.P. (CRC), has a 20-year contract with Clark County, Washington, under which it disposes of solid waste originating there. CRC uses the Finley Buttes Landfill in Morrow County as its disposal site. The operator of the Finley Buttes Landfill passes through to CRC the costs incurred for disposal, including charges made by respondent Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Petitioners challenge the constitutionality of two DEQ rules that the Environmental Quality Commission (EQC) adopted in December, 1990, OAR 340-61-115(1); OAR 340-61-120(6), and the enabling statutes that established the legal standards and procedures for adoption of those rules. ORS 459.297; ORS 459.298. The portions of the rules that petitioners challenge impose a surcharge for in-state disposal of garbage generated out-of-state.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">In 1989, the legislature enacted Oregon Laws 1989, chapter 833, an amalgamation of several bills dealing with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>waste reduction. Section 155, codified as ORS 459.297, provides that every person who disposes of solid waste that was generated out-of-state must pay a surcharge to help meet the cost to the state of administering the solid waste program.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 156, codified as ORS 459.298, enables EQC to establish the amount of the surcharge.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The rules impose on the disposal site a surcharge of $2.25 per ton for out-of-state waste that the site receives. The surcharge imposed at the disposal site for waste generated within Oregon is capped at $.50 per ton. <em>Former </em>ORS 459.294(5).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">The Oregon Supreme Court has explained that, before we can reach constitutional issues under ORS 183.400,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we must first determine: (1) whether the agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>had the general authority to make that kind of rule; (2) whether the agency followed the procedures prescribed by statute or regulation; and (3) whether the substance of the rule departed from the legal standard expressed or implied in the enabling legislation or contravened some other applicable statute. <em>Planned Parenthood Assn. v. Dept. of Human Res., </em>297 Or 562, 565, 687 P2d 785 (1984).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-4\">\u201cThese steps are designed to assure that the challenged action, particularly an action challenged for arguably violating constitutional rights, in fact was authorized by the state\u2019s or local government\u2019s politically accountable policy makers. Only if the action was clearly so authorized is there any reason to decide whether the state or local government has adopted a policy that the constitution forbids.\u201d 297 Or at 565.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-5\"> Petitioners do not contend that the agency did not have the general authority to make rules imposing surcharges on solid waste. They also make no meritorious arguments that the substance of the rules deviated from the legal standard provided in the statute<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or that they contravened some other applicable statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Their procedural argument is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>that ORS 459.298 requires the agency to follow a process that violates the Oregon Constitution and that the statute in its entirety is therefore invalid, so no rules could be made under it. They argue in the alternative that, if the procedures are permissible, then the rules are invalid, because the agency did not follow those procedures. If the rules were made by a valid procedure, they argue, they are nonetheless invalid, because they impermissibly discriminate against interstate commerce in violation of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">We turn first to the state law issues. <em>Planned Parenthood Assn. v. Dept. of Human Res., supra. </em>Under ORS 459.298, the amount of the surcharge is subject to approval by the Joint Committee on Ways and Means (Committee) during legislative sessions or by the Emergency Board during the interim. OWS argues that the grant of authority to the Emergency Board violates the state constitution. CRC agrees and argues that subjecting the rules to approval by the Committee is also unconstitutional. Both petitioners assert that the unconstitutional provisions render the statute unconstitutional and, therefore, that the rules promulgated under it are invalid. If the approval requirements are valid, they argue, then the rules are invalid, because EQC did not seek to obtain final approval from either authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Respondents concede, and we agree, that ORS 459.298 is unconstitutional to the extent that it subjects the surcharge determination to Emergency Board approval, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>because the Board has only the powers granted to it in Article III, section 3, of the Oregon Constitution. Art IV, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 25. Those powers do not include the power to veto EQC\u2019s surcharge rule.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Respondents argue, however, that the language requiring Emergency Board approval is severable from ORS 459.298, that the statute is workable without that provision and that EQC followed the correct procedure by not obtaining final approval of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The starting point for deciding that issue is ORS 174.040, which states the legislative preference for severability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">\u201cIt shall be considered that it is the legislative intent, in the enactment of any statute, that if any part of the statute is held unconstitutional, the remaining parts shall remain in force unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">\u201c(1) The statute provides otherwise;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">\u201c(2) The remaining parts are so essentially and inseparably connected with and dependent upon the unconstitutional part that it is apparent that the remaining parts would not have been enacted without the unconstitutional part; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">\u201c(3) The remaining parts, standing alone, are incomplete and incapable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Petitioners contend that Emergency Board approval is essential to the remaining parts, because without it the statute cannot be executed in accordance with legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">The bills that comprised HB 3515, which became Oregon Laws 1989, chapter 833, had been referred first to subject matter committees to consider their substance and then to. the Joint Committee on Ways and Means to consider their fiscal impacts. The Joint Committee on Ways and Means, the first committee to consider HB 3515 as a whole, inserted the Emergency Board approval requirement without providing a detailed explanation for it. Petitioners rely on the history of other sections of the bill that also included Emergency Board oversight. On the basis of that history, they argue that \u201cthe overriding philosophy * * * was to maintain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>strict E-Board control over fees of various agencies\u201d and that the legislature would not have enacted the statute without that control.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">The history cited by petitioners shows that members of the Committee were informed that, legally, the Emergency Board could review and comment on the surcharges, but that it did not have approval authority. During consideration of the State Fire Marshall\u2019s authority to establish a fee schedule relating to hazardous wastes,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> a legislative committee staff member, Acuff, commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">\u201cMr. Chairman, I believe that legislative counsel will tell you that the Emergency Board does not have the approval authority * * * that it is a review and comment only.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The response of the chair, Representative Hanlon, was to instruct staff to include control \u201cto the extent authorized by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">The history also demonstrates that inclusion of Emergency Board review was intended to permit the exertion of political, even if not legal, pressure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\">\u201cAcuff: Well, I think you\u2019re accomplishing your objective * * *. I think you\u2019re accomplishing the objective that you want now in limiting the dollars that you have in your first four decisions. You\u2019re forcing the fee structure as it is and they will come back to you and prove that [to] you either to the E-Board or to the Assembly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">\u201cRep. Jones: Except that * * * if [the Fire Marshall does not prove the need to the Emergency Board to increase fees] they go ahead and do it anyway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-10\">\u201cAcuff: I doubt that the Fire Marshall would go ahead and do it anyway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>\u201cRep Hanlon: So do I. We will be breaking for a quick lunch at 12:30 * * * half an hour or so. Up to the lounge and get some cornflakes. I would like to see the amendment. I\u2019m not sure because I wasn\u2019t listening to the whole thing, but I think Representative Jones and I agree the amendment should be made to the fullest extent possible to control the imposition of those fees. And that means that the E-Board * * * whoever it is that\u2019s approving it in the legislature has the authority * * * that authority * * * whatever authority they have, they may, may exercise at that point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-4\">\u201cSen. Hill: Mr. Chairman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-7\">\u201cRep. Hanlon: Larry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-8\">\u201cSen. Hill: I\u2019d agree. I\u2019d ask that the committee request Sue to give us the toughest language we can have for E-Board control over the fee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">We infer from that discussion that the legislature wanted to exercise whatever authority it could over the imposition of fees hut that it understood that the Emergency Board might not have the power to overrule the agency. Nevertheless, it did not enact a nonseverability provision, as it presumably would have done had it intended to override the preference for severability contained in ORS 174.040.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">With the unconstitutional provision granting approval authority to the Emergency Board omitted, the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-12\">\u201cSubject to approval by the Joint Committee on Ways and Means during the legislative sessions, the Environmental Quality Commission shall establish by rule the amount of the surcharge to be collected under ORS 459.297.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">The statute, so read, is restrictive in that it limits the approval requirement to when the legislature is in session. That does not render the statute unworkable. We conclude that the unconstitutional provision relating to Emergency Board authority is severable.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Read that way, however, the statute still requires EQC to submit the surcharge rules to the Committee for approval. CRC argues that that provision also violates the Oregon Constitution. It urges us to adopt the reasoning of <em>INS v. Chadha, </em>462 US 919, 103 S Ct 2764, 77 L Ed 2d 317 (1983), which held unconstitutional a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 USC \u00a7\u00a7 1101 <em>et seq, </em>that purportedly authorized a one-house legislative veto of the Attorney General\u2019s determination that a particular deportable alien should not be deported. 8 USC \u00a7 1254(c)(2). Respondents do not directly respond to those arguments but, in the course of explaining that the Emergency Board provision is severable, they conclude that \u201cwithout the offending provision the statute simply provides that the agency shall set the rates.\u201d We assume, however, that respondents did not intend that to be an affirmative concession that the provision subjecting the rules to the approval of the Committee is also unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">CRC argues that, even if approval of the surcharge is a legislative act,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Committee cannot do it, because all bills must be approved by a majority of each house, Or Const, Art IV, \u00a7 25, and presented to the governor for signature. Or Const, Art V, \u00a7 15b.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The plain language of the statute provides that the rules are subject to approval of the <em>Committee-, </em>it does not provide that the rules are subject to approval of the Legislative Assembly. The legislature has required approval of the Emergency Board or the \u201cLegislative Assembly\u201d before agency action can take effect in other contexts, but it did not use such language here. <em>See, e.g., </em>ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>341.565(4); ORS 537.805(4)(a).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although the legislature has the undoubted authority to enact laws establishing charges, nowhere does the legislative history suggest that anyone thought that the provision required any action by the Legislative Assembly beyond review by the Committee. We therefore read the words \u201cJoint Committee on Ways and Means\u201d to signify that the legislature intended the approval process to be completed by the Committee without further legislative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">If the statute were given effect as written, it would constitute a command by the legislature ordering EQC to propose legislation to be enacted by the Committee. Respondents concede that the power to enact or repeal laws is vested solely in the Legislative Assembly and that that power cannot be delegated, even to a group of its own members. <em>See Marr v. Fisher et al, </em>182 Or 383, 388, 187 P2d 966 (1947); <em>Van Winkle v. Fred Meyer, Inc., </em>151 Or 455, 49 P2d 1140 (1935); <em>see also </em>31 Op Att\u2019y Gen 161 (Or 1962-64). The Committee is composed of only 16 legislators, 8 from each house, ORS 171.555, and therefore could not constitute \u201c[a] majority of all the members elected to each House.\u201d Or Const, Art IV, \u00a7 25. No laws can constitutionally be enacted by the process described in the statute.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">CRC argues that the approval provision is not sever-able from the statute for all the same reasons that Emergency Board approval is not severable. The starting point again is ORS 174.040. Because the legislature has expressed a strong general preference in favor of severability, we can find the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Committee approval requirement not severable only if (1) it is apparent that the legislature would not have enacted the statute without that provision or (2) the resulting parts of the statute would be incomplete and incapable of being executed in accordance with legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"> ORS chapter 459 contains over 40 pages devoted to the control of solid waste. The legislature found that \u201c[t]here is a shortage of appropriate sites for landfills in Oregon, \u2019 \u2019 ORS 459.015(l)(c), and:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">\u201cIt is in the best interests of the people of Oregon to extend the useful life of existing solid waste disposal sites by encouraging recycling and reuse of materials whenever recycling is economically feasible, and by requiring solid waste to undergo volume reduction through recycling and reuse measures <em>before disposal in landfills </em>to the maximum extent feasible. Implementation of recycling and reuse measures will not only increase the useful life of solid waste disposal sites, but also decrease the potential public health and safety impacts associated with landfill operation.\u201d ORS 459.015(l)(d) <em>(since amended by Or </em>Laws 1991, ch 385, \u00a7 7). (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The legislative scheme was intended to establish a comprehensive system of regulation that provides for broad participation and cooperation among local governments and state agencies, \u201creserving to the state those functions necessary to assure effective programs, cooperation among local government units and coordination of solid waste management programs throughout the state.\u201d ORS 459.015(2)(c) <em>(since amended by </em>Or Laws 1991, ch 385, \u00a7 7). It delegated to EQC and DEQ the authority to adopt and enforce rules in order to implement and assure the effectiveness of the extensive regulatory plan. <em>See </em>ORS 459.025; ORS 459.045; ORS 459.376; ORS 459.385.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Chapter 459 contains a plethora of sections authorizing EQC, DEQ and local governments to impose fees and charges to recover costs at each step in the solid waste control program.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As in the statutes at issue here, almost every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>delegation of authority to charge a fee is accompanied by an explanation of how the fee is to be calculated and how the funds collected are to be used. <em>See, e.g., former </em>ORS 459.170(2) (renumbered 459A.025(2) in 1991); <em>former </em>ORS 459.200(8) (renumbered 459A.085 in 1991); ORS 459.235(2); ORS 459.236(5); ORS 459.284; ORS 459.335. That careful structuring of fees demonstrates that the legislature wanted to ensure that the costs of each protective activity would be borne by those who had created the need for it. It clearly wished to avoid spreading among all Oregonians the costs of mitigating environmental risks that they did not create.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Although the Committee was reluctant to delegate final authority to EQC to establish the surcharge, that reluctance was insufficient to motivate it to include in the statute a non-severability clause. <em>See, e.g., INS v. Chadha, </em>supra, 462 US at 932. From that fact, the extensiveness of the regulatory scheme, the detail with which the authority was delegated and the nature of the overall fee structure that the chapter creates, we conclude that the legislature would have enacted ORS 459.297 and ORS 459.298 even if it had known that neither the Committee nor the Emergency Board could have the power to veto the resulting rules.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The language that remains after both approval provisions are deleted is still a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>workable statute that contains clear standards for EQC to follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">After EQC drafted the rule that established the fee, it submitted it to the Emergency Board. The Board instructed EQC that the fee had been set too high for reasons that we need not examine. EQC then redrafted the rule to require a slightly lower fee. It did not, however, submit the amended rule to the Emergency Board or to the Committee for final approval. Strictly speaking, EQC did not follow the procedure prescribed in the statute. The rule is not invalid on that ground, however, because the portion of the statutory procedure that the agency failed to follow is unconstitutional. It would be perverse, indeed, to hold a rule invalid on the ground that the agency did not follow a constitutionally impermissible procedure. No one has otherwise challenged the validity of the procedure that EQC actually employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Petitioners contend that OAR 340-61-115(1) and OAR 340-61-120(6) violate the Commerce Clause, Article I, section 8, clause 3, of the United States Constitution<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> by imposing a higher surcharge for garbage received from out-of-state haulers than that received from in-state haulers.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The Commerce Clause grants Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states. Unless Congress precludes it, states may make laws that affect persons engaged in interstate commerce. However, states cannot enact laws that discriminate against articles of interstate commerce \u201cunless there is some reason, apart from their origin, to treat them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>differently.\u201d <em>City of Philadelphia v. New Jersey, </em>437 US 617, 627, 98 S Ct 2531, 57 L Ed 2d 475 (1978); <em>see also Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v. </em>Hunt, _US _, 112 S Ct 2009, 119 L Ed 2d 121 (1992); <em>Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc., v. Michigan Dept. Natl Res., supra, </em>n 17; <em>New Energy Co. of Indiana v. Limbach, </em>486 US 269, 273, 108 S Ct 1803, 100 L Ed 2d 302 (1988). States cannot benefit in-state interests by burdening out-of-state interests. <em>New Energy Co. of Indiana v. Limbach, supra, </em>486 US at 273; <em>see also Wyoming v. </em>Oklahoma, _ US _, 112 S Ct 789, 800, 117 L Ed 2d 1 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">The rules at issue here, by the express language of ORS 459.298, exact a compensatory fee for specific costs incurred by the state. They exact a per-ton surcharge on landfill operators who accept refuse from out-of-state haulers. ORS 459.297 provides that those funds are appropriated to DEQ to meet the costs that it incurs in administering the solid waste program. ORS 459.298 provides that the amount of the surcharge must be based on the costs to the state and its political subdivisions of disposing of solid waste generated out-of-state. Those may include, but are not limited to, costs associated with solid waste management, permit issuance, environmental monitoring, ground water monitoring and site closure. They may not include costs that are paid under other provisions in the chapter. The rules implement those statutory directives.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">Laws that impose compensatory fees<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-10\">\u201cnot a burden upon, or regulation of, interstate commerce in violation of the commerce clause of the Constitution. A law exhibiting the intent to impose a compensatory fee for such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>legitimate purpose is prima facie reasonable.\u201d <em>Great Northern Ry. Co. v. State of Washington, </em>300 US 154, 160, 57 S Ct 397, 81 L Ed 573 (1937). (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><em>See also Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, </em>453 US 609, 622 n 12, 101 S Ct 2946, 69 L Ed 2d 884 (1981). When that kind of law is challenged on Commerce Clause grounds, the challenger has the burden to show that the fee is excessive for the purpose for which it is collected, <em>Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., </em>306 US 583, 599, 59 S Ct 744, 83 L Ed 1001 (1939), or that \u201cthere is no sufficient relation between the measure employed and the extent or manner of use\u201d of the state provided service. <em>Interstate Transit, Inc. v. Lindsey, </em>283 US 183, 190, 51 S Ct 380, 75 L Ed 953 (1931).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">In <em>Interstate Busses Corp. v. Blodgett, </em>276 US 245, 48 S Ct 230, 72 L Ed 551 (1928), a state law had assessed a per-mile user fee on busses engaged in interstate commerce but did not assess that fee on those engaged in intrastate commerce. The Court first recognized that a state may impose a reasonable charge for the use of the facilities that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>provides to those engaged in interstate <em>commerce, </em>roads, in that case. It then determined, from a facial review of the statutory scheme, that the funds generated were dedicated to financing those facilities. The Court sustained the validity of the fee, because the party challenging it failed to show that \u201cthe aggregate charge [bore] no reasonable relation to the privilege granted.\u201d 276 US at 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">In <em>Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., supra, </em>the state had exacted a \u201ccaravaning\u201d fee for each automobile \u201coperated on its own wheels, or in tow of a motor vehicle, for the purpose of selling or offering the same for sale * * * within or without [the] State.\u201d 306 US at 586. (Citation omitted.) The purpose of the fee was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">\u201cto reimburse the State for expense [sic] incurred in administering police regulations pertaining to the operation of vehicles moved pursuant to such permits and to public safety upon the highways as affected by such operation.\u201d 306 US at 586. (Citation omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Because the law exempted cars moved exclusively within one of two zones that were roughly defined as the northern and southern halves of the state, the plaintiffs claimed that it unlawfully discriminated against interstate commerce. The Court disagreed. It first determined that the distinction that the state had made between intrazone and interzone traffic was permissible, because the state incurred a distinct burden by managing and facilitating the latter form of traffic and the intrazone traffic was already paying its fair share of costs of that commerce. The Court then recognized that the fees would offend the Commerce Clause if the plaintiffs showed that they were \u201cexcessive for the declared purposes.\u201d 306 US at 599. Because the fees did not appear, on their face, to be manifestly disproportionate to the services rendered, and the plaintiffs failed to present any other evidence of disproportionality, the Court sustained the validity of the fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">EQC\u2019s rules exact a compensatory fee for the distinct burden that the state incurs to regulate and facilitate disposal of out-of-state waste. Unlike the Michigan plan at issue in <em>Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v. Hunt, supra, </em>the rules impose a surcharge on in-state <em>and </em>out-of-state waste for the state services. The state might nevertheless be unlawfully discriminating if there is no reason, apart from its origin, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>charge more for its services to manage and regulate out-of-state waste than it charges to manage and regulate in-state waste. The state, however, appears to have a reason apart from origin <em>per se </em>to treat out-of-state waste differently. It first encounters any out-of-state waste at the disposal site. In contrast, by the time in-state waste reaches the disposal site, it has already been subjected to state and local regulations and fees that are designed to reduce Its volume and alter its character in order to limit the risks associated with dumping it on the ground. <em>See </em>n 14, <em>supra. </em>We cannot discern, from a facial review of the rules and legislation whether, in the aggregate, in-state garbage ultimately \u201cpays\u201d all of the costs that the state and its political subdivisions incur to manage and regulate its disposal. However, it does show that EQC is expressly forbidden to impose fees on out-of-state waste that exceed the costs of management of that waste. The legislature has made abundantly clear that it intends only to make \u201cout-of-state generators pay their \u2018fair share\u2019 of the costs\u201d and no more. <em>Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v. Hunt, </em>supra, _ US at __ n 9. Therefore, before we could say that the rules are unconstitutional, petitioners would have to show that the fees are excessive for the purposes for which they are collected or that there is no sufficient relation between the measure employed and the extent or manner of use of the state provided service.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Petitioners brought this challenge under ORS 183.400, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">\u201c(3) Judicial review of a rule shall be limited to an examination of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-9\">\u201c(a) The rule under review;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-10\">\u201c(b) The statutory provisions authorizing the rule; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-11\">\u201c(c) Copies of all documents necessary to demonstrate compliance with applicable rulemaking procedures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">A facial review of the enabling legislation and the rules does not sho w that the fees are either excessive or unrelated to the state provided service. ORS 183.400(3) does not permit us to consider the evidence that petitioners would have to produce to show that the fees are, nevertheless, manifestly disproportionate to the costs incurred by the state to manage and facilitate disposal of out-of-state waste.

It cites <em>Kids Against the Cut v. Wage and Hour Comm., </em>41 Or App 179, 597 P2d 1264 (1979), for the proposition that we must examine DEQ\u2019s \u201cmethodology to develop\u201d those costs to determine whether the agency \u201cfailed to act in conformance with the enabling statute.\u201d That infers too much from <em>Kids Against the Cut. </em>In that case, we held only that we may look at the record to see whether the agency made a determination on which its authority to act was predicated, not that we may consider whether the method used to reach that determination was correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b410-10\"> Petitioners assert in one short paragraph that EQC violated ORS 459.305 by including in the surcharge $0.05 per ton for what EQC calls \u201csolid waste reduction activities related to reviewing and certifying out-of-state waste reduction and recycling plans.\u201d They argue that certification fees may not be \u201clumped into the surcharge levied on all out of state waste,\u201d because they must be \u201cset in accordance with ORS 486.065,\u201d which they believe requires the fee to be set by a rule after a hearing. Moreover, they observe, the fee is \u201csubject to review of the Executive Department and the prior approval of the appropriate legislative review agency.\u201d ORS 459.305(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">Even assuming, without deciding, that ORS 459.305 is the exclusive source of authority for EQC to assess the certification fee, we see nothing in the statute that prohibits the agency from considering that fee at the same time that it considers the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>surcharge and nothing that requires the fee to be established by a separate rule, rather than as a component part of a more general rule. We also see nothing in ORS 468.065 <em>(since amended by </em>Or Laws 1991, ch 752, \u00a7 15) that requires the certification fee to be set by a rule after a hearing. Subsection (1) pertains only to permits issued under various sections of ORS chapters 448, 454 and 468. Subsection (2) pertains only to fees for permits issued pursuant to the specified sections that govern water and air pollution sources. Subsection (3) describes the costs that the agency may consider in determining fees for certification of hydroelectric power projects. Subsection (5) applies only to the specified sections of chapters 448, 454 and 468. Subsections (4) and (6) are the only subsections to which ORS 459.305(4) <em>could </em>refer. The former provides that DEQ may require various documents and reports to be submitted by those who apply for permits; the latter merely addresses what must be done with the fees that the DEQ collects. Neither requires a separate rule or a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">We also see no merit in petitioners\u2019 second argument under ORS 459.305(4). As far \u00e1s we can tell, that subsection requires nothing different from the procedure specified under ORS 459.298.

Accordingly, a landfill operator can pass the surcharge on to in-state as well as out-of-state haulers in the form of uniformly increased dumping fees. Nevertheless, because it is interstate commerce that gives rise to the obligation to pay the surcharge, the rules are subject to scrutiny under the Commerce Clause. <em>See Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Michigan Dept. of </em>Nat\u2019l Res., _ US _, 112 S Ct 2019, 119 L Ed 2d 139 (1992); <em>Evansville Airport v.

The classic example is a use tax imposed on goods purchased out of state that is equivalent to the sales tax that would have been generated had those goods been purchased in state. <em>See Henneford v. Silas Mason Co., </em>300 US 577, 57 S Ct 524, 81 L Ed 814 (1937). Such taxes permit an individual faced with the choice of an in-state or out-of-state purchase to make that choice without regard to the tax consequences. <em>Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>429 US 318, 330, 97 S Ct 599, 50 L Ed 2d 514 (1977). Accordingly, when a state enacts a valid compensatory tax, it does not discriminate against interstate commerce. <em>Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, </em>430 US 274, 97 S Ct 1076, 51L Ed 2d 326 (1977); see <em>also Maryland v.

Regulations that control conduct to protect some aspect of the health or general welfare of a state\u2019s citizens are valid when preservation of health or welfare is the law\u2019s true purpose and the means chosen to achieve that objective does not unduly burden interstate commerce. <em>Maine v. Taylor, </em>477 US 131, 106 S Ct 2440, 91 L Ed 2d 110 (1986); <em>Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., </em>397 US 137, 142,90 S Ct 844, 25 L Ed 2d 174 (1970). However, if the actual purpose or effect of a health or welfare regulation is economic or resource protectionism, the law may be invalid. <em>See, e.g., Wyoming v. Oklahoma, </em>supra; <em>Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm., </em>432 US 333, 97 S Ct 2434, 53 L Ed 2d 383 (1977); <em>Dean Milk Co. v.

New Jersey, supra. </em>General revenue measures are taxes imposed to compensate the state for \u201cprovidingpolice and fire protection, the benefit of a trained work force, and the advantages of a civilized society.\u201d <em>Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, supra, </em>453 US at 624. (Citations and internal quotations omitted.) A state can impose such a tax on those engaged in interstate commerce if it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3c\">\u201cis applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to services provided by the State. \u2019 \u2019 <em>Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v.
