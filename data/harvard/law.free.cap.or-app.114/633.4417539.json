ORS 163.160. The court merged the assault conviction with the first count of criminal mistreatment and sentenced defendant to 96 months incarceration and 36 months post-prison supervision on the sexual penetration conviction. On each criminal mistreatment conviction, it imposed 18 months incarceration and 36 months post-prison supervision. The three prison terms are to run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Defendant argues that the court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal. There was no error. There was sufficient evidence to find him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">He also argues that the court erred in imposing multiple terms of post-prison supervision on the consecutive sentences. Under OAR 253-12-020 and OAR 253-12-040, multiple terms of post-prison supervision are served as a single term, that being the post-prison term of the primary offense. There is no error that requires remand. <em>State v. Enos, </em>114 Or App 208, 836 P2d 1347 (1992); <em>State v.
