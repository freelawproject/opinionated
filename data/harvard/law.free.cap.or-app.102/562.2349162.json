We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Claimants Dodgion and Allen were long haul truck drivers for American Hardwoods, an Oregon employer covered by SAIF. In June, 1984, they were involved in a head-on collision with another truck in Michigan. Dodgion was killed, and Allen was seriously injured. Allen and Dodgion\u2019s surviving spouse, the beneficiary of his estate, filed workers\u2019 compensation claims in Oregon. SAIF accepted the claims and paid Allen $137,741 and anticipated paying him another $20,596, for a total of $158,337. SAIF also paid $31,568 to Dodgion\u2019s beneficiary, and anticipated paying an additional $136,561, for a total of $168,130.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">In March, 1986, claimants brought actions against the other truck driver\u2019s estate and Twin Ports Grocery Company, the owner of the other truck.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both claims were eventually settled. Allen\u2019s \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d provided that the settlement was for non-economic loss only and contained an express choice of laws clause adopting Michigan law. Under Michigan law, a workers\u2019 compensation carrier cannot reach the proceeds of a claimant\u2019s third-party settlement that are for noneconomic loss.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Great American Ins. Co. v. Queen, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>410 Mich 73, 300 NW2d 895 (1980). Dodgion\u2019s \u201cRelease of All Claims\u201d does not include a choice of laws clause.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAK1\">SAIF asserted that it had valid liens against all of Dodgion\u2019s settlement proceeds and against Allen\u2019s proceeds for the smaller of $158,337 or its statutory distributional share. In November, 1987, SAIF petitioned the Board for a third-party distribution order declaring its lien against the settlement proceeds valid and distributing them in accordance with ORS 656.593(1) and (3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Relying on sections 6 and 145 of the <em>Restatement </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number><em>(Second) Conflict of Laws </em>(1971), the Board concluded that \u201cclaimant\u2019s right of tort recovery against the third parties and the third parties\u2019 liabilities to claimant were determined by Michigan law.\u201d It reasoned that, with respect to those issues, Michigan had the \u201cmost significant contacts\u201d with the parties and the subject matter of their dispute. However, the Board concluded that Oregon law governs the issue of SAIF\u2019s rights to share in the settlement proceeds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-4\">\u201cThat issue concerns the relationship of an Oregon worker, and an Oregon workers\u2019 compensation carrier and, indirectly at least, an Oregon employer. The state of Michigan had no substantial interest in whether SAIF is able to recover all, some or none of its compensation payments from claimant\u2019s proceeds. The financial, social and legal impacts of that determination are centered in Oregon. Under these circumstances, Oregon has the most significant relationship to the parties and the subject matter of their dispute and its law should control. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7\u00a7 6, 145(2). The law of Michigan, like the law of any other foreign jurisdiction, is advisory only.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The Board then concluded that the liens were valid and ordered distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Claimants assign error first to the Board\u2019s conclusion that Oregon, rather than Michigan, law applies and, second, to the conclusion that SAIF\u2019s lien may be satisfied out of the settlement proceeds. They argue that, under general choice of law principles, because Michigan has the most significant contacts with the parties and the subject matter of the dispute, its law controls. <em>Restatement (Second) Conflict of Laws </em>\u00a7\u00a7 6,145. Therefore, claimants contend that, under Michigan law, SAIF\u2019s lien is invalid, because their recovery was for non-economic loss only.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">We conclude that the Board correctly held that Oregon law governs the validity of SAIF\u2019s liens on the third-party settlement proceeds. Although the Board relied on general choice of law principles, enumerated in sections 6 and 145, section 185 of the <em>Restatement </em>is directly on point. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">\u201cThe local law of the state under whose workman\u2019s compensation statute an employee has received an award for an injury determines what interest the person who paid the award has in any recovery for tort or wrongful death that the employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>may obtain against a third person on account of the same injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">Section 185 is in accord with Larson, who states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">\u201cAs to third party actions, if compensation has been paid in a foreign state and suit is brought against a third party in the state of injury, the substantive rights of the employee, the subrogated insurance company and the employer are ordinarily held governed by the law of the foreign state.\u201d 4 Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law </em>16-171, \u00a7 88.00 (1989).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Oregon has a vital interest in applying its law to determine the interest of an Oregon workers\u2019 compensation carrier in settlement proceeds that are obtained by Oregon workers. Claimants obtained workers\u2019 compensation in Oregon. Under Oregon law, SAIF, as the paying agency, is entitled to reimbursement from the proceeds of any settlement for the amounts that it paid on behalf of the injured and deceased workers. ORS 656.580(2); ORS 656.593(1) and (3). The provision in the agreement that the settlement was for noneconomic loss only is irrelevant. Although that limitation would apparently protect the settlement proceeds from the reach of workers\u2019 compensation carriers under Michigan law, <em>see Great American Ins. Co. v. Queen, supra, </em>the Oregon legislature has made no such exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">We also reject claimants\u2019 suggestions that the express choice of laws provision in Allen\u2019s settlement agreement, adopting Michigan law, is evidence of the parties\u2019 recognition of that state\u2019s greater interest in the enforcement of the agreement. SAIF was not a party to the agreement, and the parties may not contract to circumvent a fundamental policy of Oregon law by choosing the law of another jurisdiction. <em>See Young v. Mobil Oil Corp., </em>85 Or App 64, 67-73, 735 P2d 654 (1987). The underlying public policy of the third-party distribution statutes and the purpose of the statutory liens</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-8\">\u201cis to allocate <em>whatever </em>the claimant recovers between him and the paying agency and to provide reimbursement to those responsible for statutory compensation of injured workers when damages for settlements are obtained against the persons whose act caused the injuries.\u201d <em>Schlect v. SAIF, </em>60 Or App 449, 456, 653 P2d 1284 (1982). (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-7\"> \u201cClaimants\u201d refers both to Allen and to Dodgion\u2019s surviving spouse, the beneficiary of his estate. The Board issued two third-party distribution orders, and the cases were consolidated on review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b606-8\"> Under Michigan law, tort liability for motor vehicle accidents has been generally abolished and replaced with a no-fault system of personal protection benefits that limit recovery to certain categories of loss. One of those categories is noneconomic loss. Although the other truck driver and Twin Ports Grocery were Minnesota residents, they were covered insured under a policy that contained a written certification that provided them with the rights and immunities of Michigan\u2019s no-fault law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b606-9\"> In Michigan, a workers\u2019 compensation carrier is not entitled to reimbursement for the type of expenses that SAIF paid. <em>Great American Ins. Co. v. Queen, supra. </em>Under that state\u2019s law, a carrier\u2019s right to reimbursement from a third-party settlement is restricted to only those proceeds that are compensation for types of damages that are common to both the tort action and to benefits that it has paid on the compensation claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b607-6\"> The record contains two copies of what purports to be Dodgion\u2019s release. One copy has a paragraph that states: \u201cIt is further agreed to by the parties that all of the consideration paid to the plaintiff * * * is consideration for non-economic loss. The parties agree that no portion of the settlement is consideration for economic loss.\u201d That provision is below the signature line and in a different typeface than the rest of the document. The other copy has no such paragraph. No explanation of the discrepancy is in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b607-8\"> ORS 656.593(1) and (3) provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">\u201c(1) If the worker or the beneficiaries of the worker elect to recover damages from the employer or third person, notice of such election shall be given the paying agency * * *.
