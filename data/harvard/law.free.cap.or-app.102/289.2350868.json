Bissett (A41367)(A44881), </em>101 Or App 163, 174 n 8, 790 P2d 16 (1990). On reconsideration, we conclude that the issue appears to have been litigated in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">For purposes of this opinion, we assume, without deciding, that grandchildren have standing. However, they have no right to relief, because their grandmother was a party to the lawsuit against Anderson, and whatever reduction to her estate that occurred as a result of the expenses incurred in the Anderson matter was with her consent and participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Petition for reconsideration allowed; former opinion modified and adhered to as modified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
