The dispositive issue on appeal arises from the trial court\u2019s decision not to recuse himself in this matter. The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly (1) exercised its discretion and prejudiced him by presiding over the present case when the judge had previously recused himself from all future matters in which the plaintiffs attorney appeared, and (2) admitted hearsay testimony from the defendant. Because our resolution of the first issue is dispositive, it is unnecessary to consider the second issue related to the merits of the dissolution action.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">On September 10, 1996, the plaintiffs attorney, Joseph Chiarelli, was at a motions calendar in an unrelated matter. After an exchange with the trial court, Chiarelli orally moved for the judge to recuse himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>from hearing any case in which Chiarelli was involved.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court granted Chiarelli\u2019s motion and recused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>himself from all of Chiarelli\u2019s matters \u201c[b]ecause I do not approve of the way you handle yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">On September 30, 1996, the first day of trial in this case, Chiarelli represented the plaintiff before the same court who had recused himself less than three weeks before from hearing any cases involving Chiarelli. At that time, the trial judge informed both parties and counsel that he was hearing this case because he had been instructed to do so by the presiding judge.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Chiarelli reminded the court of the reason he had recused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>himself and that the court was imposing on his client the needless expense of filing an appeal in this matter before it had even started. The trial judge repeated that he was instructed to proceed with the case and that if Chiarelli had a problem to take it up with the presiding judge.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Chiarelli went before the presiding judge and requested that she reassign this case to another judge. She denied his request.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial proceeded and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The plaintiff claims on appeal that the trial court abused its discretion and prejudiced him by hearing the trial of his case when the trial court previously had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>recused itself from hearing any case in which the plaintiffs counsel of record had an interest. We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">\u201cNo more elementary statement concerning the judiciary can be made than that the conduct of the trial judge must be characterized by the highest degree of impartiality. If he departs from this standard, he casts serious reflection upon the system of which he is a part. A judge is not an umpire in a forensic encounter. . . . He is a minister of justice. ... He may, of course, take all reasonable steps necessary for the orderly progress of the trial. ... In whatever he does, however, the trial judge should be cautious and circumspect in his language and conduct. A judge should be scrupulous to refrain from hear ing matters which he feels he cannot approach in the utmost spirit of fairness and to avoid the appearance of prejudice as regards either the parties or the issues before him. . . . <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>187 Conn. 163, 168-69, 444 A.2d 915 (1982). Moreover, disqualification of a trial judge is not dependent upon proof of actual bias. The appearance and the existence of impartiality are both essential elements of a fair trial. Id. Canon 3 (c) (1) of the Code of Judicial Conduct requires a judge to disqualify himself in any proceeding in which judicial impartiality might reasonably be doubted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Any conduct that would lead a reasonable [person] knowing all the circumstances to the conclusion that the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned is a basis for the judge\u2019s disqualification.\u201d (Internal quotation marte omitted.) <em>Postemski </em>v. <em>Landon, </em>9 Conn. App. 320, 322, 518 A.2d 674 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">\u201cIt is [the judge\u2019s] responsibility to have the trial conducted in a manner which approaches an \u2018atmo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>sphere of perfect impartiality which is so much to be desired in a judicial proceeding.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. Echols, 170 Conn. 11, 13, 364 A.2d 225 (1975), quoting <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 82, 62 S. Ct. 457, 86 L. Ed. 680 (1942).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>supra, 187 Conn. 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">\u201c[E]very litigant is entitled to nothing less than the cold neutrality of an impartial judge. It is the duty of [c]ourts to scrupulously guard this right and to refrain from attempting to exercise jurisdiction in any matter where his qualification to do so is seriously brought in question. The exercise of any other policy tends to discredit the judiciary and shadow the administration of justice. It is not enough for a judge to assert that he is free from prejudice. His mien and the reflex from his court room speak louder than he can declaim on this point. If he fails through these avenues to reflect justice and square dealing, .his usefulness is destroyed. The attitude of the judge and the atmosphere of the court room should indeed be such that no matter what charge is lodged against a litigant or what cause he is called on to litigate, he can approach the bar with every assurance that he is in a forum where the judicial ermine is everything that it typifies\u2014purity and justice. The guaranty of a fair and impartial trial can mean nothing less than this.\u201d <em>Hayslip </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>400 So. 2d 553, 557 (Fla. App. 1981), quoting <em>State ex rel. Davis </em>v. <em>Parks, </em>141 Fla. 516, 519-20, 194 So. 613 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that a reasonable person who is aware of all the circumstances surrounding this judicial proceeding would question the trial judge\u2019s impartiality in hearing a case in which Chiarelli represented one of the parties. On the first day of trial, the first words from the trial judge were that he had been instructed to hear this case. The subsequent discussion concerning the trial judge\u2019s recusal on matters involving Chiarelli, as well as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>discussion on the record with the presiding judge, all created an atmosphere in which the plaintiff could reasonably believe that he was unable to receive a fair trial before the trial judge. Further, the trial judge\u2019s decision to recuse himself from all matters involving Chiarelli was made on September 10, 1996. Three weeks later, the judge sat before the plaintiff, stated that he had been instructed to hear the plaintiffs case, and that he \u201c[does] not allow any feelings that [he] may have for any litigant or for any attorney to affect [his] judicial rulings or decisions, and you <em>arc </em>going to have to accept that.\u201d This can hardly be said to have assuaged the plaintiffs concerns that he is now facing a judge who dislikes his attorney and, therefore, is not impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">\u201cThough a client and his counsel are separate entities, they share a common bond forged by the attorney-client relationship and tempered in the rigors of litigation. Most clients find the courtroom to be an unfamiliar and, in some instances, uncomfortable atmosphere and so it is not unusual that they entrust themselves into their counsel\u2019s care and view their interests as one. Thus, it is understandable that a client would become concerned and fearful upon learning that the trial judge has an antipathy toward his lawyer and has expressed the opinion that [he does not approve of the way the client\u2019s counsel handles himself].\u201d <em>Hayslip </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>supra, 400 So. 2d 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">When the trial judge decided to recuse himself from all future; matters involving Chiarelli, this should have ended any concern for either Chiarelli or the trial judge over his hearing of cases involving Chiarelli. It was inappropriate for the presiding judge to instruct the trial judge to hear this case. The presiding judge does not have the power to tell a trial judge when he or she may or may not recuse himself or herself. The matter of a judge\u2019s recusal is in the reasonable discretion of that judge and is not to be overruled by a presiding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>judge. The decision to recuse oneself is an intrinsic part of the independence of a judge. Any attempt to instruct or order a judge to hear a matter after recusal violates the independence of judges individually and the judiciary as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-5\"> The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: Okay, Judge, as I\u2019m sitting here it occurs to me that I should make a motion to disqualify you in the hearing of any case that I\u2019m involved in. You are\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">\u201cThe Court: Well, if it occurs to you, are you making that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-8\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: Well, I\u2019d like to address to you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-9\">\u201cThe Court: Are you malting that motion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-10\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: I\u2019m malting that motion now, Judge. And the reason is that we had very hard feelings against one another in my recollection while you were practicing law. And I thought that when you got on the bench that your attitude toward me changed. But, now I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-11\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Chiarelli, from my own\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-12\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: Can I finish, Judge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-13\">\u201cThe Court: Yeah. [For my] own curiosity, would you refer to when that was because you and I didn\u2019t practice the same type of law and unless you were defending malpractice cases I can\u2019t imagine ever having a case with you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-14\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: No, no, no. No, that isn\u2019t how.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-15\">\u201cThe Court: Oh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-16\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: It was our reaction to one another when we saw one another. And you were associated with Miss Daskal Rubin. Am I correct, Judge? \u201cThe Court: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-17\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: Yes. Okay. And I think because of the way you have been so critical of me for nothing here. This woman has come here and complained about nothing. You picked up on it right away. And you started letting me have it for what I think is no cause. So, I think that these hard feelings that you have against me for when I practiced law and when you practiced law at the same time have carried over to while you\u2019re a judge\u2014\u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-18\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Chiarelli\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-19\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-20\">\u201cThe Court: Did you and I ever have a matter together in all the years that I practiced?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-21\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: I can\u2019t think of one off the top of my head, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-22\">\u201cThe Court: And the reason you can\u2019t is I don\u2019t think we ever did. \u201c[Chiarelli]: Yeah. But, you have a dislike for me and I had a dislike for you. But, I got over my dislike for you. It\u2019s obvious to me that you didn\u2019t get over your dislike for me, making these comments to me. Being critical of what I said to this woman on a telephone answering machine\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-23\">\u201cThe Court: Mr.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-24\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: It seems that you seize on every opportunity to insult me. And I don\u2019t like it and I don\u2019t want to practice law\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-25\">\u201cThe Court: And I don\u2019t want you raising your voice in my courtroom, Mr. Chiarelli\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-26\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: Oh, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry if I raised my voice. I apologize to you, Judge\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"arm-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Because in one second I\u2019m going to tell the sheriff to escort you right through that door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: Okay\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-8\">\u201cThe Court: Now, sit down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-9\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: Sure, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-10\">\u201cThe Court: And I will tell you that the only thing that is keeping me from doing exactly what you said was that I have some feeling for my brethren.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-11\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: Yes, thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-12\">\u201cThe Court: But, I\u2019m going to grant your request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-13\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: Thank you, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-14\">\u201cThe Court: And I\u2019m going to recuse myself from all of your matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-15\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: Okay, thank you very much, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-16\">\u201cThe Court: Because I do not approve of the way you handle yourself.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b685-17\"> The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-18\">\u201cThe Court: Are both counsel here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-19\">\u201c[Counsel for the Defendant]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-20\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Will both counsel approach the bench. ... I have told you that I am hearing this case because the chief judge has instructed me to hear this case. And the chief judge has further said that she will allow no attorney to dictate who will or will not hear their cases. You and I had a discussion on the record in the Gordon versus Gordon case, the transcript is before me, and in that transcript you made the claim that I was treating you unfairly. At that time I said to you, if you felt that way that I would recuse myself from your cases, and that was the way it was left. I did not hear this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-21\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: Can I address what you just said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-22\">\u201cThe Court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-23\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: Okay. You said that you didn\u2019t like the way I handled myself and that\u2019s why you disqualified yourself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-24\">\u201cThe Court: Well\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-25\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: It\u2019s on page 19 of the transcript.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-26\">\u201cThe Court: On page 19 of the transcript it says\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-27\">\u201c[Chiarelli]: Oh, it\u2019s page 18 then. And then on [page] 19 you say that you will recuse yourself from all my cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>\u201cThe Court: I did say that.

But I am telling you now that my instructions are to proceed with this case. And on the record I\u2019m saying to you that I take my judicial responsibilities very seriously, and I do not allow any feelings that I may have for any litigant or for any attorney to affect my judicial rulings or decisions, and you are going to have to accept that.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b686-9\"> The trial judge stated: \u201cMr. Chiarelli, the only thing that I would suggest to you is that if you are unhappy and refuse to go along with what I have just told you, that you go down to the [presiding judge] and you see [the presiding judge] and tell her exactly that.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b686-10\"> \u201c[Presiding Judge]: On the Consiglio matter, the question is the assignment of the case, and whether [the trial judge] is\u2014well, first of all whether the parties are ready to proceed, and I gather they are, and whether [the trial judge] has determined that he can hear this case, and he, as I understand it, has determined he can hear this case, that he can be fair to both counsel, to all parties involved.
