We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. James Perkins owned and operated the Perkins Funeral Home in New Haven. In 1989, Perkins was convicted of a crime unrelated to this appeal and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Perkins\u2019 attorney, Julie Block, approached Armond McCoy, the accountant for the funeral home, and asked him to take a more active role in managing the financial affairs of the funeral home during Perkins\u2019 incarceration. McCoy agreed and began a review of the funeral home accounts and records. He discovered that the funeral home did not have a checking account and established one with Bank of Boston on February 27, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">On May 10, 1989, Sidney Gimple, as conservator for Esther West, sent a check for $3600 to the Perkins Funeral Home in order to establish an \u201cirrevocable funeral trust\u201d to pay for West\u2019s funeral expenses upon her death. Earlier that year, the funeral home had also received checks from several other persons who wanted to prepay funeral expenses. McCoy decided that these funds should be deposited in a separate account to ensure that the assets would be available when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>needed. On May 18, 1989, McCoy deposited a total of $9057.16, which included the $3600 check sent by Gim-ple and the other funds received as prepayment of funeral costs, into an account with Bank of Boston.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Subsequently, Gimple learned that McCoy had commingled the funds intended to pay for West\u2019s funeral with moneys received to pay for the funerals of other persons. On May 25, 1989, Gimple sent a letter to the funeral home requesting that the funds he had provided to establish an \u201cirrevocable funeral trust\u201d on behalf of West be deposited in a separate trust account. As requested, McCoy withdrew the $3600 and set up a certificate of deposit (CD). The CD named the funeral home as the trustee of an \u201cirrevocable funeral trust F/ B/O Esther W. West.\u201d McCoy sent a copy of the CD to Gimple to confirm that he had complied with Gim-ple\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">On November 17, 1989, McCoy withdrew the remaining funds and closed the account. With these funds, he obtained a second CD from Bank of Boston. The certificate issued for this account, however, did not provide that it was a trust account nor did it provide the names of any trustees or beneficiaries. It merely labeled the funeral home as the owner of the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">On March 19,1990, McCoy submitted a letter of resignation to Block, indicating that he would no longer provide his professional services to the funeral home. On or about that date, Perkins asked the defendant to become involved with the management of the funeral home. On April 20, 1990, McCoy and his attorney, John H. Peck, Jr., met with the defendant at Block\u2019s office. Peck turned over a box of funeral home business records that had been in the possession of McCoy. Included in these records were a list of documents and the two CDs opened by McCoy. Block signed a statement acknowledging receipt of the records. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>defendant also signed a handwritten statement that indicated an accounting discrepancy. Block turned these documents over to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">On June 29, 1990, the defendant went to the Hamden branch of Bank of Boston and spoke with a customer service representative, Richard Brown. Brown was aware that the defendant was associated with the funeral home. At the request of the defendant, Brown cashed the second CD, which was worth $8397.99. The defendant deposited $1397.99 into the funeral home checking account and took the remaining $7000 in cash. On August 21,1990, the defendant again met with Brown and cashed the first CD that had been established as an \u201cirrevocable funeral trust F/B/O Esther W. West,\u201d then worth $3963.30. The entire amount was again taken in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">In November, 1991, the defendant terminated his association with the funeral home. In May, 1993, Gimple spoke with a representative of Bank of Boston regarding the status of West\u2019s funeral trust account. He was informed that the account had been closed by the defendant in August, 1990, and was given copies of the bank\u2019s records to confirm the closing. Gimple sent a letter to the funeral home, a copy of which was sent to the defendant\u2019s residence, demanding that the assets of the trust be transferred to another funeral home located in New Haven.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When he received no response to his letter, Gimple filed a complaint with the department of consumer protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Neale Belgrade, an administrative hearing officer for the department, was assigned to investigate the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>plaint. Belgrade requested that the defendant submit to an interview, to which the defendant consented. On November 24, 1993, at the department\u2019s office in Hartford, the defendant was interviewed. The interview was conducted under oath, and was tape recorded and later transcribed. The defendant subsequently was charged with larceny in the second degree, larceny in the third degree and perjuiy. The defendant was tried before a jury beginning on January 2, 1996. A motion for judgment of acquittal as to the charge of larceny in the second degree was granted on January 9, 1996. The jury returned verdicts of guilty of larceny in the third degree and perjury on January 18, 1996. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The defendant\u2019s first two claims assert that the evidence presented was insufficient to sustain his conviction of larceny in the third degree and perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">\u201c[W]e have consistently employed a two-part analysis in appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a criminal conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Salz, 226 </em>Conn. 20, 31, 627 A.2d 862 (1993). First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. That the evidence is circumstantial rather than direct does not diminish the probative force of that evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>214 Conn. 77, 79, 570 A.2d 203 (1990), on appeal after remand, 220 Conn. 169, 595 A.2d 881 (1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1034, 112 S. Ct. 877, 116 L. Ed. 2d 781 (1992). . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>DePastino, </em>228 Conn. 552, 570, 638 A.2d 578 (1994).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pulley, </em>46 Conn. App. 414, 418-19, 699 A.2d 1042 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">We turn first to the defendant\u2019s argument regarding his conviction of larceny in the third degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-124 (a) (2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the state presented insufficient evidence on the essential element of intent. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\u201cThe elements of larceny . . . are: (1) the wrongful taking or carrying away of the personal property of another; (2) the existence of a felonious intent in the taker to deprive the owner of it permanently; and (3) the lack of consent of the owner.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Huot, </em>170 Conn. 463, 467, 365 A.2d 1144 (1976). To prove the element of intent within the context of larceny, the state must show that the defendant intended to deprive another person of property permanently. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>178 Conn. 689, 694, 425 A.2d 111 (1979). Intent may be inferred by the fact finder from the conduct of the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofone, </em>164 Conn. 162, 164, 319 A.2d 381 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict and with all inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, the jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant withdrew $3963.30 from the account held by the Perkins Funeral Home for the benefit of West using a certificate marked \u201cirrevocable funeral trust F/B/O Esther W. West.\u201d When a demand was made on the defendant by a letter sent via certified mail, return receipt requested, and signed for by the defendant\u2019s daughter, for a transfer of the moneys held in trust to another funeral home, the defendant failed to return the moneys and ignored the request. From these facts alone, sufficient evidence was presented from which the jury reasonably could have inferred that the defendant intended to take funds from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>the account of West without her permission and that he refused to return them.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The defendant argues that his testimony to the jury that he did not know the meaning of an \u201cirrevocable funeral trust\u201d negated any evidence of intent presented by the state. Therefore, he claims, the state failed to prove intent. The defendant misconstrues our standard of review. It is not our function to decide the weight of evidence presented or the credibility of witnesses. We must determine whether there was sufficient evidence from which a jury reasonably could conclude that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of larceny in the third degree. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Salz, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 31. That the defendant presented contrary evidence is of no moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">We conclude that sufficient evidence was presented from which a jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">The defendant next claims that insufficient evidence was presented to sustain his conviction of perjury in violation of \u00a7 53a-156 (a). The defendant claims that the allegedly false statements concerned withdrawals made from the second CD and, therefore, there is no evidence that he made a false statement regarding a withdrawal from the first CD. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, the state did not charge the defendant with perjury for denying that he withdrew money from the irrevocable funeral trust of West. The specific language of the information charged that the defendant \u201cintentionally, under oath, did testify falsely to a material statement which he does not believe to be true, to wit: denied withdrawing money from accounts established to deposit prepaid funeral arrangement money . . . .\u201d These statements were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>alleged to have been made at the formal investigatory hearing at the department of consumer protection.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">In the present case, the state presented extensive documentary evidence to support the allegation that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>the defendant testified falsely. \u201cIn appropriate circumstances, belief of falsity may be inferred by proof of the falsity itself. <em>La Placa </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 F.2d 56, 59 (1st Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 927, 86 S. Ct. 932, 15 L. Ed. 2d 846 (1966).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fantasia, </em>5 Conn. App. 552, 555, 500 A.2d 968 (1985), cert. denied, 199 Conn. 806, 508 A.2d 33 (1986). It is clear that the defendant knew that the second CD was a trust account used to hold payments for prepaid funeral arrangements and that the defendant denied withdrawing any money from this account. It is equally clear and overwhelmingly supported by the record that the defendant withdrew money from this account as well as from the first CD, as evidenced by the defendant\u2019s signature on the redemption receipts. Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict and with all inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, overwhelmingly sufficient evidence existed from which the jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion for a further bill of particulars regarding the perjury count. The defendant\u2019s specific claim on appeal is that the trial court improperly failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>to grant the motion for a bill of particulars as to in \u201cexactly what respect the said statement is alleged to have been false.\u201d The defendant argues that this error deprived him of his constitutional right to be informed of the charges against him and to prepare a defense. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Additional facts are necessary to our resolution of this claim. On October 27, 1995, the state filed an amended information in response to the defendant\u2019s motion for a bill of particulars in which the state charged that \u201con or about November 24, 1993, [the defendant] intentionally, under oath, did testify falsely to a material statement which he does not believe to be true in violation of \u00a7 53a-156 (a) . . . .\u201d On December 21, 1995, the defendant filed a second motion for a bill of particulars requesting that the state (1) identify the statement alleged to be false and (2) declare in what respect it is false.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">A hearing on the further bill of particulars was held before the trial corut, which granted the request as to question one and denied it as to question two. On January 11,1996, the state filed an amended long form information, which added the following language to the perjury charge, \u201cto wit: denied withdrawing money from accounts established to deposit prepaid funeral arrangement money, in violation of \u00a7 53a-156 (a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">\u201cThe sixth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution guarantee a criminal defendant the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the charges against him with sufficient precision to enable him to meet them at trial. <em>State </em>v. Cates, 202 Conn. 615, 625-26, 522 A.2d 788 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Franko, </em>199 Conn. 481, 490, 508 A.2d 22 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 240, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S. Ct. 1455, 79 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1984). [That] the offense should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>described with sufficient definiteness and particularity to apprise the accused of the nature of the charge so he can prepare to meet it at his trial . . . are principles of constitutional law [that] are inveterate and sacrosanct. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sumner, </em>178 Conn. 163, 166, 422 A.2d 299 (1979); <em>State v. Scognamiglio, </em>202 Conn. 18, 22, 519 A.2d 607 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Franko, </em>supra [490]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>supra [240]. . . . The defendant has the burden of showing why the particulars are necessary to the adequate preparation of his defense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>supra [240-41]. The denial of a motion for a bill of particulars is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will be overturned only upon a clear showing of prejudice to the defendant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>194 Conn. 233, 237, 478 A.2d 1013 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>supra [240-41].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.). <em>State </em>v. <em>Laracuente, </em>205 Conn. 515, 518-19, 534 A.2d 882 (1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 1036, 108 S. Ct. 1598, 99 L. Ed. 2d 913 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">A bill of particulars must allege facts with sufficient precision to enable the defendant to meet them at trial; exact precision is not required. The amended information charged that the defendant committed perjury, \u201cto wit: denied withdrawing money from accounts established to deposit prepaid funeral arrangement money, in violation of \u00a7 53a-156 (a).\u201d We fail to see how the defendant could have been uninformed regarding the nature of the charges against him and why \u201cexactly what respect the said statement is alleged to have been false\u201d was necessary to his defense. The defendant\u2019s claim to the contrary is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court unconstitutionally restricted his cross-examination of Block, the attorney for the funeral home.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>argues that the questions he wanted to pose were relevant to show Block\u2019s motive and bias, and to show prior misconduct. On appeal, the defendant asserts that Block\u2019s motive for testifying was to curry favor with the state in order to avoid prosecution for her own misdeeds and that he should have been allowed to present this theory to the jury. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The state called Block as a witness for the purpose of establishing that she had received a box of documents during a meeting with Peck, McCoy and the defendant. Block testified that she regularly dealt with the defendant and that she had turned the contents of the box over to him. This evidence was pertinent because the first CD was one of the documents in that box.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">During the cross-examination, a total of four objections were made by the state, one of which was overruled. The purported \u201crestriction\u201d on cross-examination put into issue on appeal by the defendant was part of the following colloquy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">\u201cQ. You represented Perkins Funeral Home during the time that Mr. Perkins was in jail, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-9\">\u201cA. Yes\u2014well, part of the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-10\">\u201cQ.

Beyond the scope of direct and relevance, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-14\">\u201cThe Court: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-15\">\u201cQ.

The witness was excused and out of the presence of the jury, the defendant stated that the questions objected to by the state and sustained by the trial court were relevant to show bias and motive. Specifically, the defendant argued for the record that (1) he was attempting to show that Block was exposed to the possibility of criminal liability and therefore had a motive to curry favor with the state, and (2) the questions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>relevant to impeachment as evidence of prior misconduct relating to the issue of credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\u201cThe right to confrontation is fundamental to a fair trial under both the federal and state constitutions. <em>Pointer </em>v.

Ct. 1431, 89 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">\u201cThe defendant relies upon the holding of <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Alaska, </em>[supra, 415 U.S. 308] that undue restriction upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>cross-examination of prosecution witnesses for bias or interest, particularly with respect to bargains made concerning the disposition of criminal charges against those witnesses, violates the constitutional right of confrontation. <em>See State v. Annunziato, </em>174 Conn. 376, 379, 387 A.2d 566 (1978). That principle is wholly inapplicable to the questions which are the subject of the rulings challenged here. Not only do these inquiries make no reference to pending criminal charges against the [witness], whether formally presented or at some preliminary stage, but no claim of such a purpose was made at trial. Facially the questions appeared to be designed to attack the character of the [witness] by proof of prior specific acts of misconduct other than felony convictions in violation of the general prohibition against such evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Zdanis, </em>173 Conn. 189, 191, 377 A.2d 275 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>170 Conn. 161, 167, 365 A.2d 104 (1976); <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>96 Conn. 582, 597, 115 A. 11 (1921); <em>Verdi </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>91 Conn. 448, 454, 99 A. 1041 (1917). The exception, which allows, in the discretion of the trial court, proof of particular acts having a special significance upon the issue of veracity, cannot be said to require the admission of evidence that a witness has engaged in an unrelated [and uncharged misconduct] at some time in the past. <em>Vogel </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>148 Conn. 666, 675, 174 A.2d 122 (1961); <em>Shailer </em>v. <em>Bullock, </em>78 Conn. 65, 69, 61 A. 65 (1905). . . .

Maybe you can tell us a little bit about the mechanics of how that worked at the funeral home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-9\">\u201cThe Witness: The individuals would come in and make prearrangements for funerals and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-10\">\u201cMs. Belgrade:\u2014And that was either for themselves\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-11\">\u201cThe Witness:\u2014For themselves or for a loved one.
