On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the trial court (a) abused its discretion with respect to eviden-tiary rulings and (b) improperly charged the jury, (2) the state failed to present evidence sufficient to convict the defendant of burglary in the first degree and (3) his federal and state constitutional rights to a fair trial were violated due to prosecutorial impropriety. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On the evening of Monday, September 26, 1994, the victim, a twenty-six year old woman, was living with her fourteen month old daughter in an apartment in Meriden. The defendant lived with his mother in an apartment in close proximity to that of the victim. The defendant entered the victim\u2019s apartment uninvited at approximately 8:30 p.m. rubbed her shoulders and licked and kissed her cheek. Despite the victim\u2019s protests, the defendant, who was much bigger than the victim, pushed her onto the couch and squeezed her breasts so hard that it hurt her and caused milk to be expressed. The victim\u2019s daughter then began to cry, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>the defendant ceased his attack and left the victim\u2019s apartment. Two days later, after discussing the incident with a counselor whom she had known for five years, the victim reported the incident to the police. At the close of evidence, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, which was denied. Following his conviction, the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">The defendant first claims that the trial court abused its discretion by permitting the prosecutor to cross-examine him improperly. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">The following additional facts and procedure are necessary for our review of the defendant\u2019s claim. On direct examination, the investigating police officer testified that he had known the defendant for over twenty years and that he went to the defendant\u2019s apartment on three occasions to talk to him about the subject incident. On each occasion, the officer did not find the defendant at home and left his business card in the door with a note asking the defendant to call him. The defendant never contacted the officer. On cross-examination, the officer testified that he did not know whether the defendant had received the business cards, but he assumed that the defendant had received them and had chosen not to respond to his requests. The officer also testified that in his experience, the response rate for someone being investigated is very low.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">The defendant testified on his own behalf, but his direct testimony did not relate to the investigating officer or his business cards. The prosecutor did delve into the issue of the officer\u2019s business cards, however, on cross-examination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>Defense counsel objected to the questions concerning the officer\u2019s business cards as being outside the scope of direct examination. The trial court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">The prosecutor also asked the defendant a number of times whether he had been watching the victim and eavesdropping on her telephone conversations.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant testified that he saw the victim often because he lived next door. He also testified that a number of people had seen him talking to the victim prior to September 26, 1994, but that for a variety of reasons, none of the persons who saw him talking to the victim could come to trial to testify on his behalf.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>\u201c[0]ur review of a trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling is limited. Evidentiary rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice. <em>State </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>216 Conn. 301, 306, 579 A.2d 515 (1990). In considering whether the trial court abused its discretion, the unquestioned rule is that great weight is due to the action of the trial court and every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of its correctness .... <em>Jacobsen </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>177 Conn. 259, 263, 413 A.2d 854 (1979).\u201d (Internal quotations marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Nixon, </em>32 Conn. App. 224, 234, 630 A.2d 74 (1993), aff'd, 231 Conn. 545, 651 A.2d 1264 (1995). \u201cIt is well settled that the scope of cross-examination is limited to matters covered in the direct examination, except as they involve credibility. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ireland, </em>218 Conn. 447, 590 A.2d 106 (1991). \u2018The court has wide discretion to determine the scope of cross-examination.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>224 Conn. 196, 208, 618 A.2d 494 (1992).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Nixon, </em>supra, 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">\u201cWhen a witness voluntarily testifies, as did the defendant here, he asks the jury to believe him. The jury should be informed about the sort of person asking them to take his word. . . . Matters which might not be strictly relevant on direct examination may be so on cross-examination where that matter is explored for the purpose of credibility. Given that function of cross-examination in shedding light on the credibility of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>witness\u2019 direct testimony, [t]he test of relevancy is not whether the answer sought will elucidate any of the main issues, but whether it will to a useful extent aid the court or jury in appraising the credibility of the witness and assessing the probative value of the direct testimony. ... A question is within the scope of the direct examination if it is intended to rebut, impeach, modify or explain any of the defendant\u2019s direct testimony . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Hernandez, supra, 224 Conn. 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">The defendant relies on <em>State </em>v. <em>Zdanis, </em>173 Conn. 189, 195-96, 377 A.2d 275 (1977), for the proposition that while \u201ccredibility may be attacked by contradiction, so long as the matter is in issue ... it may not be attacked by first introducing one version of an event through a witness for the prosecution and then cross-examining the defendant, who has not testified as to that event on direct, thus creating a retroactive contradiction of his testimony. [B.] Jones on Evidence (6th Ed.) \u00a7 25.2, pp. 111-12.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">Here, the trial court properly exercised its discretion in permitting the prosecutor to cross-examine the defendant with respect to the officer\u2019s business cards and whether he had been watching the victim. The defendant testified on direct examination that his sexual encounter with the victim was consensual, which was contradictory to the testimony of the victim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>ultimate question before the jury was credibility. Therefore, the state was entitled to ask questions to rebut, impeach, modify or explain matters affecting credibility. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Zdanis, </em>supra, 173 Conn. 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">The questions concerning the officer\u2019s business cards were proper because they tended to rebut or impeach the defendant\u2019s claim of innocence by demonstrating that he may have avoided contact with the police after his encounter with the victim. The questions in regard to the defendant\u2019s watching the victim were appropriate in as much as the defendant admitted that he saw the victim often, that he knew her roommate had moved out and that only the victim and her child lived in the apartment. Clearly, there was evidence before the jury from which it could infer that the defendant was watching the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the trial court improperly charged the juiy with respect to the elements of \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (2) and the state\u2019s burden of proof. The defendant\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">The defendant did not submit a request to charge nor did he take exception to the charge given by the trial court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cWe generally do not consider a claimed error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>regarding the giving of or failure to give an instruction unless the matter is covered by a written request to charge or exception has been taken . . . immediately after the charge is delivered. ... In addition, the exception taken must state distinctly the matter objected to and the ground of objection.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>202 Conn. 349, 362, 521 A.2d 150 (1987). Therefore, the defendant seeks review of his unpreserved claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">In <em>Golding, </em>our Supreme Court held that \u201c \u2018a defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>243 Conn. 796, 817, 709 A.2d 522 (1998), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Dash, </em>242 Conn. 143, 151, 698 A.2d 297 (1997). \u201c \u2018An accused has a fundamental right, protected by the due process clauses of the federal and Connecticut constitutions, to be acquitted unless proven guilty of each element of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>[201 Conn. 505, 512, 523 A.2d 1252 (1986)], citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>U.S. Const., amend XIV; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8; see <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 362, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 213, 217, 479 A.2d 814 (1984).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 202 Conn. 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">\u201c \u2018It is well settled that a jury instruction is to be examined in its entirety, and that the test to be applied is whether the charge as a whole presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will be done. <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>181 Conn. 151, 170, 434 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1064, 101 S. Ct. 789, 66 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1980).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Lytell, </em>206 Conn. 657, 664, 539 A.2d 133 (1988); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Findlay, </em>198 Conn. 328, 346-47, 502 A.2d 921, cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1159, 106 S. Ct. 2279, 90 L. Ed. 2d 721 (1986).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>supra, 243 Conn. 818-19. On our review of the entire instruction, we determine that there was nothing improper about the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury. The defendant\u2019s claims here do not meet the second prong of <em>Golding </em>in that no constitutional violation exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">The defendant\u2019s first claim with respect to the charge is that although the trial court correctly defined the element of \u201cunlawfully entering or remaining,\u201d it did not fully inform the jury of the state\u2019s burden of proof with respect to this element. This claim is unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">\u201c \u2018It is the law of this state that a request to charge which is relevant to the issues of [a] case and which is an accurate statement of the law must be given. . . . It is, however, also the law of this state that a refusal to charge in the exact words of a request will not constitute error if the requested charge is given in substance.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Cooper, </em>182 Conn. 207, 211, 438 A.2d 418 (1980), quoting <em>Mazzucco </em>v. <em>Krall Coal &amp; Oil Co., </em>172 Conn. 355, 357, 374 A.2d 1047 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>Our review of the jury instructions reveals that the trial court instructed the jury no fewer than six times that the state had the burden of proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt, including a specific instruction that every element constituting the offense must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The charge also properly included an instruction on the meaning of reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">The defendant also claims that the trial court\u2019s charge failed to explain how a lawful entry may become an unlawful remaining. Our review of the record proves otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">The trial court first read the jury the statutory definition of \u201centers or remains unlawfully.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-100 (b),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which applies to \u00a7 53a-101 (a). The trial court then instructed the jury that \u201ceven if a person enters a building lawfully, that is, he had the right or had been given permission and the right had been terminated or the permission withdrawn by someone who had a right to terminate or withdraw permission, you may find that there was unlawful remaining on the premises as the basis of burglary.\u201d The trial court\u2019s instruction was sufficient to guide the jury and was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">The defendant\u2019s last claim with respect to the charge is that the trial court improperly defined the element \u201cbodily injury\u201d by using the statutory definition of \u201cphysical injury.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The substance of the defendant\u2019s claim is that bodily injury and physical injury are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>the same. Our holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>17 Conn. App. 391, 552 A.2d 837 (1989), is to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">\u201cIt is elementary jurisprudence that a jury charge is to be considered in its entirety and no part of it is to be critically dissected in order to find a technical inaccuracy in one portion, read in artificial isolation from the overall charge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jasper, </em>200 Conn. 30, 37, 508 A.2d 1387 (1986). \u2018Jury instructions need not be \u201cexhaustive, perfect or technically accurate,\u201d as long as they are \u201ccorrect in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury.\u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>11 Conn. App. 575, 580, 528 A.2d 855, cert. denied, 205 Conn. 804, 531 A.2d 938 (1987). Microscopic examination of a jury charge in an effort to find error has been consistently discountenanced by our courts. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mastropetre, </em>175 Conn. 512, 524, 400 A.2d 276 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>5 Conn. App. 599, 604, 502 A.2d 418 (1985), cert. denied, 199 Conn. 803, 506 A.2d 146 (1986).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>supra, 17 Conn. App. 394-95. We hold that the trial court\u2019s instructions were correct in law, adapted to the issues and provided sufficient guidance for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">The defendant next claims that the state did not produce sufficient evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he entered or remained unlawfully in the victim\u2019s apartment or that he had the requisite state of mind to commit burglary in the first degree. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a). These claims are also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">The following additional facts are necessary for our analysis. On the date in question, the victim came home at approximately 4:30 p.m. and did some household chores. She washed her kitchen floor with ammonia, opening the back door of the apartment to permit the ammonia fumes to escape. She then prepared supper, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>which she ate with her child. Between 6 and 7 p.m., the victim had an extended telephone conversation with a friend. At about 7 p.m., after she put her baby to bed, the victim washed laundry in the kitchen sink. The back door, which faced the defendant\u2019s apartment, was open the entire time. At approximately 8:30 p.m., the victim was standing at the sink when the defendant entered her apartment and introduced himself. The victim did not know why the defendant, whom she had seen once or twice in the neighborhood, had entered her apartment, and she thought that he was just a neighbor seeking to borrow something. The defendant walked over to the victim and said, \u201cI know you\u2019ve been hurt in the past.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He then began to rub the victim\u2019s shoulders and to kiss and lick her cheek. The victim tried to push the defendant away and said, \u201cNo,\u201d and \u201cNo. Stop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">\u201cOur courts utilize a two part analysis when reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hen-ning, </em>220 Conn. 417, 420, 599 A.2d 1065 (1991). \u2018We first review the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the guilty verdict.\u2019 Id. \u2018We then determine, upon the facts thus established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, whether any rational trier of fact could have concluded that the cumulative effect of the evidence established the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 Id. In the review process, the probative force of the evidence is not diminished if it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct. Id., 420-21. Findings of fact that are consistent with guilt are afforded great deference unless they are improbable and unconvincing. <em>State </em>v. <em>Osman, </em>218 Conn. 432, 437, 589 A.2d 1227 (1991).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Paredes, </em>35 Conn. App. 360, 372, 646 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>A.2d 234, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 925, 648 A.2d 166 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">The defendant claims that the evidence is insufficient to prove he entered the victim\u2019s apartment unlawfully because the victim did not scream or place an emergency telephone call when she first became aware of the defendant\u2019s presence in her apartment. The defendant also claims that he could not have remained unlawfully on the premises because he left when the victim asked him to go after her daughter began to cry. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">The jury reasonably could infer from the evidence that the defendant did not have permission to enter the victim\u2019s apartment and that even if the victim did not initially protest his presence, she certainly let him know that he did not have permission to remain when she called out, \u201cNo,\u201d and, \u201cStop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">A finding of fact by the jury must stand if it is reasonably supported by the evidence or the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>216 Conn. 367, 380, 579 A.2d 1066 (1990). The jury could have reasonably found that the victim did not consent to the defendant\u2019s entering, even though she left her door open and did not ask the defendant to leave. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gelormino, </em>24 Conn. App. 563, 571, 590 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 219 Conn. 911, 593 A.2d 136 (1991). Furthermore, consent to enter or to remain in another\u2019s private premises does not encompass consent to commit a crime therein. See id., 571-52. Here, the jurors, as the arbiters of truth; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>33 Conn. App. 763, 774, 638 A.2d 1084, cert. denied, 229 Conn. 913, 642 A.2d 1209 (1994); clearly could have inferred that the victim\u2019s telling the defendant, \u201cNo,\u201d and, \u201cStop,\u201d apprised the defendant of the fact that he did not have permission to remain in her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The defendant\u2019s second sufficiency claim is that the state\u2019s evidence does not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he \u201cintentionally, knowingly or recklessly inflictfed] or attempted] to inflict bodily injury\u201d on the victim. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">The gravamen of the defendant\u2019s claim is that he did not have the state of mind to cause injury to the victim\u2019s breasts because he did not know, nor could have known that because the victim was lactating, squeezing her breasts would result in physical injury or pain. The defendant misconstrues the law. \u201cShort of homicide, [sexual assault] is the ultimate violation of self. It is also a violent crime because it normally involves force, or the threat of force or intimidation, to overcome the will and the capacity of the victim to resist. [Sexual assault] is very often accompanied by physical injury to the [victim] . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Coleman, 41 Conn. App. 255, 274, 675 A.2d 887 (1996), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 242 Conn. 523, 700 A.2d 14 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Havican, </em>213 Conn. 593, 599 n.3, 569 A.2d 1089 (1990). Here, the victim testified that the defendant squeezed her breasts so hard that they hurt for a week. The evidence before the jury and the inferences to be drawn from it are sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">Finally, the defendant claims that he was denied due process and a fair trial pursuant to the fifth<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and fourteenth <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> amendments to the United States constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>and article first, \u00a7 8,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of the Connecticut constitution in that the prosecutor went beyond the bounds of propriety (1) during cross-examination (a) by employing a retroactive contradiction and (b) by asking questions about facts not in evidence, and (2) during final argument (a) by referring to missing witnesses, (b) by commenting on facts not in evidence, (c) by expressing a personal opinion about the credibility of the parties and (d) by appealing to the emotions, passions and prejudices of the jury.

Here, the jury well could have inferred from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>evidence that the defendant was watching the victim on the night in question, and we view the prosecutor\u2019s final argument as fair comment on the record.

The defendant properly points out that a prosecutor must seek and obtain an advance ruling from the trial court if he intends to argue to the jury that an unfavorable inference should be drawn from the absence of a defense witness at trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>180 Conn. 101, 113, 429 A.2d 813 (1980). A prosecutor\u2019s failure to secure the trial court\u2019s permission to refer to missing witnesses, however, fails to reach constitutional magnitude. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>239 Conn. 481, 490, 687 A.2d 489 (1996), cert. denied, 521 U.S. 1121, 117 S. Ct. 2515, 138 L.

The central issue in this case was one of credibility. The prosecutor\u2019s remarks were made for the purpose of drawing the jury\u2019s attention to the defendant\u2019s credibility. The state did not argue that the witnesses\u2019 testimony would have contradicted that of the defendant, but argued that contrary to the defendant\u2019s testimony, there were no witnesses who could testify. Therefore, the prosecutor\u2019s comments were appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">The defendant\u2019s third claim of prosecutorial impropriety during final argument concerns the prosecutor\u2019s statements about the defendant\u2019s having watched and stalked<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the victim, and listened in on her conversations. \u201c \u2018While the privilege of counsel in addressing the jury should not be too closely narrowed or unduly hampered, it must never be used as a license to state, or to comment upon, or to suggest an inference from, facts not in evidence, or to present matters which the jury have no right to consider.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrone, </em>[supra, 96 Conn. 169]. \u2018When a verdict is challenged on the basis of the prosecutor\u2019s allegedly prejudicial remarks, the defendant bears the burden of proving the remarks prejudicial in light of the whole trial.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>[supra, 10 Conn. App. 364].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 394-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">As we reasoned in this opinion in regard to the defendant\u2019s evidentiary claims, there was evidence presented through the defendant\u2019s own testimony that he had been watching the victim and that he was standing outside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>the door of the victim\u2019s apartment prior to entering the apartment. Therefore, it was proper for the prosecutor to draw the jury\u2019s attention to reasonable inferences to be drawn from the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The defendant\u2019s fourth claim of impropriety during the prosecutor\u2019s final argument alleges that the prosecutor commented on the credibility of the parties. It is axiomatic that \u201c \u2018[t]he prosecutor may not express his own opinion, either directly or indirectly, as to the credibility of witnesses. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Modica, </em>supra, [663 F.2d 1181]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Drummond, </em>481 F.2d 62 (2d Cir. 1973); <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>[supra, 10 Conn.

App. 396. Because the prosecutor\u2019s comments were directed to the inferences that could reasonably be drawn from the two very different versions of the incident before the jury, there was no misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">The defendant\u2019s last claim of misconduct on the part of the prosecutor is that the final argument appealed to the emotions, passions and prejudices of the jurors. As a rule, a prosecutor may not resort to such appeals. See id., 400. \u201c \u2018This does not mean that a prosecutor may not present arguments with logical force and vigor. See <em>Berger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>629, 79 L.

App. 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">As previously noted, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s final argument, and we also note that the trial court did not intervene to caution the prosecutor or to strike any of the prosecutor\u2019s comments. \u201cIn considering this claim, we must adhere to the principle that \u2018the action of the trial court is entitled to weight because of the vantage point from which it can observe and evaluate the circumstances of the trial. The trial court is in a better position to determine the propriety of the remarks of counsel and whether or not they are harmful. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ubaldi, </em>[190 Conn. 559, 563, 462 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 916, 104 S. Ct. 280, 78 L.

The court\u2019s instructions to the jury did, however, include a charge that the jury\u2019s verdict \u201cshould be based only on the evidence and that the statements of counsel during closing argument did not constitute evidence. Those instructions served to diminish the impact, if any, the remark[s] may have had on the jury. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Flinter, </em>16 Conn. App. 402, 410, 548 A.2d 1 [cert. denied, 209 Conn. 829, 552 A.2d 1216] (1988).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>supra, 395-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">In conclusion, we hold that the state\u2019s final argument did not so infect the trial with unfairness as to deny the defendant due process under either the federal or state constitutions and, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s claims of prosecutorial misconduct do not meet the third prong of <em>Golding. </em>Because we also find that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks did not impair the effectiveness or integrity of the judicial process, we similarly conclude that his claims are not reviewable under the plain error doctrine.

Drakeford, </em>202 Conn. 75, 81, 519 A.2d 1194 (1987). To rule otherwise would permit trial by ambuscade. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 311, 664 A.2d 743 (1995). An appellant cannot create a reviewable claim because his appellate counsel disagrees with the strategy of his trial counsel.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b850-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-100 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person \u2018enters or remains unlawfully\u2019 in or upon premises when the premises, at the time of such entry or remaining, are not open to the public and when the actor is not otherwise licensed or privileged to do so.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b850-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (3) provides: \u201c \u2018Physical injury\u2019 means impairment of physical condition or pain . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b852-7\"> The victim assumed that the defendant made the statement because he overheard the telephone conversation she had between 6 and 7 p.m. during which she discussed her father\u2019s having abused her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b854-10\"> The fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime . . . nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b854-11\"> The fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201c[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b855-8\"> Article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution provides in relevant pait: \u201cNo person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b855-9\"> The defendant has also requested that his claims of prosecutorial misconduct be reviewed under the second \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d of <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 71-73, 327 A.2d 576 (1973).
