The commissioner submitted the arresting officer\u2019s form A-44 report of the arrest and the times and results of the chemical blood alcohol content (BAC) tests administered to the plaintiff. The two breath tests administered by the arresting officer demonstrated a BAC of 0.148 percent on each, which were in excess of the 0.10 percent BAC set out in \u00a7 14-227a (a). The plaintiff submitted a letter from James E. O\u2019Brien, a toxicologist, to the plaintiffs attorney.* *<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On that date, the hearing officer rendered his decision affirming the one year suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Thereafter, the plaintiff appealed the commissioner\u2019s decision of suspension to the Superior Court. The court pointed out that the sole basis of the appeal was that there was insufficient evidence to support the hearing officer\u2019s decision that the plaintiffs BAC at the time of operation exceeded the legal level. The plaintiff claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>that the O\u2019Brien letter legally rebutted the inference permitted by \u00a7 14-227b (f), which meant, he argued, that the commissioner was required to provide additional evidence that would extrapolate the test results back to the time of operation. In rejecting the plaintiffs claim, the trial court referred to two recent cases of this court to support its position. Those cases were <em>State </em>v. <em>Nokes, </em>42 Conn. App. 10, 678 A.2d 510, remanded for reconsideration, 239 Conn. 926, 683 A.2d 22, on remand, 44 Conn. App. 40, 686 A.2d 999 (1996), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Korhn, </em>41 Conn. App. 874, 678 A.2d 492, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 910, 682 A.2d 1010 (1996). The trial court pointed out that both cases involved \u00a7 14-227a, which contains provisions that are \u201cessentially identical\u201d to those in \u00a7 14-227b, and held in effect that the statute creates only a permissive presumption or inference. The trial court also stated that these decisions established that the jury may draw the inferences, despite expert evidence to the contrary, provided that the jury finds the predicate facts to be true and disbelieves the contrary evidence. The court decided that this analysis also applied to an administrative proceeding under \u00a7 14-227b. Accordingly, the trial court reasoned, a hearing officer may rely on the statutory presumption and infer that the plaintiffs BAC had exceeded the legal BAC level at the time of operation, provided that there was substantial evidence to provide the predicate facts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It also meant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>that if there was contrary expert evidence before the hearing officer, the hearing officer was free to believe or disbelieve that evidence. The trial court also decided that no additional expert evidence was required to rebut the plaintiffs expert evidence in such a case. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">On appeal to this court, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly (1) held that the presumption created by \u00a7 14-227b could withstand \u201cuncontroverted expert testimony that it was not possible with reasonable scientific certainty to determine [the] alcohol level [in the blood] at the time of operation,\u201d and (2) dismissed his appeal after the hearing officer arbitrarily and capriciously had ignored the evidence of his expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The plaintiff correctly acknowledges that under \u00a7 14-227b (f), \u201c[i]n the [administrative] hearing, the results of the test or analysis shall be sufficient to indicate the ratio of alcohol in the blood of such person ... at the time of operation. . . .\u201d He points out that in providing that the BAC test results \u201cshall be sufficient,\u201d the legislature created a \u201crebuttable presumption\u201d that the test results can be used in place of direct evidence to prove the BAC at the time of operation and that the presumed fact is that the driver had a BAC equal to or more than 0.10 percent. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Relying on the letter from his expert, O\u2019Brien, the plaintiff contends that he has rebutted the \u201crational connection\u201d between the test results and the presumption that his BAC at the time of operation can be determined from them. He depends heavily on O\u2019Brien\u2019s letter and argues that it \u201cstated in essence that because of the flat readings . . . \u2018there is no extrapolation factor nor any other rehable means to determine [the plaintiffs] alcohol level at the time of operation. Also, for similar reasons it is impossible to state with reasonable scientific certainty that [the plaintiffs] alcohol level was</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>at or above 0.1 percent at the time in question (0150 hours).\u2019 \u201d This uncontradicted expert evidence, the plaintiff claims, makes the statutory presumption disappear from the case. It effectively \u201cannuls\u201d the claimed connection between the basic fact, i.e., the test results, and the presumed fact, i.e., that his BAC at the time of operation was 0.10 percent or greater. In effect, the plaintiff argues that his expert evidence in O\u2019Brien\u2019s letter rebuts the presumption created by \u00a7 14-227b and shifts the burden of proof to the commissioner who, in turn, did not sustain that burden. The plaintiff ultimately claims that because the commissioner did not produce more evidence on the BAC level at the time of operation, the plaintiff must be found to have rebutted the statutory presumption with substantial countervailing evidence and his license should not have been suspended.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s other claim is that suspension of his license was improper because the hearing officer \u201carbitrarily and capriciously ignored or disregarded the evidence of his expert witness.\u201d In advancing this claim, he contends that in a \u00a7 14-227b hearing, the hearing officer acts as the fact finder and has a responsibility different from that of a jury in a criminal case. To support this position, he maintains that this distinction is mandated by the relevant departmental regulation, \u00a7 14-227b-20 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Stressing subsection (b) of that regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>as highlighting the different responsibility of the hearing officer from that of a jury, the plaintiff argues that the trial court improperly affirmed the hearing officer\u2019s decision where the hearing officer had disregarded the only expert testimony<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> produced at the hearing. The plaintiff argues, quoting <em>Tanner </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>15 Conn. App. 336, 341, 544 A.2d 258 (1988), that while an administrative agency is not required \u201cto believe any of the witnesses, including expert witnesses ... it must not disregard the only expert evidence available on the issue when the commission members lack their own expertise or knowledge [on a specific issue].\u201d (Citation omitted.) The plaintiff contends that it was not legal for the hearing officer to rely on his own special or expert knowledge, if he had any, concerning the issue of the BAC level. If the hearing officer intended to do that, <em>then Feinson </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>180 Conn. 421, 428-29, 429 A.2d 910 (1980), required that he so notify the plaintiff in a timely fashion. Because the hearing officer made no reference to the O\u2019Brien letter in his decision, the plaintiff argues that the hearing officer acted in a manner that was \u201carbitrary, capricious, illegal and an abuse of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The commissioner counters that in an appeal under the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq., judicial review is very limited, and the plaintiff has the burden of demonstrating that the hearing officer has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of his discretion. This review, the commissioner argues, prohibits the reviewing court from retrying the case, reassessing credibility, determining factual issues within the province of the administrative agency or substituting its judgment for that of the agency. In this case, he argues, the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>of the healing officer must be affirmed because there is substantial evidence to support his decision. The commissioner also argues that the <em>Nokes </em>and <em>Korhn </em>decisions cannot be distinguished as the plaintiff claims. In the decisional context, he also argues that <em>Ramisk </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>45 Conn. App. 924, 696 A.2d 1325, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 923, 701 A.2d 343 (1997), is on \u201call fours\u201d with this case. With reference to the O\u2019Brien letter, he claims that the hearing officer had the right to believe or disbelieve it, in whole or in part, even though it was the only expert evidence before him.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He argues that the hearing officer did not believe the O\u2019Brien letter. The commissioner argues that the statutory presumption that the plaintiffs BAC<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was in excess of the 0.10 percent level at the time of operation was not rebutted and, therefore, the Superior Court correctly sustained the decision of the hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u201c [J] udicial review of the commissioner\u2019s action is governed by the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act [\u00a7\u00a7 4-166 through 4-189], and the scope of that review is very restricted.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>47 Conn.

Ed. 2d 1066 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\u201cThe substantial evidence rule governs judicial review of administrative [fact-finding] under General Statutes [\u00a7 4-183 (j)]. <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>203 Conn. 525, 539-41, 525 A.2d 940 (1987); <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>[supra, 171 Conn. 713-14]. An administrative finding is supported by substantial evidence if the record affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred. <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>supra, 541, quoting <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, 713. Such a standard of review allows less room for judicial scrutiny than does the weight of the evidence rule or the clearly erroneous rule. <em>Huck </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Agency, </em>supra [541], In determining whether an administrative finding is supported by substantial evidence, a court must defer to the agency\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and to the agency\u2019s right to believe or disbelieve the evidence presented by any witness, even an expert, in whole or in part.

The plaintiff misconstrues the nature of the statutory rebuttable presumption as set out in \u00a7 14-227a (c). A \u201crebuttable presumption\u201d is defined as a \u201cpermissive inference.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Korhn, </em>supra, 41 Conn. App. 880-82. In <em>Korhn, </em>we said: \u201cOur Supreme Court has stated that [a] permissive inference suggests to the jury a possible conclusion to be drawn if the state proves predicate facts, but does not require the jury to draw that conclusion. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Amarillo, </em>198 Conn. 285, 302, 503 A.2d 146 (1986). An entirely permissive inference or presumption, which allows\u2014 but does not require\u2014the trier of fact to infer the elemental fact from the proof by the prosecutor of the basic one and that places no burden of any kind on the defendant . . . [does not violate due process unless] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>there is no rational way the trier could make the connection permitted by the inference. <em>Ulster County Court </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>[442 U.S. 140, 157, 99 S.

The test readings in this case do not trigger the exception set out in that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The plaintiff also claims that the hearing officer disregarded the O\u2019Brien letter and that \u201cit was not legal for [him] to rely on his own special or expert knowledge, if any, regarding the issue of BAC level.\u201d In addition, the plaintiff argues that if the hearing officer \u201cintended to use his special or expert knowledge, he was required to notify the plaintiff of that fact in a timely manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">To claim, as the plaintiff does, that the hearing officer disregarded the O\u2019Brien letter and, in effect, relied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>his \u201cown special or expert knowledge\u201d is to attribute to him a failure to perform his duty. See <em>Balch Pontiac-Buick, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>165 Conn. 559, 564, 345 A.2d 520 (1973). The hearing officer<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> who heard the matter and decided to uphold the suspension of the plaintiffs motor vehicle operator\u2019s license was a \u201cpublic officer\u201d and acted in this matter as a statutory designee of the defendant commissioner, having been appointed by him. See General Statutes \u00a7 14-4a.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As a public officer, the hearing officer is presumed to have acted legally and properly until the contrary appears. <em>Brookfield </em>v. <em>Candlewood Shores Estates, Inc., </em>201 Conn. 1, 6, 513 A.2d 1218 (1986); <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>198 Conn. 229, 242, 502 A.2d 410 (1985); <em>Balch Pontiac-Buick, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra, 568; <em>Imbrogno </em>v. <em>Stamford Hospital, </em>28 Conn.

We are entitled to presume that the hearing officer considered <em>all </em>the evidence before him in arriving at his decision, which was limited by statute to a determination of four specific issues. See General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The plaintiff has not shown that the hearing officer \u201crelied on his own special or expert knowledge\u201d for two reasons. First, as noted, the plaintiff has not demonstrated that the hearing officer disregarded the O\u2019Brien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>letter. Second, the plaintiffs reliance on <em>Feinson </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 180 Conn. 429, and <em>Tanner </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 15 Conn. App. 340,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> is inapposite here. In both of those cases, the appellate courts reversed the decisions of the conservation commissions involved where their decisions were contrary to the unrebutted expert testimony. Since <em>Feinson </em>and <em>Tanner, </em>however, our appellate courts have handed down decisions that point out that the trier of fact is not required to believe unrebutted expert testimony, but may believe all, part or none of such unrebutted expert evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Blades, </em>225 Conn. 609, 625, 626 A.2d 273 (1993), the defendant, charged with murder, presented the testimony of aboard certified psychiatrist in support of his affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance. The state did not introduce any expert evidence to refute the defendant\u2019s claim as to that defense. The defendant was found guilty of murder. On appeal, the defendant claimed that because the state did not present its own expert evidence to rebut this defense, the trial court<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> was required to accept his evidence and to find that the defendant had sustained his burden of proof on that defense. Id., 627. In rejecting this claim, our Supreme Court said: \u201cDespite the defendant\u2019s contention to the contrary, the trial court is not required to accept uncontradicted expert testimony. The court might reject it entirely as not worthy of belief or find that the opinion was based on subordinate facts that were not proven.\u201d Id., 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">In <em>Pickles </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>supra, 38 Conn. App. 325, this court, quoting with approval from <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 217, said: \u201cIn determining whether an administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>finding is supported by substantial evidence, a court must defer to the [commissioner\u2019s] . . . right to believe or disbelieve the evidence presented by any witness, even an expert, in whole or in part.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\"><em>State </em>v. <em>Nokes, </em>supra, 42 Conn. App. 10, was a case tried to a jury in which the defendant was charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor and in which the rebuttable presumption of \u00a7 14-227a (c) was involved. In that case, only the defendant offered expert testimony, which the trial court told the jury to consider on the issue of whether it rebutted the statutory presumption that would otherwise exist. The jury chose not to credit that expert testimony and it returned a verdict of guilty. On appeal, drawing on <em>State </em>v. <em>Korhn, </em>supra, 41 Conn. App. 874, in which the jury instructions were \u201cvery similar\u201d to those in <em>Nokes, </em>we affirmed.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Nokes, </em>supra, 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Quite similar to the case now before us is that of <em>Ramisk </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>supra, 45 Conn. App. 924. In that case, the plaintiff appealed from the defendant commissioner\u2019s suspension of his motor vehicle operator\u2019s license pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b because the plaintiff had failed the chemical test of his BAC. He argued on his appeal that there was insufficient evidence in the record to support the hearing officer\u2019s determination that at the time of operation, his BAC exceeded the legal level under the statute. Specifically, the plaintiff argued that the letter of his expert, which was in evidence at the administrative hearing, legally rebutted the presumption created by \u00a7 14-227b and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>shifted the burden of proof to the commissioner. That meant, according to the plaintiff, that the commissioner was required to adduce additional evidence that would extrapolate the chemical test results back to the time of operation. The <em>Ramisk </em>trial court rejected these claims. In doing so, it cited both <em>Nokes </em>and <em>Korhn </em>for the proposition that the presumption was \u201csufficient to withstand expert evidence to the contrary and support a conviction without further evidence, if the jury disbelieves the contrary evidence.\u201d <em>Ramisk </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. CV 96-0558492 (July 11, 1996). The <em>Ramisk </em>trial court held that this principle applied equally to an administrative hearing under \u00a7 14-227b, saying that \u201c[a] hearing officer may rely on the presumption created by the statute if he or she disbelieves expert evidence to the contrary. Additional expert evidence to rebut the plaintiffs evidence is not required in such a case.\u201d Id.

According to the documents, Mr. Bancroft was stopped at 0150 hours, and Intox\u00fcyzer 5000 tests were performed at 0336 and 0410 hours. The results of these tests were 0.148% on both occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">\u201cIn regard to your inquiry as to Mr. Bancroft\u2019s blood alcohol level at the time of operation, this cannot be established. This is based on the fact that the values obtained on the two tests performed 34 minutes apart are identical. One would expect the alcohol level, because of metabolism, to have decreased 0.010% (average decrease is 0.018%) during this interval. These identical values could only have been obtained if Mr. Bancroft was absorbing alcohol from his stomach at least to a point between the two tests. Since there is no doubt that Mr. Bancroft was absorbing alcohol in the time between tests, there is no question that he was also absorbing alcohol from the time of the stop to the time of the first test. In such situations, there is no extrapolation factor nor any other reliable means to determine Mr. Bancroft\u2019s alcohol level at the time of operation. Also, for similar reasons it is impossible to state with reasonable scientific certainty that Mr. Bancroft\u2019s alcohol level was at or above 0.1 percent at the time in question (0150 hours).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b423-6\"> Section 14-227b provides an exception to the presumption that demonstrates an implicit understanding that in limited circumstances, not present here, the mere presence of a BAC of over 0.10 percent is not sufficient to infer a BAC of over 0.10 percent while operating the motor vehicle.

Vermont\u2019s administrative per se suspension statute contained a presumption that stated, \u201c[I]f there was at any time within two hours of operating, attempting to operate or being in actual physical control of a vehicle an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more, it shall be a rebuttal presumption that there was 0.10 percent or more by weight of alcohol in the blood at the time of operating, attempting to operate or being in actual physical control.\u201d Id., 453. In that case, the defendant was arrested on November 10, 1990, at approximately 1:10 a.m., and a chemical breath test conducted at 2:40 a.m. disclosed that his BAC was 0.15 percent. At the civil license suspension hearing, the defendant introduced an affidavit from a chemist. That chemist testified that \u201cit is possible for a person to have a test result over .10 percent within 2 hours of operation and be under .10 percent at the time of operation.\u201d Id., 452. The trial court held that the chemist\u2019s affidavit rebutted the statutory presumption that the defendant\u2019s BAC was over 0.10 percent at the time of operation. It further held that even with that, the state still could have prevailed had it introduced evidence that related the test back to the time of operation. The state, however, not having done so, failed to show that there was a rational connection between a test result of 0.15 percent BAC one hour and thirty minutes after operation and a BAC of 0.10 percent at the time of operation. The trial court then found for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">The Vermont Supreme Court reversed on appeal. In doing so it said: \u201cUnder Vermont law, a civil presumption effectively places the burden of going forward with the evidence on the party against whom it operates. <em>Rocque </em>v. <em>Co-operative Fire Ins. Assn, of Vermont, </em>140 Vt. 321, 325-26, 438 A.2d 383, 386 (1981); V.R.E. 301(a). Thus, the defendant had to present evidence to rebut the presumed fact that his level of intoxication violated the statute. See 9 Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 2494, at 379 (Chadboum rev. 1981) .... To satisfy that burden, defendant was not required to \u2018overcome\u2019 the presumption with evidence. <em>Tyrrell </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of America, </em>109 Vt. 6, 23-24, 192 A. 184, 192 (1937); <em>Rocque, </em>140 Vt. at 326, 438 A.2d at 386. He was required only to produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that his blood alcohol level was under 0.10 percent at the time of operation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>See <em>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. of Maryland </em>v. <em>Wu, </em>150 Vt. 225, 228, 552 A.2d 1196, 1198 (1988) ....</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">\u201cTo rebut a statutory presumption the opponent\u2019s evidence must do more than raise a mere theoretical possibility that the presumed fact does not exist. See <em>Insurance Co. of North America </em>v. <em>Millers\u2019 Mutual Ins. Assn, of Illinois, </em>139 Vt. 255, 258, 427 A.2d 354, 355 (1981) .... Otherwise, the use of a presumption to shift the burden of going forward with certain evidence would be meaningless. Since a rebuttable presumption already assumes that the presumed fact will not be true in all cases, it is not rebutted simply by recognizing the possibility that it can be rebutted. To fairly put the presumed fact in issue, specific evidence is required to show that the presumed fact was not true in the particular case, given its actual underlying facts and circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">\u201cIn the instant case, defendant\u2019s evidence was insufficient to defeat the statutory presumption that a person is intoxicated at the time of operation if his BAC within two hours of operation is .10 percent or more. The trial court erred in concluding that evidence of a general, theoretical nature was sufficient to rebut 23 V.S.A. \u00a7 1205(m)\u2019s presumption. . . . Such a holding defeats the obvious purpose of the statute, which is to shift the burden of submitting relation-back evidence to the party most able to provide it.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pluta, </em>supra, 157 Vt. 453-55.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b432-7\"> Section 14-227b-17 (a) of the Regulations of State Agencies provides in relevant part: \u201cThe hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer appointed by the commissioner pursuant to Section 14-4a of the General Statutes, and shall be limited to a determination of the issues stated in subsection (f) of Section 14-227b of the General Statutes, as amended by Section 1 of P.A. 89-314. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b432-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-4a, titled, \u201cConduct of hearings and rendering of decisions,\u201d provides: \u201cIn any case where a hearing is required or authorized under the provisions of any statute dealing with the Department of Motor Vehicles such hearing may be conducted by and the decision rendered therein by the commissioner or by anypersonorpersons designated by him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b433-8\"> Neither <em>Feinson </em>nor <em>Tanner </em>involved the use of a statutory presumption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"Aeh\"> The <em>Blades </em>trial was conducted before and decided by a three judge court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b434-8\"> Our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Nokes, </em>supra, 42 Conn.
