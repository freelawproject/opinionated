Part of the stairway had been removed by the defendant Stanton Johnson. The judgment further prohibited the defendants from engaging in any activities that would interfere with the plaintiffs\u2019 rights to use a driveway and stairway and to park cars in an area adjacent to the stairway. The defendants claim that the trial court improperly (1) determined that the plaintiffs established an easement by prescription over their property, and (2) awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiffs. We agree that the trial court improperly awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiffs and, therefore, reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The plaintiffs brought this action seeking injunctive relief (1) forbidding the defendants from interfering with the plaintiffs\u2019 use of a driveway and stairway located on the defendants\u2019 property, (2) requiring the defendants to remove all obstructions from the driveway and stairway, and (3) requiring the defendants to restore the portion of the stairway that was removed by Stanton Johnson. The plaintiffs also sought damages and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">The parties own abutting properties in the Stevenson section of Monroe. In 1958, the plaintiff Atkins purchased the parcel located at 52 Downs Road, also known as 46 Mooseup Trail. From the time that Atkins purchased the property, he used a parking area and stairway, located on property now owned by the defendants, to gain access to his property. In addition, in 1963, Atkins began using a driveway, located on property now owned by the defendants, to gain access to his property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>On July 13,1995, the defendant Stanton Johnson erected a chain and a fence across the driveway, blocking ingress and egress to the plaintiffs\u2019 property by vehicle. On July 16,1995, Johnson removed the upper stairs and a landing from the stairway leading to the plaintiffs\u2019 property and placed a fence across the stairway. On September 13, 1995, Johnson installed five concrete Jersey barriers across the driveway and a sidewalk, blocking all access to the plaintiffs\u2019 property from the driveway and stairway.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">In addition to hearing testimony and admitting exhibits, the trial court viewed the properties. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court stated: \u201cIt would be difficult for the court, which has viewed the locale, to describe the terrain, and even more difficult for anyone reading such description to obtain an accurate picture of the scene. Suffice it to say, based on the court\u2019s view, the testimony and a stipulation of facts, the court finds that the plaintiffs have used the drive and stairs in question for more than fifteen years in a continuous, hostile, open and adverse manner, without permission from either the defendants or their predecessors in title. The plaintiffs\u2019 rights had fully accrued before any attempt to block [their] use [was] employed. See [General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7] 52-575 and 47-38. The defendants offered no testimony to counteract the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. \u201d There were no motions filed to correct, articulate or rectify the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">The defendants do not agree that the plaintiffs established an easement by prescription over their property. While the defendants do not agree with the trial court\u2019s finding that the plaintiffs\u2019 use continued for more than fifteen years in a hostile, open and adverse manner, without permission from either the defendants or their predecessors in title, they claim that finding is irrelevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>since the plaintiffs\u2019 use was not made under a claim of right. The defendants\u2019 basic argument is that the plaintiffs did not demonstrate that their use was made under a claim of right and, further, that the trial court made no such finding. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The plaintiffs had the burden of proving a prescriptive right to use the defendants\u2019 property. See <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Gavitt, </em>89 Conn. 359, 363, 94 A. 360 (1915). To sustain their burden, the plaintiffs were required to establish that their use of the defendants\u2019 property was open, visible, continuous and uninterrupted for fifteen years and made under a claim of right. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Soffer, </em>190 Conn. 184, 187, 459 A.2d 1027 (1983). Whether these requirements have been met in a particular case presents a question of fact for the trier of facts. <em>Swenson </em>v. <em>Dittner, </em>183 Conn. 289, 294, 439 A.2d 334 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">\u201cUse under a claim of right simply means without recognition of the rights of the owner of the servient tenement. <em>Putnam, Coffin &amp; Burr, Inc. </em>v. <em>Halpern, </em>154 Conn. 507, 515, 227 A.2d 83 (1967).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Saunders Point Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Cannon, </em>177 Conn. 413, 419, 418 A.2d 70 (1979). The record indicates that the trial court heard testimony that the plaintiff Atkins believed that the driveway was his because he improved it for use and it was the only way to gain access to his property. Furthermore, the plaintiffs never asked the defendants or their predecessors for permission to use the defendants\u2019 property, and their use was in the presence of the defendants and their predecessors. See id., 419-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The trial court specifically found the plaintiffs\u2019 use to be adverse and without permission from either the defendants or their predecessors. This finding is supported by the evidence and by the reasonable inferences drawn from the facts proven. <em>Leabo </em>v. <em>Leninski, </em>182 Conn. 611, 615-16, 438 A.2d 1153 (1981). Furthermore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>because there was no evidence in this case that either the driveway or the stairway was ever used as a right-of-way by the general public, the plaintiffs were not required to \u201cperform some act to the knowledge of the [defendants or their predecessors] clearly indicating [their] individual claim of right.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Robert S. Weiss &amp; Co. </em>v. Mullins, 196 Conn. 614, 619-20, 495 A.2d 1006 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">After a review of the record, including the transcript and exhibits, we cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding of a prescriptive easement in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor was clearly erroneous. The evidence adduced at trial amply supports the court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs satisfied the requirements to acquire a prescriptive easement over the defendants\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The defendants\u2019 claim that the trial court did not specifically find that the plaintiffs\u2019 use of the defendants\u2019 property was made under a claim of right is without merit. \u201cTo acquire an easement by prescription, the use of the property must be adverse. General Statutes \u00a7 47-37; <em>Westchester </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>227 Conn. 495, 501, 629 A.2d 1084 (1993). In order to prove adverse use, the party claiming to have acquired the easement must demonstrate that the use of the property has been open, visible, continuous and uninterrupted for fifteen years <em>and made under a claim of right.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stiefel v. Lindemann, </em>33 Conn. App. 799, 810, 638 A.2d 642, cert. denied, 229 Conn. 914, 642 A.2d 1211 (1994). \u201cAll that is required is a showing by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the use was adverse.\u201d <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Soffer, </em>supra, 190 Conn. 188. The trial court found that the plaintiffs\u2019 use of the defendants\u2019 property was adverse and, therefore, by necessity, found that it was made under a claim of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The defendants next claim that the trial court improperly awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiffs. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">On January 7, 1997, the trial court rendered judgment granting injunctive relief to the plaintiffs. In addition, the trial court scheduled a separate hearing to decide the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for damages and attorney\u2019s fees. On February 21, 1997, the plaintiffs sought permission to amend their complaint to include a claim for punitive damages based on the defendant Stanton Johnson\u2019s \u201cintentional, outrageous and wanton\u201d conduct. On March 19,1997, the trial court filed its second memorandum of decision granting the plaintiffs\u2019 request to amend their complaint and awarding \u201ca reasonable fee for the services of counsel\u201d in the amount of $2000. The court also stated that \u201c[a]ny further claims for damages [based on] mental anguish and distress are denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">\u201c \u2018[T]he general rule of law known as the \u201cAmerican rule\u201d is that attorney\u2019s fees and ordinary expenses and burdens of litigation are not allowed to the successful party absent a contractual or statutory exception. See <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. </em>v. <em>Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 247, 95 S. Ct. 1612, 44 L. Ed. 2d 141 (1975); <em>Fleischmann Distilling Corporation v. Maier Brewing Co., </em>386 U.S. 714, 717, 87 S. Ct. 1404, 18 L. Ed. 2d 475 (1967). . . . Connecticut adheres to the American rule.\u2019 <em>Marsh Day &amp; Calhoun v. Solomon, </em>204 Conn. 639, 652, 529 A.2d 702 (1987).\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Chrysler Corp. </em>v. <em>Maiocco, </em>209 Conn. 579, 590, 552 A.2d 1207 (1989); see <em>O\u2019Leary s. Industrial Park Corp., </em>211 Conn. 648, 651, 560 A.2d 968 (1989). \u201cAttorney\u2019s fees may be awarded, however, as a component of punitive damages.\u201d <em>Farrell v. Farrell, </em>36 Conn. App. 305, 311, 650 A.2d 608 (1994). In the present case, the trial court did not make any findings regarding the defendant Stanton Johnson\u2019s wanton, wilful or outrageous conduct and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>did not award punitive damages. Because the trial court did not award punitive damages and there is neither contractual nor statutory authorization for the award of attorney\u2019s fees, we must vacate that portion of the judgment requiring the defendants to pay the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The judgment is reversed in part and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment as on file except as modified to eliminate the ordered payment of attorney\u2019s fees by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
