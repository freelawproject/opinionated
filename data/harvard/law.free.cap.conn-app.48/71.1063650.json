Pursuant to the consent order, the defendant was (1) placed on probation for a period of four years, (2) required to undergo a psychiatric evaluation at his own expense and (3) required to pay a civil penalty of $1000. The conditions of the defendant\u2019s probation specify that the defendant may not provide care to any patient who has restricted sensory perception, moderate to severe cognitive impairments or who is unable to communicate either verbally, in writing, by sign, computer or letter board modality, except in the presence of another licensed practitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">On February 14, 1997, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the criminal char ges, claiming that the conditions to which he had agreed under the consent order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>constituted \u201cpunishment\u201d for his alleged conduct and, therefore, he could not be prosecuted on the basis of the same conduct. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court held that the administrative sanctions imposed under the consent order served a legitimate remedial purpose and were rationally related to that purpose. The trial court also concluded that the fine imposed, which was far below the maximum fine that could have been imposed, was primarily compensatory and remedial, rather than punitive, hi denying the defendant\u2019s motion, the trial court held that because the administrative sanctions imposed served compensatory and remedial purposes and were not intended to punish the defendant, the continued criminal prosecution would not violate his double jeopardy protections. We agree that the continued criminal prosecution and punishment of the defendant would not violate the double jeopardy protections of the United States and Connecticut constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">The defendant claims that his constitutional rights under the fifth<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and fourteenth<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> amendments to the United States constitution would be violated if the state is allowed to prosecute him criminally. The defendant\u2019s claim is predicated on the constitutional protection against multiple punishments for the same offense. <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S. Ct. 2072, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1969). \u201cBecause the issue of whether an administrative sanction constitutes punishment for purposes of double jeopardy is a question of law, [our] review [is] de novo.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tuchman, </em>242 Conn. 345, 350-51, 699 A.2d 952 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>It is well settled that Congress may impose both a criminal and a civil sanction with respect to the same act or omission. Whether a civil sanction may preclude a subsequent criminal prosecution depends on whether it was intended to be, or by its nature necessarily was, punitive or remedial. <em>United States </em>v. <em>One Assortment of 89 Firearms, </em>465 U.S. 354, 362, 104 S. Ct. 1099, 79 L. Ed. 2d 361 (1984). Among the factors that are indicative of whether a sanction is punitive or remedial in nature are whether (1) it involves an affirmative disability or restraint, (2) it has historically been regarded as a punishment, (3) it comes into play only on a finding of scienter, (4) its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment, i.e., retribution and deterrence, (5) the behavior to which it applies is already a crime, (6) an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and (7) it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned. <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Mendoza-Martinez, </em>372 U.S. 144, 168-69, 83 S. Ct. 554, 9 L. Ed. 2d 644 (1963). If the indication is that Congress intended the sanction to be remedial, then further inquiry is made to determine whether \u201cthe clearest proof\u2019 has been shown that the statutory scheme is so punitive as to negate that intention. <em>United States </em>v. <em>One Assortment of 89 Firearms, </em>supra, 365; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>448 U.S. 242, 249, 100 S. Ct. 2636, 65 L. Ed. 2d 742 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">In 1989, the United States Supreme Court held that the imposition of a civil penalty following a criminal prosecution constitutes multiple punishment for the same offense if the civil penalty \u201cbears no rational relation to the goal of compensating the Government for its loss, but rather appears to qualify as \u2018punishment\u2019 in the plain meaning of the word . . . .\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Halper, </em>490 U.S. 435, 449, 109 S. Ct. 1892, 104 L. Ed. 2d 487 (1989).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court subsequently rejected any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>notion that <em>Halper </em>stands for the proposition that a civil sanction must be deemed to be punitive unless it is \u201csolely remedial.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. Ursery, 518 U.S. 267, 284-85 n.2, 116 S. Ct. 2135, 135 L. Ed. 2d 549 (1996).* ***<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">On December 10, 1997, the court issued its decision in <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>522 U.S. 93, 118 S. Ct. 488, 138 L. Ed. 2d 549 (1997), in which it stated: \u201cOur opinion in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Halper </em>[supra, 490 U.S. 435] marked the first time we applied the Double Jeopardy Clause to a sanction without first determining that it was criminal in nature. . . . The analysis applied by the <em>Halper </em>Court deviated from our traditional double jeopardy doctrine in two key respects. First, the <em>Halper </em>Court bypassed the threshold question: whether the successive punishment at issue is a \u2018criminal\u2019 punishment. . . . The second significant departure in <em>Halper </em>was the Court\u2019s decision to \u2018asses[s] the character of the actual sanctions imposed\u2019 . . . rather than, as <em>Kennedy </em>[v. <em>Mendoza-Martinez, </em>supra, 372 U.S. 144] demanded, evaluating the \u2018statute on its face\u2019 to determine whether it provided for what amounted to a criminal sanction ....</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">\u201cWe believe that <em>Halper\u2019s </em>deviation from longstanding double jeopardy principles was ill considered. As subsequent cases have demonstrated, <em>Halper\u2019s </em>test for determining whether a particular sanction is \u2018punitive,\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>and thus subject to the strictures of the Double Jeopardy Clause, has proved unworkable. We have since recognized that all civil penalties have some deterrent effect. . . . If a sanction must be \u2018solely\u2019 remedial (i.e., entirely nondeterrent) to avoid implicating the Double Jeopardy Clause, then no civil penalties are beyond the scope of the Clause.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 100-102.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Applying traditional federal double jeopardy principles to the facts of the present case, we hold that the criminal prosecution of the defendant would not violate double jeopardy. It is evident that our legislature intended the administrative sanctions imposed on the defendant to be civil in nature. Furthermore, the sanctions serve a legitimate remedial purpose. The terms and conditions of the defendant\u2019s probation restrict his actions so as to protect other patients in situations similar to that of the alleged victim. In addition, the maximum fine that could have been imposed on the defendant is $10,000.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant, however, was fined $1000 and, while the consent order does not specifically state the basis for that amount, the legislative history of General Statutes \u00a7 19a-17 shows that subsection (a) (6), which permits the imposition of a fine, was intended to provide the department with flexibility in disciplining professional misconduct and that fines should be commensurate with the seriousness of the misconduct. Finally, because our legislature conferred the power to sanction on an administrative agency, we consider it prima facie evidence that the sanctions were intended to be civil rather than criminal in nature. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number><em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>303 U.S. 391, 402, 58 S. Ct. 630, 82 L. Ed. 917 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Turning to the second stage of the test as reestablished by <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 522 U.S. 93, we find that there is little, if any, evidence, let alone the required \u201cclearest proof,\u201d that the civil sanctions imposed on the defendant are so punitive in form and effect as to render them criminal despite our legislature\u2019s clear intent to the contrary. We note that the types of sanctions imposed in this case have not historically been viewed as punishment. In fact, the payment of money is a sanction that has \u201cbeen recognized as enforceable by civil [rather than criminal] proceedings since the original revenue law of 1789.\u201d <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>supra, 303 U.S. 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">We conclude, therefore, that under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, the civil sanctions imposed on the defendant were intended by our legislature to be civil in nature and that no evidence exists, let alone the clearest proof, that they are so punitive in form and effect as to render them criminal despite the legislative intent to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">The defendant also contends that his continued prosecution and punishment would violate the double jeopardy protection implied under article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and 9,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">The defendant contends that the double jeopardy protection provided by the Connecticut constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>exceeds that provided by the United States constitution as interpreted in <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 522 U.S. 93. The defendant recognizes that in <em>State </em>v. <em>Tuchman, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 360, our Supreme Court stated that \u201cthe absence of an explicit constitutional double jeopardy provision strongly suggests that the incorporated common law double jeopardy protection mirrors, rather than exceeds, the federal constitutional protection.\u201d The defendant argues, however, that <em>Tuchman </em>was addressing the state of affairs subsequent to <em>United States </em>v. <em>Halper, </em>supra, 490 U.S. 435, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Hicham, </em>235 Conn. 614, 668 A.2d 1321 (1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1221, 116 S. Ct. 1851, 134 L. Ed. 2d 951 (1996), \u201cand hence is not indicative as to whether Connecticut may in the future substantially reverse itself and adopt the <em>Hudson </em>approach.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">We do not agree with the defendant that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hudson </em>in any manner affects our Supreme Court\u2019s analysis and conclusion in <em>Tuchman </em>as to the double jeopardy protection afforded by our state constitution. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Tuchman, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 360-62, the absence of an explicit constitutional double jeopardy provision in our state constitution was merely one of six factors<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> relied on by our Supreme Court in rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim that our state constitution provides more expansive double jeopardy protection than does the federal constitution. While <em>Tuchman </em>set forth the law that \u201c[sanctions that are not exclusively remedial do not necessarily constitute punishment for state constitutional double jeopar dy purposes\u201d; id., 362; the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>therein makes it clear that our state constitution does not afford greater double jeopardy protection than does its federal counterpart.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u201cAs an intermediate appellate court, we must follow the precedent of our Supreme Court along the path which our considered reading of that precedent lays out for us.\u201d <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>13 Conn. App. 400, 409, 536 A.2d 995 (1988), aff'd, 209 Conn. 609, 553 A.2d 161 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-10\"> The defendant\u2019s motion was brought pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 815 (6) and (9).
