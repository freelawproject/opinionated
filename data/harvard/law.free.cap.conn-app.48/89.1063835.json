These consolidated appeals, which are identical, involve cases consolidated in the trial court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">On appeal, the plaintiffs, numerous tenants of commercial real estate and their respective insurance carriers, raise several claims, but only two of the claims are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>reviewable: (1) that the trial court improperly allowed an expert witness for the defendant owners\u2019 to testify beyond the scope of direct examination and to render an opinion not disclosed prior to trial; and (2) that the trial court failed to set aside the verdict, which the plaintiffs claim was against the evidence with respect to their nuisance count.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The plaintiffs conducted their various professions and businesses as tenants on the premises known as Flanders Plaza located at 15 Chesterfield Road in East Lyme, which is owned by the defendants Thomas J. Tucciarone, Michael J. DiProspero, Kaj Snellman and the Snellman Limited Partnership (owners). On September 30, 1988, a fire started in a light fixture on the second floor and spread throughout the premises, causing damage to the property and businesses of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">To recover the various losses they sustained, the plaintiffs sued several entities;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the owners, however, were the only defendants remaining at the time of trial. The two relevant complaints each contain two counts, one alleging numerous acts of negligence and carelessness against the owners with respect to the construction and maintenance of the premises, and one alleging that those acts or omissions also created a nuisance. The cases were tried to a jury in the late spring and early summer of 1996. After the jury answered interrogatories in favor of the owners and rendered defendants\u2019 verdicts in all cases, the plaintiffs moved to set aside the verdicts and for a new trial. The trial court denied the motions and rendered judgments in favor of the owners. These appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 first claim concerns the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. \u201cIt is a well established principle of law that the trial court may exercise its discretion with regard to evidentiary rulings, and the trial court\u2019s rulings will not be disturbed on appellate review absent abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>213 Conn. 446, 451, 569 A.2d 10 (1990). \u201cSound discretion, by definition, means a discretion that is not exercised arbitrarily or wilfully, but with regard to what is right and equitable under the circumstances and the law .... And [it] requires a knowledge and understanding of the material circumstances surrounding the matter .... <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>195 Conn. 1, 8, 485 A.2d 570 (1985).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>supra, 455. \u201cIn our review of these discretionary determinations, we make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling. <em>State </em>v. <em>Weidenhof, </em>205 Conn. 262, 278, 533 A.2d 545 (1987).\u201d <em>Curry </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>33 Conn. App. 65, 69, 633 A.2d 315 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 claim concerns the testimony of the owners\u2019 expert witness, Beth Anderson, an electrical engineer, who was called to render her opinion as to the cause of the subject fire. Anderson\u2019s deposition was taken on numerous days prior to trial. In their briefs and at oral argument, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Anderson\u2019s trial testimony was inconsistent with her deposition testimony and the owners\u2019 expert witness disclosure made pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 220 (D).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The record reveals, however, that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is really an evidentiary one.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>The owners, pursuant to \u00a7 220 (D), disclosed Anderson as an expert witness on April 3, 1991, stating, \u201cAnderson will testily with respect to the facts and circumstances of the fire on September 30, 1988 . . . leading [to] her conclusion that the fire was caused within a fluorescent light fixture. . . .\u2019\u2019The owners supplemented their disclosure on April 10, 1996, stating, \u201cBeth Anderson will offer expert opinions, substantially in conformity with her deposition testimony, rendered on October 30, 1995, October 31, 1995, November 1, 1995, and December 18, 1995, as supplemented by the information and opinions set forth in the attached letter, of even date.\u201d In the subject letter, Anderson stated that the fire was due to a defect in the light ballast. Anderson made no mention of insulation in her letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Anderson testified on behalf of the owners at trial. On direct examination, defense counsel asked Anderson if she had an opinion about whether there was insulation on top of the light fixture.1 **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiffs did not object to the question or testimony at the time it was given. On cross-examination, however, the plaintiffs sought to impeach the credibility of Anderson with a prior inconsistent statement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On redirect, counsel for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>owners attempted to rehabilitate Anderson.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiffs objected to the questioning as being outside the scope of prior examination.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court heard the arguments of counsel and overruled the objection.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We agree with the trial court and find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Direct examination is conducted by the party who calls a witness, and is limited to the substantive facts of the case and then is followed by cross-examination, if any. See C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7\u00a7 3.4.2, 3.4.3, pp. 43^8. \u201cWhile it is settled Connecticut law that inquiry upon cross-examination is limited by the scope of the direct examination; <em>Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Dacey, </em>154 Conn. 129, 150, 222 A.2d 339 (1966), appeal dismissed, 386 U.S. 683, 87 S. Ct. 1325, 18 L. Ed. 2d 404, reh. denied, 387 U.S. 938, 87 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>S. Ct. 2048, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1006 (1967); that scope is determined by all of the evidence offered during direct examination.\u201d <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>189 Conn, 518, 525, 457 A.2d 656 (1983). \u201cThe court could properly allow the proponents to inquire as to any facts which would tend to rebut or modify any material conclusion or inference resulting from the facts elicited on the [cross-examination].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>197 Conn. 247, 260, 496 A.2d 513 (1985). A party who initiates discussion of an issue, whether on direct or cross-examination, is said to have \u2018opened the door\u2019 to inquiry by the opposing party, and cannot later object when the opposing party so questions the witness. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>200 Conn. 9, 13, 509 A.2d 493 (1986). \u201cThe basic function of a redirect examination is to enable a witness to explain and clarify relevant matters in his testimony which have been weakened or obscured by his cross-examination. . . . Where evidence is introduced showing an apparent [contradiction in testimony, the party offering the testimony] is entitled to explain the circumstances so that the trier can properly evaluate it.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kucza </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>155 Conn. 194, 198, 230 A.2d 559 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Here, the owners elicited testimony about insulation from Anderson on direct examination. If the plaintiffs wanted to prevent Anderson from testifying about insulation over the light fixture because such testimony was beyond the scope of the expert witness disclosure made pursuant to \u00a7 220 (D), the time to object was during direct examination. Instead, the plaintiffs chose the strategy of impeaching Anderson\u2019s credibility. In doing so, they invited further testimony on redirect examination when the owners attempted to rehabilitate their expert. \u201c[A] party who delves into a particular subject during the examination of a witness cannot object if the opposing party later questions the witness on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>same subject.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Somers </em>v. <em>LeVasseur, </em>230 Conn. 560, 565, 645 A.2d 993 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Under the circumstances, the court exercised its sound discretion in permitting Anderson to testify about the insulation on redirect examination. The plaintiffs questioned Anderson about insulation on cross-examination, and, as the trial court noted, Anderson\u2019s opinion, or lack of an opinion, about the insulation was not related to the cause of the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">We also agree with the trial court\u2019s ruling regarding Anderson\u2019s opinion on the issue of moisture in the ballast. On cross-examination, the plaintiffs asked Anderson if she knew that the roof leaked and whether moisture would cause a ballast to malfunction. On redirect, the owners asked Anderson if she had an opinion concerning moisture and the ballast in question. The plaintiffs objected to the question claiming the owners had not disclosed Anderson\u2019s opinion concerning moisture. The trial court overruled the objection because, again, the owners had opened the door to the issue of moisture on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 second claim, which concerns the sufficiency of the evidence, is that the trial court improperly failed to set aside the verdict with respect to their nuisance count because the jury failed to consider the nuisance count and because there was a preponderance of evidence that the owners breached their duties to the tenants by violating applicable building and safety codes, which created a dangerous condition. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">An examination of the procedural posture of the case is necessary for our review of the first of the plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>sufficiency claims. When the jurors retired to deliberate, they were asked to answer four sets of interrogatories, one set for each case, in reaching their verdict. Two sets of interrogatories contained questions only about negligence. The other two sets of interrogatories contained questions concerning negligence and nuisance. While the clerk was reading the jury\u2019s verdict, the trial court realized that the jury had not answered the questions addressed to nuisance. Upon reviewing the interrogatories, the trial court and counsel for the parties noted a directional error on the interrogatory form.* 123*****<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court then instructed the jury to return to its deliberations and to answer the interrogatories concerning nuisance. The jury retired and answered the interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">On appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the juiy deliberated on the nuisance interrogatories for only five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>minutes and therefore could not have considered the claim of nuisance. Although the record and the transcript do not reflect the amount of time the jury deliberated, the amount of time is not relevant. The plaintiffs did not object to the form of the interrogatories or to the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury to answer the interrogatories concerning nuisance. Therefore, the plaintiffs failed to preserve their claim of error. Practice Book \u00a7 315. Furthermore, the trial court instructed the jury to answer the interrogatories concerning the nuisance count. A jury is presumed to follow the instructions it is given. See <em>Eisenbach </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>45 Conn. App. 165, 181, 694 A.2d 1376, cert. denied, 241 Conn. 926, 696 A.2d 1264 (1997). Therefore, in the absence of evidence to the contrary; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>46 Conn. App. 578, 583, 700 A.2d 96, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 938, 702 A.2d 644 (1997); we must presume that the jury followed the trial court\u2019s instructions and properly considered the nuisance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 second sufficiency claim is that the trial court improperly failed to set aside the verdict on the nuisance count because the allegations of the claim were proved by a fair preponderance of the evidence. This claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">To prevail on their nuisance claim, the plaintiffs had to prove not only that they had an ownership interest in the real property; see <em>Webel </em>v. <em>Yale University, </em>125 Conn. 515, 525, 7 A.2d 215 (1939); but also that the condition complained of had a natural tendency to create a continuing danger, that the defendants\u2019 use of the land was unreasonable or unlawful, and that the condition was the proximate cause of their injuries. See <em>Filisko </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Hydraulic Co., </em>176 Conn. 33, 35-36, 404 A.2d 889 (1978). In addition, the plaintiffs also had to prove that the owners had control over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>area that was the source of the nuisance; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton, </em>204 Conn. 177, 184, 527 A.2d 688 (1987); and that the owners intended to bring about the condition that was a nuisance. See <em>DeLahunta </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>134 Conn. 630, 633-34, 59 A.2d 800 (1948). \u201cWhether any of those essentials exist is ordinarily a question of fact. <em>Chazen </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>148 Conn. 349, 355, 170 A.2d 891 [1961].\u201d <em>Filisko </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Hydraulic Co., </em>supra, 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The substance of the plaintiffs\u2019 nuisance claim against the owners is that there was paperbacked insulation over the light fixture where the ballast failed and that there were no fire walls in the attic of the premises, both of which constituted violations of applicable building and fire codes. Building and fire codes are themselves not evidence of negligence, but only evidence of the standard of care. See <em>Wendland </em>v. <em>Ridgefield Construction Services, Inc., </em>184 Conn. 173, 181, 439 A.2d 954 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u201c \u2018In determining whether a verdict should be set aside, the court is obligated first to review the evidence giving it a construction most favorable to sustaining the jury\u2019s verdict. ... In addition, the trial court\u2019s refusal to disturb the jury verdict is entitled to great weight, and every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of its correctness. ... In reviewing this issue, our sole responsibility is to decide whether, on the evidence presented, the jury could fairly reach the conclusion [it] did.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Lester </em>v. <em>Resort Camplands International, Inc., </em>27 Conn. App. 59, 68-69, 605 A.2d 550 (1992). \u201c \u2018It is the province of the jury to weigh the evidence and determine the credibility and the effect of testimony; and we must decide the question whether on the evidence presented, the jury could have fairly reached [its] verdict . . . Id., 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Our review of the trial transcript reveals that the evidence on all of the elements of nuisance was well controverted. Jurors are the arbiters of fact and credibility. They are free to believe all, some or none of a witness\u2019 testimony. We will not disturb a jury\u2019s verdict where the record reveals that the factual issues were in dispute. Therefore, the trial court properly refused to set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">A number of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are not amenable to appellate review. \u201cIn order for this court judiciously and efficiently to consider claims of error raised on appeal\u201d; <em>Karanian </em>v. <em>Maulucci, </em>185 Conn. 320, 321, 440 A.2d 959 (1981); the parties must clearly and fully set forth their arguments in their briefs. \u201cWe do not reverse the judgment of a trial court on the basis of challenges to its rulings that have not been adequately briefed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Krondes </em>v. <em>O\u2019Boy, </em>37 Conn. App. 430, 436, 656 A.2d 692 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">The plaintiffs claim that the trial court failed to provide them with a fair and impartial trial. Their initial brief merely contains a list of references to the transcript of the trial that allegedly support their claim of impartiality, but cites no legal authority for their claim. In their reply brief, the plaintiffs cite a series of legal principles. The plaintiffs did not, however, analyze the relationship between the facts of this case and the law cited. Therefore, we will not review this claim. See <em>Middletown Commercial Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Middletown, </em>42 Conn. App. 426, 439 n.12, 680 A.2d 1350, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 939, 684 A.2d 711 (1996); see also <em>Williams Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford Courant Co., </em>232 Conn. 559, 593-94 n.26, 657 A.2d 212 (1995) (arguments cannot be raised for first time in reply brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Regarding the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the court improperly permitted the owners\u2019 expert witness, Anderson, to testify, the plaintiffs cite to the record and to the transcript, but they cite no law in support and provide no analysis of that claim. We will not review such claims, absent law and analysis. See <em>Middletown Commercial Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Middletown, </em>supra, 42 Conn. App. 439 n.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">With respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the trial court permitted the owners to elicit prior consistent statements from Norm Maxon, the owners\u2019 property manager, that were not in dispute, \u201c \u2018[assignments of error which are merely mentioned but not briefed beyond a statement of the claim will be deemed abandoned and will not be reviewed by this court.\u2019 . . . <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>16 Conn. App. 548, 554, 547 A.2d 1387, cert. denied, 210 Conn. 802, 553 A.2d 615 (1988).\u201d <em>Fromer </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>36 Conn. App. 155, 156, 649 A.2d 540 (1994). Therefore, we will not review the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">The plaintiffs also claim that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence their superseded complaints and failed to admit into evidence the owners\u2019 corresponding answers. Our review of the record reveals a lengthy colloquy between the trial court and the parties concerning whether copies of pleadings should go to the jury. The record also discloses that the plaintiffs never offered the pleadings they wanted admitted as evidence for the trial court to rule on their admissibility, and they did not object to the trial court\u2019s admission of the superseded complaints as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>\u201cOur rules of practice make it clear that counsel must object to a ruling of evidence [and] state the grounds upon which objection is made ... to preserve the grounds for appeal. . . . These requirements are not simply formalities. . . . We consistently have stated that we will not consider evidentiary rulings where counsel did not properly preserve a claim of error by objection .... <em>State </em>v. <em>Lizotte, </em>200 Conn. 734, 742A, 517 A.2d 610 (1986). Because of the [plaintiffs\u2019] failure to comply with the rules of practice, the claim concerning the admissibility of this particular evidence was not properly preserved for appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pecoraro, </em>198 Conn. 203, 206, 502 A.2d 396 (1985).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ulen, </em>31 Conn. App. 20, 30, 623 A.2d 70, cert. denied, 226 Conn. 905, 625 A.2d 1378 (1993).

During argument, the plaintiffs incorporated a different argument, as they did in their briefs to this court, i.e., that Anderson\u2019s opinion concerning paperbacked insulation was an opinion different from that disclosed by the owners pursuant to \u00a7 220 (D).
