The trial court also imposed a monetary penalty on the defendant and awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">We have fully reviewed the record and briefs and considered the oral arguments of the parties. The trial court\u2019s findings are supported by the evidence and the inferences that reasonably may be drawn therefrom. Having applied the appropriate standard of review, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion and that its decision conformed to the applicable law. No novel principles of law or appellate procedure are involved in this case, and to discuss the defendant\u2019s claims at length would serve no useful purpose. See <em>Byrne </em>v. <em>Trice, </em>170 Conn. 442, 442-43, 365 A.2d 1063 (1976); <em>Benlock </em>v. <em>New Haven Terminal/Cilco Terminal, </em>48 Conn. App. 250, 706 A.2d 1390 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
