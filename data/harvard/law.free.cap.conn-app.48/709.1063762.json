Saucier, appeals from the judgment of foreclosure by sale. More specifically, Saucier claims that the trial court improperly struck his special defense, which alleged that the plaintiff had not complied with the notice requirements of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701x.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">The trial court record discloses that the plaintiff moved to strike Saucier\u2019s special defense on May 21, 1996. The parties briefed the issue, and oral argument was presented to the court. On July 11, 1996, the trial court granted the motion to strike the special defense, and Saucier filed a notice of intent to appeal. The plaintiff subsequently obtained summary judgment against Saucier, and the trial court rendered a judgment of foreclosure by sale. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">The duty to provide this court with a record adequate for review rests with the appellant. See Practice Book \u00a7 4007, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 61-10; <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>48 Conn. App. 545, 547, 711 A.2d 746 (1998). In the present case, the record is inadequate for review because we have not been provided with a written memorandum of decision or a transcribed copy of an oral decision signed by the trial court. See Practice Book \u00a7 4059, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 64-1. We cannot reach the issue of whether the trial court acted properly because we may not surmise or speculate as to the reasons why the trial court granted the motion to strike. <em>Chase Manhattan </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number><em>Bank/City Trust </em>v. <em>AECO Elevator Co., </em>48 Conn.
