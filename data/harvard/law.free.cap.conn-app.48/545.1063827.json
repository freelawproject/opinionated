Thereafter, the plaintiff, the statewide grievance committee, applied to the Superior Court for reciprocal discipline pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 28A, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 2-39. The trial court scheduled a hearing for May 14, 1997, and ordered that the nonresident defendant be given notice of the application and the hearing date. The defendant filed an answer to the application for reciprocal discipline, along with exhibits. The defendant also requested a continuance of the hearing scheduled for May 14, 1997. The trial court continued the hearing to May 28, 1997, and, thereafter, to June 25, 1997. The defendant failed to attend the June 25,1997 hearing. The trial court found \u201cthat no defense as set forth in [the defendant\u2019s] answer (entitled \u2018opposition\u2019) has been proven to the Practice Book \u00a7 28A (c) standard of clear and convincing evidence.\u201d The trial court, therefore, granted the application for reciprocal discipline and ordered the defendant disbarred effective immediately. The defendant did not move to open the judgment, nor did he seek articulation of the trial court\u2019s brief memorandum of decision. The defendant has also failed to furnish a transcript of the June 25, 1997 hearing before the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>\u201c[W]e cannot render a decision without first having specific findings of fact to determine the basis of the court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gorneault </em>v. <em>Gorneault, </em>34 Conn. App. 923, 924, 642 A.2d 734, cert. denied, 231 Conn. 911, 648 A.2d 152 (1994). We have consistently stated that it is the responsibility of the appellant to provide an adequate record for review. See Practice Book \u00a7 4007, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 61-10; <em>Gelormino </em>v. <em>Blaustein, </em>31 Conn.

We see no reason to depart from that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">We therefore decline to review this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
