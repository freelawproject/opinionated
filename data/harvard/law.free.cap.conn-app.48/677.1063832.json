We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On October 29, 1993, a community newspaper association known as Da Ghetto held a fund-raising Halloween party at the Casa Mia restaurant in Waterbury. The purpose of the event was to raise money so that Da Ghetto could purchase a computer. The admission to the party was $5, unless the guest wore a costume, in which case admission was $4. Food and beer were provided to the guests, and a prize was to be awarded for the best costume.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">Casa Mia was filled to capacity during the party. The defendant arrived between 11 and 11:30 p.m. Upon his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>arrival, the defendant complained about having to wait outside for a long time before he was admitted inside. The party had been planned to continue until 2 a.m. on October 30, 1993. At some point, however, Mark Yates, the senior editor of Da Ghetto, announced that the party was ending early because of \u201cinappropriate conduct.\u201d People at the party became upset after that announcement was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The defendant angrily confronted Yates about ending the party early and demanded his money back. Yates did not have any small bills and gave the defendant $20. The defendant then had an altercation with Leroy Flint, an employee of Casa Mia and the boyfriend of the restaurant owner, Delores Trudeau, and had further altercations with his brother and his cousin when they tried to calm him, and with Yates\u2019 brother. The defendant, who was described as acting \u201clike a typhoon,\u201d pushed and shoved anyone who was in his path. Trudeau overheard the defendant state that \u201csomeone was going to stop breathing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The defendant eventually left Casa Mia with his friend, Brian Brown. The defendant and Brown drove to the house where Brown\u2019s girlfriend lived. Once there, Brown went inside and the defendant waited in the car. After about five minutes, Brown returned and gave the defendant a bag containing a gun. The defendant and Brown then proceeded back to Casa Mia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">At approximately 1 a.m. on October 30, 1993, Martin Hayre, Michael Millhouse and the victim, Christopher Love, were leaving Casa Mia together. Hayre and the victim walked out of Casa Mia and waited on the curb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>for Millhouse to come with his car. When Millhouse pulled his car up, the victim opened the front passenger door and Hayre opened the right rear door. As they were getting into the car, the defendant approached, said something to the victim<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, and then shot the victim in the face. The victim died of a gunshot wound to the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">At trial, the defendant admitted that he was responsible for the victim\u2019s death. He testified, however, that he did not intend to take the victim\u2019s life. The defendant testified that he had been drinking and had smoked marijuana that night. He testified that he did not leave the gun in the car when he and Brown returned to Casa Mia because he had been in previous arguments at the bar and had been jumped by several people. He testified that he approached the victim and wanted to talk to him about the way the party was ended. At that time, the gun was in the defendant\u2019s shirt pocket, with the handle hanging out. The defendant testified that he heard footsteps behind him and that as he was going to turn around, he was \u201cyanked from the back by [the] hood.\u201d His arm then went up and the gun went off.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">The defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to a term of sixty years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">The defendant first argues that the trial court improperly instructed the jury regarding intoxication and manslaughter under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3) and 53a-56 (a) (1). Specifically, the defendant claims that the court deprived him of due process by limiting the jury\u2019s use of evidence of intoxication to negate the specific intent required for minder and by failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>instruct the jury on intoxication as proof of recklessness.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">As an initial matter, we note that the defendant did not file a request to charge on intoxication or on the lesser included offenses and did not object to the court\u2019s instructions. The defendant, nonetheless, argues that this claim is reviewable on appeal pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>or, alternatively, under the plain error doctrine as set forth in Practice Book \u00a7 4061, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 60-5.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>217 Conn. 648, 588 A.2d 127 (1991), the defendant, like the defendant in the present case, was convicted of murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a (a). On appeal, the defendant claimed, inter alia, that his federal and state constitutional rights had been violated by the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury. Specifically, the defendant took issue with the trial court\u2019s charge that evidence of his intoxication should not be considered in determining whether he had possessed the mental state of recklessness necessary for conviction of the lesser included offenses of manslaughter in either the first or second degree. The defendant sought review of this claim pursuant to <em>Golding </em>or, alternatively, as plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Our Supreme Court declined to afford <em>Golding </em>review to this claim, stating that \u201c[bjecause a lesser included offense instruction is purely a matter of common law, and therefore does not implicate constitutional rights . . . the defendant has failed to satisfy the second condition of <em>Golding.\u2019\u2019\u2019' </em>(Citations omitted.) Id., 659. The Supreme Court likewise concluded that this claim was not reviewable as plain error, stating that \u201c[sjince the jury, having been instructed not to consider lesser included offenses unless it found the defendant not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>guilty of the greater offense of murder, found the defendant guilty of murder, we cannot say that the instruction challenged by the defendant undermined the fairness of his trial or resulted in a manifest injustice to him.\u201d Id., 660;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>244 Conn. 226, 240-41, 710 A.2d 732 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">We conclude, on the basis of <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>supra, 217 Conn. 658-60, that the defendant\u2019s claim is not reviewable pursuant to <em>Golding </em>or the plain error doctrine.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The defendant next argues that the trial court improperly instructed the jury in connection with intoxication that the state had the burden of proving \u201cthat the defendant was capable of forming the required intent\u201d for murder. According to the defendant, the trial court charged that to negate specific intent, the intoxication evidence must show that the defendant was \u201cincapable\u201d of possessing the required intent, and that this incapacity was the threshold for consideration of intoxication evidence. The defendant argues that this charge imper-missibly shifted and diluted the state\u2019s burden to prove intent beyond a reasonable doubt. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>We initially note that the defendant did not file a request to charge and did not except to the charge as given. He therefore requests review of this claim pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, and, alternatively, as plain error. This claim is reviewable under <em>Golding </em>\u201cbecause it alleges that there was a shifting or diminishing of the state\u2019s burden of proof and that there was constitutional error in the instructions on intent, which constitutes a violation of a fundamental constitutional right.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Burgos, </em>37 Conn. App. 404, 416, 656 A.2d 238, cert. denied, 233 Conn. 915, 659 A.2d 186 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">We conclude, however, on the basis of our review of the charge as a whole, that it is not reasonably possible that the jury was misled as to the scope of the state\u2019s burden of proof on the element of specific intent and the relationship of intoxication to that burden.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court instructed the jury as to the statutory definition of intoxication and then addressed that portion of the statute providing that intoxication is not a defense to a criminal prosecution but may be considered to negate the requirement of intent. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-7. The court then charged that \u201c[i]f you find that the defendant was intoxicated at the time of the crime, you may take this fact into consideration in determining whether he was in such a state of intoxication as to be incapable of forming the required specific intent which is a necessary element for the commission of a crime.\u201d The trial court then made further references to the defendant\u2019s \u201ccapability\u201d of forming the required intent. See footnote 4. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Later, in connection with the court\u2019s charge on the specific elements of the crime charged, the court repeatedly instructed the jury that the state had the burden of proving specific intent beyond a reasonable doubt. See footnote 11. Instructions similar or identical to the charge given have been upheld by our Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 238-40, <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>supra, 217 Conn. 663, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>198 Conn. 560, 571, 504 A.2d 1029 (1986), and by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Burgos, </em>supra, 37 Conn. App. 418, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>27 Conn. App. 73, 85-86, 604 A.2d 1308, cert. denied, 222 Conn. 904, 606 A.2d 1330 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The defendant has, therefore, failed to satisfy the third prong of Golding<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and is not entitled to further review of this claim on that basis. Additionally, the defendant has failed to establish how this claim rises to the level of plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">The defendant next argues that the trial court improperly charged the jury regarding intent when it charged, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (11), that \u201c[a] person acts intentionally with respect to the result or conduct described by a statute defining an offense when his conscious objective is to cause such result or engage in such conduct.\u201d According to the defendant, this charge permitted the jury to return a murder conviction based on a general intent to engage in conduct, rather than the required intent to cause a specific result, namely, death. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although the defendant did not file a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>request to charge and did not except to the charge as given, he argues that this claim is reviewable pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40, and as plain error. We will review this claim because \u201c[a]n improper instruction on an element of an offense . . . is of constitutional dimension.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 235.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">\u201cWe first note that [t]he specific intent to kill is an essential element of the crime of murder. To act intentionally, the defendant must have had the conscious objective to cause the death of the victim.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 235. Although \u201c[w]e agree with the defendant that that portion of \u00a7 53a-3 (11) dealing with intent to engage in proscribed conduct is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>irrelevant to a murder prosecution pursuant to \u00a7 53a-54a\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 322, 664 A.2d 743 (1995); we conclude that the charge read as a whole did not mislead the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The trial court commenced its charge on murder by reading the statutory definition of murder: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when <em>with intent to cause the death of another person, </em>he causes the death of such person . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a). The trial court then read the statutory definition a second time. In explaining the specific elements of murder, the trial court charged that the state had to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt: \u201cNumber one, that <em>the defendant intended to cause the death of another person, </em>in this case, Christopher Love. And number two, <em>that in accordance with that intent, </em>the defendant caused the death of Christopher Love.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court then indicated that it was going to explain what those elements meant in a legal sense. In this regard, the trial court stated: \u201c[T]he first element, which must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, [is] <em>the element of intent to cause the death of a victim </em>The trial court then instructed, pursuant to \u00a7 53a-3 (11), that \u201c[a] person acts intentionally with respect to the result or conduct described by a statute defining an offense when his conscious objective is to cause such result or engage in such conduct.\u201d Several sentences later, the trial court charged: \u201cIf you find that the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant <em>had </em>the intent to cause the death of Christopher Love <em>and that having that intention did cause the death of Christopher Love </em>. . . then you will find the defendant guilty of murder and go no further.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>In the present case, the trial court properly instructed the jury on several occasions that the state was required to prove that the defendant intended to cause the death of Christopher Love. \u201c[I]t strains reason to believe that the jury could have [understood] the challenged instruction as not requiring that the state prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to kill [the victim].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 237. The defendant, therefore, cannot prevail under the third prong of <em>Golding </em>because he has failed to establish that a constitutional violation clearly exists and that it clearly deprived him of a fair trial. Additionally, the defendant has failed to establish how the trial court\u2019s charge amounted to plain error. We, therefore, decline to review this claim further. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 237; <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>supra, 235 Conn. 322; <em>State </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>223 Conn. 535, 541-43, 613 A.2d 770 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jaynes, </em>36 Conn. App. 417, 430-31, 650 A.2d 1261 (1994), cert. denied, 233 Conn. 908, 658 A.2d 980 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court placed undue emphasis on the defendant\u2019s interest in the outcome of the case and thereby \u201cunduly singled out the defendant\u2019s testimony for unfair treatment.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the charge impinged on his right to present a defense and his right to a fair trial under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>United States constitution, and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendant again concedes that he did not object to the charge at the time of trial. He, therefore, seeks review of this claim pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">\u201cWe have treated the basic claim that specific mention of the defendant\u2019s interest infringes upon his right to a fair trial as falling within the claimed deprivation of a fundamental constitutional right . . . [and] [w]e must, therefore, examine the nuances of language, belatedly relied upon by the defendant, only for the purpose of determining whether they are significant enough to have affected the fairness of his trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>220 Conn. 385, 396-97, 599 A.2d 1053 (1991), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Mack, </em>197 Conn. 629, 637, 500 A.2d 1303 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Scarpiello, </em>40 Conn. App. 189, 214, 670 A.2d 856, cert denied, 236 Conn. 921, 674 A.2d 1327 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">The defendant\u2019s assertion that the trial court\u2019s reference to his interest in the outcome of the case \u201csingled out the defendant\u2019s testimony for unfair treatment\u201d is not supported by the record. The trial court specifically instructed the jury that \u201c[i]n weighing the testimony of an accused person <em>you should apply the same principles by which the testimony of other witnesses is tested, </em>and that necessarily involves the consideration of his interest in the outcome of the case.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court further charged that \u201c[a]n accused person having taken the witness stand stands before you, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>then, <em>just like any other witness, and is entitled to the same consideration and must have his testimony measured in the same way as any other witness, </em>including his interest in the verdict which you\u2019re about to render.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Thus, \u201c[t]he continual emphasis was that the jury was to evaluate the defendant\u2019s testimony in the same fashion as the testimony of the other witnesses. We have repeatedly approved the use of similar language and we do not find its use here unduly repetitive or transcending the bounds of evenhandedness.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 397; <em>State </em>v. <em>Scarpiello, </em>supra, 40 Conn. App. 215. The defendant, therefore, cannot prevail under the third prong of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b707-9\"> The defendant testified that he did not know where they were going when they left the house where Brown\u2019s girlfriend lived. He testified that they were \u201cjust riding and we end up back at the Casa Mia bar.\u201d He further testified that \u201cI was a fool. I was stupid. ... [I did] not know that we were going back to the bar. This was not my car, I was just riding.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b708-10\"> Several witnesses testified that the defendant said something to the effect of, \u201cPh.D., where\u2019s your boys at now, where\u2019s your Ph.D. now?\u201d prior to shooting the victim. The victim, who was involved with publishing Da Ghetto, had been working toward his Ph.D. at the University of Rhode Island.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b709-7\"> The trial court charged the jury in relevant part: \u201cNow, [there has] been some testimony to the effect that the defendant was under the influence of an intoxicant, namely, liquor, marijuana or both, at the time of the alleged acts. The penal code defines intoxication as a substantial disturbance of mental or physical capabilities resulting from the introduction of substances into the body. If you find that the defendant was under the influence of an intoxicant at the time of the alleged act, you must then determine what effect, if any, this voluntary intoxication had on his ability to form the specific intent required to commit the alleged crime.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">\u201cIntoxication shall not be a defense to a criminal charge but in any prosecution for an offense, evidence of an intoxication of the defendant may be offered by the defendant whenever it\u2019s relevant to negate an element of the crime charged. Now, note that intoxication is not a defense to or an excuse for the commission of a crime. It\u2019s only relevant to negate an element of the crime charged, such as intent. If you find that the defendant was intoxicated at the time of the crime, you may take this fact into consideration in determining whether he was in such a state of intoxication as to be incapable of forming the required specific intent, which is a necessary element for the commission of a crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-9\">\u201cNow, in this particular case the crime of murder has the element of specific intent, as you\u2019ll see. In other words, this is a legal concept or principle to consider in connection with the charge of murder, as you\u2019ll see. One element of murder is the specific intent to cause someone\u2019s death. I charge you further that if you believe that the defendant, although intoxicated, was still capable of possessing a specific criminal intent, then his responsibility is the same as if he were not intoxicated. You must first decide whether the defendant was intoxicated at the time of the alleged crime and, second, whether he was incapable of possessing an intent to commit the act constituting, in this case, murder. Remember, the defendant does not have to prove that he was intoxicated. The state always has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was capable of forming the required intent. Any degree of intoxication, not merely total intoxication, may be considered in determining whether or not the defendant possessed the requisite intent.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b709-10\"> The defendant can prevail pursuant to <em>Golding </em>only if \u201c(1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b710-12\"> Practice Book \u00a7 4061, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 60-5, provides in relevant part: \u201cThe court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial.

App. 317, 320, 708 A.2d 964 (1997), cert. denied, 244 Conn. 904, 714 A.2d 3 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b713-9\"> The third prong of <em>Golding </em>requires that \u201cthe alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b713-10\"> The trial court charged in relevant part as follows: \u201cNow, the defendant is charged with the crime of murder. A person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person. [I\u2019ll] [r]ead it again. With intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-11\">\u201cFor you to find the defendant guilty of this charge, the state must prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt. Number one, that the defendant intended to cause the death of another person, in this case, Christopher Love. And number two, that in accordance with that intent, the defendant caused the death of Christopher Love.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\">\u201cNow, I\u2019m going to explain what those elements mean in the legal sense. With respect to the first element, which must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the element of intent to cause the death of a victim. A person acts intentionally with respect to the result or conduct described by a statute defining an offense when his conscious objective is to cause such result or engage in such conduct. Intent is a mental process. To discern what aperson is thinking, the question of intent may be determined by considering all the facts and circumstances leading up to . . . surrounding and following the events in question. You may consider any statement made, an act done or admitted by the defendant, along with all the other facts and circumstances in evidence, and from those you may infer what his intention was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-9\">\u201cWith respect to intent. There\u2019s no requirement that an intent to do a particular thing must be reached over a long period of time. It may be formed virtually instantaneously. However, to find intent, you must find that the defendant\u2019s mental state had, beyond a reasonable doubt, reached the level of conscious objective that I\u2019ve just described here. Remember, it\u2019s in coryunction with this element of intent that you may consider the issue of intoxication. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-10\">\u201cIf you find that the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the intent to cause the death of Christopher Love and that having that intention did cause the death of Christopher Love, the defendant did cause his death, then you will find the defendant guilty of murder and go no further.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b715-7\"> In response to a request from the jury, the trial court later reinstructed the jury regarding the elements of murder. The supplemental charge included the language that the defendant challenges on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b716-8\"> The trial court charged as follows: \u201cNow, the testimony of the defendant. Now, the accused in this case took the stand and testified. In weighing the testimony of an accused person you should apply the same principles by which the testimony of other witnesses is tested, and that necessarily involves the consideration of his interest in the outcome of the case. You may consider the importance to him [of] the outcome of the trial. An accused person having taken the witness stand stands before you, then, just like any other witness, and is entitled to the same consideration and must have his testimony measured in the same way as any other witness, including his interest in the verdict which you\u2019re about to render.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b717-8\"> The defendant additionally claims that the trial court\u2019s undue emphasis on 1he defendant's testimony effectively endorsed the state\u2019s comments during closing arguments that the defendant\u2019s story was simply \u201cnonsense.\u201d The defendant\u2019s brief, however, does not contain a claim for prosecutorial misconduct based on improper remarks made by counsel during closing arguments. We will, therefore, consider this claim abandoned. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>44 Conn. App. 818, 823, 692 A.2d 846, cert. denied, 242 Conn. 902, 697 A.2d 363 (1997) (appellate claims inadequately briefed deemed abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
