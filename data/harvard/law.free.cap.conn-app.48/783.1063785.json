The trial court affirmed the board\u2019s decision and the union appealed to this court. The dispositive issue is whether an earlier decision of the board bars the present proceeding under the doctrine of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>Our examination of the record and briefs and our consideration of the arguments of the parties persuades us that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. In a thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum of decision, the trial court analyzed the law in a manner consistent with our statutes and case precedents. Because that memorandum addresses the dispositive argument raised in this appeal, we adopt the trial court\u2019s well reasoned decision; <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Locals 387, 391 &amp; 1565, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Dept. of Correction, </em>45 Conn. Sup. 292, 714 A.2d 75 (1997); as a statement of the applicable law on this issue. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion contained therein. See <em>In re Karrlo K., </em>40 Conn. App. 73, 75, 668 A.2d 1353 (1996); <em>Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. </em>v. <em>Bardinelli, </em>39 Conn.
