Brunswick, appeals from the summary judgment rendered by the trial court in favor of the defendant, Safeco Insurance Company. The issues raised on appeal concern whether an attorney can bring a cause of action against an insurance carrier that settled a personal injury action directly with the attorney\u2019s former client. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. The plaintiff is an attorney engaged in the practice of law in New Haven. At some time prior to 1991, the plaintiff undertook to represent Mary Osborne in connection with injuries she sustained in an automobile accident. The plaintiff claims that he met with Osborne\u2019s daughter at a time when Osborne was incapacitated<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and gave the daughter a copy of his retainer agreement, which included the plaintiffs name but was not signed by him. The plaintiff subsequently had a telephone conversation with Osborne during which he asked Osborne to sign and return the retainer agreement. Osborne neither signed nor returned the agreement to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">Nonetheless, the plaintiff proceeded with his representation of Osborne by obtaining copies of her relevant medical records, issuing letters of protection to her health care providers and others, and commencing suit on her behalf against the driver of the other vehicle, who was insured by the defendant. During the pendency of the personal injury suit, Osborne informed the plaintiff by letter dated May 8, 1991, that she no longer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>wanted him to represent her in this matter because she was going to negotiate a settlement directly with the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On May 28, 1991, Osborne filed her pro se appearance in lieu of the plaintiffs in the personal injury action, but failed to provide notice of her appearance in accordance with the rules of practice. In early June, 1991, the plaintiff appeared at short calendar on behalf of Osborne and entered a discovery agreement reached with counsel retained by the defendant to represent its insured. Although several of the defendant\u2019s agents knew of the plaintiffs interest as Osborne\u2019s attorney, the defendant negotiated a settlement of the personal injury action directly with Osborne in October, 1991. The plaintiff was not given notice of the settlement, payment or withdrawal of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">On August 3, 1992, the plaintiff commenced the action now before this court by serving the defendant with a six count complaint. The plaintiff alleged that (1) he has a common-law lien on the recovery in the amount of his compensation, (2) the defendant tortiously interfered with his contractual rights, (3) the defendant\u2019s actions violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq., (4) the defendant violated the regulations of the insurance commission,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (5) the defendant violated the plaintiffs property rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and (6) the defendant\u2019s reckless acts impaired the rights of those given letters of protection by the plaintiff. As special defenses to the plaintiffs action, the defendant alleged that the plaintiff failed to comply with General Statutes \u00a7 52-251 c<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and with rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>1.5 (c)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the Rules of Professional Conduct (effective October 1, 1986).* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Between July, 1993, and October, 1996, the parties filed five motions for summary judgment and also filed corresponding objections with affidavits and other evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On February 26,1997, the trial court simultaneously granted the defendant\u2019s third and fourth motions for summary judgment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly granted summary judgment because (1) the defendant did not have standing to raise \u00a7 52-251c and rule 1.5 (c) in defense of the plaintiffs claims, (2) a lawyer who performs services for a client is not barred from recovery for services rendered where the attorney has issued his written commitment to abide by the regulations of \u00a7 52-25lc and rule 1.5 (c) even though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>the commitment is not signed, (3) the plaintiff is protected by the rule that a party may not repudiate her bargain in bad faith to reap the benefit of a statute, (4) an action for interference with contractual relations or business relations may be brought against a tortfeasor even though an enforceable contract did not exist, and (5) the plaintiffs cause of action was alleged, in part, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> not General Statutes \u00a7 38a-816 (6), which is part of the Connecticut Unfair Insurance Practices Act (CUIPA).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">\u201cOur standard of review of a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for summary judgment is well established.\u201d <em>Zichichi </em>v. <em>Middlesex Memorial Hospital, </em>204 Conn. 399, 402, 528 A.2d 805 (1987). \u201cThe judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. \u201d Practice Book \u00a7 384, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 17-49. A \u201cmaterial fact\u201d is a fact that will make a difference in the result of the case. See <em>Hammer </em>v. <em>Lumberman\u2019s Mutual Casualty Co., </em>214 Conn. 573, 578, 573 A.2d 699 (1990). The facts at issue are those alleged in the pleadings. See <em>Plouffe </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H.R. Co., </em>160 Conn. 482, 489, 280 A.2d 359 (1971). The party seeking summary judgment \u201chas the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue as to all material facts, which, under applicable principles of substantive law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>D.H.R. Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>180 Conn. 430, 434, 429 A.2d 908 (1980). Pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 380 and 381, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7\u00a7 17-45 and 17-46, the party adverse to such a motion must provide an evidentiary foundation to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. \u201cIn deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. . . . The test is whether a party would be entitled to a directed verdict on the same facts.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connell </em>v. <em>Colwell, </em>214 Conn. 242, 246-47, 571 A.2d 116 (1990). A defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment \u201cis properly granted if it raises at least one legally sufficient defense that would bar the plaintiffs claim and involves no triable issue of fact.\u201d <em>Perille </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan-Europe, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 529, 543, 494 A.2d 555 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">The plaintiffs first claim is that the trial court improperly determined that the defendant has standing to assert \u00a7 52-251c and rule 1.5 (c) as special defenses because it is not within the class that the statute and rule were intended to protect. The defendant\u2019s special defenses are at the heart of its motions for summary judgment because they attack the plaintiffs failure to secure a written fee agreement when he undertook to represent Osborne. This failure is fatal to the plaintiffs claims. See <em>Alan E. Silver, P.C. </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>43 Conn. App. 184, 188-89, 682 A.2d 551, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 938, 684 A.2d 708 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">Our law is clear. When an attorney undertakes to represent a client in a personal injury action, the attorney and the client \u201cmay provide by contract, which contract shall comply with all applicable provisions of the rules of professional conduct . . . that the fee for the attorney shall be paid\u201d contingent upon certain events. See General Statues \u00a7 52-251c (a). The applicable rule of professional conduct provides that \u201c[a] contingent fee agreement shall be in writing . . . .\u201d Rule 1.5 (c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The use of the word <em>shall </em>means that the performance of the statutory requirement is mandatory rather than permis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>sive. See <em>Caulkins </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>200 Conn. 713, 717, 513 A.2d 43 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Section 52-251c \u201cwas intended to regulate the attorney-client relationship in order to protect plaintiffs from excessive legal fees.\u201d <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Loiseau, </em>223 Conn. 786, 830 n.22, 614 A.2d 414 (1992). \u201cWhere a law is passed for the protection of the public, we will not undermine the remedial purposes of the statute . . . <em>Alan E. Silver, P.C. </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>supra, 43 Conn. App. 190. Although <em>Jacobs </em>makes it clear that the plaintiff could not enforce his claim for fees against Osborne because there was no written agreement, the plaintiff argues that the defendant is not within the class to be protected by \u00a7 52-251c and for that reason cannot invoke its protection. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">\u201cIn order to establish liability as a result of a statutory violation, a plaintiff must satisfy two conditions. First, the plaintiff must be within the class of persons protected by the statute. . . . Second, the injury must be of the type which the statute was intended to prevent.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Berchtold </em>v. <em>Maggi, </em>191 Conn. 266, 274-75, 464 A.2d 1 (1983). Here, the defendant asserts \u00a7 52-251c as a special defense; it does not attempt to use the statute because it has sustained an injury. The plaintiff is the party claiming the injury. Section 52-25lc placed an affirmative duty on the plaintiff; he cannot come forward now seeking justice when he failed to follow the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">Section \u00a7 52-251c protects clients from excessive legal fees by regulating the attorney-client relationship. <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Loiseau, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 830 n.22. The statute permits the attorney and client to enter into a written contract to govern the attorney\u2019s fee. A contract is binding on all parties to the agreement. See <em>Herbert S. New</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number><em>man &amp; Partners, P.C. </em>v. <em>CFC Construction Ltd. Partnership, </em>236 Conn. 750, 760, 674 A.2d 1313 (1996). The plaintiff could have protected his interests by abiding by the dictates of the statute. He cannot now complain that the defendant should have protected his interests, which he, by law, could have done himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The plaintiff also argues that because the attorneys retained by the defendant to represent its insured knew of the plaintiffs appearance in the personal injury suit and because Osborne had not properly certified her May 28, 1991 pro se appearance to the plaintiff; see Practice Book \u00a7 123, now Practice Book (1998 Rev.) \u00a7 10-14; the defendant\u2019s direct communication with Osborne was improper. This argument is unavailing. Osborne wrote to the plaintiff on May 8, 1991, not only discharging him, but also telling him she intended to negotiate a settlement with the defendant directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">The plaintiffs second claim is that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion because a lawyer who performs services for a client is not barred from recovery for services rendered where the attorney has issued a commitment to abide by the dictates of \u00a7 52-25lc and rule 1.5 (c) that is not signed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In support of his argument, the plaintiff relies on <em>Schwarzschild v. Martin, </em>191 Conn. 316, 321-22, 464 A.2d 774 (1983). The plaintiffs reliance is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">In <em>Schwarzschild, </em>the dispute was whether a written agreement that had not been signed by one of the parties to the agreement was enforceable as to all of the parties. Here, the plaintiff seeks to enforce an unsigned agreement allegedly between himself and Osborne <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>against the defendant, who was not a party to the attorney-client relationship. Furthermore, it is evident that the plaintiff and Osborne did not have an agreement at the time the defendant settled Osborne\u2019s claim. Osborne discharged the plaintiff in May, 1991, and the defendant settled Osborne\u2019s claim in October, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">The plaintiffs third claim is that the trial court improperly granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment because a party may not repudiate her bargain in bad faith to reap the benefit of a statute. See <em>Habetz </em>v. <em>Condon, </em>224 Conn. 231, 238, 618 A.2d 501 (1992). Again, the plaintiff attempts to impute the acts of Osborne<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to the defendant, which he may not do. There is no genuine issue of material fact that Osborne discharged the plaintiff as her attorney at least five months before the defendant settled Osborne\u2019s claim. Osborne informed the defendant that she had discharged the plaintiff and intended to settle her claim directly. There is no evidence, in any form, that the defendant acted in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">The plaintiffs next claim is that a plaintiff may bring an action against a tortfeasor for interference with contractual relations or business relations even though an enforceable contract did not exist. In support of that claim, the plaintiff relies on the rule governing intentional interference with contractual relations or unlawful interference with business relations set forth in <em>Harry A. Finman &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Truck &amp; Trailer Service Co., </em>169 Conn. 407, 415, 363 A.2d 86 (1975). While we agree with the plaintiffs statement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>the rule,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the rule has no application to this case, which is factually distinguishable from <em>Harry A. Finman &amp; Son, Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">In <em>Harry A. Finman &amp; Son, Inc., </em>the plaintiff was the defendant hydraulics company\u2019s Connecticut distributor. The defendant trucking company, which knew of the plaintiffs relationship with the hydraulics company, corresponded with the company and questioned the plaintiffs sales ability. The defendant trucking company was then appointed the hydraulics company\u2019s exclusive distributor in Connecticut. The Supreme Court held that the elements of the plaintiffs cause of action against the defendant trucking company were present in its pleadings and claims of proof, and were sufficient to make out a prima facie cause of action. Therefore, the trial court should have submitted a verdict form to the jury on the plaintiffs claims against the defendant trucking company.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Here, Osborne discharged the plaintiff by letter and so informed the defendant. Osborne\u2019s claims were settled at least five months after she discharged the plaintiff. There was no evidence presented that the defendant initiated correspondence directly with Osborne and, thus, was the cause of Osborne\u2019s terminating the plaintiffs employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">The plaintiffs final claim is that the trial court improperly granted summary judgment as to his CUTPA claim because the trial court applied the CUIPA standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>requiring a plaintiff to allege more than one unfair act of claim settlement practice prohibited by \u00a7 38a-816 (6). See <em>Lees </em>v. <em>Middlesex Ins. Co., </em>229 Conn. 842, 850-51, 643 A.2d 1282 (1994); <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>199 Conn. 651, 666, 509 A.2d 11 (1986). The plaintiff cites no Connecticut law in support of his claim that an attorney may assert a CUTPA claim, exclusive of a CUIPA allegation, against an insurer that settles a claim with a former client. Because the plaintiff has provided no analysis of the rule of law applicable to our statutes, we will not review this claim.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>New London Federal Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Tucciarone, </em>48 Conn. App. 89, 100, 709 A.2d 14 (1998); <em>Middletown Commercial Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Middletown, </em>42 Conn. App. 426, 439 n.12, 680 A.2d 1350, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 939, 684 A.2d 711 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-11\"> There is evidence that the plaintiff was already representing Osborne in another personal injury action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b729-7\"> The plaintiff responded to Osborne by letter dated May 15, 1991, attempting to dissuade her from negotiating the settlement herself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b729-8\"> The plaintiff subsequently withdrew the last paragraph of count four, which was then identical to count two.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b729-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-251c provides in relevant part: \u201cLimitation on attorney contingency fees in personal injury, wrongful death and property damage actions, (a) In any claim or civil action to recover damages resulting from personal injury, wrongful death or damage to property occurring on or alter October 1, 1987, the attorney and the claimant may provide by contract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>which contract shall comply with all applicable provisions of the rules of professional conduct governing attorneys adopted by the judges of the Superior Court, that the fee for the attorney shall be paid contingent upon, and as a percentage of: (1) Damages awarded and received by the claimant; or (2) settlement amount pursuant to a settlement agreement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b730-13\"> Rule 1.5 (c) provides: \u201cA fee may be contingent on the outcome of the matter for which the service is rendered, except in a matter in which a contingent fee is prohibited by subsection (d) or other law.
