Dumont claims that (1) there was no probable cause for his arrest, (2) the commissioner\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence, and his expert evidence rebutted the statutory presumption, (3) General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 14-227a (a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 14-227b<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>unconstitutional in various respects, (4) his rights were substantially prejudiced because the hearing officer acted as judge and state advocate and (5) his due process rights were violated by the denial of his request for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The hearing officer reasonably could have found the following facts. On April 11, 1996, a state trooper on Interstate 84 observed Dumont\u2019s car swerve from the left exit lane back onto the highway, causing other vehicles to brake quickly. The trooper stopped Dumont for operating his vehicle erratically and found that Dumont\u2019s breath had an odor of alcohol. Dumont said that he had been drinking beer. When Dumont got out of his car, he steadied himself on the car and walked with a limp. He told the trooper that he had injured his left ankle and right heel the previous year, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>trooper, therefore, did not ask Dumont to perform <em>all </em>of the standard field sobriety tests. In the opinion of the trooper, Dumont failed the tests that were administered. On the basis of the test results and his other observations, the trooper arrested Dumont for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor and took him to the Southington police station. After advising Dumont of his rights, the trooper administered two breath tests using an Intoxilyzer 5000 machine. The results of the tests showed blood alcohol levels of 0.132 percent and 0.118 percent. Thereafter, the commissioner notified Dumont that his operator\u2019s license was to be suspended for a period of ninety days.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b, Dumont requested a hearing on the suspension of his license. His counsel issued a subpoena ordering the trooper to appear at the hearing with the machine and a number of documents. The trooper appeared and testified, but brought only a log book with him. He testified that the machine was functioning properly at the time of the tests and that it was certified by the state department of public health and addiction services (health department). He testified further, however, that the machine and the other items requested were not within the custody or control of the state police, but were the property of and in the custody of either the Southington police department, the health department or some other agency. Dumont requested a continuance to obtain the evidence sought. The hearing officer denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">At the hearing, Dumont submitted a report signed by a toxicologist, Brian Pape,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in which Pape expressed the opinion that the machine used to measure the alcohol content of Dumont\u2019s blood was not rehable. Pape concluded that there was a reasonable likelihood that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Dumont\u2019s true blood alcohol content was less than 0.10 percent at the time of his breath tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The hearing officer concluded that the police had probable cause to arrest Dumont, that they did arrest him for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, that he had been operating a motor vehicle and that within two hours alter operating the vehicle, he had submitted to a breath test that showed the alcohol content of his blood to be above the legal limit. On the basis of those findings, the hearing officer suspended Dumont\u2019s license. Dumont appealed to the Superior Court, which upheld the license suspension. We affirm the decision of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Dumont claims first that because the trooper failed to administer two particular field sobriety tests, and because two of the tests administered were nonstandard, there was not probable cause for an arrest.1 **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">\u201cIt is fundamental that a plaintiff has the burden of proving that the commissioner, on the facts before him, acted contrary to law and in abuse of his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">\u201cProbable cause, broadly defined, comprises such facts as would reasonably persuade an impartial and reasonable mind not merely to suspect or conjecture, but to believe that criminal activity has occurred. . . . In determining whether there was probable cause to arrest for operating a motor vehicle while under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>influence of liquor, the court may consider, just as in an arrest for any other criminal offense, circumstantial as well as direct evidence. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">\u201cTo establish probable cause, it is not necessary to produce a quantum of evidence necessary to convict. . . . The credibility of witnesses and the determination of factual issues are matters within the province of the administrative agency, and this court cannot disturb the conclusions reached by the commissioner if there is evidence that reasonably supports his decision.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kirei </em>v. <em>Hadley, </em>47 Conn. App. 451, 456-57, 705 A.2d 205 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">As in <em>Kirei, </em>the record here shows that the testimony of the trooper, the trooper\u2019s report that was admitted into evidence and the totality of the circumstances at the time of Dumont\u2019s arrest support the hearing officer\u2019s finding that there was probable cause to arrest Dumont for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of liquor. See id., 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The trial court properly found that there was ample evidence to support the hearing officer\u2019s determination that there was probable cause to arrest Dumont.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Dumont next claims (1) that the hearing officer\u2019s finding that Dumont was operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor was not supported by substantial evidence because the breath test machine was not functioning properly, (2) that the hearing officer improperly disregarded Pape\u2019s report, which was the only expert evidence offered, and (3) that Pape\u2019s report rebutted the statutory presumption that the results of the tests indicated Dumont\u2019s blood alcohol content at the time of operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Given the trooper\u2019s testimony and the certification of the machine by the health department, the court had ample evidence to conclude that the machine was functioning properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Our recent decision in <em>Bancroft </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>48 Conn. App. 391, 710 A.2d 807 (1998), directly addresses Dumont\u2019s arguments regarding his expert evidence. The hearing officer \u201cis not required to believe unrebutted expert testimony, but may believe all, part or none of such unrebutted expert evidence.\u201d Id., 405. Moreover, Dumont has not demonstrated that the hearing officer disregarded Pape\u2019s report. As to the argument that Pape\u2019s report rebutted the statutory presumption, we stated in <em>Bancroft </em>that the statutory presumption is \u201csufficient to withstand expert evidence to the contrary and support a conviction without further evidence, if the jury disbelieves the contrary evidence. . . . [T]his principle appliejs] equally to an administrative hearing under \u00a7 14-227b, [where a] hearing officer may rely on the presumption created by the statute if he or she disbelieves expert evidence to the contrary. Additional expert evidence to rebut the plaintiffs evidence is not required in such a case.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s finding that the hearing officer\u2019s reliance on the statutory presumption to suspend Dumont\u2019s license was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">Dumont maintains that \u00a7\u00a7 14-227a (a) and 14-227b are void for vagueness because he had no way of measuring whether his blood alcohol content was 0.10 percent or higher when he operated his motor vehicle. \u201cThe constitutional injunction that is commonly referred to as the void for vagueness doctrine embodies two central <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>precepts: the right to fair warning of the effect of a governing statute or regulation and the guarantee against standardless law enforcement. . . . Thus, [i]n order to surmount a vagueness challenge, a statute [must] afford a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is permitted or prohibited. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">\u201cFurthermore, [a]s a general rule, the constitutionality of a statutory provision being attacked as void for vagueness is determined by the statute\u2019s applicability to the particular facts at issue.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>240 Conn. 766, 777, 695 A.2d 525 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Dumont claims that the statutes do not give fair warning because an ordinary person has no ascertainable means of measuring his or her own blood alcohol content. This claim has been rejected in all of our sister states in which it has been raised.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We join those states on the basis of the reasoning stated by the California Supreme Court in <em>Burg </em>v. <em>Municipal Court for Santa Clara County Judicial District, </em>35 Cal. 3d 257, 271-72, 673 P.2d 732, 198 Cal. Rptr. 145 (1983), cert. denied and appeal dismissed, 466 U.S. 967, 104 S. Ct. 2337, 80 L. Ed. 2d 812 (1984): \u201c[I]t requires more than asmall amount of alcohol to produce a [0].10 [percent] BAC [blood alcohol content]. Those who drink a substantial amount of alcohol within a relatively short period of time are given clear warning that to avoid possible criminal behavior they must refrain from driving. . . . Considering also today\u2019s heightened level of public awareness regarding the problem, we cannot believe that any person who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>drives after drinking would be unaware of the possibility that his blood-alcohol level might equal or exceed the statutory standard. . . . Charts are readily available to the public that show with reasonable certainty the number of different alcoholic beverages necessary for a particular individual to reach a blood-alcohol level of 0.10 percent.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">We conclude that \u00a7\u00a7 14-227a (a) and 14-227b are not unconstitutionally vague as applied to Dumont.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">Dumont also maintains that \u00a7 14-227b (f) is unconstitutional because it is limited to four issues and, thus, denies him due process. He cites no authority in support of this claim and offers no analysis beyond his argument that he was thus prevented from explaining that his performance and test results were not related to his being under the influence of alcohol. \u201cOne who challenges the constitutionality of a statute bears the heavy burden of overcoming the presumption of its constitutional validity and of establishing the statute\u2019s invalidity beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Ecker </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>205 Conn. 219, 237, 530 A.2d 1056 (1987). Dumont has failed even to come close to satisfying this heavy burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">Dumont also claims that \u00a7 14-227b is unconstitutional because it mandates that the hearing officer find that the blood alcohol content was 0.10 percent or higher if the test, commenced within two hours of the time of operation, indicates the same. He argues that under the terms of \u00a7 14-227b (f) the result of the test is sufficient to indicate the content of alcohol in the blood at the time of operation, and that this amounts to a conclusive and unconstitutional presumption. We consider and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>reject the claim as being without merit. One of the four issues to be determined by the hearing officer is whether the operator submitted to a test commenced within two hours of the time of operation and, if so, whether the result of the test indicated a blood alcohol content of 0.10 percent or higher. Pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b (f), the test result is sufficient only to indicate blood alcohol content at the time of operation if the result of the second required test is not 0.12 percent or less and is higher than the result of the first test. If such results do occur, there must be additional evidence demonstrating that the results accurately indicate the blood alcohol content at the time of operation. Thus, the statute creates a rebuttable, as opposed to a conclusive, presumption. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Korhn, </em>41 Conn. App. 874, 880-81, 678 A.2d 492, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 910, 682 A.2d 1010 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Dumont claims that the dual role of the hearing officer as judge and state advocate substantially prejudiced his rights. He claims that the hearing officer presented the evidence, ruled on its admissibility and rendered a decision, thus substantially prejudicing his rights. Dumont cites no authority in support of this claim. The hearing officer received the reports from the police officer and the evidence Dumont adduced. There is no reference in the brief to any specific ruling on admissibility that called into question the hearing officer\u2019s impartiality. The hearing officer was called upon merely to decide four statutory issues, and he did so. \u201cIt is not violative of due process for the same authority which initiated the subject of the hearing to listen to and determine its outcome as long as that authority gives the person appearing before it a fair, open and impartial hearing.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>New England Rehabilitation Hospital of Hartford, Inc. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number><em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>226 Conn. 105, 151, 627 A.2d 1257 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Dumont also claims that the fact that the hearing officer is compensated by the department that seeks to suspend his license presents too high a risk that he will be biased. Dumont does not assert that the hearing officer was in fact biased, and this claim too lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Finally, Dumont claims that his due process rights were violated when the hearing officer denied his request for a continuance to permit him properly to subpoena the persons or agencies having custody of the Intoxilyzer 5000 and various documents. The trial court, in its discretion, reasonably found that Dumont and his counsel knew that the breath tests were given at the Southington police department with that department\u2019s machine. Also, there is nothing in the record to indicate that a subpoena could not have been issued to the more likely repositories of the documents sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor ....
