We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-14\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On May 14, 1994, Carl Nicholson left his home on Arctic Street in Bridgeport to buy groceries. He lived there with Stacy Corbett and five children, Erica, Eric, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Shawn, Corey and Carla. When he left, he told ten year old Erica, the eldest child, to close the door. As he stepped out onto the porch, Nicholson had a conversation with the defendant, whom he knew as a neighbor, telling him that Corbett had left the children alone for two days and that he was going to the grocery store. The defendant told Nicholson that he had some toys in the attic for the children, and Nicholson replied that the defendant should save the toys for the morning because the children were going to bed. The defendant asserted that he was going to get the toys for the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Shortly thereafter, the defendant appeared at the door of the Corbett residence and told Erica that her father said to come with him to get some toys. Eric, who recognized the defendant, wanted to go along, but the defendant said, \u201cOnly Erica.\u201d Erica left with the defendant, who beat and choked her, carried her through an alleyway, threw her over a fence into her backyard, where he stabbed her in the face and neck, piercing her jugular vein and causing her death.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>The defendant then went to the one of the victim\u2019s neighbors and told them there was a body in the backyard. Other facts will be discussed as pertinent to issues in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">The defendant claims that the state\u2019s closing argument contains two impermissible indirect comments on his failure to testify. Specifically, the defendant claims that the state posed two rhetorical questions to the jury that \u201cpointed directly and starkly at [the defendant] and asked him, and only him, for an explanation.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>The fifth amendment to the United States constitution, applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment, \u201cforbids either comment by the prosecution on the accused\u2019s silence or instructions by the court that such silence is evidence of guilt.\u201d <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 615, 85 S. Ct. 1229, 14 L. Ed. 2d 106 (1965). This does not mean that the state is prohibited from calling to the jury\u2019s attention any portion of the evidence that stands uncontradicted; see <em>State v. Marra, </em>222 Conn. 506, 534, 610 A.2d 1113 (1992); or commenting \u201con the overall quality of the defendant\u2019s evidence . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnotti, </em>198 Conn. 209, 220, 502 A.2d 404 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">In determining whether an indirect comment infringes on the defendant\u2019s constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, we have adopted the following test: \u201c \u2018Was the language used manifestly intended to be, or was it of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify?\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 72, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), citing <em>United States ex rel. Leak </em>v. <em>Follette, </em>418 F.2d 1266, 1269 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1050, 90 S. Ct. 1388, 25 L. Ed. 2d 665 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">The following additional facts concerning portions of the state\u2019s closing argument are necessary before we can review the defendant\u2019s claims. The state called Henry Lee, the state\u2019s chief criminalist and director of the state forensic laboratory, as its expert witness. A portion of Lee\u2019s testimony concerned a bloodstain found on the defendant\u2019s sneaker. According to Lee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>expert opinion, the bloodstain was caused by blood spatter rather than contact transfer. This was telling because although the defendant may have acquired a contact stain simply by touching blood,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a spatter stain required that the blood be airborne prior to contact. Furthermore, Nicholson testified, without contradiction, that he noticed that between the time he saw the defendant on the porch and when he returned from the grocery store, the defendant had changed his shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">During its final argument, the state asked several rhetorical questions related to the testimony of Lee<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Nicholson.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude that the state\u2019s questions would not naturally and necessarily be taken as comments on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify and that the state did not intend them to have such an effect. In the state\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor first argued, \u201cWell, how did it get there, then?\u201d which clearly refers to Lee\u2019s explanation of how the bloodstain got on the defendant\u2019s sneaker, i.e., spatter as opposed to surface <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>to surface contact, rather than calling on the defendant to explain its origins. Therefore, that statement would not have been naturally and necessarily interpreted as a comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">The defendant\u2019s second challenge is to the question: \u201c[W]hy would you do that?\u201d In effect, the state was asking what would lead a person to change shirts during a brief space of time. One answer is a guilty conscience and a desire to hide evidence. The question does not point to the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify, but asks the jurors to refer to their knowledge of human nature to ascertain an answer to the question. Immediately after asking the question, the state pointed out and conceded that the evidence alone is not dispositive of the defendant\u2019s guilt. It is but one fact from which the jury could draw an inference of guilt. We conclude that the rhetorical questions posed by the prosecutor would not naturally and necessarily be interpreted as a comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly exercised its discretion by excluding evidence that he asserts implicated another in the death of Erica.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">The following additional facts apply to the defendant\u2019s claim. On the night of the homicide, the defendant told several individuals that he had seen an old white man with gray hair driving a green Oldsmobile. He claimed that he observed the man fighting with a black female in the car, dragging her from the car, banging her head against the car and dumping her body over the fence. The defendant also gave this information to the police. As a result, the police stopped a green Oldsmobile with a white driver and a black female passenger about one block from the crime scene, between one hour and one and one-half hours after Erica\u2019s body was found. The driver was young, blond, tall and thin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A knife and a gun were found in the car. The knife was tested and no evidence of blood was found on it. Blood was found under the driver\u2019s fingernails, which the driver claimed was menstrual blood from his passenger, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>with whom he had engaged in sexual activity. The driver\u2019s explanation was corroborated by the female passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The state moved in limine to exclude defense evidence regarding the vehicle stop. The state argued that there was no connection between the stop or the occupants of the vehicle and the murder, and that admitting the evidence would create confusing collateral issues for the jury. The defendant maintains that the state opened the door to this area of inquiry in its direct examination of Nicholson and another witness<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and, further, that there were sufficient similarities between the defendant\u2019s version of the incident and the vehicle stop to warrant admission of these facts in evidence. The trial court granted the state\u2019s motion in limine, finding that there was insufficient evidence that directly connected the third party to the crime charged, that there was no connection between the car and the crime, and that the prejudicial value of the evidence would outweigh its relevance and it would be a waste of time. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">\u201cBoth this state and other jurisdictions have recognized that a defendant may introduce evidence which indicates that a third party, and not the defendant, committed the crime with which the defendant is charged. . . . The defendant, however, must show some evidence which <em>directly </em>connects a third party to the crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>with which the defendant is charged .... It is not enough to show that another had the motive to commit the crime . . . nor is it enough to raise a bare suspicion that some other person may have committed the crime of which the defendant is accused.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Echols, </em>203 Conn. 385, 392, 524 A.2d 1143 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The admissibility of evidence of third party culpability is governed by the rules relating to relevancy. Id., 393. \u201c \u2018No precise and universal test of relevancy is furnished by the law, and the question must be determined in each case according to the teachings of reason and judicial experience.\u2019 <em>Pope Foundation, Inc. </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>106 Conn. 423, 435-36, 138 A. 444 (1927); <em>State </em>v. <em>Towles, </em>155 Conn. 516, 523, 235 A.2d 639 (1967). The trial court has wide discretion in its rulings on evidence and its rulings will be reversed only if the court has abused its discretion or an injustice appears to have been done. <em>State </em>v. <em>Echols, </em>supra [203 Conn. 393].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>223 Conn. 535, 549, 613 A.2d 770 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">The flaw in the defendant\u2019s claim is that none of the proffered evidence directly connected the vehicle or its occupants with the commission of the crime. While the evidence proffered during the hearing on the motion in limine, held outside the presence of the jury, demonstrated that there was a car similar in description to the one identified by the defendant in the vicinity of the crime scene about one hour to one and one-half hours after the crime, it went no further. The driver of the vehicle was Caucasian, young, blond and thin; the female passenger, an alleged prostitute, corroborated the driver\u2019s activity. It would be speculative to draw from the proffered evidence an inference that these people or the vehicle were connected to Erica\u2019s homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>\u201cOrdinarily, evidence concerning a third party\u2019s involvement is not admissible until there is some evidence which directly connects that third party with the <em>crime.\u201dState v. Kinsey, </em>173 Conn. 344, 347-48, 377 A.2d 1095 (1977). Unless that direct connection exists, it is within \u201cthe sound discretion of the trial court to refuse to admit such evidence when it simply affords a possible ground of possible suspicion against another person.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>219 Conn. 93, 117, 591 A.2d 1246 (1991). Evidence of apossible motive is insufficient to establishrelevancy. See <em>State </em>v. <em>John, </em>210 Conn. 652, 670-71, 557 A.2d 93, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 824, 110 S. Ct. 84, 107 L. Ed. 2d 50 (1989). Moreover, \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s ruling on the relevancy of third party inculpatory evidence will be reversed on appeal only if the court has abused its discretion or an injustice appears to have been done.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>supra. After reviewing the record, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the defendant\u2019s proffered evidence was not connected to the victim\u2019s death and in ruling as it did.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Finally, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly exercised its discretion in admitting a prior consistent statement made by Eric Corbett, the victim\u2019s seven year old brother, who was a state\u2019s witness. The defendant maintains that Eric\u2019s statement on the night of the crime identifying the defendant as the person who took his sister away should not have been admitted because the state induced an uncertainty in Eric\u2019s in-court identification, which then led to the admission of Eric\u2019s prior consistent statement. The state argues that the factual premise on which the defendant bases his claim, that Eric\u2019s prior statement was introduced to bolster an alleged uncertainty in his in-court identification, is false. The state claims that the statement was introduced to rebut the suggestion, made by the defense, that Eric\u2019s testimony was the product of numerous conversations he had with such persons as his mother, the police, the prosecutor and social workers, rather than of his memory. The state sought to refute this contention by introducing evidence of the statement Eric made shortly after his sister\u2019s body was discovered and before anyone would have had an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>opportunity to influence his recoflection of the evening\u2019s events. Moreover, the state asserts that the statement was admissible to rehabilitate the witness following the defendant\u2019s attempted impeachment of Eric with a prior inconsistent statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The following additional facts are necessary for purposes of our analysis. At the time of the trial, Eric was eight and one-half years old; at the time of the homicide, he was seven. Eric recognized the defendant when he came to the door and told Erica that her father said that it was all right to come with him. When he was asked at trial if he saw the defendant in the courtroom, Eric initially testified, \u201cHe\u2019s not here, right?\u201d Then he testified that there was only one person in the room who looked like the defendant and pointed to the defendant, indicating he was the man who came for his sister. When asked if he was sure of his identification, Eric said that he was not. On cross-examination, Eric was asked a series of questions concerning the people with whom he had spoken about the death of his sister,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>and that, at the probable cause hearing, he had pointed to his uncle when asked to identify the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Later, outside the presence of the jury, the state made known its intention to introduce testimony of a detective who had responded to the scene shortly after Erica\u2019s body was found. The detective would testify that he had asked Eric if he knew what had happened to his sister and that Eric had replied that the \u201cfat man\u201d came for her. Eric also told the detective that he knew where the fat man lived and led the detective out of the house, down the street and pointed to the defendant\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">It is beyond question that the state offered the detective\u2019s testimony, not for its truth, but to corroborate Eric\u2019s in-court identification of the defendant. The state argued: \u201cThe theory, Your Honor, that I would offer is that during the cross-examination of Eric, the cross-examination, among other things, sought to undermine the memory of Eric.\u201d The defendant argued<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> that Eric\u2019s testimony had not been challenged for bias, interest or motive and that the court should consider the reliability of the testimony.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">After hearing arguments, the court ruled that the proposed testimony was admissible. It found that there had been \u201cextensive cross-examination as to the possibility of a taint or coaching and the accuracy of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>witness\u2019 memory concerning the identification, including cross-examination concerning a misidentification during a probable cause hearing in which [Eric] identified his uncle.\u201d In addition, the trial court determined that the statement was given before there would have been an opportunity to coach the witness and that the relevance of the proposed evidence far outweighed any prejudicial impact it might have. The trial court also informed the defendant that it would give a cautionary instruction, which it did immediately following the detective\u2019s testimony, that the jury was to use this evidence only on the issue of Eric\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Ordinarily, prior consistent statements of a witness are not admissible, whether offered for their truth or merely as corroboration of the witness\u2019 testimony at trial. The rationale for excluding this evidence is relevancy. In the normal course of events, the witness\u2019 story is not made more probable or more trustworthy by any number of repetitions of it. <em>State </em>v. <em>Valentine, </em>240 Conn. 395, 412-13, 692 A.2d 727 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Circumstances exist, however, in which the fact that the witness made a statement consistent with his or her trial testimony is probative of credibility. Exceptions to the general rule of exclusion, therefore, exist to cover such circumstances. Major exceptions include using the prior consistent statement to rehabilitate a witness who has been impeached by a suggestion of bias or interest arising subsequent to the prior statement; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeffrey, </em>220 Conn. 698, 713-14, 601 A.2d 993 (1991), cert. denied, 505 U.S. 1224, 112 S. Ct. 3041, 120 L. Ed. 2d 909 (1992); by a suggestion of recent contrivance; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>178 Conn. 564, 568 n.5, 424 A.2d 266 (1979); by a charge of faulty recollection; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (83-FG), </em>190 Conn. 715, 729, 463 A.2d 533 (1983); or by a prior inconsistent statement. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number><em>State v. Torres, </em>210 Conn. 631, 641, 556 A.2d 1013 (1989). Whether the circumstances support the admission of this evidence is left to the discretion of the trial court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>179 Conn. 1, 18, 425 A.2d 924 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s argument on appeal, the detective\u2019s testimony concerning Eric\u2019s prior statements was not admitted to bolster any weakness in Eric\u2019s testimony created by the state. The trial court found, and we agree, that the detective\u2019s testimony was admitted to refute the suggestion that Eric\u2019s testimony was the product of outside influences, such as police or social workers. Because Eric\u2019s statement to the detective occurred shortly after his sister\u2019s body was found and, thus, before anyone would have the opportunity to taint his recollection, the detective\u2019s testimony was highly relevant to Eric\u2019s credibility. \u201c \u2018A consistent statement, at <em>a time prior </em>to the existence of a fact said to indicate bias, interest, or corruption, will effectively explain away the force of the impeaching evidence; because it is thus made to appear that the statement in the form now uttered was independent of the discrediting influence.\u2019 4 [J.] Wigmore, Evidence (Chadbourne Rev. [1972]) \u00a7 1128, p. 268.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Dolphin, </em>supra, 178 Conn. 571. The suggestions that Eric had been coached and that his memory had been muddied by numerous conversations, together with the challenges to his recollection, were appropriately refuted by the admission of the detective\u2019s testimony. We conclude that the trial court properly exercised its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-15\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b747-9\"> The assistant medical examiner was unable to determine the order in which Erica sustained her injuries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b747-10\"> The defendant did not object, to these comments until immediately after the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury when he argued that they came \u201cdangerously close to a comment on the accused\u2019s failure to testify.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>defendant did not request the court to take any curative action at that point. Instead he requested the court to reserve ruling until after the verdict. The court agreed. After the verdict, the request was included in a motion to set the verdict aside, which was denied. On appeal, the state did not claim the issue was not properly preserved. This court assumes, without deciding, that the issue was preserved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b749-7\"> Lee was able to determine only that the stain was caused by human blood. He could not determine whether it was Erica\u2019s blood because the sample was too small.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b749-8\"> The prosecutor argued in part, \u201cOn that basis you\u2019re asked to just reject it. That\u2019s noi Erica\u2019s blood. Well, I would suggest to you when you review the testimony of Dr. Lee that he does not exclude that as a possibility. <em>Well, how did it get there then? How did blood get on the shoes? </em>Well, you know, [the defendant is] in that area. I mean he\u2019s around there. We know there\u2019s some blood. Maybe it\u2019s just blood that got on his shoe, you know, while he\u2019s walking around there. And that\u2019s where another thing comes in that Dr. Lee said. He said that this is not surface to surface transfer. It\u2019s spatter. Okay. That means that it somehow became airborne and landed on the shoe and then produced that characteristic pattern and a little tail where it trails off after it hits. That tells you it\u2019s a spatter.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b749-9\"> The prosecutor argued in part: \u201cThe only evidence in this case about the defendant\u2019s clothing is that there was a change of shirts. <em>Now, why would you do that? </em>Does that\u2014now, does that prove that he committed the murder? No. Is this one more tiling? Which direction is it pointing at? Somebody else? Is it pointing at that we\u2019re asking you to jump to conclusions? It\u2019s one more thing that points on the defendant. It\u2019s one more thing that you need to see how it meshes with the rest of the evidence in this case.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b750-7\"> Even if we were to view either of the challenged remarks as indirect comments on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify, the impropriety is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S. Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705 (1967). First, the trial court charged the jury that it could not draw an unfavorable inference from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify and, absent a fair indication to the contrary, we must presume the jury followed this instruction. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Baskins, </em>12 Conn. App. 313, 319-20, 530 A.2d 663, cert. denied, 205 Conn. 811, 532 A.2d 586 (1987). Second, defense counsel presumably did not view the remarks as so prejudicial that his client\u2019s right to a fair trial was seriously jeopardized; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Negron, </em>221 Conn. 315, 330, 603 A.2d 1138 (1992); because he did not object until after the trial court\u2019s charge and requested that the court hold its ruling in abeyance until after the verdict. Fkuther, the defendant did not ask the trial court to give a curative instruction to avert any prejudice that may have resulted from the allegedly improper remarks of the state\u2019s attorney. Where prejudice to the defendant could have been remedied by the court\u2019s curative instruction, defense counsel cannot opt for a new trial instead of a curative instruction, as if the two were interchangeable. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hawthorne, </em>176 Conn. 367, 373-74, 407 A.2d 1001 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>McNellis, </em>15 Conn. App. 416, 438, 546 A.2d 292, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 809, 548 A.2d 441 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b751-9\"> The defendant also puts forth a \u201cfair trial\u201d argument in that he posits that Nicholson testified that the defendant told him that a green car had driven up to the area of the Corbett home, that an old, white, gray haired man pulled a woman out of the car, banged her head on the car and threw the body over the fence. The defendant maintains that because the state was permitted to demonstrate this fact to the jury, the defendant should not be excluded from offering evidence of a third party suspect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b751-10\"> The defendant never presented evidence concerning his third party claim. Knowledge regarding notice of the evidence came from representations of counsel in arguing the motion in limine and the police incident report marked as an exhibit for identification. Although representations of counsel are not evidence; <em>State </em>v. <em>Tillman, </em>220 Conn. 487, 496, 600 A.2d 738 (1991), cert. denied, 505 U.S. 1207, 112 S. Ct. 3000, 120 L. Ed. 2d 876 (1992); the trial court relied on these uncontroverted representations in its ruling. In the police incident report, the driver\u2019s date of birth is April 20, 1970, and he is described as \u201cwhite male, 6\u20194\u201d, 150 lb., light, fair complex, blue eyes, blonde hair, slender build.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b752-8\"> During direct examination, Nicholson and the other witness testified, not in response to a direct question on the issue but in narrative, as to what the defendant told them about events on the night Erica was murdered. The testimony was not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b752-9\"> \u201cI\u2019m going to grant the motion to exclude that ... I\u2019ll find that this would only lead to extremely confusing side issues. . . . There appears to be no connection with this car to the location of this crime . . . nor of either of the occupants found in the car to the location of this crime. . . . Moreover, the description of the knife appears dissimilar, in addition to there being no blood found on the knife. . . .Ido think the prejudicial value would far outweigh the relevance ... it would lead to much confusion . . . as well as a waste of time.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b754-6\"> In view of our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim, we necessarily conclude that the defendant was not deprived of his constitutional right to a fair trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>208 Conn. 365, 376, 545 A.2d 1048 (1988). Relevancy is an evidentiary question and \u201c[e]very evidentiary ruling which denies a defendant a line of inquiry to which he thinks he is entitled is not constitutional error.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>197 Conn. 396, 403, 497 A.2d 956 (1985). The defendant has placed a constitutional label on a nonconstitutional claim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gooch, </em>186 Conn. 17, 18, 438 A.2d 867 (1982). \u201cThe defendant\u2019s rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses and to present a defense do not give him the right to have admitted any evidence he chooses.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Negron, </em>221 Conn. 315, 328, 603 A.2d 1138 (1992). In the exercise of his rights, the defendant, as well as the state, must comply with the established rules of evidence and procedure. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>199 Conn. 473, 479, 507 A.2d 1387 (1986). We find no merit in the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">The defendant\u2019s claim that the state opened the door to the inquiry and, therefore, the defendant was entitled to present evidence of the vehicle stop is of equal merit. \u201cThe doctrine of opening the door cannot, of course, be subverted into a rule for injection of prejudice. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lum, </em>466 F. Sup. 328, 335 [(D. Del.), aff'd, 605 F.2d 1198 (3d Cir. 1979)], quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Winston, </em>447 F.2d 1236, 1240 (D.C. Cir. 1971).\u201d (Internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>194 Conn. 483, 499, 481 A.2d 741 (1984). The state never delved into the issue of a possible third party culprit. In fact, the state objected to the subject when defense counsel attempted to ask questions on cross-examination of Nicholson and the other witness. Although Nicholson did relate the defendant\u2019s claims on the night of the homicide, the testimony was in the nature of a narrative of the night\u2019s events. The second witness\u2019 testimony did not include the defendant\u2019s description of the car or its occupants. Even if we were to assume, without deciding, that the state was deemed to have opened the door, that does not mean that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the evidence. While a court may determine that the balance of equities requires that a party be able to explore an issue opened up by the other side, the court must be free to restrict that evidence due to its lack of probative value and potential for delay and confusion. The trial court found that producing evidence of a motor vehicle stop where there was no evidence connecting the vehicle\u2019s occupants to the homicide was a waste of time. Rather than advancing the truth seeking process, the admission of this evidence would have derailed it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b756-7\"> The following colloquy took place during the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Eric.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-8\">\u201cQ.
