He contends the district court erred by applying a 12-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 based on his prior conviction of knowing or intentional delivery of marijuana. <em>See </em>Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \u00a7 481.120(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">According to Torres-Rodriguez, the \u00a7 2L1.2 enhancement is inapplicable to his prior conviction because the Texas statute could be violated by the administration of marijuana, an act outside of the generic definition of a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2. We review de novo this preserved objection. <em>United States v. Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d 453, 457 (5th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1892, - L.Ed.2d - (2015). However, Torres-Rodriguez cites no Texas cases, nor any facts in his own situation, showing that Texas courts have applied \u00a7 481.120 to administering. Under <em>Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d at 460, such a showing of a theoretical possibility, as opposed to a realistic probability, is insufficient to show error.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-18\">Torres-Rodriguez additionally contends that the \u00a7 2L1.2 enhancement is inapplicable because the Texas statute may encompass giving away a controlled substance for no remuneration, also conduct outside of the gen\u00e9ric definition of a drug trafficking offense. This court recently rejected the argument that an offense must require remuneration to qualify as a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>782 F.3d 198, 201-05 (5th Cir.2015). Accordingly, Torres-Rodriguez\u2019s argument is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b305-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
