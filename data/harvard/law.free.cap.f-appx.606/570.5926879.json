The district court ruled that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction because Eisenberg failed to allege that there was complete diversity of citizenship among the parties. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(1). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-20\">The district court did not err by dismissing Eisenberg\u2019s complaint. When federal jurisdiction is invoked based on diversity of the parties, the complaint must allege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>that the plaintiff and the defendants are citizens of different states. <em>Id. </em>As the district court stated in its order of dismissal without prejudice, the complaint failed to allege the citizenship of Eisenberg or McCulley or to allege the principal place of business of Smithport Freight.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion when it denied Eisenberg\u2019s later motion to amend. Eisenberg\u2019s amended complaint contained the same deficiency involving Smithport Freight. Because a corporation is \u201cdeemed to be a citizen of every State and foreign state by which it has been incorporated and ... where it has its principal place of business,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1332(c)(1), the district court could not determine whether complete diversity existed among the parties. <em>McGovern v. Am. Airlines, Inc., </em>511 F.2d 653, 654 (5th Cir.1975). Moreover, the district court made clear that Eisenberg remained free to refile this action if she believed that federal jurisdiction could be established.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">We AFFIRM the dismissal of Eisen-berg\u2019s complaint without prejudice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
