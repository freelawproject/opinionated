The district court sentenced Cardenas to a mandatory life sentence based on his three prior felony drug convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-23\">For the first time on appeal, Cardenas raises four issues: (1) violation of his constitutional rights under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), by raising his statutory minimum sentence based on prior convictions that were not charged in the indictment or proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) wrongly treating his three related prior felony drug convictions as separate convictions instead of as a single conviction; (3) violation of <em>Alleyne </em>by increasing his guidelines sentence range based on facts not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt; and (4) violation of the Eighth Amendment by imposing sentences that were grossly disproportionate to his crimes. As Cardenas-did not raise these issues in the district court, we review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Salazar, </em>542 F.3d 139, 147 (5th Cir.2008). To establish plain error, Carde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>nas must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error, but we should do so only .if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">As Cardenas concedes, his <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Alleyne </em>argument, his second <em>Alleyne </em>argument, and his Eighth Amendment argument are foreclosed. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 961, 994-96, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991); <em>Rummel v. Estelle, </em>445 U.S. 263, 284-85, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 63 L.Ed.2d 382 (1980); <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>759 F.3d 486, 497 (5th Cir.2014); <em>United States v. Tumo, </em>738 F.3d 681, 693 (5th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2875, 189 L.Ed.2d 835 (2014). Cardenas\u2019s prior felony drug convictions were for offenses that were committed sequentially, not simultaneously, so the district court did not commit error, plain or otherwise, by treating them as separate convictions. <em>See United States v. Barr, </em>130 F.3d 711, 712 (5th Cir.1997). Cardenas urges us not to follow <em>Barr </em>and adopt the precedent of other circuits, but we may not overrule the holding in <em>Barr </em>absent an intervening statutory change, Supreme Court decision, or en banc decision of this court. <em>See Jacobs v. Nat\u2019l Drug Intelligence Ctr., </em>548 F.3d 375, 378 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b274-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
