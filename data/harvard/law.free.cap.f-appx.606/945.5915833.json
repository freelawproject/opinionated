She was originally hired as the librarian in the facility\u2019s education department. When CCA learned one year later that Jackson did not have a library sciences degree \u2014 a requirement for the librarian position \u2014 she was encouraged to apply for other positions at the facility. Jackson applied for and accepted a case manager position, which she held for three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\">In April 2008, Jackson wanted to be back in the education department and applied for and accepted the librarian aide position. At the time, Jackson\u2019s old librarian position was vacant. Jackson testified that from the time she started as librarian aide until her resignation, she performed the duties of both the librarian aide and the librarian. That testimony is corroborated by Jackson\u2019s performance review covering the period of November 1, 2008, to October 81, 2009, which indicated that she was \u201caccountable as librarian and library aide simultaneously\u201d and \u201cha[d] supervised library services for the last 17 months as librarian even though uncompensated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">In February 2009, Jackson submitted an \u201cinformal application\u201d for the vacant librarian position, .hoping that the library sciences degree requirement could be waived. In September 2009, she devel-' oped irritable bowel syndrome and asked to work from home more often. CCA approved a modified work schedule and gave Jackson timesheets with instructions to keep a log of hours worked and tasks completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">As far as we can tell from the record and the briefs on appeal, Jackson claims that she worked, on average, 7.5 to 10 hours per week of unpaid overtime between April 2009 and September 2009, and 5 to 10 hours of overtime per week between September 2009 and February 2010. Those alleged overtime hours included both \u201con the clock\u201d hours at the McRae facility and \u201coff the clock\u201d hours worked from home. Jackson has never specified how many hours fell into each category. She acknowledges, however, that she was properly compensated for the \u201con the clock\u201d hours and says that the overtime .pay was accompanied by \u201cverbal reprimands\u201d and instructions from CCA to not exceed 40 hours per week. Jackson testified that she nonetheless continued working extra hours from home \u201cbecause [she] wanted the [librarian] position.\u201d' When asked by CCA\u2019s counsel whether she reported any of the alleged overtime hours on her timesheets, Jackson responded, \u201cI think only once.... in January [2010].\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jackson explained that she did not typically record her overtime because it was her belief that \u201cno one was planning on compensating me for those hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">Jackson further testified that she repeatedly complained about working unpaid overtime. She went to CCA\u2019s human resources manager \u201con approximately six occasions between April 2008 and February 1, 2010,\u201d to' the assistant warden \u201con two occasions in the fall of 2009,\u201d and to the warden \u201con three occasions during early summer of 2008 and early and mid 2009.\u201d According to Jackson, those individuals \u201ctold [her] that [she] would not be paid overtime, but they never instructed [her] not to work overtime.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>In November 2009, CCA told Jackson that she would not be selected for the librarian position due to budgetary concerns. In February 2010, Jackson received a memorandum from CCA instructing her to return to a normal work schedule at the McRae facility and cease working from home. Instead of returning to a normal schedule, Jackson took leave under the Family Medical Leave Act, and then, in May 2010, resigned from CCA altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">In December 2011, Jackson filed a complaint alleging various violations of Title VII, \u00a7 1981, the FLSA, and state tort law. At the time of filing, Jackson was represented by K. Prabhaker Reddy. Fourteen days before the initial discovery deadline, Reddy moved to withdraw as Jackson\u2019s counsel and Jackson moved to extend discovery. The court granted both motions and set the discovery deadline for December 26, 2012. The court instructed Jackson to obtain replacement counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">On December 4, Jackson moved for another extension of time to complete discovery and to seek counsel. The district court granted the motion, set a new discovery deadline for April 5, 2018, and stated that Jackson\u2019s new counsel should enter an appearance by January 25, 2013. On January 29, Jackson filed a \u201cnotice to continue to seek legal counsel\u201d in which she sought an additional 14 days. On March 26, the court administratively closed the case, citing Jackson\u2019s failure to retain counsel and the numerous extensions it had already granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">In April 2013, Jackson retained Ains-worth Dudley as her new counsel. Dudley entered an appearance and moved to reopen the case and extend discovery by 60 days. The district court granted the motion and set the discovery deadline for July 22, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">On July 3, 2013, less than 20 days before the discovery deadline, Jackson filed a motion to compel discovery in which she complained that CCA had not fully responded' to her discovery requests. Specifically, Jackson asserted that CCA had not yet responded to a discovery-deficiency letter from Reddy (Jackson\u2019s original counsel). On July 18, CCA and Jackson filed a joint motion to (1) stay CCA\u2019s response to Jackson\u2019s motion to compel, and (2) extend discovery and summary judgment deadlines by 45 days. The district court granted the motion and set the discovery deadline for September 5, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-10\">On that deadline \u2014 September 5, 2013\u2014 Jackson filed a second motion to compel discovery. CCA filed briefs in opposition to both motions to compel. Regarding the discovery-deficiency letter, CCA stated that it had never received the letter from Reddy; instead, it had received a copy of Reddy\u2019s letter attached to an email from Dudley and it did not respond to the letter because Reddy no longer represented Jackson. Based on emails provided to the court, CCA repeatedly advised Dudley that it. would respond to the letter if he would first ratify its contents, to which Dudley never responded. The district court referred both motions to compel to a magistrate judge. On October 22, 2013, the magistrate judge denied Jackson\u2019s motions to compel in a 10-page order that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>made extensive findings of fact and concluded that those facts \u201cevidence[d] a complete absence of diligence and good faith throughout the discovery period by [Jackson].\u201d Jackson filed objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s order, but the district court overruled them.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">On November 21, 2013, CCA moved for summary judgment on all of Jackson\u2019s claims. CCA attached to its motion a copy of its compensation policy, but the effective date on the policy was April 15, 2011, well after Jackson\u2019s resignation. CCA\u2019s exhibits did not include any timesheets, records, or other documentation of the hours Jackson worked during the relevant time period (or any other period for that matter).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">Dudley, on behalf of Jackson, responded to CCA\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The response neglected to address many of CCA\u2019s arguments, but it did argue that Jackson had established a prima facie case under the FLSA because her testimony created a genuine issue of material fact about whether she worked overtime without pay and whether CCA was aware of it. Dudley\u2019s statement of material facts cited almost exclusively to Jackson\u2019s sworn declaration, which was attached as an exhibit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">Two weeks after Dudley filed Jackson\u2019s response, Jackson filed a motion for leave to file a <em>pro se </em>supplemental response to CCA\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Dudley signed and filed the motion for leave, but wrote that his client wanted \u201can opportunity to present this evidence and raise these arguments with the Court on a <em>pro se </em>basis.\u201d The <em>pro se </em>supplemental response, prepared by Jackson, was attached to the motion along with several new exhibits and a revised statement- of material facts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The supplemental response included arguments and evidence that had not been raised or referred to in the initial response.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">The district court held a' hearing on CCA\u2019s motion for summary judgment and Jackson\u2019s motion for leave to file a <em>pro se </em>supplemental response. Regarding the latter motion, the court informed Jackson that she could not \u201chave it both ways\u201d and represent herself while also represented by counsel. Dudley told the court that he did not endorse or join Jackson\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-11\">One day after the hearing, the district court denied Jackson\u2019s motion, reiterating that \u201cshe [could] not be represented by counsel <em>and </em>file materials <em>pro </em>se.\u201d The day after that, Dudley filed a motion to withdraw as Jackson\u2019s counsel. Several days passed before Jackson filed a notice of her intent to proceed <em>pro se </em>and a motion requesting that the court reconsider its stance on her <em>pro se </em>supplemental response. The court granted Dudley\u2019s motion to withdraw and denied Jackson\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-12\">On February 11, 2014, the court granted CCA\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all of Jackson\u2019s claims. Regarding Jackson\u2019s FLSA claim, the court found that (1) any overtime claim that may have accrued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>before December 23, 2008 \u2014 three years before Jackson filed her complaint \u2014 was barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and (2) Jackson had \u201cfail[ed] to create a genuine issue of fact that she worked overtime without compensation\u201d after December 23, 2008. The court noted that Jackson\u2019s failure to \u201ctrack and log her time accurately\u201d while working from home was \u201cparticularly detrimental to her claim.\u201d For that reason and others, the district court concluded that CCA was entitled to summary judgment on Jackson\u2019s FLSA claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">This is Jackson\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"A8M\">Jackson first contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying her motions to compel. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to compel discovery for an abuse of discretion. <em>Hol-loman v. Mail-Well Corp., </em>443 F.3d 832, 837 (11th Cir.2006). The district court has broad discretion to compel or deny discovery, and we will therefore leave undisturbed a district court\u2019s ruling unless we find that it made a clear error of judgment or applied the wrong legal standard. <em>Jo-sendis v. Wall to Wall Residence Repairs, Inc., </em>662 F.3d 1292, 1306-07 (11th Cir. 2011). A district court does not abuse its discretion in denying motions to compel for failure to comply with the good faith conferral requirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37 where \u201cthe district court\u2019s interpretation of the facts [is not] untenable.\u201d <em>Holloman, </em>443 F.3d at 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-9\">The magistrate judge\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned order denying Jackson\u2019s motions to compel included a meticulous chronology of correspondence between the parties during relevant portions of the extended discovery period. The findings of fact that flowed naturally from that chronology were far from \u201cuntenable.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Critically, Jackson does not argue on appeal that the findings of fact were erroneous; instead, she reiterates the same arguments that she made to the district court and otherwise rails against what she perceives to be CCA\u2019s calculated and willful dodging of discovery. But regardless of whether Jackson\u2019s perception is grounded in reality, it is not grounded in the record.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Having carefully reviewed that record, we agree with the magistrate\u2019s judge conclusion that it \u201cevidences a complete absence of diligence and good faith throughout the discovery period by [Jackson].\u201d Thus, the court\u2019s denial of Jackson\u2019s motions to compel was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">Next, Jackson contends that the district court abused its discretion by not granting her leave to file a <em>pro se </em>supplemental response to CCA\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>See Scantland v. Jeffry Knight, Inc., </em>721 F.3d 1308, 1320 (11th Cir.2013) (\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision made in the course of managing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>its docket for an abuse of discretion.\u201d); <em>see also Mann v. Taser Int\u2019l Inc., </em>588 F.3d 1291, 1302 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cWe ... review a district court\u2019s application of local rules for an abuse of discretion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">It is undisputed that at the time Jackson sought the court\u2019s leave, she was still represented by Dudley, who had already filed a response to CCA\u2019s motion for summary judgment. At a hearing on this and other motions, the district court told Jackson that it would not consider <em>pro se </em>filings while she was still represented by counsel. In its order denying Jackson\u2019s motion, the court wrote: \u201cAs explained to Plaintiff at the hearing on January 21, 2014, she may not be represented by counsel <em>and </em>file materials <em>pro se.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">The court\u2019s unqualified statement that Jackson could not at the same time be represented by counsel and file materials <em>pro se </em>implies an unqualified rule. But the relevant rule actually states that \u201c[a] party represented by counsel may not file any motion, brief, or other paper <em>pro se absent prior leave of court.\u201d </em>U.S. Dist. Ct. Rules, S.D. Ga., L.R. 11.3 (emphasis added). The emphasized language is critical here because Jackson\u2019s <em>pro se </em>supplemental response was not, as the court\u2019s order would seem to suggest, a stand-alone filing; it was instead attached to her motion for leave of the court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court did not explain why it was denying leave in this particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"AZI\">In any event, upon a careful review of Jackson\u2019s proposed supplemental response, we conclude that any error in the court\u2019s decision to deny Jackson\u2019s motion for leave of the court to file the response was harmless error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 61 (error is harmless if it \u201cdoes not affect'the substantial rights of the parties\u201d); <em>EEOC v. Alton Packaging Corp., </em>910 F.2d 920, 924 (11th Cir.1990) (\u201cA reviewing court must disregard as harmless error any error which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d). Simply put, none of the arguments raised by Jackson\u2019s supplemental response had any merit, and therefore her substantial rights were not affected by the court\u2019s failure to allow or consider those arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of CCA on Jackson\u2019s FLSA claim, applying the same standards as the district court and viewing all facts and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to Jackson. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2513, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); <em>Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., </em>257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir.2001).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> '</p>\n<p id=\"b980-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>It is well established that an employee bringing a claim for unpaid overtime wages must' initially demonstrate that she performed work for which she was not properly compensated. <em>See, e.g., Allen v. Bd. of Pub. Educ., </em>495 F.3d 1306, 1314-15 (11th Cir.2007). However, \u201cit is the employer\u2019s duty to keep records of the employer\u2019s wages, hours, and other conditions and practices of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1315. For that reason, in situations where the employer has failed to keep records or the records cannot be trusted, the employee satisfies her burden of proving that she performed work without compensation if she \u201cproduces sufficient evidence to show the amount and extent of that work as a matter of just and reasonable inference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1316 (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Lamonica v. Safe Hurricane Shutters, Inc., </em>711 F.3d 1299, 1315 (11th Cir. 2013) (noting that if the employer failed to keep time records, the burden on the employee to show that she worked overtime without compensation is \u201crelaxed\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">Here, Jackson failed to meet even the relaxed burden of \u201cproducing] sufficient evidence to show the amount and extent of that work as a matter of just and reasonable inference.\u201d <em>See Allen, </em>495 F.3d at 1316. She has never stated with any clarity or precision the number of hours she allegedly worked, the amount or nature of that work, where or when the work was completed, or anything else that would assist a factfinder in approximating Jackson\u2019s unpaid overtime. It is undisputed that CCA provided Jackson with time-sheets to document both her time and tasks completed while she was working from home. But the only month for which Jackson documented any overtime hours was January of 2010, and as'far as we can tell, she does not include those extra hours among the ones she claims were unpaid. Jackson\u2019s vague and contradictory assertions concerning the number of hours she worked from home<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> are not evidence from which can be drawn just and reasonable inferences about the nature or extent of that work. <em>See id. </em>We agree with the district court that Jackson failed to create a genuine issue of material fact about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>whether she performed work for which she was not paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">Finally, Jackson contends that the district court abused its discretion in taxing litigation costs against her under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1), but she has not preserved this claim for appeal because she failed to object to the award of costs in district court. <em>United States EEOC v.W &amp; 0, Inc., </em>213 F.3d 600, 620 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cFailure to raise an issue, objection or theory of relief in the first instance to the trial court generally is fatal.\u201d). Even if she had preserved the claim for appeal, we see no reason to disturb the district court\u2019s decision to award litigation costs. <em>See id. </em>at 619 (\u201cThis Court will not disturb a costs award in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b975-7\">. Jackson does not claim, at least as far as we can tell, that she was not paid for the overtime hours she reported in January 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b975-8\">. In November 2009, Jackson filed a formal grievance with CCA alleging, among other things, that she had made the assistant warden aware that she had been worldng unpaid overtime from home to complete the duties of two positions and \"he had no reply or problem with [it].\u201d CCA investigated the claim internally and concluded that it was unsubstantiated. Jackson also testified about a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>versation she had with a supervisor when she was \"about two hours short\u201d of the 40-hour workweek for a few weeks in the summer of 2009. Her supervisor told her that she needed to fill out \"deviation forms\u201d to report the missed time. Jackson complained that it was . \"unfair\u201d that she had not been compensated for overtime but was now \"getting in trouble\u201d for missed time. According to Jackson, her supervisor said that she could fill in the missed time on her timesheet with the extra hours she had worked from home, but did not indicate that she could be compensated for all of her hours.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b977-8\">. The declaration stated in relevant part: (1) \u201cIn April of 2008, [Jackson] began working as librarian] aide;\u201d (2) \u201cFor the first six or seven months she was employed as librarian] aid[e] she worked 7.5 to 10 overtime hour per week without pay;\u201d (3) \"In September 2009, she began working 5 [to] 10 hours per week without pay;\u201d (4) \u201c[Jackson] complained about not being paid overtime to her human resources manager ... to Assistant Warden Orsolits ... [and] to Warden Wells;\u201d and (5) \"CCA refused to pay overtime, but never instructed her not to work overtime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b977-14\">. CCA opposed the motion, arguing that Jackson should not be permitted to file <em>pro se </em>documents while represented by counsel, the supplemental response was untimely, Jackson had failed to allege cause or excusable neglect for her untimeliness, and the litigation -had gone on long enough.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b978-7\">. In addition to its findings and conclusions on Jackson\u2019s FLSA claim, the court found that Jackson had abandoned all but two claims (her FLSA claim and her race discrimination claim based on CCA's alleged failure to promote her to the librarian position) and that CCA was entitled to summary judgment on the failure to promote claim. Jackson does not challenge those findings on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b978-12\">. One illustration of Jackson\u2019s skewed perception is the disputed discovery-deficiency letter. CCA told Dudley on more than one occasion that it would respond to Reddy\u2019s letter if he \u2014 Dudley\u2014would ratify its contents. That was a perfectly reasonable request to which Dudley never responded. It should be noted that a delayed response or non-response to communication from opposing counsel appears to have been Dudley\u2019s modus operandi.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b979-7\">. The court cited an unpublished decision of \u25a0 our Court concluding that it was not an abuse of discretion for a district court to strike a <em>pro se </em>motion filed by a party represented by counsel where that court had a local rule prohibiting the filing of such a motion absent prior leave of court, and no such leave had been obtained. <em>See Jones v. United Space Alliance, L.L.C., </em>170 Fed.Appx. -52, 57 (11th Cir.2006) (unpublished). Not only does <em>Jones </em>lack precedential effect because it is unpublished, it also lacks persuasive effect because it does not speak to the issue before us now. The litigant in <em>Jones </em>filed a <em>pro se </em>paper without first obtaining leave of the court, a clear violation of those local rules. Here, Jackson moved the court for leave to file her <em>pro se </em>supplemental response, an action that the relevant local rules do not proscribe.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b979-13\">. Jackson has abandoned any challenge to the district court's grant of summary judgment on claims other than the portion of her FLSA claim that allegedly accrued on or after December 23, 2008. She did so by not arguing to us that the district court erred in: (1) finding that any unpaid overtime claim that may have accrued before December 23, 2008 \u2014 three years before Jackson filed her complaint \u2014 was barred by the applicable stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>ute of limitations; (2) granting summary judgment to CCA on her racial discrimination claims under \u00a7 1981 and Title VII; and (3) concluding that she had abandoned the other claims raised in her amended complaint. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (\"While we read briefs filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants liberally, issues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b980-6\">. If the employee satisfies her burden, the burden then shifts to the employer to present evidence that negates the reasonableness of the inference to be drawn from the employee\u2019s evidence. <em>Lamonica, </em>711 F.3d at 1315. In this case, we conclude that the burden never shifted to CCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b980-7\">. Statements made in Jackson's sworn declaration contradict statements made during her deposition. For example, her sworn declaration states that she worked \"7.5 [to] 10 hours per week\u201d of uncompensated overtime, \"for the first six or seven months that [she] worked as [a] library aid[e].\" By contrast, she stated in her deposition that she worked \u201c15, 20 hours a week ... for maybe [the first] six, seven months.\" Setting aside the obvious discrepancy in hours, we also note that the \"first six or seven months\u201d of Jackson's tenure as librarian aide translates roughly to April through September <em>2008, </em>which contradicts other parts of the record reflecting that Jackson\u2019s overtime claim accrued in <em>2009; </em>indeed, Jackson\u2019s response brief in opposition to CCA\u2019s motion for summary judgment stated that she worked \u201cbetween 7.5 to 10 hours [per] week overtime from April to September, <em>2009.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) Although those errors might be merely typographical, they are representative of a poorly developed, poorly compiled, and poorly presented factual record. In light of the state of the record, the district court was left with no choice but to grant summary judgment in favor of CCA, and we are left with no choice but to affirm.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
