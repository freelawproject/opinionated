Defendant argues that the district court erred by failing to give \u201cequitable\u201d consideration to the excess time he spent in prison and by neglecting to consult his probation officer; thereby failing to take into account his conduct and progress while serving his term of supervised release. After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">After a jury trial, Defendant was convicted on three counts: (1) conspiracy to distribute cocaine and cocaine base; (2) conspiracy to violate the Hobbs Act, through a series of robberies and threats of physical violence; and (3) conspiracy to use firearms during a drug-trafficking crime. The presentence report in this case sets out the following facts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon his release from state custody in November 1990, Defendant became involved in a violent drug distribution organization. To finance their operation and obtain drugs, organization members would rob other drug dealers, \u201cshot house\u201d operators, and gambling establishments \u2014 often while dressed as police officers. On several occasions, organization members shot or otherwise injured their victims, and in December 1991, they killed a drug dealer from whom they had just taken, \u201ccrack cocaine and cash.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b982-13\">Having joined the conspiracy late, Defendant\u2019s known involvement in the organization\u2019s drug trade was limited to three deliveries of cocaine base (\u201ccrack cocaine\u201d), the total amount of which the district court found to be between 50 and 150 grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-14\">The presentence report further concluded that Defendant not only delivered drugs for the organization, but he had also involved himself in three violent incidents on its- behalf. First, on July 21, 1991, he participated in the. robbery of a \u201chigh stakes gambling house[,]\u201d during which he was armed with a shotgun. Notably, one of the victims of the robbery was instructed, to kneel on the floor, where he was shot in the ,arm and side with a shotgun. Second, on November 21,1991, Defendant and a number of co-conspirators \u201cfired shotguns and pistols\u201d into the residence of an individual who owed them $2,400. While the gunfire did not injure anyone, it narrowly missed the debtor\u2019s wife and children.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-15\">But it should be noted that Defendant was acquitted of the \u00a7 924(c) counts (Counts 11 and 14), which charged him with the substantive offense of using and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>carrying a firearm during a drug trafficking crime and during a crime of violence offense, as charged in Counts 1 and 2, respectively. Count 11 presumably references the July 21 armed robbery and Count 14 presumably references the November 21 shooting as those dates are listed as the dates the offenses were committed. Nevertheless, he was convicted of Counts 1 and 2, which charged him, respectively, with conspiracy to distribute drugs and conspiracy to violate the Hobbs Act through a series of robberies and violent threats. Further, of the overt acts listed in Count 2, Defendant was listed in only one: the November 21 incident where he and co-defendant Clowers were alleged to have shot at Jesse Moseley.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">The presentence report also indicated that Defendant was present for the planning of a December 1991 robbery in which the victim was killed, and that he possibly even participated in the crime. The latter incident signaled the beginning of the end for the drug distribution organization. Within two weeks, the organization kidnapped, shot, and killed one of its own members, after learning that this member intended to inform police about the organization\u2019s crimes. This event precipitated the flight to New York of some members of the organization, and the arrests of others. Then, in 1992, a grand jury returned an indictment against various members of the drug distribution organization, including Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">In sentencing Defendant, the district court determined his Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 range to be 360 months to life,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and sentenced him to the low-end of the Guidelines\u2019 range: 360 months in prison, followed by a five-year term of supervised release. We affirmed Defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence on appeal. <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>131 F.3d 951, 952, 956 (11th Cir.1997), <em>cert. denied </em>525 U.S. 892, 119 S.Ct. 211, 142 L.Ed.2d 173 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">In February 2008, Defendant moved the district court to reduce his sentence in light of Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which lowered the offense level for specified thresholds of crack cocaine. The court granted Defendant\u2019s motion, lowering his total offense level to 35 and imposing a sentence at the low-end of the Guidelines\u2019 range of 292 months\u2019 imprisonment. Then, in October 2011, after a second, similar amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines \u2014 Amendment 750 \u2014 Defendant again moved the district court to modify his sentence. Once again, the court granted Defendant\u2019s motion, reducing his offense level for the drug trafficking count of conviction. The court\u2019s graht of Defendant\u2019s second motion resulted in the lowering of the base offense level for his Count 1 drug conspiracy conviction to 28. Two levels were then added, pursuant to the dangerous weapon enhancement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>\u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), to arrive at an adjusted, offense level of 30. However, with this latest reduction, the crack cocaine count of conviction no longer gave rise to Defendant\u2019s highest adjusted offense level. Rather, at 31, the adjusted offense level for Defendant\u2019s Hobbs Act conspiracy conviction achieved that distinction. Consequently, the court added three levels to this latter adjusted offense level to account for Defendant\u2019s multiple offenses, pursuant to \u00a7 3D1.4. Because Defendant had 13 criminal history points and a criminal history category of VI, his Guidelines\u2019 range became 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5A. The district court imposed a 262-month sentence. Notably, the term of Defendant\u2019s supervised release did not change with either modification of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">After serving 228 months of this 262-month sentence, Defendant was released on January 24, 2012,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> at which point he began serving his five-year term of supervised release. Nearly two-and-a-half years into that term, Defendant requested that the district court terminate early his supervised release, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(1). In support of his request, Defendant argued that (1) given the reductions triggered by Amendments 706 and 750, he had spent five extra years in prison; (2) he has fulfilled the conditions of his supervised release; (3) he has held steady employment since his release from prison; (4) he is pursuing a degree at a technical college; and (5) he is not a risk to public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">The district court denied Defendant\u2019s motion in a summary order issued May 28, 2014. Defendant moved for reconsideration, which the court granted \u201cfor the limited purpose of clarifying [its] previous order.\u201d Specifically, the district court responded that it had denied Defendant\u2019s motion for early termination of supervised release because of \u201cparticular concern[] about the violent nature of the crimes for which Defendant was convicted and the overarching need to protect the public from further crimes by Defendant.\u201d This appeal followed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">We review a district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3), for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Cunningham, </em>607 F.3d 1264, 1266 (11th Cir.2010). In addition, we ordinarily review the imposition of a special condition of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Zinn, </em>321 F.3d 1084, 1087-88 (11th Cir. 2003). For that reason, we will assume that review of the denial of a motion for early termination of supervised release <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>should likewise be subject to an abuse of discretion standard.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">In challenging the denial of his motion for early termination, Defendant argues that the district court erred (1) by failing to give equitable consideration to the excess time he spent in prison and (2) by neglecting to consult Defendant\u2019s probation officer, thereby failing to take into account Defendant\u2019s conduct and progress while serving his term of supervised release. We address each of Defendant\u2019s arguments in turn. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">A. Equitable Consideration of Excess Prison Time</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">Defendant\u2019s first argument, that the district court erred by failing to give equitable consideration to any excess time he spent in prison, is premised on <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>529 U.S. 58, 120 S.Ct. 1114, 146 L.Ed.2d 39 (2000). There, the Supreme Court considered whether a defendant\u2019s excess imprisonment should be credited to his supervised release term, thereby reducing its length. <em>Id. </em>at 54,120 S.Ct. 1114. Reciting the language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(e), the Court noted that, with limited, inapplicable exceptions, a term of supervised release does not \u201ccommence until an individual is \u2018released from imprisonment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57-59, 120 S.Ct. 1114. The Court further emphasized that imprisonment and supervised release serve separate and distinct ends. <em>Id. </em>at 59-60, 120 S.Ct. 1114. Consequently, the Court held that a term of supervised release is not required to be shortened by excess time an individual spends in prison. <em>Johnson, </em>529 U.S. at 54, 58, 60, 120 S.Ct. 1114.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">That said, though, the Supreme Court acknowledged that \u201cequitable considerations of great weight exist when an individual is incarcerated beyond the proper expiration of his prison term.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60, 120 S.Ct. 1114. Thus, while incarceration in excess of the appropriate sentence does not require a court to shorten a term of supervised release, a district court can certainly take that fact into account when deciding whether to terminate early the defendant\u2019s supervised release. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">Here, Defendant asserts that he was in prison five-and-a-half years longer than he should have been. This is so because, in Defendant\u2019s view, Amendment 750 directed that his sentence should have been between 140 and 175 months, rather than the 262-month sentence he ultimately received. Even though Defendant actually served only 228 months, he notes that this period of time also exceeds the amended Guidelines\u2019 range that he says should have applied. Accordingly, Defendant argues that the district court should have taken this excess imprisonment into account when ruling on his motion for early termination of supervised release, and that the court erred by not doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-11\">Contrary to Defendant\u2019s assertion, however, the district court did not err by refusing to give dispositive effect to Defendant\u2019s allegedly excessive incarceration. First, and importantly, Defendant did <em>not </em>spend any excess time in prison, albeit he persists in claiming that he did. <em>See infra </em>at 958-59. Contrary to his contention, application of Amendment 750 to his case in 2011 did not mean that Defendant\u2019s sentencing range was to be between 140 and 175 months.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The November 2011 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>resentencing did lower the adjusted offense level for Defendant\u2019s Count 1 drug conspiracy conviction to 30. However, this adjustment meant that the offense level for Defendant\u2019s Hobbs Act conspiracy conviction, which was 31, now became the highest offense level for a count of conviction. <em>See </em>discussion <em>supra </em>at 955-56. Consequently, when the district court calculated Defendant\u2019s new Guidelines\u2019 range, it did so based upon this latter offense level of 31. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4. Given Defendant\u2019s criminal history category of VI, the resulting Guidelines\u2019 range for Defendant\u2019s Hobbs Act conspiracy conviction was 262 to 327 months. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5A. The district court then sentenced Defendant to the low-end of this Guidelines\u2019 range, 262 months, of which he served 228 months. In short, Defendant served no excess time in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">Second, while <em>Johnson </em>permits a district court to consider excess imprisonment when ruling on a motion to terminate early an individual\u2019s supervised release, it does not require the court to end supervision early, based just on that fact. <em>Johnson, </em>529 U.S. at 60, 120 S.Ct. 1114 (\u201cThe statutory structure provides a means to address [equitable considerations] ... the court <em>may </em>terminate an individual\u2019s supervised release obligations ... \u2018if it is satisfied that such action is warranted by the conduct of the defendant released and the interest of justice.\u2019 \u201d) (internal citation omitted) (emphasis added); <em>Reynolds v. Thomas, </em>603 F.3d 1144, 1148 (9th Cir.2010) (\u201cA court <em>could </em>consider this alleged period of over-incarceration under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) as a factor weighing in favor of reducing the term of supervised release.\u201d) (emphasis added), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Setser v. United States, </em>566 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 1463, 182 L.Ed.2d 455 (2012). Indeed, consistent with the structure of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), a district court\u2019s consideration of excess prison time is discretionary. <em>See Rhodes v. Judiscak, </em>676 F.3d 931, 933-35 (10th Cir.2012) and <em>Johnson v. Pettiford, </em>442 F.3d 917, 918 (5th Cir.2006) (\u201c[A] district court may exercise its discretion to modify an individual\u2019s term of supervised release, taking into account that an individual has been \u2018incarcerated beyond the proper expiration of his prison term.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">What\u2019s more, there is no indication here that when ruling on his motion for early termination of supervised release, the district court failed to take into consideration Defendant\u2019s claim that he had spent excess time in prison. Defendant raised that claim in both his initial motion to terminate supervision and in his motion for reconsideration, and the court\u2019s order granting in part the latter motion stated that it \u201cconsidered all the relevant factors and determined that early termination was inappropriate in this case.\u201d Notably, the district court had previously rejected, on at least two other occasions, Defendant\u2019s very same argument that Amendment 750 dictated that his sentence must fall within the Guidelines\u2019 range of 140 to 175 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">And finally, although excess imprisonment is an \u201cequitable consideration ] of great weight\u201d under <em>Johnson, </em>it does not automatically override other factors the district court must consider. Incarceration and supervised release serve different purposes: imprisonment is punitive, whereas supervised release aims to \u201cassist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>convicted felons in their transitions to community life.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>529 U.S. at 55, 59, 120 S.Ct. 1114. On this latter point, Congress acknowledged that a successful transition to community life depends upon a number of factors, and it left it to the district court to use its discretion in balancing those factors. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3558(a), 3583(e)(1); <em>see Zinn, </em>321 F.3d at 1089 (\u201c[E]ach [\u00a7 3553(a) factor] is an independent consideration to be weighed\u201d) and <em>United States v. Pregent, </em>190 F.3d 279, 282-83 (4th Cir.1999) (discussing, before issuance of <em>Johnson, </em>the factors a court considers when contemplating early termination of supervised release). To require early termination of release because of excess time served in prison would undermine this statutory framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Defendant\u2019s motion for early termination based on the latter\u2019s allegation that he had served more prison time than the Guidelines\u2019 range called for.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">B. Failure to Consider \u00a7 3553(a) Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">Defendant\u2019s second argument on appeal is that the district court did not \u201cfulfill its obligations under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)[.]\u201d As discussed below, he supports that argument with four related contentions. We are not persuaded by Defendant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">Section 3583(e) allows for early termination of supervision. It provides that a district court may, after considering certain enumerated provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-9\">terminate a term of supervised release and discharge the defendant released at any time after the expiration of one year of supervised release, pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure relating to the modification of probation, <em>if it is satisfied that such action is warranted by the conduct of the defendant released and the interest ofjusticej]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b987-11\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(1) (emphasis added). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors that the district court must consider are: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; (4) the need for the sentence imposed to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner; (5) the .kinds of sentence and sentencing range established for the applicable category of offense committed, as set forth in the Sentencing Guidelines; (6) pertinent policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission; (7) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and (8) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3583(e), 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D), (a)(4)-(7). As a general matter, in weighing the above considerations, the court need not \u2018\u201carticulate the applicability of each factor, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>576 F.3d 1216, 1219 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254,1256 (11th Cir.2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-12\">Defendant argues that the district court\u2019s denial of his motion constituted an abuse of discretion, and non-compliance with \u00a7 3553(a), . because: (1) the court \u201cfailed to consider any of [Defendant\u2019s] post-release conduct\u201d; (2) neither the Government nor Defendant\u2019s probation officer opposed the motion; (3) Defendant\u2019s pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>bation officer \u201cstated repeatedly [ ] that[,] as f[a]r as he is concerned[, Defendant] has fulfilled all the obligations of supervised release and [that] he did not oppose [Defendant\u2019s] supervised release being terminated, and [] would state the same to the district court if consulted\u201d; and (4) no factual basis exists from which to conclude that continued supervised release is required to assuage concerns about the violent nature of Defendant\u2019s offenses or to protect the public from future crimes by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">First, we disagree that the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, or more particularly the factor that Defendant urges the court should have most considered: Defendant\u2019s post-release conduct. While it is true that the district court\u2019s initial order denying Defendant\u2019s initial motion for early termination of supervised release failed to state that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when ruling on the motion, its order granting in part Defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration indicates that the court had considered these factors. <em>See Douglas, </em>576 F.3d at 1219 (a district court need not articulate the applicability of each \u00a7 3553(a) factor as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account.)</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">Indeed, that order was issued in response to Defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration, which specifically argued that the court had not considered \u00a7 3553(a) factors or Defendant\u2019s post-release conduct. Specifically, the district court acknowledged this allegation, noting \u201cAlthough not explicitly stated, the Court did rely on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in its Order denying Defendant\u2019s [initial motion] ... [and] the Court considered all the relevant factors [when it] determined that early termination was inappropriate in this case.\u201d The district court then went on to identify the primary reason for its denial of early termination of supervision: that is, its \u201cparticular! ] concern!] about the violent nature of the crimes for which Defendant was convicted and the overarching need to protect the public from further crimes by Defendant.\u201d In so clarifying, the court explicitly cited 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1) and (a)(2)(C) in support.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">As to Defendant\u2019s argument that the district court should have allowed early termination because neither the Government nor Defendant\u2019s probation officer opposed the motion, we can identify no authority \u2014 nor does Defendant cite any\u2014 that requires a court to grant an unopposed motion for early termination of supervised release. Just as a federal prosecutor or probation officer cannot dictate a district court\u2019s sentence, they likewise do not call the shots concerning a court\u2019s decision whether to terminate early a term of supervised release. A criminal sentence is the court\u2019s sentence, not the prosecutor\u2019s and not the probation officer\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">As to Defendant\u2019s related argument that the district court must not have consulted with the probation officer before making his decision, and that such consultation was required, Defendant cites no authority that mandates a court to consult a defendant\u2019s probation officer when reviewing a motion for early termination of supervised release. Moreover, Defendant\u2019s reliance on the likely positive recommendation of his officer seems greatly overstated. Specifically, Defendant avers only that, after the initial denial of his motion by the court, the probation officer indicated that \u201cif he was asked,\u201d he would advise the court that Defendant \u201chad complied with all conditions of supervised release.\u201d Inasmuch as many, if not most, offenders presumably complete the full term of their release having fully complied with all their conditions, the officer\u2019s statement hardly suggested an enthusiastic recommendation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>that supervision be terminated. Further, in his own motion, Defendant had noted the factors that should guide probation officers in determining whether to recommend early termination. One of those factors was \u201cno history of violence\u201d and \u201cno identifiable risk to public safety based on the Risk Prediction Index.\u201d Consideration of those factors suggests that the probation officer should not have, and actually did not, recommend early termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Finally, Defendant argues that no factual basis exists from which to conclude that continued supervision is necessary given concerns about the violent nature of Defendant\u2019s offenses or to protect the public from future criminal acts by him. We disagree that there is no basis for continued concern. Not only was Defendant actively associated with an extremely bloodthirsty band of criminals \u2014 and was convicted of conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act violations \u2014 his presentence report also details a very troubling past for which he was assigned a criminal history category of VI, the highest criminal history category in the Sentencing Guidelines.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, Defendant\u2019s criminal history shows that he had previously committed three offenses while on parole, and had his probation revoked on another occasion for a technical violation. Thus, an adequate basis exists in the record to support the district court\u2019s concern over the violent nature of Defendant\u2019s offenses and its conclusion that completion by Defendant of his full supervised release term was necessary to protect the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">That said, nothing in our opinion should detract from Defendant\u2019s compliant behavior during his release. He is to be congratulated for maintaining steady employment and pursuing an education since his release from prison. Indeed, Defendant notes that he has done so well on release, he is no longer even required to report to his probation officer. In other words, it appears that Defendant is operating under a non-reporting term of supervision. If accurate, what this means in practical terms is that the only potential ramification posed by continuing supervised release of Defendant is the possibility of revocation, and perhaps a return to prison, should he violate the law during the remainder of his term. Unless Defendant intends to break the law again, this incentive to continue his good behavior should not pose an unreasonable burden and, in fact, it is arguably a helpful nudge to encourage the Defendant to continue being a law-abiding citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">In short, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in deciding against an early termination of Defendant\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">III. CONCLUSI\u00d3N</p>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">For the above reasons, the district court\u2019s order denying Defendant\u2019s motion for early termination of supervised release is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b982-11\">. At sentencing, Defendant\u2019s primary objection to the presentence report focused on the latter\u2019s calculation of drug quantity. He also objected to any consideration by the district court of the two counts on which he was acquitted, which counts charged Defendant with possession of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime or a crime of violence on July 21, 1991 and November 21, 1991, respectively, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). At sentencing, the district court indicated that it would not consider any conduct for which Defendant was acquitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b983-6\">. In calculating the Guidelines\u2019 range for Defendant's Count 1 conviction, the district court began with a base offense level of 32, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2D1.1(a)(3) and (c)(6), which apply to offenses involving the unlawful manufacturing, importing, exporting, or trafficking of 50 to 150 grams of cocaine base, or attempts or conspiracies to engage in such offenses.' Because Defendant possessed firearms during the conspiracy, the court then added a two-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 IB 1.3 and 2D 1.1(b)(1), taking the adjusted offense level to 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">At the time, this Count 1 drug trafficking conspiracy count of conviction gave rise to Defendant\u2019s highest adjusted offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4. Then, to account for Defendant\u2019s multiple offenses, the court added three levels pursuant to \u00a7 3D 1.4, arriving at a total offense level of 37. Because Defendant had 13 criminal history points and a criminal history category of VI, the above calculation yielded a sentencing range of 360 months to life. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b984-5\">. The Government suspects that Defendant was released after serving only 228 months of his 262-month sentence because of \u201cgood time credits earned ... in prison.\u201d From a rough calculation of the allowable reduction of 54 days a year that good time credit would achieve, the Government's hypothesis seems likely. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b)(1) (allowing up to 54 days a year credit on a person's sentence based on satisfactory behavior).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b984-6\">. Actually, Defendant filed his motion for reconsideration and notice of appeal on the same day. Ordinarily, \"the filing of a notice of appeal deprives the district court of jurisdiction over all issues involved in the appeal.\u201d <em>Mahone v. Ray, </em>326 F.3d 1176, 1179 (11th Cir.2003) (citing <em>Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., </em>459 U.S. 56, 58, 103 S.Ct. 400, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982) and <em>Doe v. Bush, </em>261 F.3d 1037, 1064 (11th Cir.2001)). But where, as here, a party timely files a motion for reconsideration <em>before </em>filing a notice of appeal, the latter is tolled until the district court rules on the former. <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1205-06 (11th Cir.2012); <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(3). Thus, the court below possessed jurisdiction to rule on the merits of Defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b985-8\">. While unpublished, and therefore non-prec-edential, decisions of this Court have applied this standard to rulings on motions to modify terms of supervised release, we have found no published (precedential) cases on this issue. But we can discern no good reason why an abuse of discretion standard would not be applicable here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b985-13\">. Leaving aside the fact that, with the second reduction, the Hobbs Act conspiracy convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>tion became the determiner of the base offense level, <em>see infra, </em>Defendant's calculation of a Guidelines\u2019 range dictated by his drug conspiracy conviction is still incorrect. With a reduced offense level of 28, enhanced by two levels to level 30, and adding three more levels for Defendant's additional counts of conviction, Defendant\u2019s total offense level would have been a 33. With Defendant\u2019s criminal history, his resulting range would have been 235-293 months, not 140-175 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b989-7\">. Of note, Defendant\u2019s Hobbs Act conspiracy conviction includes seven violent \"shadow\u201d or \"pseudo\u201d counts for sentencing purposes; his Count 3 conviction pertains to the possession and use of firearms \"in relation to drug trafficking crimes <em>and crimes of violence </em>\u201d and outlines seven overt acts of such conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
