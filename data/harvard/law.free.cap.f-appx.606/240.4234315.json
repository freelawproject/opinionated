Hardin is serving a 120-month sentence for multiple fraud crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-19\">The district court noted that Hardin has already filed at least one unsuccessful motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court therefore dismissed his petition as an unauthorized successive \u00a7 2255 motion. The district court also determined that the Hardin could not invoke the savings clause of \u00a7 2241. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-22\">On appeal, Hardin asserts, among other things, that he has committed no crime and that the United States District Courts have no constitutional authority over him. He makes no argument relevant to the district court\u2019s construction of his petition, as a successive and unauthorized \u00a7 2255 motion, and he refuses even to acknowledge his conviction. Hardin also has not attempted to show that he is entitled to proceed under the savings clause of \u00a7 2241. By his lack of briefing, Hardin has waived any relevant challenge to the district court\u2019s ruling. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993) (issues not briefed are abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-23\">In any event, the district court properly dismissed Hardin\u2019s petition as a successive and unauthoriz\u00e9d \u00a7 2255 motion over which the court lacked jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3), 2255(h); <em>Pack v. Yusuff, 2</em>18 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000). Hardin\u2019s appeal lacks arguable merit and is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. All of Hardin\u2019s motions for \u201cJudicial Notice\u201d or any other relief are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b268-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
