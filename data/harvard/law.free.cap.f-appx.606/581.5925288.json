On appeal, Little only challenges the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment regarding his false arrest and malicious prosecution claims brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and the resulting dismissal of his claims brought under Alabama common law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He contends that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether there was probable cause for his arrest, and whether the request for the warrant was because of malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">After consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs and upon thorough review of the record, we find that the district court properly entered summary judgment. We agree with the district court that (1) Little\u2019s claims based on the actions of the code enforcer cannot go forward as false arrest claims, but rather must be decided under a claim for malicious prosecution; and, (2) in Little\u2019s claims based on malicious prosecution he is unable to establish the requisite lack of probable cause or the presence of malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">Little also claims that the district court erred in dismissing his ancillary state claims that stem from this incident. However, \u201c[t]he decision to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over pendant state claims rests within the discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>Raney v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>370 F.3d 1086, 1088-89 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam). And \u201c[w]e have encouraged district courts to dismiss any remaining state claims when, as here, the federal claims have been dismissed prior to trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1089. Accordingly, given that Little\u2019s federal claims were properly dismissed on summary judgment, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to exercise jurisdiction over Lit-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>tie\u2019s state law ancillary claims.</p>\n<p id=\"A8b\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b610-8\">.
