We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-16\">Thomas pleaded guilty to several drug and gun counts. To calculate his guidelines sentencing range, the district court grouped Thomas\u2019s counts. <em>See </em>United \u2022States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3D1.2 (instructing sentencing courts to group counts \u201cinvolving substantially the same harm\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court calculated an offense level for each of the grouped counts. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3D1.3(a). Two guidelines sections provided offense levels for the grouped counts: \u00a7 2D1.1 (for the drug counts) and \u00a7 2K2.1 (for the gun counts). Adhering to the grouping rules, the district court gave the group the highest offense level, which was calculated under \u00a7 2K2.1 \u2014 the guideline for the gun counts. <em>See USSG \u00a7 </em>3D1.3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-19\">Years later, Thomas moved for a sentence reduction. He argued that Amendment 782, which retroactively amended \u00a7 2D1.1, lowered his guideline range and warranted resentencing. The district court denied his motion, explaining that Thomas was not entitled to a reduction because his sentence was calculated using \u00a7 2K2.1, not \u00a7 2D1.1, so Amendment 782 did not affect his guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-20\">A district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence if he \u201chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). Amendment 782 provides a two-level reduction in the base offense levels for most drug quantities listed in the table in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). USSG app. C, amend. 782. When it applies, Amendment 782 may serve as the basis for a sentence reduction. <em>See </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>But Amendment 782 does not apply here. It lowered the offense levels for \u00a7 2D1.1, but Thomas\u2019s offense level was calculated using \u00a7 2K2.1. A reduction is not authorized by an amendment that addresses one guideline if the sentence was imposed under another. <em>See United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam); \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A); <em>cf. Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327 (explaining that the defendants were ineligible for sentence reductions based on an amendment that lowered base offense levels under \u00a7 2D1.1 because the amendment had no effect on the career-offender guideline, which generated their guideline ranges).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The district court correctly denied Thomas\u2019s motion. Although \u00a7 2D1.1 did provide the offense level for the grouped drug counts, the offense level for the group as a whole was calculated using \u00a7 2K2.1. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3D1.3(a). Thus, Amendment 782 \u2014 which lowered the offense levels for \u00a7 2D1.1 \u2014 does not affect Thomas\u2019s offense level, which would remain unchanged under \u00a7 2K2.1 and the grouping rules. Because Amendment 782 does not lower Thomas\u2019s applicable guideline range, he is not eligible for a sentence reduction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-17\">. The district grouped all but one of Thomas\u2019s counts. He pleaded guilty to one count of carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). That count was not grouped because it required a separate sentence consecutive to any other term of imprisonment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i); USSG \u00a7 5G1.2(a)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b585-8\">. Thomas also argues that <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), applies. But <em>Freeman </em>is relevant only to defendants who entered binding plea agreements, and Thomas\u2019s plea agreement was nonbinding. <em>See United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir. 2012) (per curiam) (\"In <em>Freeman, </em>the question before the Supreme Court was whether defendants who entered into Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreements were eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
