Barber was sentenced to serve 24 months in prison. Barber argues that the district court erred by (1) admitting testimony from a government agent regarding Barber\u2019s prior statements, which the government allegedly failed to disclose in violation of a standing discovery order and (2) applying an enhancement for intended loss under United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l). After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-15\">At trial, the evidence established that Barber submitted a fictitious financial instrument, entitled a \u201cbonded promissory note,\u201d to the servicer of his and his wife\u2019s home mortgage loan, which was then several months in arrears. The \u201cbonded promissory note\u201d purported to pay off the amount. remaining on the mortgage\u2014 around $49,000 \u2014 through funds in a secret \u201cstrawman\u201d , account held by the United States Treasury in his wife\u2019s name. This purported United States Treasury account, which does not exist, supposedly held millions of dollars.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After submitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>the fictitious financial instrument to the mortgage servicer, Barber contacted the attorney representing the servicer in the Barbers\u2019 pending foreclosure case to inform her that the servicer would soon receive its payment from the United States Treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Barber testified in his defense that he believed the \u201cbonded promissory note\u201d to be a lawful means by which to pay off his mortgage. He explained that while his beliefs about the secret United States Treasury account may seem odd, they, were honestly held.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Barber first contends that the district court erred in admitting a government agent\u2019s testimony that Barber had described the process by which he attempted to pay off his mortgage as a \u201cscheme.\u201d He contends that this statement was not disclosed by the government as required by a standing discovery order and by Rule 16, Fed.R.Crim.P. The use of the word \u201cscheme,\u201d Barber asserts, was the only evidence presented by the government tending to show that Barber had the specific intent to defraud when he sent the \u201cbonded promissory note.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">The standing discovery order provided that the government was required to disclose, among other things, \u201cthe substance of any oral statement(s) made by the defendant\u201d to a government agent \u201cwhich the government intends to offer in evidence at trial.\u201d <em>See also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(A). At trial, the federal agent testified that Barber, in talking with the agent about the \u201cbonded promissory note\u201d and related documents, had informed the agent that Barber \u201cwent to a Sam Kennedy seminar in New York and learned this scheme to pay off his mortgage.\u201d Barber did not contemporaneously object to the agent\u2019s testimony on the grounds that the government had failed to disclose Barber\u2019s \u201cscheme\u201d statement. Barber\u2019s counsel then cross-examined the agent on Barber\u2019s use of the word \u201cscheme.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">Because Barber did not contemporaneously object to the agent\u2019s testimony during trial, as he concedes, we review for plain error only. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1275 (11th Cir.2007). To demonstrate plain error, the appellant must establish that there is (1) an error (2) that is plain or obvious and (3) that has affected his substantial rights; and, if the first three prongs are met, we may exercise our discretion to correct the error if it (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 1276.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">Here, the record is unclear as to whether there was in fact a discovery violation, and, therefore, whether there is an error. The only evidence Barber asserts in support of his contention that the government violated the discovery order is an email exchange between Barber\u2019s appellate coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>sel and his trial counsel. But the emails do not show that the government failed to meet its discovery obligations, only the possibility that it may have failed to do so. Nor is it clear from the trial transcript that either the defense or the prosecution was \u201csurprised\u201d by the statement, as Barber contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\">But even assuming error, it is not \u201cplain.\u201d A \u201cplain\u201d error is one that is \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cobvious.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Absent a contemporaneous objection or other prior notification by Barber to the district court that the \u201cscheme\u201d statement was not disclosed properly, the government\u2019s failure to disclose would not have been clear to the court when the agent testified about the \u201cscheme\u201d statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Barber concedes that the purported error may not be \u201cplain,\u201d but contends that this Court could remand to the district court for the limited purpose of conducting further.fact finding about whether the government complied with its discovery obligations. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Fernandez, </em>780 F.2d 1573, 1577 (11th Cir.1986) (remanding for further development of the factual record where the prosecution clearly failed to comply with a discovery order and the defendant consistently litigated that, issue during the criminal proceedings). But Barber has not identified any precedent remanding for further fact finding where, as here, the Jack of clarity in the record resulted from the defendant\u2019s failure to object contemporaneously. Remand in these circumstances would undermine the plain-error doctrine. <em>Cfi United States v. Bonavia, </em>927 F.2d 565, 570 (11th Cir.1991) (\u201cWe note that the plain error doctrine should be applied sparingly lest the contemporaneous objection rule, requiring timely objections to preserve issues for appeal, be swallowed by the plain error exception.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Nor has Barber shown that admitting evidence of the allegedly undisclosed statement affected his substantial rights. <em>Turner, </em>474 F.3d at 1276; <em>see United States v. Noe, </em>821 F.2d 604, 607 (11th Cir.1987) (\u201c[A] violation by the government of the criminal discovery rules warrants reversal of a conviction only if the defendant shows prejudice to substantial rights.\u201d). Specifically, Barber has not demonstrated a reasonable probability of a different result absent the alleged error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">We have observed that \u201cthe failure of the government to disclose statements made by the defendant is so serious a detriment to the preparation for trial and the defense of serious criminal charges that where it is apparent ... that the defense strategy may have been determined by the failure to disclose, there should be a new trial.\u201d <em>Noe, </em>821 F.2d at 607 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, when the government violates discovery rules in a criminal case, our inquiry focuses on how the violation affected the defendant\u2019s ability to present a defense. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Camargo-Vergara, </em>57 F.3d 993, 998-99 (11th Cir.1995) (\u201cSubstantial prejudice exists when a defendant is unduly surprised and lacks an adequate opportunity to prepare a defense, or if the mistake substantially influences the jury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">In challenging the admission of the \u201cscheme\u201d statement, Barber primarily relies on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>799 F.2d 649 (11th Cir.1986). In <em>Rodriguez, </em>a panel of this Court reversed the defendant\u2019s cocaine convictions and ordered a new trial where the government, in violation of Rule 16, Fed.R.Crim.P., failed to disclose that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>had obtained certain names and telephone numbers from a wallet taken from the defendant upon his arrest. 799 F.2d at 651-52. This Court found that the defendant\u2019s substantial rights had been prejudiced when, while cross-examining the defendant, the government asked about the wallet and its contents in order to imply that the defendant, despite his testimony to the contrary, had close ties to Colombia, a \u201cwell known source of cocaine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 652-53. By failing to turn over for discovery the contents of the wallet, we concluded, the government \u201cdeprived Rodriguez of any chance to prepare his case to meet that evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\"><em>Rodriguez </em>does not support Barber\u2019s position that his substantial rights were violated in this case. Here, in contrast to <em>Rodriguez, </em>Barber\u2019s allegedly undisclosed statement was revealed in the government\u2019s case-in-chief, before Barber had to decide whether to testify, not on cross-examination after that decision was made. <em>Cfi United States v. Arcentales, </em>532 F.2d 1046, 1050 (5th Cir.1976) (holding that the defendant failed to show prejudice in part because \u201cthe existence of the inculpatory statement became known during the government\u2019s case-in-chief.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For that reason, Barber also had the chance to cross-examine the agent about Barber\u2019s statement, and indeed did so extensively.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Barber also has not explained how his defense strategy was determined by the government\u2019s alleged failure to disclose the statement, or how he was deprived an opportunity to prepare a defense. <em>See Noe, </em>821 F.2d at 607; <em>Rodriguez, </em>799 F.2d at 652-53. In his appellate brief, he acknowledges that his own testimony was \u201cperhaps the most harmful aspect of the case to his own interests,\u201d but \u201cspeculate^]\u201d that he may not have testified had the \u201cscheme\u201d statement not been admitted. The record, however, does not support that assertion. When discussing preliminary matters with the district court before jury selection, Barber\u2019s counsel stated that he \u201cexpect[ed] Mr. Barber to testify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">Finally, we disagree that the \u201cscheme\u201d statement was the only evidence of Barber\u2019s fraudulent intent. \u201cCircumstantial evidence may prove knowledge and intent.\u201d <em>United States v. Macko, </em>994 F.2d 1526, 1533 (11th Cir.1993). Here, the government presented evidence that Barber sent a fictitious financial instrument in order to pay off his mortgage from an account that did not exist, and that this was the second time that he had attempted to .do so, despite the fact that it did not work the first time that he sent the instrument. Barber also testified that he did nothing to confirm the existence of the \u201cstrawman\u201d account before representing to the mortgage servicer that the United States Treasury would satisfy the debt. A reasonable jury could infer from these facts that Barber sent the instrument with the intent to defraud. Moreover, by testifying that he believed that sending the \u201cbonded promissory note\u201d was a lawful means by which to pay off his mortgage, Barber ran the risk that the jury would disbelieve him and conclude that the opposite of his testimony was true. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>53 F.3d 312, 314 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">In sum, Barber has not shown plain error because he has not demonstrated that the government violated its discovery obligations, and, even if the government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>did, Barber has not shown that the alleged error prejudiced his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Barber also contends that the district court erred in applying an enhancement for an intended loss under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l). We review a district court\u2019s loss calculation for clear error and its application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. McCrimmon, </em>362 F.3d 725, 728 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant may receive a six-level enhancement if the actual or intended loss of the offense conduct was more than $30,000 but no more than $70,000. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(D)'. \u201cIntended loss\u201d means \u201cthe pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the offense,\u201d and it \u201cincludes intended pecuniary harm that would have been impossible or unlikely to occur.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 3(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The district court did not err in determining that the offense conduct involved an intended loss. By finding Barber guilty of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 514(a)(3), the jury determined that Barber mailed a fictitious financial instrument, the \u201cbonded promissory note,\u201d \u201cwith the intent to defraud\u201d \u2014 that is, the intent to deprive someone of something of value. <em>See United States v. Svete, </em>556 F.3d 1157, 1161 (11th Cir.2009) <em>(fin bane) </em>(\u201cThe words \u2018to defraud\u2019 commonly refer to wronging one in his property rights by dishonest methods or schemes, and usually signify the deprivation of something of value by trick, deceit, chicane or overreaching.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Because Barber\u2019s conviction was based on mailing a fictitious instrument in order to pay off the approxim\u00e1tely $49,000 remaining on his mortgage loan, it necessarily follows that a loss of around $49,000 was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">While Barber argues that he could not have intended a loss because the odds of the mortgage servicer or the United States Treasury suffering a loss were minimal or non-existent, intended loss includes loss that is impossible or unlikely to occur. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 3(A)(ii). Therefore, the loss Barber intended to cause was properly included in the loss amount, however unlikely he was to succeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-12\">In sum, the district court did not plainly err in admitting evidence of an allegedly undisclosed prior oral statement made by Barber to a government agent. Nor did the court err in applying the sentencing enhancement for intended loss under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1). Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-13\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-9\">. According to Barber\u2019s testimony at trial,' the United States Treasury creates such a \"straw-man\u201d account for every person born in the United States, using the individual\u2019s birth cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>tificate as a bond with which to trade and fund the account. This description appears similar to what some courts have described as the \"Redemptionist\u201d theory. <em>See, e.g., Monroe v. Beard, </em>536 F.3d 198, 203 n. 4 (3d Cir.2008). The Third Circuit has explained that the \"Redemptionist\u201d theory \"propounds that a person has a split personality: a real person and a fictional person called the 'strawman.' \u201d <em>Id. </em>The \"strawman\u201d supposedly came into existence when the United States went off the gold standard and pledged the \"strawman\u201d of its citizens as collateral for the country\u2019s national debt. <em>Id. </em>When the United States allegedly did so, \"it created an 'exemption account\u2019 for each citizen, identified by each person\u2019s Social Security number.\u201d <em>McLaughlin v. CitiMortgage, Inc., </em>726 F.Supp.2d 201, 210 (D.Conn.2010). By submitting the appropriate documentation, the theory goes, an individual can gain access to his or her \"strawman\u201d account and make the federal government responsible for the individual\u2019s debts. <em>See id. </em>at 209-10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b565-9\">. We do not mean to suggest that prejudice can never be found when the government presents an undisclosed confession in its case in chief. <em>See, e.g., United States v.
