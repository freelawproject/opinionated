After review, we dismiss in part and deny in part Gua-darrama-Melo\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b545-17\">Guadarrama-Melo is a native and citizen of Mexico. Guadarrama-Melo came to the United States in 1989. On June 23, 1994, he was admitted as a lawful permanent resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-18\">A. 1996 Aggravated Felony Conviction in Federal Court</p>\n<p id=\"b545-19\">On April 23, 1996, Guadarrama-Melo was arrested after a search of his car revealed 43.20 pounds of marijuana. Gua-darrama-Melo was charged with the federal felony offenses of: (1) conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (Count One), and (2) possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (Count Two).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-20\">On August 30, 1996, Guadarrama-Melo pled guilty to Count Two pursuant to a written plea agreement. On November 19, 1996, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas entered a written judgment sentencing Guadarrama-Melo to 13 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-21\">B. 2008-2012 Removal Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b545-22\">On February 1, 2008, Guadarrama-Melo was served with a Notice to Appear, charging him with removability as a result of his 1996 felony conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, which was both an aggravated felony un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>der INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a) (2) (A) (iii), and a controlled substance offense under INA \u00a7 237(a) (2) (B) (i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i). On January 6, 2009, Guadarrama-Melo conceded remova-bility.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Guadarrama-Melo informed the IJ that he intended to. seek a waiver of removal under INA \u00a7 212(c). The IJ responded that Guadarrama-Melo was ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief because he pled guilty to an aggravated felony after April 24, 1996, the effective date of the amendments to \u00a7 212(c) contained in \u00a7 440(d) of the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">On April 19, 2012, Guadarrama-Melo filed an application seeking asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), based on his membership in a particular social group. Guadarrama-Melo claimed that, if he returned to Mexico, it was more than likely he would be tortured by drug traffickers for losing the marijuana he was transporting for them when he was arrested back in 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">At Guadarrama-Melo\u2019s removal hearing, the IJ noted that Guadarrama-Melo was ineligible for asylum, withholding of removal, and waiver under \u00a7 212(c) because of his 1996 conviction. The hearing proceeded as to Guadarrama-Melo\u2019s claim for CAT relief. On November 27, 2012, the IJ denied Guadarrama-Melo\u2019s claim for CAT relief and ordered him removed to Mexico. The IJ stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that Guadarra-ma-Melo\u2019s 1996 conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute qualified as an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">C. 2013 Appeal to the BIA</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Guadarrama-Melo appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA. In relevant part, Gua-darrama-Melo argued that the IJ erred by finding him ineligible for a waiver under INA \u00a7 212(c). In his counseled brief to the BIA, Guadarrama-Melo conceded that his 1996 conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute was an aggravated felony. Nevertheless, he contended that he was still eligible for waiver because his 1996 aggravated felony conviction occurred prior to the enactment of any restriction or repeal of \u00a7 212(c) relief. Guadarrama-Melo argued that the IJ\u2019s pretermission of his waiver application was an impermissibly retroactive application of a change in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">On June 17, 2014, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and dismissed Guadarrama-Melo\u2019s appeal. Noting that Guadarrama-Melo. pled guilty to an aggravated felony after April 24, 1996, the effective date of AEDPA \u00a7 440(d)\u2019s amendments to INA \u00a7 212(c), the BIA concluded that he was not eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief under the law in effect at the time of his guilty plea. Thus, the IJ correctly determined that Guadarrama-Melo was statutorily ineligible to seek a waiver under \u00a7 212(c). Gua-darrama-Melo timely filed this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">We review \u201conly the BIA\u2019s decision,\u201d except to the extent that it \u201cexpressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion or reasoning.\u201d <em>Cole v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>712 F.3d 517, 523 (11th Cir.2013) (quotation marks and alteration omitted). We review questions of law, including the extent of our subject matter jurisdiction, <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-13\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b546-14\">Before 1996, INA \u00a7 212(c) gave the Attorney General the discretion to waive an alien\u2019s deportation, now called removal, if the alien was a lawful permanent resident who had lived in the United States continuously for seven years. INA \u00a7 212(c), 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c). On April 24, 1996, Congress enacted the AEDPA, which made \u00a7 212(c) waivers unavailable to certain aliens with aggravated felony convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>AEDPA, Pub.L. No. 104-132, \u00a7 440(d), 110 Stat. 1214, 1277 (1996) (amending 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c)). Specifically, \u00a7 440(d) of the AEDPA bars \u00a7 212(e) relief for any alien who \u201cis deportable by reason of having committed any criminal offense covered in section [241(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the INA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Section 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), in turn, states that \u201c[a]ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.\u201d INA \u00a7 241 (a)(2)(A)(iii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Guadarrama-Melo raises two claims of legal error concerning his eligibility for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We discuss each claim in turn.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">First, Guadarrama-Melo argues, for the first time on appeal, that his 1996 conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute was not an aggravated felony under immigration law.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Guadarrama-Melo failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with-respect to his first claim. He never argued in his administrative appeal to the BIA that his 1996 conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute did not qualify as an aggravated felony under immigration law. In fact, he conceded in his brief to the BIA that his 1996 conviction was an aggravated felony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review this unexhausted claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see also Malu v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>764 F.3d 1282, 1287-88 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">Second, Guadarrama-Melo argues that the IJ erroneously pretermitted his application for a waiver under \u00a7 212(c). Specifically, Guadarrama-Melo contends that AEDPA \u00a7 440(d)-whieh uses the word \u201ccommitted\u201d rather than \u201cconvicted\u201d \u2014 only precludes relief for aliens who \u201ccommitted\u201d certain criminal offenses after the effective date of the AEDPA. According to Guadarrama-Melo, he is eligible for relief under INA \u00a7 212(c) because he committed the aggravated felony on April 23, 1996, one day before AEDPA \u00a7 440\u2019s restrictions on \u00a7 212(c) relief went into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Guadarrama-Melo exhausted his second claim before the BIA, it is without merit. Whereas AEDPA \u00a7 440(d) applies to aliens \u201cdeport-able by reason of having committed\u201d certain criminal offenses, \u00a7 241 (a) (2) (A) (iii), which is incorporated by reference, specifies that an alien is deportable only when he is <em>\u201cconvicted </em>of an aggravated felony.\u201d \u2022 <em>See </em>AEDPA \u00a7 440(d), 110 Stat. at 1277; INA \u00a7 241(a)(2)(A)(iii), 8. U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (emphasis added); <em>cf. Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 828, 832-33 (11th Cir.2004) (interpreting similar language in \u00a7 309(c)(4)(G) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Guadarrama-Melo was convicted of an aggravated felony on August 30,1996, over four months after AEDPA \u00a7 440(d) took effect. Although Guadarrama-Melo\u2019s criminal conduct predated the AEDPA by one day, he became removable and thus subject to \u00a7 440(d)\u2019s restrictions on \u00a7 212(c) relief on August 30, 1996, by reason of his aggravated felony conviction. Under \u00a7 212(c), as amended by \u00a7 440(d)\u2014 the law in effect at the time he pled guilty \u2014 Guadarrama-Melo is -ineligible for a waiver of removal. <em>See Oguejiofor v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>277 F.3d 1305, 1309 (11th Cir.2002) (noting that the petitioner \u201cbecame ineligible for discretionary relief under [\u00a7 212(c) ] when he pled guilty [in November and December 1996] to the offenses which made him removable\u201d). Accordingly, the BIA did not err in affirming the IJ\u2019s determination of Guadarrama-Melo\u2019s ineligibility for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Because we lack jurisdiction to review Guadarrama-Melo\u2019s unexhausted claim that his 1996 conviction does not qualify as an aggravated felony, we dismiss Guadar-rama-Melo\u2019s petition for review to the extent he challenges that determination. We deny Guadarrama-Melo\u2019s petition for review to the extent he challenges his ineligibility for a waiver under INA \u00a7 212(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b547-10\">. In September 1996, Congress repealed \u00a7 212(c) relief altogether, replacing it with a procedure referred to as \"cancellation of removal.\u201d <em>See Ferguson v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>563 F.3d 1254, 1260 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b547-11\">. Guadarrama-Melo does not contend, as he did before the BIA, that the IJ\u2019s pretermission of his waiver application had an impermissible retroactive effect on him. Additionally, he does not argue any error with respect to the IJ\u2019a denial of CAT relief. Those issues are therefore abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b547-12\">. The REAL ID Act bars courts of appeals from reviewing final orders of removal against aliens who are removable by reason of having committed certain criminal offenses, including controlled substance offenses and aggravated felonies. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). However, the statute excepts \"constitutional claims or questions of law\u201d from this jurisdictional bar. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Here, we have jurisdiction to review the legal questions presented in Guadarrama-Melo's petition for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b547-15\">.This concession is consistent with the fact that possession of marijuana with intent to distribute under \u00a7 841(a)(l)-a federal offense punishable by more than one year\u2019s imprisonment-qualifies as an aggravated felony under immigration law. <em>See Moncrieffe v. Holder, </em>-U.S.-,-, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 1683, 185 L.Ed.2d 727 (2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
