Ballesteros argues that his amended sentence is unreasonable and that he was entitled to the appointment of counsel and an evidentiary hearing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-16\">In 2012, Ballesteros was convicted of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute oxycodone and oxymorphone, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(C), 846, two counts of possessing with intent to distribute oxycodone and oxymorphone, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(C); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, and conspiring to defraud Medicare, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1349. Ballesteros, a physician, wrote more than 6,000 prescriptions for oxyco-done and oxymorphone as part of a conspiracy to distribute pain medicine obtained from Medicare-eligible patients and relocated his medical practice five times to elude law enforcement. The district court sentenced Ballesteros at the high end of his advisory guideline range of 292 to 365 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-18\">Ballesteros moved for a reduction of his sentence based on Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Ballesteros requested a two-level reduction of his offense level and credit for \u201chis educational, vocational, religious ... and institutional progress.\u201d Bal-lesteros also requested that the district court appoint counsel and conduct an evi-dentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-19\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal, conclusions regarding the scope of its authority\u201d to reduce a sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008). The decision whether to grant or deny a motion to reduce is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 1368 n. 1. We also review for an abuse of discretion the denial of requests for appointed counsel and for an evidentiary hearing. <em>See United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 793 (11th Cir.2009) (appointment of counsel); <em>United States v. Hill, </em>643 F.3d 807, 874 (11th Cir.2011) (evidentiary hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-20\">The district court did not err in reducing Ballesteros\u2019s sentence. Based on the amended drug table, the district court correctly assigned Ballesteros an offense level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>of 38, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(2), which resulted in an amended sentencing range between 235 and 293 months of imprisonment, <em>id. </em>Ch. 5, Pt. A. The district court considered \u201cthe Amendment, [Balleste-ros\u2019s] motion and the response, and the Section 3553(a) factors,\u201d and determined that \u201ca sentence at the high end of [Bal-lesteros\u2019s amended] guideline [range] [was] appropriate.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). Ballesteros\u2019s offense involved at least 5,000 grams of oxycodone and 40 grams of oxymorphone. And Bal-lesteros had a prior conviction for Medicare fraud, served a term of probation, and received his \u201cmedical license back,\u201d but he squandered that \u201cnew lease on life to go back into the practice of medicine\u201d by participating in a conspiracy to distribute prescription drugs. Based on this record, the district court reasonably decided to sentence Ballesteros to 293 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Ballesteros challenges his sentence on three grounds, all of which lack merit. First, Ballesteros contests the amount of drugs attributed to him, but when considering a reduction of sentence \u201call original sentencing determinations remain unchanged,\u201d <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 781. Second, Ballesteros argues for a further reduction based on his rehabilitation, but the district court was not obligated to consider Bal-lesteros\u2019s post-sentencing conduct. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1 (B)(iii); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>568 F.3d 923, 927 (11th Cir.2009). Third, Ballesteros argues that the district court should have considered his arguments that he was denied due process and that his sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment, but the district court lacked \u201cjurisdiction to consider [Bal-lesteros\u2019s] extraneous resentencing issues\u201d under section 3582(c)(2). <em>Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 782.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Ballesteros\u2019s motions for appointed counsel and for an evidentiary hearing. Ballesteros was not entitled to appointed counsel in seeking a reduction of his sentence. <em>See Webb, </em>565 F.3d at 794-95. And the district court was not required to conduct an evidentiary hearing when no \u201cfactor important to the sentencing determination [was] reasonably in dispute.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3. The government conceded that Amendment 782 applied to Ballesteros.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">We AFFIRM Ballesteros\u2019s amended sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
