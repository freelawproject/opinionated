On appeal, he contends that the district court erred in applying a four-level sentencing enhancement because its finding that the offense involved more than fifty victims was clearly erroneous. Adeife further argues that his seventy-six-month term of imprisonment is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable since the district court failed to adequately explain why it deviated upward from the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-19\">After a thorough review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court\u2019s factual finding with regard to its calculation of the number of victims was not clearly erroneous, and, therefore, the district court did not err in applying the four-level enhancement. However, because the district court imposed a sentence above the Guidelines without adequate explanation, despite announcing its intent to impose a sentence within the Guideline range, we vacate Adeife\u2019s seventy-six-month sentence and remand for further clarification and resen-tencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-21\">The district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo, and its calculation of the number of victims is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>732 F.3d 1299, 1305 (11th Cir.2013). Although estimations are permitted, the district court is prohibited from speculating about the existence of a fact that would yield a more severe sentence. <em>Id. </em>The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a four-level enhancement if the offense involved fifty or more but fewer than 250 victims. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(2)(B)-(C). For sentencing en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>hancement purposes, a \u201cvictim\u201d is defined as \u201cany person who sustained any part of the actual loss.\u201d \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n: 1. However, when a case involves a means of identification, a victim is also defined as \u201cany individual whose means of identification was used unlawfully or without authority.\u201d \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 4(E)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Here, Adeife admitted that he filed 112 fraudulent Social Security retirement benefit claims using the identities of real people without their authorization. We acknowledge that Adeife was only successful in receiving payment on forty-five of those claims. However, the fact that he did not receive payment on all 112 claims is of no moment because the mere unlawful use of a means of identification or its use without authorization is sufficient to convert an individual into a victim for enhancement purposes. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 4(E)(ii). Therefore, Adeife\u2019s claim that these individuals were not victims within the meaning of Application Note 4(E)(ii), simply because he was unsuccessful in receiving payments on every claim, is without merit. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s finding of fact that the offense involved 112 victims was not clearly erroneous, and, therefore, its application of the four-level enhancement was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Adeife also argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Here, the district court explicitly stated that it found \u201cno reason to depart or vary from the sentence called for by the guidelines\u201d and that the sentence it imposed was \u201cwithin the advisory guideline range.\u201d The calculated Guideline range was sixty-five to seventy-five months\u2019 imprisonment, and both parties requested a sentence within the Guidelines. Despite unequivocally declaring its intent to impose a sentence within the guidelines, the district court sentenced Adeife to seventy-six months\u2019 imprisonment, which is not a sentence within the guidelines range. The seventy-six month sentence is in direct conflict with the district court\u2019s expressed, unequivocal intention to sentence Adeife within the Guidelines. <em>See id. </em>Because .it appears that the district court did not intend to impose an above Guidelines sentence, we vacate Adeife\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for further clarification and resentencing. Finally, because it is necessary to first cure this error, we do not reach the issue of whether Adeife\u2019s sentence was substantively reasonable. <em>United States v. Barner, </em>572 F.3d 1239, 1253 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">AFFIRMED in part; VACATED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-17\">.
