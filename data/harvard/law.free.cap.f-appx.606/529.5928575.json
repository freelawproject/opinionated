Bar v. Scott, </em>39 So.3d 309 (Fla.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>562 U.S. 1030, 131 S.Ct. 581, <em>178 </em>L.Ed.2d 415 (2010). It is also the third time the district court has dismissed his claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Order, <em>Scott v. Florida, </em>No. 11-cv-21242 (S.D.Fla. Aug. 2, 2011), ECF No. 12; Report &amp; Recommendation, <em>Scott v. Frankel, </em>No. 12-cv-23930 (S.D. Fla. June 20, 2013), ECF No. 52. Scott claims to be the victim of a wide-ranging conspiracy to silence his criticism of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The conspiracy achieved its goals, Scott claims, by involving him in an illegal eommodities-trading scheme during which he was tricked into representing clients with conflicting interests. This, he contends, allowed the powers aligned against him to suspend him from the practice of law, which in turn led to the revocation of his Series 3 commodity-trading license. According to Scott, the primary players in the conspiracy are Steven Frankel (who Scott says is \u201ca ruling class member of The Florida Bar and [an] undercover operative of [the] Federal and Florida governments\u201d), Prudential Securities, and the CFTC itself. The conspiracy\u2019s alleged membership grows with every defeat Scott suffers in court; it now also appears to include the Florida Supreme Court (and \u201cits captive Bar\u201d) and the district court, among others.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-14\">In his complaint in this case, Scott claims that Frankel, acting \u201cunder cover of law with intent to cover[ ]up the frauds he committed as a ruling member of the Fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>eral and Florida legal systems ... wrongfully had [Scott] suspended from the practice of law in Florida.\u201d Scott\u2019s two-count complaint therefore seeks a declaration that Frankel violated his First Amendment rights, compensation for the \u201cwrongful taking\u201d of his \u201cright to practice law in Florida,\u201d and punitive damages \u201cfor the malicious, wanton, willful, reckless, and knowing violation of [Scott\u2019s] Constitutional rights under the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments.\u201d Those alleged violations, too, stemmed from his bar suspension. On Frankel\u2019s motion, the district court dismissed Scott\u2019s case with prejudice, ruling that under the <em>Rooker-Feld-man </em>doctrine it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. This is Scott\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>Lozman v. City of Riviera Beach, </em>713 F.3d 1066, 1069 (11th Cir.2013). <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>is a narrow preclusion doctrine that .bars a state court loser from later enlisting a federal district court to reverse his state court loss. <em>See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 1521-22, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). It arises from the. fact that the only federal court empowered to review final state court judgments is the Supreme Court of the United States. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1257(a); <em>D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 486-87, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 1317, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 415-16, 44 S.Ct. 149, 150, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923). District courts, as courts of \u201coriginal jurisdiction,\u201d lack any such appellate jurisdiction over state courts. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">The Supreme Court has limited <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>to those cases in which (1) the plaintiff was the loser in state court, (2) the plaintiff is complaining of an injury caused by the state court\u2019s judgment, (3) the state court\u2019s judgment was \u201crendered before the district court proceedings commenced,\u201d and (4) the plaintiff is \u201cinviting district court review and rejection\u201d of the state court\u2019s judgment. <em>Exxon Mobil, </em>544 U.S. at 284, 125 S.Ct. at 1521-22. Further, the doctrine applies only to claims . that were actually brought in state court or claims that are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state court judgment. <em>Cosale v. Tillman, </em>558 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted). A claim is \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state court judgment \u201cif it would effectively nullify the state court judgment, or it succeeds only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">Narrow though the doctrine is, Scott\u2019s case fits comfortably within its bounds. <em>See Exxon Mobil, </em>544 U.S. at 284, 125 S.Ct. at 1521-22. Scott lost in a state court decision rendered years before he filed his' district court complaint. That complaint would enlist the district court to decide questions \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>with the decision of the Florida Supreme Court suspending Scott\u2019s law license, and to decide those questions in a way that conflicts with that decision. <em>See Casale, </em>558 F.3d at 1260. Scott would prevail under Count I of his complaint only if the district court were to decide that the \u201ctaking\u201d of Scott\u2019s \u201cright to practice law in Florida\u201d was \u201cwrongful\u201d \u2014 in other words, that the Florida Supreme Court had erred when it suspended him. Count II seeks a declaration that the \u201csuccessful removal of [Scott] from the roll of attorneys in Florida ... violated [his] rights secured by the First Amendment to the United - States Constitution,\u201d along with compensatory and punitive damages for the alleged \u201cviolation of [Scott\u2019s] Constitutional rights under the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments\u201d resulting from the taking of Scott\u2019s law license. Scott could therefore only prevail on Count II if the district court determined that the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s holdings were wrong, a determination it lacks jurisdiction to make.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Scott makes two arguments that the district court erred when it dismissed his case. He first contends that the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision to suspend him was the product of extrinsic fraud. But he cites no authority, and we find none, bind--ing us to recognize an extrinsic-fraud exception to the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Scott\u2019s second contention of error is that the district court failed to view the facts in the light most favorable to him. But even if that is true, any such failure does not matter. Scott\u2019s claims, not the allegations on which he bases them, deprive the district court of subject matter jurisdiction. When the relief a plaintiff seeks is federal district court review of an earlier state court order against him, no set of facts, however favorable, will give the court jurisdiction to consider that relief. <em>See Exxon Mobil, </em>544 U.S. at 284, 125 S.Ct. at 1521-22 (applying <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>to cases where the plaintiff is \u201cinviting district court review and rejection of those judgments\u201d). The district court properly dismissed Scott\u2019s elaims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Our conclusion, in other words, is the same as it was the last time Scott appealed a <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>dismissal of his claims against Frankel. <em>See Scott v. Frankel, </em>562 Fed.Appx. 950, 953-54 (11th Cir.2014) (holding that under <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>the district court properly dismissed Scott\u2019s claims, including a damages claim against Frankel \u201cpremised on an allegation of extrinsic fraud\u201d). We elect not to consider sanctions for this frivolous appeal under Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, but further frivolous appeals of <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>dismissals of these or related claims will risk subjecting Scott to pay \u201cjust damages and single or double costs.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>We must, however,' correct the district court on a point of procedure. The district court determined that \u201cany amendment of [Scott\u2019s] Complaint would be futile\u201d and on that basis dismissed the case with prejudice. We sympathize with the district court\u2019s efforts to discourage vexatious litigation. But a <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>dismissal is a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and \u201c[a] dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is not a judgment on the merits and is entered without prejudice.\u201d <em>Stalley v. Orlando Reg\u2019l Healthcare Sys., </em>524 F.3d 1229, 1232 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also Boda v. United States, </em>698 F.2d 1174, 1177 n. 4 (11th Cir.1983) (dismissal on subject matter jurisdiction grounds \u201cis without prejudice\u201d). The district court has already placed Scott on notice that he will be \u201cat risk of violating Rule 11(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\u201d should he file <em>another </em>lawsuit challenging the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision to suspend him. Given that we have now twice held that Scott\u2019s claims are barred by <em>Rooker-Feldman, </em>he will violate Rule 11 if he amends his pleadings in this case in a further attempt to cajole the district court into reversing the Florida Supreme Court. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(b)(2) (providing that a litigant\u2019s signature on a pleading or other paper certifies that \u201cthe claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a <em>nonfrivolous </em>argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">We therefore affirm the dismissal of Scott\u2019s complaint and remand with instructions that the district court reenter its dismissal as one without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART and REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b558-12\">. <em>See D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 486-87, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 1317, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 415-16, 44 S.Ct. 149, 150, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b559-6\">. Ordinarily we must construe, a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s briefs and pleadings liberally. <em>See Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir. 1998). But in this case, although Scott is proceeding <em>pro se </em>and is currently suspended from the practice of law, he is a lawyer with nearly two decades of experi-<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ence practicing in Florida. In fact, he remains a member of the Florida bar. <em>See </em>Fla. R. Prof'l Conduct 3-5.1(e) (\u201cDuring [a] suspension the respondent shall continue to be a member of The Florida Bar but without the privilege of practicing.\u201d). We therefore do not construe his papers liberally. <em>See Olivares v. Martin, </em>555 F.2d 1192, 1194 n. 1 (5th Cir.1977) (\u201d[W]e cannot afford [the appellant] the advantage of the liberal construction of his complaint normally given pro se litigants, because he is a licensed attorney.\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>see also Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc) (adopting as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b560-6\">. Scott's unsuccessful attempt to plead around <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>in both counts has left them nearly devoid of discernable legal content, but we do not reach the question of whether either of Scott's counts states a claim on which relief could be granted. <em>See Boda v. United States, </em>698 F.2d 1174, 1177 n. 4 (11th Cir.1983) (\"Where dismissal can be based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim, the court should dismiss on only the jurisdictional grounds.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b560-7\">. It is true that some of our sister circuits have recognized an extrinsic-fraud exception to <em>Rooker-Feldman. See, e.g., In re Sun Valley Foods Co., </em>801 F.2d 186, 189 (6th Cir.1986) (\"A federal court may entertain a collateral attack on a state court judgment which is alleged to have been procured through fraud, deception, accident, or mistake.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted); <em>Resolute Ins.
