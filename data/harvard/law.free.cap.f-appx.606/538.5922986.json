On appeal, Chin argues that his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him was violated when the district court, under Federal Rule of Evidence 412, limited Chin\u2019s cross-examination of victim-witness K.B. to exclude evidence that K.B. engaged previously in prostitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-18\">Chin was charged with sex trafficking of two underage girls, K.B. and S.M. Briefly stated, Chin\u2019s theory of the defense was that he was \u201cmerely present\u201d during K.B. and S.M.\u2019s prostitution activities and that K.B. was the person who was actually directing her own prostitution business. In support of his theory, Chin sought, pursuant to Rule 412(b)(1)(C), to cross-examine K.B. about her past involvement in prostitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-19\">Following an <em>in camera </em>hearing (during which K.B. testified that she had, in fact, engaged in two instances of prostitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>more than two years before she met Chin), the district court excluded evidence of KB.\u2019s prior acts of prostitution. The court concluded that the proposed evidence \u201csimply indicates ... a propensity or a willingness to engage in prostitution\u201d and that the evidence was not pertinent to the charges against Chin.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s application of Rule 412. <em>United States v. Culver, </em>598 F.3d 740, 749 (11th Cir.2010). But, \u201c[w]hether the exclusion of evidence violated a constitutional guarantee is a legal question reviewed de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Sarras, </em>575 F.3d 1191, 1209 n. 24 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Rule 412 provides that, in a \u201ccriminal proceeding involving alleged sexual misconduct,\u201d the following evidence is inadmissible: \u201c(1) evidence offered to prove that a victim engaged in other sexual behavior; or (2) evidence offered to prove a victim\u2019s sexual predisposition.\u201d ' Fed. R.Evid. 412(a). The district court may, however, admit \u201cevidence whose exclusion would violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 412(b)(1)(C). Rule 412(b)(1)(C) is \u201ca narrow exception\u201d to the \u201cbroad general principle\u201d that evidence of a victim\u2019s prior sexual history is inadmissible. <em>Culver, </em>598 F.3d at 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">In determining whether evidence is admissible under Rule 412(b)(l)(C)\u2019s \u201cnarrow exception,\u201d we start with the premise that a defendant has a right, under the Sixth Amendment, to confront witnesses against him. <em>See id.; </em>U.S. Const, amend. VI. \u201cThe main and essential purpose of confrontation is to secure for the defendant the opportunity of cross-examination.\u201d <em>United States v. Baptista-Rodriguez, </em>17 F.3d 1354, 1366 (11th Cir.1994) (alteration omitted). Still, a \u201cdefendant\u2019s right to cross-examine witnesses is not without limitation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he Sixth Amendment guarantees only an <em>opportunity </em>for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u201d <em>United States v. Beale, </em>921 F.2d 1412, 1424 (11th Cir.1991) (emphasis in original) (quotations omitted). We have said that \u201c[c]ross-examination of a government \u2018star\u2019 witness is important, and a presumption favors free cross-examination on possible bias, motive, ability to perceive and remember, and general character for truthfulness, but cross-examination must be relevant.\u201d <em>United States v. Phelps, </em>733 F.2d 1464, 1472 (11th Cir.1984) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">\u201cThe test <em>for </em>the Confrontation Clause is whether a reasonable jury would have received a significantly different impression of the witness\u2019 credibility had counsel pursued the proposed line of cross-examination.\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>17 F.3d 333, 340 (11th Cir.1994). \u201cA defendant\u2019s cross-examination rights are satisfied when the cross-examination permitted exposes the jury to facts sufficient to evaluate the credibility of the witness and enables defense counsel to establish a record from which he properly can argue why the witness is less than reliable.\u201d <em>Baptista-Rodriguez, </em>17 F.3d at 1371. \u201c[Ojnce there is sufficient cross-examination to satisfy the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause, further questioning is within the district court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>17 F.3d at 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">Chin has failed to demonstrate that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated when the district court excluded evidence about KB.\u2019s earlier acts of prostitution. First, Chin had ample opportunity to cross-examine K.B. and to impeach K.B.\u2019s credibility effectively.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On cross-examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>tion, K.B. admitted that she had lied to the police about several aspects of her involvement in the prostitution business. Chin\u2019s lawyer was also able to highlight inconsistencies in K.B.\u2019s testimony, including whether K.B. had paid a homeless woman to rent a motel room for her because she was underage. The district court acknowledged the effectiveness of K.B.\u2019s cross-examination, commenting that K.B.\u2019s attitude changed from being \u201cdemur\u201d on direct examination to \u201cindicating a degree of casualness or indifference\u201d on cross-examination, which the district court thought gave the jury a different and perhaps more \u201caccurate view\u201d of K.B.\u2019s approach and willingness to participate in prostitution. Based on this record, sufficient evidence existed to enable Chin\u2019s lawyer to argue properly that K.B. lacked credibility. And nothing evidences that the jury would have formed \u201ca significantly different impression\u201d about K.B.\u2019s credibility had Chin been permitted to cross-examine K.B. about her past acts of prostitution. <em>See Taylor, </em>17 F.3d at 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Moreover, evidence of K.B.\u2019s earlier involvement in prostitution was not critical to Chin\u2019s \u201cmere presence\u201d defense. KB.\u2019s testimony demonstrated that K.B. was already knowledgeable about the prostitution business. For example, K.B. testified that prostitution was prevalent in her neighborhood and that it was her idea to start telling men that they had to pay for sex. K.B. began managing S.M.\u2019s prostitution activities, which included coaching S.M. on \u201chow to be a girlie girl,\u201d what to wear, and how to \u201ckeep [her]self up.\u201d KB.\u2019s testimony also demonstrated that, at times, she and S.M. found clients, set up prostitution \u201cdates,\u201d and engaged in acts of prostitution without Chin\u2019s involvement or instruction. In the light of KB.\u2019s trial testimony, the district court\u2019s exclusion of evidence about KB.\u2019s prostitution history in no serious way hindered Chin\u2019s ability to argue that he was \u201cmerely present\u201d for K.B. and S.M.\u2019s prostitution activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Chin has failed to demonstrate a violation of his constitutional rights; the district court abused no discretion in excluding evidence of K.B.\u2019s history of prostitution under Rule 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-10\">. Chin also makes the following arguments on appeal: (1) the district court erred in instructing the jury (a) that Chin did not have to know his acts affected interstate commerce and (b) that Chin could be found guilty if he recklessly disregarded that K.B. and S.M. were under 18 years old; (2) Chin\u2019s mandatory-minimum sentence was unconstitutional under <em>Alleyne </em>v. <em>United </em>States,-U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), without a finding by the jury that Chin knew that S.M. was under 14 years old; and (3) Chin\u2019s below-guideline sentence was substantively unreasonable. Having reviewed the pertinent law and the record, we conclude that these arguments are without merit and warrant no further discussion. Thus, we focus our discussion only on the district court\u2019s exclusion of evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 412.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b568-7\">. Contrary to Chin\u2019s assertions on appeal, K.B. never testified \u2014 either directly or indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>rectly \u2014 that she had not considered prostituting herself until after she met Chin.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
