He contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable and greater than necessary to satisfy the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>We review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Arias-Ramos\u2019s arguments fail to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that we apply to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008). The district court, who was \u201cin a- superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d acknowledged Arias-Ramos\u2019s mitigating arguments but concluded that a sentence near the top of the guidelines range was appropriate in light of his criminal history. <em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339. We have rejected the argument that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s double-counting of a prior conviction in the calculation of a defendant\u2019s offense level and criminal history score necessarily render a sentence unreasonable. <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). We have also rejected substantive reasonableness challenges based on the alleged lack of seriousness of illegal reentry. <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir. 2008); <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). Finally, as Arias-Ramos concedes, his argument that the presumption of reasonableness should not be applied to his sentence because \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis is foreclosed. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 530-31; <em>United States v. Mandragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b186-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
