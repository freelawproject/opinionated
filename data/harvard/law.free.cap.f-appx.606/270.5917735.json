Now, he challenges the district court\u2019s determination that his prior North Carolina conviction for conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon was a crime of violence (COV) under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 and an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). He argues that his prior conviction should not be considered a COV or a \u00a7 1326(b)(2) aggravated felony because it lacks an overt act requirement. Because he did not raise this argument in the district court, we review for plain error only.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-23\">To establish plain error, Marin-Arrellanes must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have discretion to correct the error but will do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Marin-Arrellanes asserts that his current argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Pascacio-Rodriguez, </em>749 F.3d 353, 367-68 (5th Cir.2014). In that case we held that a Nevada conviction for conspiracy to commit murder, which likewise does not require an overt act, constituted a COV for purposes of the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) enhancement. <em>Pasca-cio-Rodriguez </em>rejected arguments similar to those raised by Marin-Arrellanes. In view of <em>Pascacio-Rodriguez, </em>Marin-Arrellanes has not established clear or obvious error on the part of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Although we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment, summary disposition is not appropriate. <em>See United States v. Holy Land Found, for Relief &amp; Dev., </em>445 F.3d 771, 781 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, we deny Marin-Arrellanes\u2019s motion for summary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b298-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
