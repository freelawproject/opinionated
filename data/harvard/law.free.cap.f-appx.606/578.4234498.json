Cordova argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-21\">In 2009, Cordova pleaded guilty to entering the United States illegally after being deported in 2005. <em>Id. </em>Cordova was deported after completing his sentence for leaving the scene of an accident involving a death. Cordova drove his vehicle in a canal, swam away, and allowed his passenger to drown without seeking assistance or notifying the police. His criminal past also included convictions in 2008 of driving with a revoked license, in .2000 for unlawful driving as an habitual traffic offender, and in 1998 for driving with a suspended license and obstruction of justice. Based on that record, the district court sentenced Cordova to 18 months of imprisonment and 3 years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-22\">In 2012, the district court revoked Cor-dova\u2019s supervised release for driving without a license and sentenced him to 13 months of imprisonment and 23 months of supervised release. Immigration officials deported Cordova, but he reentered the United States illegally and was arrested by Florida officers for a traffic violation. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>government petitioned to revoke Cordova\u2019s supervised release a second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">In the meantime, Cordova pleaded guilty to Centering the United States illegally. <em>Id. </em>Cordova\u2019s presentence investigation report recounted his criminal history and numerous traffic offenses. With an adjusted offense level of 12, United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2L1.2(a), (b)(1)(D) (Nov.2014), and a criminal history of IV, Cordova faced an advisory guideline range of 21 to 27 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The district court consolidated Cordo-va\u2019s reentry proceeding and the petition for revocation of his supervised release. Cordova admitted that he had reentered the country illegally and committed traffic violations, and the district court revoked his supervised release. Based on Cordo-va\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, the district court reduced the offense level for his reentry offense from 12 to 10, which resulted in a revised advisory guideline range of 15 to 21 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">With respect to Cordova\u2019s second violation of supervised release, the district court considered the parties\u2019 arguments and the information in the petition for revocation, and determined that a sentence within the advisory guideline range of 18 to 24 months was appropriate. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(2), 7B1.4(a). Because the maximum statutory sentence that Cordova faced was 86 months, and he had served 13 months for his first violation, the district court sentenced him to 23 months. For Cordova\u2019s reentry offense, the district court considered the parties\u2019, arguments, the presentence investigation report, and the statutory sentencing factors and sentenced Cordova to 21 months. The district court ordered that Cordova\u2019s sentences run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by sentencing Cordova to 23 months for the second violation of his supervised release and to a consecutive term of 21 months for reentering the United States illegally. The district court determined that Cordova\u2019s \u201ccriminal history ... underrepresented\u201d the \u201cmultiple occasions! that he had] come into the country illegally\u201d and his \u201crepetitive traffic violations,\u201d one of which evidenced a \u201ccallous disregard\u201d for human life. Cordova\u2019s \u201cindifference to our rules and laws\u201d made him, as stated by the district court, \u201ca menace to the community\u201d that warranted sentences to the maximum remaining penalty for violating his supervised release and to the high end of the revised sentencing range for his illegal reentry. Those sentences, the district court reasonably determined, were required to address Cordo-va\u2019s \u201clackadaisical attitude\u201d about supervised release, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3583(c), 3553(a), and to provide adequate punishment, to protect the public, and to deter Cordova from continuing to reenter this country illegally, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a). Based on those factors, the district court also reasonably decided to order that Cordova\u2019s sentences run consecutively. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3584(b). Although Cordova entered the country ostensibly to see his wife and children, the district court determined that Cordova\u2019s criminal history warranted a lengthy sentence. Cordova\u2019s sentence of 44 months, which is well below the maximum statutory penalty of 10 years for his illegal reentry, is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">We AFFIRM Cordova\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
