Ltd. (\u201cKAL\u201d), in Jacob\u2019s suit alleging that he suffered injuries as the result of his travel on a KAL flight from Honolulu, Hawaii to India on September 6-7, 2011. KAL, for its part,' says that Jacob was not carrying proper immigration documentation on the flight, and as a result, KAL was ordered by the Indian government to return Jacob to the United States. The parties do not dispute that Jacob\u2019s claims are governed by a treaty known as the Montreal Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>vention,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which provides the exclusive cause of action to passengers who suffer \u201cbodily injury\u201d caused by an \u201caccident\u201d during \u201cinternational carriage by air,\u201d within the meaning of Articles 1 and 17 of the Convention. The district court granted KAL\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Jacob\u2019s Montreal Convention claim on the ground that Jacob failed to present sufficient evidence of a \u201cbodily injury\u201d caused by an \u201caccident,\u201d and dismissed Jacob\u2019s conversion claim on the ground that it was preempted by the Convention. On appeal, Jacob argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because it did not \u201cflexibly\u201d apply the term accident; it improperly required expert testimony concerning causation; and it improperly shifted the burden of proof to Jacobs. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Weeks v. Harden Mfg. Corp., </em>291 F.3d 1307, 1311 (11th Cir.2002). Summary judgment is proper when the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, presents no genuine issue of material fact and compels judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). A movant also may carry its summary judgment burden by showing an absence of evidence to support the nonmovant\u2019s case. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). But \u201c[a] mere scintilla of evidence in support of the non-moving party will not suffice to overcome a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Young v. City of Palm Bay, </em>358 F.3d 859, 860 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">Liability exists under Article 17 of the Montreal Convention only if an \u201caccident\u201d caused a plaintiffs death or injury. An \u201caccident\u201d under the Convention is an \u201cunexpected or unusual event or happening that is external to the passenger.\u201d <em>Air France v. Saks, </em>470 U.S. 392, 405, 105 S.Ct. 1338, 84 L.Ed.2d 289 (1985).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cThis definition should be flexibly applied after assessment of all the circumstances surrounding a passenger\u2019s injuries.\u201d ' <em>Id. </em>However, \u201cwhen the injury indisputably results from the passenger\u2019s own internal reaction to the usual, normal, and expected operation of the aircraft, it has not been caused by an accident.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">Here, Jacob claimed several \u201caccidents\u201d that caused him injury, including: (1) an employee\u2019s theft of $2,000 in cash from Jacob; (2) the \u201cdenial of access to medicine\u201d in Mumbai when his luggage was checked (and again on his return flight when he stopped over in Seoul, where he did not have access to his checked luggage); (3) KAL\u2019s failure to call a physician for him at the gate in Mumbai or upon his arrival in Seoul; (4) the failure to provide Jacob with diabetic meals on any flight on his return from Mumbai to Honolulu; (5) KAL\u2019s failure to allow Jacob to \u201cstroll the transit facility\u201d or go through immigration in Seoul; (6) Jacob\u2019s \u201cdetention\u201d in the holding area in Seoul; (7) KAL\u2019s failure to feed or provide \u201cproper hydration\u201d to Jacob in the holding facility in Seoul; and (8) KAL\u2019s \u201cfailure to assist\u201d Jacob when he fell back into his seat because of his swollen legs. Jacob also sets forth several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>injuries he believes KAL caused \u2014 namely, his swollen legs, his later need to begin treating his diabetes with insulin, his later chest pains requiring open-heart surgery, and mental anguish.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Even assuming that' the incidents Jacob described properly constituted \u201caccidents\u201d under the Montreal Convention, we agree with the district court that Jacob failed to provide any medical evidence that any of the alleged \u201caccidents\u201d caused or even contributed to his injuries. Although causation is an issue generally left to a jury, the medical causation in this case \u2014 which involves technical and scientific issues concerning diabetes and heart disease \u2014 falls beyond the scope of a layperson\u2019s knowledge and requires competent medical testimony. <em>See, e.g., Allison v. McGhan Med. Corp., </em>184 F.3d 1300, 1320 (11th Cir.1999) (holding, under Georgia law, that expert medical testimony was essential to prove that silicone breast implants caused plaintiffs systemic disease); <em>Carroll v. Beto, </em>421 F.2d 1065, 1068 (5th Cir.1970) (holding that lay testimony was not sufficient to establish competence to stand trial, and that \u201cexpert testimony [was] essential\u201d);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>see also Wills v. Amerada Hess Corp., </em>379 F.3d 32, 36-37, 41 (2d Cir.2004) (holding, where the estate of a deceased seaman suing under the Jones Act claimed that long-term exposure to toxic chemicals caused the decedent\u2019s death, that \u201cexpert testimony on the issue of causation is necessary in Jones Act cases where a lay juror could not be expected to intuit the causal relationship between the acts in question and the injury\u201d); <em>Mitchell v. United States, </em>141 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir.1998) (holding, under Massachusetts law, that \u201ca plaintiff in a medical malpractice action may carry his or her burden of proof on the issues of negligence and causation only with the assistance of expert testimony.\u201d). Yet the medical records Jacob proffered did not support his theory that the alleged \u201caccidents\u201d caused the injuries of which he complains. Rather, the records showed that Jacob underwent several tests all of which were negative, his complaints had subsided, and he was discharged that same day without any follow up treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">In fact, Jacob failed to submit any medical-expert evidence at all in opposition to summary judgment. He claimed as proof that the flight caused bodily injury the fact that he was transported off the aircraft by wheelchair and underwent tests in a hospital. However, as the district court noted, simply because someone asks for a wheelchair and makes vague complaints of injury resulting in the taking of several diagnostic tests does not translate into proof of an injury. Further, contrary to Jacob\u2019s argument that the district court erred in requiring a showing of permanent injury, the record shows that the court did not impose this requirement. Instead, the court simply addressed and rejected Jacob\u2019s claim that he sustained long-term diabetic and cardiac injuries as a result of his KAL travel. For these reasons, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to KAL on the Montreal Convention' claim. <em>See Webster v. Offshore Food Serv., </em>434 F.2d 1191, 1193 (5th Cir.1970) (granting summary judgment for the defendant, the only party who submitted medical expert testimony on \u201con technical questions of medical causation beyond the competence of lay determination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Nor did the district court err in concluding that the Montreal Convention bars purely mental injuries. <em>See Eastern Airlines, Inc. v. Floyd, </em>499 U.S. 530, 534, 111 S.Ct. 1489, 113 L.Ed.2d 569 (1991). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>As for Jacob\u2019s attempts to characterize his physical injuries as manifestations of mental distress, at best, \u201cmental injuries are recoverable under Article 17 only to the extent that they have been caused by bodily injuries.\u201d <em>Ehrlich v. Am. Airlines, Inc., </em>360 F.3d 366, 400 (2d Cir.2004). Jacob\u2019s causation, however, is backwards\u2014the Convention simply does not provide a remedy for <em>subsequent </em>physical manifestations of an earlier emotional injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Finally, to the extent Jacob is reviving his conversion claim, the district court did not err in dismissing it. Jacob claimed before the district court that his allegation that KAL agents took $2,000 from him fell \u201coutside\u201d of the Montreal Convention. But, as the district court held, Article 17.2 of the Montreal Convention provides the exclusive remedy for a claim for property lost or damaged during international carriage. Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-5\">. <em>See </em>The Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, May 28, 1999 (entered into force on Nov. 4, 2003), <em>reprinted in </em>S.
