After an unsatisfactory outcome, Fisher brought a state court lawsuit accusing the presiding judge in that case of bias. Fisher\u2019s complaint was dismissed and he subsequently filed this \u00a7 1988 action in federal court repeating his allegations of bias and seeking reversal of the judgment in the probate dispute. The district court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>See Liedtke v. State Bar of Tex., </em>18 F.3d 315, 317 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201cAbsent specific law otherwise providing, that doctrine directs that federal district courts lack jurisdiction to entertain collateral attacks on state court judgments.\u201d). Fisher has failed to provide any reason why the district court\u2019s determination was in error. Accordingly, his appeal is DISMISSED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b215-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
