For the reasons that follow, we vacate that order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">On February 24, 2014, Mr. Glaze pled guilty with the assistance of retained counsel to one count of conspiracy with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine. On May 9, 2014, the district court sentenced Mr. Glaze to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by 5 years of supervised release. Four and a half months later, on September 29, 2014, Mr. Glaze filed a <em>pro se </em>\u201cMotion for Relief from Judgment Pursuant to Fed.R.CivJP. Rule 60(b)(3), Rule 60(b)(4), and Rule 60(d)(3)\u201d in which he asked the court to \u201cvacate [his] judgment and sentence.\u201d In that motion, he asserted, among other things, that his trial counsel was ineffective, the sting operation that resulted in his arrest was racially motivated, and his guilty plea was obtained fraudulently, all in violation of the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">Two days later, the district court summarily denied Mr. Glaze\u2019s motion. As relevant here, the court stated: \u201cDefendant is seeking to vacate his sentence pursuant to a rule of civil procedure. Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). Rule 60(b) ... does not provide relief from a judgment in a criminal case.\u201d Mr. Glaze appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-14\">We generally review a district court\u2019s ruling on a Rule 60 motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Burke v. Smith, </em>252 F.3d 1260, 1263 (11th Cir.2001). But here, the district court\u2019s conclusion that 60(b) did not provide a vehicle for relief was a threshold legal conclusion, and we review that conclusion <em>de novo. See AIG Baker Sterling Heights, LLC v. Am. Multi-Cinema, Inc., </em>579 F.3d 1268, 1270 (11th Cir.2009). We, like the district court, must liberally construe pleadings prepared by <em>pro se </em>litigants. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-15\">\u201cFederal courts have long recognized that they have an obligation to look beyond the label of a motion filed by a <em>pro se </em>inmate and determine whether the motion is, in effect, cognizable under a different remedial statutory framework.\u201d <em>See Gooden v. United States, </em>627 F.3d 846, 847 (11th Cir.2010). We see no indication that the district court did so here despite the fact that Mr. Glaze moved the court to vacate his conviction and sentence, a motion that could properly be considered under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-16\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-10\">. We note, however, that Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(e) does impose some restrictions on the district court\u2019s authority to address Mr. Glaze\u2019s request to have his guilty plea set aside.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
