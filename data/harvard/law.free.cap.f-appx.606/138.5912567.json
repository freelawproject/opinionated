He contends that the sentence is substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He argues that the guideline range was too high to fulfill \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s goals because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based and effectively double counts a defendant\u2019s criminal record. He also contends that the range overstated the seriousness of his nonviolent reentry offense and failed to account for his personal history and characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-21\">We review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, 564 </em>F.3d 750, 751-52 (5th Cir.2009). We apply a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness to a within guidelines sentence. <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 360 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-22\">In reliance on <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 109-10, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and for purposes of preserving the issue for possible further review, Bonilla argues that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply because the illegal reentry guideline lacks an empirical basis. As Bonilla concedes, his \u2022 argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 366-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-23\">We have consistently rejected \u201cdouble counting\u201d arguments and arguments that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 results in excessive sentences because it is not empirically based. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31. We also have rejected the \u201ctrespass\u201d argument that Bonilla asserts. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-24\">The district court considered Bonilla\u2019s arguments for a lower sentence. Bonilla has not shown that his sentence does not account for a sentencing factor that should receive significant weight, gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or represents a clear error of judgment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>balancing sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Mere disagreement with the propriety of his sentence or with the weight given to \u00a7 3553(a) factors does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010). The judgment of the district court as AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b166-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
