He argues that the district court erred in concluding that his prior illegal reentry conviction, predicated on his Iowa theft conviction, qualified as an aggravated felony under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). Specifically, Galindo contends that the prior \u00a7 1326 conviction is not an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(O) because the court lacked sufficient documentation to determine whether the underlying theft conviction qualified as a theft offense under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-21\">We review Galindo\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Medina-Torres, </em>703 F.3d 770, 773 (5th Cir.2012). Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) provides for an eight-level enhancement if the defendant was deported after a prior aggravated felony conviction. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). The term \u201caggravated felony\u201d is defined in \u00a7 1101(a)(43). \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.3(A)). This definition includes an illegal reentry offense under \u00a7 1326 if the offense was committed after the defendant was deported on the basis of another aggravated felony also set out in \u00a7 1101(a)(43). <em>See </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(O); <em>United States v. Gam-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number><em>boa-Garcia, </em>620 F.3d 546, 548 (5th Cir.2010). The term \u201caggravated felony\u201d also includes a \u201ctheft offense\u201d for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The judgment in Galindo\u2019s prior illegal reentry case reflects that he was convicted of unlawful reentry by a previously deported convicted felon, in violation of \u00a7 1326(a) and \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Thus, the prior judgment reflects that Galindo\u2019s illegal reentry conviction occurred subsequent to an aggravated felony, and the district court was entitled to rely on that judgment. <em>See Gamboa-Garcia, </em>620 F.3d at 549. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b168-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
