We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b217-23\">Government Technical Services, LLC (GTS), owned by Joseph Terry, was a general contractor in the business of providing construction services to governmental entities. Gray is an insurance company that issues payment and performance bonds as surety for general contractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-24\">The present dispute arises from a surety agreement between Gray and GTS. To en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>sure compliance with the Miller Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> GTS requested Gray to issue payment and performance bonds, as surety for government construction projects for which GTS would serve as the general contractor. Gray and GTS executed a surety agreement under which Gray agreed \u201cto furnish, procure or continue contracts of suretyship\u201d on behalf of GTS, and GTS agreed to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2D\">indemnify and hold [Gray] harmless from all loss, liability, damages and expenses including, but not limited to, court costs, interests and attorney\u2019s fees, which [Gray] incurs or sustains (1) because of having furnished any Bond, or (2) because of the failure of an Indemnitor to discharge any obligations under this Agreement, or (3) in enforcing any of the provisions of this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The surety agreement was signed by GTS as an indemnitor, and by Joseph Terry, Aaron Terry, and Tammie Terry as individual indemnitors.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">On a number of GTS\u2019s government construction projects for which Gray issued a payment and performance bond, GTS\u2019s subcontractors asserted claims against GTS and Gray for payment. Gray paid several of the claims and incurred costs and attorney\u2019s fees in connection with investigating and resolving each claim. As of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, Gray had incurred a loss of $1,683,509.82 in claims and costs associated with the surety agreement, approximately $600,000 of which were legal fees, costs, and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Gray first brought suit against GTS and the individual indemnitors in 2007. At that time, there were unsettled issues regarding whether the payments made by Gray had been properly paid, and the district court dismissed the case without prejudice to allow for these issues to be resolved. In 2013, Gray filed a Motion to Lift Stay and Reopen Litigation because the claims underlying Gray\u2019s indemnity action had been resolved. Shortly after Gray filed a motion for summary judgment, GTS informed the district court that it had filed for bankruptcy. The district court stayed the proceedings against GTS due to the pending bankruptcy action pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362, but granted summary judgment to Gray against Joseph, Aaron, and Tammie Terry and ordered them to indemnify Gray in the amount of $1,683,509.82. Aaron and Tammie Terry now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Summary judgment is appropriate if \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">The surety agreement is governed by Louisiana law, which provides that \u201c[w]hen the words of a contract are clear and explicit and lead to no absurd consequences, no further interpretation may be made in search of the parties\u2019 intent.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The terms of the surety agreement are clear. They require the Terrys to indemnify Gray for all losses Gray incurs \u201c(1) because of having furnished any Bond, or (2) because of the failure of an Indemnitor to discharge any obligations under this Agreement, or (3) in enforcing any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>provisions of this Agreement.\u201d The test set forth in the surety agreement is one of causation, whether Gray incurred losses <em>because </em>it furnished a payment and performance bond for GTS. The Terrys must indemnify Gray for all payments made to claimants pursuant to the bonds. The Terrys must also indemnify Gray for the costs it incurred in investigating and resolving those claims, even when Gray did not ultimately make a payment to the claimant, because those costs and fees were incurred because Gray furnished the bonds on behalf of GTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The Terrys assert that there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Gray acted in bad faith by making payments on certain claims despite GTS having valid defenses against those claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, by the very terms of the surety agreement, whether GTS had a valid defense against a subcontractor\u2019s claim was not a condition precedent to GTS\u2019s and the Terrys\u2019 obligations to indemnify Gray. The surety agreement only requires that Gray incur the expenses \u201cbecause of having furnished any Bond,\u201d and it is undisputed that the losses Gray is claiming were incurred in connection to having furnished bonds in favor of GTS. Furthermore, the Terrys failed to adduce any evidence indicating that Gray acted with any dishonesty or commercial unreasonableness when investigating and settling the underlying claims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The Terrys argue that summary judgment is improper because Gray has not provided proper documentation of the Attorney\u2019s fees and costs it incurred in excess of $600,000. Under the terms of the surety agreement, the evidence Gray adduced to prove its fees is adequate to establish the Terrys\u2019 obligation to indemnify: \u201cVouchers or other evidence of such payments, including records of any nature maintained by the Surety in the ordinary course of business, shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and extent of the liability of the Indemnitors to the Surety.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Gray provided ledgers it kept in the ordinary course of business indicating the payments it made for legal services in connection with the claims submitted under the bonds. These records were sufficient, under the agreement, to establish a prima facie case against the Terrys for indemnification. The Terrys have failed to provide any evidence to rebut the accuracy of these fees or that would indicate that Gray acted in bad faith. \u2019 Instead, the Ter-rys assert that the amount of Gray\u2019s legal fees is unreasonable. They rely on <em>Central Progressive Bank v. Bradley </em>for the proposition that Louisiana law prohibits lawyers from charging a \u201cclearly excessive fee.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The decision in <em>Central Progressive </em>dealt with a rule against excessive fees as set forth in the disciplinary rules for the Louisiana bar. That case did not concern an indemnity agreement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In any event, the Terrys provided no evidence that would indicate that the amount of legal fees Gray incurred over several years, litigating claims asserted by a number of GTS\u2019s subcontractors, was excessive, let alone clearly so. Gray satisfied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>the prima fade standard for indemnification of attorney\u2019s fees as set forth by the contract, and Terry failed to provide any evidence indicating the excessiveness of these fees. Gray is entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b217-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
