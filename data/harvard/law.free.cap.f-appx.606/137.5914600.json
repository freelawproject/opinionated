Approximately 18 months after entry of the judgment of conviction, Mulder filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, arguing, inter aha, that counsel rendered ineffective assistance and that the district court lacked subject matter \u2019 jurisdiction over the criminal proceeding. The district court denied the motion to withdraw. Now, Mulder moves this court for authorization to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) in this appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw guilty plea, as well as the denials of his motion for declaratory judgment and his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-22\">Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(e), Mulder could not withdraw his guilty plea once the district court imposed his sentence. Rather, the guilty plea could be set aside <em>\u201conly </em>on direct appeal or collateral attack.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim,P. 11(e) (emphasis added). Because Mulder\u2019s motion to withdraw guilty plea was filed after he was sentenced, his motion was unauthorized and without a jurisdictional basis. <em>See id.; United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994). Mulder thus has not demonstrated a nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, his motion to proceed IFP on appeal is denied, Fed.R.App. P. 24(a), and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 &amp; n. 24 (5th Cir.1997); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-23\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b165-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
