Lindsay\u2019s largely unintelligible brief on appeal fails to cure these deficiencies. Accordingly, his outstanding motions are DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 42.2. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 n. 24 (5th Cir.1997). Lindsay is CAUTIONED that future frivolous or repetitive filings will result in the imposition of sanctions, including dismissal, monetary sanctions, and restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court or any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction. He is further CAUTIONED to review all pending matters in this court and move to dismiss any that are frivolous or repetitive.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b303-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
