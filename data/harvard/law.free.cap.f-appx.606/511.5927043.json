In 2002, a jury convicted Pla-sencia of the 1996 murder of Michaelene Blastic. Plasencia\u2019s guidelines range was 156 to 260 months\u2019 imprisonment. The state trial court imposed a 30-year sentence, which reflected a 100-month upward departure from the guidelines range, based on its own judicial determination that the crime was one of violence and was especially heinous, atrocious^ or cruel.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">We issued a certificate of appealability (COA) as to whether Plasencia\u2019s 30-year sentence violates the rule announced in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Pla-sencia argues the state court\u2019s decision denying his <em>Blakely </em>claim was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. He asserts that, because he was sentenced under Florida\u2019s 1994 mandatory sentencing guidelines, the statutory maximum the state trial court could impose without any additional fact finding was 260 months\u2019 imprisonment. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-14\">I. PROCEDURAL BAR</p>\n<p id=\"b540-15\">As an initial matter, the State contends Plasencia waived his <em>Blakely </em>claim by not raising it until his motion for rehearing on direct appeal in state court. \u201cFederal habeas review of a petitioner\u2019s claim is typically precluded when the petitioner procedurally defaulted on or failed to exhaust the claim in state court.\u201d <em>Pope v. Sec\u2019y for the Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>680 F.3d 1271, 1284 (11th Cir.2012). A claim is not subject to procedural default unless the \u201clast state court to review the claim states clearly and expressly that its judgment rests on a procedural bar ... and that bar provides an adequate and independent state ground for denying relief.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Singletary, </em>938 F.2d 1166, 1173 (11th Cir.1991) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-16\">The State\u2019s argument that Plasencia waived his <em>Blakely </em>claim because he did not raise it on direct appeal is unavailing because Plasencia raised his <em>Blakely </em>argument in his motion for rehearing after direct appeal. The motion for rehearing was denied by the state appellate court without explanation. Plasencia also raised his <em>Blakely </em>challenge in his Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850 motion. The state habeas trial court denied Plasencia\u2019s claim on the merits, albeit in terms of a violation of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Moreover, Plasencia set forth his <em>Blakely </em>argument in his brief on appeal, and the state habeas appellate court affirmed in a decision without opinion. This Court interprets the state habeas appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>court\u2019s affirmance without an opinion to be a denial on the merits. <em>See Shelton v. Sec\u2019y, Dep't of Gorr., </em>691 F.3d 1348, 1353 (11th Cir.2012). Thus, Plasencia\u2019s claim is not proeedurally barred because the state court did not \u201cclearly and expressly [state] that its judgment rests on a procedural bar.\u201d <em>See Johnson, </em>938 F.2d at 1173. Furthermore, Plasencia exhausted his state court remedies because he presented his claim to the state\u2019s highest court in his motion for rehearing on direct appeal, and in his Rule 3.850 motion, which was affirmed <em>per curiam </em>by the Second District Court of Appeal. <em>See Ward v. Hall, </em>592 F.3d 1144, 1156 (11th Cir.2010) (stating to exhaust state remedies, a petitioner must have presented the issues raised in the federal habeas petition to the state\u2019s highest court,' either on direct appeal or collateral review); <em>see also Jenkins v. State, </em>385 So.2d 1356, 1359 (Fla.1980) (holding a <em>per curiam </em>affirmance from a Florida District Court of Appeal is not renewable by the Florida Supreme Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">II. <em>BLAKELY </em>ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), as amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), federal courts are precluded from granting habeas relief on claims that were previously adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the adjudication:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">In <em>Apprendi </em>the Supreme Court held that, \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. In <em>Blakely, </em>the Supreme Court applied the rule announced in <em>Apprendi </em>to hold a Washington. state trial court violated the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights by sentencing the defendant to 90 months\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 which reflected a 37-month upward departure from the standard guideline range of 49 to 53 months\u2014 based upon the trial court\u2019s own finding that the crime involved \u201cdeliberate cruelty.\u201d 542 U.S. at 299-304, 124 S.Ct. 2531. Although the statute provided a statutory maximum of ten years\u2019 imprisonment, the Court explained the \u201c \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d Id. </em>at 303, 124 S.Ct. 2531. We have emphasized that <em>Blakely </em>was decided in the context of a mandatory guidelines system. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1297-98 (11th Cir.2005). .</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">As to the merits of Plasencia\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>claim, this Court interprets the state habe-as appellate court\u2019s <em>per curiam </em>affirmance as a denial on the merits. <em>See Shelton </em>691 F.3d at 1353 (11th Cir.2012). The state court\u2019s decision is therefore entitled to deference under \u00a7 2254(d). <em>See id. </em>Thus, in order to prevail on this claim, Plasencia must show that the state court\u2019s decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely </em>applies to Plasencia\u2019s case because his conviction was not yet final when the Supreme Court issued <em>Blakely. See Schriro v. Summerlin, </em>542 U.S. 348, 351, 124 S.Ct. 2519, 159 L.Ed.2d 442 (2004) (explaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>when the Supreme Court issues a decision that \u201cresults in a \u2018new rule,\u2019 that rule applies to all criminal cases still pending on direct review\u201d). The Florida Supreme Court has determined that a conviction is not final until the appellate court has issued the mandate. <em>Hughes v. State, </em>901 So.2d 837, 839 (Fla.2005). The Supreme Court issued <em>Blakely </em>on June 24, 2004. 542 U.S. at 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531. Although the state appellate court affirmed Plasen-cia\u2019s conviction and sentence on June 23, 2004, the mandate did not issue until March 30, 2005. Because Plasencia\u2019s case was pending on direct review, the rule announce in <em>Blakely </em>applied to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Because <em>Blakely </em>was decided in the context of a mandatory guideline system, Pla-sencia\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>claim depends on whether the Florida guidelines under which he was sentenced were mandatory or advisory. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1297. Plasen-cia asserts he was sentenced under the mandatory 1994 sentencing guidelines because the commission date of his offense fell within the window of <em>Heggs v. State, </em>759 So.2d 620 (Fla.2000). In <em>Heggs, </em>the Florida Supreme Court invalidated Florida\u2019s 1995 sentencing guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 630-31. Thus, individuals who committed crimes between October 1, 1995, and May 24, 1997, were resentenced under the 1994 sentencing guidelines. <em>Trapp v. State, </em>760 So.2d 924, 928 (Fla.2000); <em>cf. Poole v. State, </em>968 So.2d 82, 83 (Fla. 5th DCA 2007) (\u201cBased upon the date of his offense, Poole fell within the <em>Heggs </em>window and was sentenced under the 1994 guidelines.\u201d (footnote omitted)). Because Plasencia\u2019s offense occurred in February 1996, his offense falls within the <em>Heggs </em>window. Indeed, his guidelines calculation score sheet was entitled \u201cNepg's-Sentencing Guidelines Scoresheet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Defendants sentenced pursuant to the 1994 Florida sentencing guidelines were sentenced under a determinate sentencing scheme. The 1994 sentencing guidelines provided \u201c[sentences imposed by trial court judges under the 1994 revised sentencing guidelines on or after January 1, 1994, must be within the 1994 guidelines unless there is a departure sentence with written findings.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 921.001(5) (1994). Moreover, Florida courts have recognized that, for defendants sentenced under the guidelines sentencing scheme, which used several factors and discretion in calculating the maximum guideline range, <em>Blakely </em>could provide relief, even if the sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum. <em>See Plott v. State, </em>148 So.3d 90, 95 (Fla.2014) (quashing the appellate court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s Rule 3.800 motion because the defendant\u2019s four sentences of life imprisonment imposed upon resentencing pursuant to <em>Heggs </em>were unconstitutionally enhanced under <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>where the trial court imposed an upward departure without empaneling a jury to make the necessary factual determination); <em>Boardman v. State, </em>69 So.3d 367, 369 (Fla. 2d DCA 2011) (stating that, if Blakely applied retroactively to cases on collateral review, it could apply to a defendant who was sentenced under the 1994 sentencing guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The maximum sentence the state trial court could impose under <em>Blakely </em>without any additional fact findings was the top of Plasencia\u2019s guideline range \u2014 260 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court imposed a 360-month sentence, which reflected a 100-month upward departure, based on its own factual findings. Because the state trial court imposed an upward departure based on facts that were not submitted to or proven to a jury, Plasencia\u2019s sentence was imposed in violation of <em>Blakely. </em>Nevertheless, as will be discussed in the next section, a reasonable court could have determined that any <em>Blakely </em>error was harmless; thus, the state court\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>was not unreasonable. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">III. HARMLESS ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">In <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>the Supreme Court determined the appropriate standard for harmlessness of a non-structural constitutional error on collateral review is whether the error \u201chad substantial. and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d 507 U.S. 619, 623, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (quotation omitted). A non-structural constitutional error \u201coccurs during the presentation of the case to the jury\u201d and can be \u201cassessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine the effect it had on the trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 629, 113 S.Ct. 1710 (quotation and alterations omitted). The Supreme Court has held <em>Blakely </em>error is not a structural error. <em>See Washington v. Recuenco, </em>548 U.S. 212, 222, 126 S.Ct. 2546, 165 L.Ed.2d 466 (2006) (concluding, in the context of a direct appeal, that failing to submit a sentencing factor to the jury was not structural error and was thus subject to harmless error review).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">\u201cWhen reviewing the harmlessness of an error under the <em>Brecht </em>standard, if, when all is said and done, the court\u2019s conviction \u25a0 is sure that the error did not influence, or had but very slight effect, the verdict and judgment should stand.\u201d <em>Ross v. United States, </em>289 F.3d 677, 683 (11th Cir.2002) (quotations and alterations omitted). However, an error is not harmless if the court is \u201cin grave doubt about whether a trial error of federal law had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The <em>Brecht </em>harmless-error standard applies to a <em>Blakely </em>challenge raised in a \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>See Lovins v. Parker, </em>712 F.3d 283, 303-04 (6th Cir.2013) (concluding the <em>Blakely </em>error was not harmless).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">In the context of direct appeals, we have determined a <em>Blakely </em>error is harmless \u201cif it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant guilty absent the error.\u201d <em>United States v. King, </em>751 F.3d 1268, 1279 (11th Cir.2014) (quotation and alterations omitted) (applying harmless error review to errors under <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013)); <em>United States v. Dulcio, </em>441 F.3d 1269, 1277 (11th Cir.2006) (reviewing <em>Blakely </em>claim for harmless error).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">. Under the Florida law applicable to Pla-sencia\u2019s sentence, an aggravating factor may warrant a departure above the guideline range if \u201c[t]he offense was one of violence and was committed in a manner that was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 921.0016(3)(b) (1994). The Florida Supreme Court has upheld the determination that a crime was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel where the victim was strangled. <em>Stephens v. State, </em>975 So.2d 405, 423 (Fla.2007) (analyzing the especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel aggravating factor in a capital case).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">Plasencia cannot prevail under either the <em>Brecht </em>standard or the more petitioner-friendly harmless-error standard applied to <em>Blakely </em>challenges raised on direct appeal. <em>See Hittson v. GDCP Warden, </em>759 F.3d 1210, 1233-34 n. 26 (11th Cir.2014) (indicating harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt is a more petitioner-friendly standard). A rational jury would have found Plasencia warranted an upward departure because the crime was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel. The evidence presented at trial showed Blastic was found dead in her refrigerator, the cause of death was by strangulation, there was a struggle, and she had blunt trauma to her face and anus that occurred prior to her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>The Florida Supreme Court has upheld determinations that the especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating factor applies in cases involving strangulation, <em>see Stephens, </em>975 So.2d at 423, and has stated, \u201cit is permissible to infer that strangulation, when perpetrated upon a conscious victim, involves foreknowledge of death, extreme anxiety and fear, and that this method of killing is one to which the factor of heinousness is applicable,\u201d <em>Tompkins v. State, </em>502 So.2d 415, 421 (Fla.1986). Thus, a rational jury would have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Plasencia\u2019s strangulation of Blastic, while she was conscious and struggling, was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See King, </em>751 F.3d at 1279; <em>Dulcio, </em>441 F.3d at 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Because a reasonable court could conclude any <em>Blakely </em>error was harmless, the state court\u2019s decision denying Plasencia\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>claim was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. Accordingly, the district court did not err by denying Ground Two of Plasencia\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ARc\">.
