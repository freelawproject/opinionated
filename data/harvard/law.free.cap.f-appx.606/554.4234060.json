A few days later, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer interviewed him. During the interview, he admitted that he had illegally entered the United States for the fourth time in 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-21\">Ramirez-Alvarado later pleaded guilty to one count of illegal reentry by an aggravated felon, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) &amp; (b)(2). In sentencing him for that crime, the district court calculated his advisory guidelines range as 77 to 96 months imprisonment. It then varied downward and imposed a 72-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-22\">Ramirez-Alvarado contends that his downward variance sentence was substantively unreasonable \u2014 that the court did not go low enough. The thrust of his argument is that he should have gotten some credit for freely admitting his date of reentry to ICE officials. But for his honesty, Ramirez-Alvarado argues, he might have been found to have \u201ccommenced\u201d his illegal reentry offense in 2014, his \u201cencounter\u201d date of reentry, as opposed to 2012, his actual date of reentry. If that were the case, his advisory guidelines range would have been significantly lower \u2014 37 to 46 months instead of 77 to 96 months\u2014 because two of his prior convictions would not have received criminal history points, and he would have received only a 12-level, as opposed to a 16-level, enhancement under United States Sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e) (explaining that certain prior convictions are not scored if the resulting sentence was imposed too many years before the defendant \u201ccommenced\u201d his instant offense of conviction); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) (providing that, if a defendant previously was deported after having been convicted of a felony that is a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d he receives a 16-level enhancement if the conviction was scored and a 12-level enhancement if it was not); <em>United States v. Castrillon-Gonzalez, </em>77 F.3d 403, 406 (11th Cir.1996) (holding that, for purposes of calculating a defendant\u2019s criminal history score, \u201cthe commencement of the crime of being \u2018found in\u2019 the United States [under 8 U..S.C. \u00a7 1326] is at the point of entry\u201d). He also argues that the district court failed to consider that the low end of his advisory guidelines range (77 months) was much higher than the 24-month sentence that he had received for a previous illegal reentry conviction, and that his personal history and characteristics merited a shorter sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S, 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Under that deferential standard, we will vacate a sentence \u201conly if[ ] we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ] factors' by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quotation marks omitted). The party challenging a sentence has the burden of showing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the entire record, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the substantial deference afforded sentencing courts. <em>United States v. Langston, </em>590 F.3d 1226, 1236 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Ramirez-Alvarado\u2019s 72-month sentence is substantively reasonable. For starters, it is a below-guidelines sentence. Because we ordinarily expect <em>within-guidelines </em>sentences to be reasonable, <em>see United States v. Asante, </em>782 F.3d 639, 648 (11th Cir.2015), that fact alone is a strong indicator of the sentence\u2019s reasonableness. Equally to the point, the sentence was not the product of a clear error in judgment. The district court considered the advisory guidelines range, treated it as advisory, and varied downward based on the fact that \u201cold\u201d convictions \u201ctriggered] a very large adjustment in the calculation of the guideline range.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It did not vary downward as much as Ramirez-Alvarad\u00f3 would have liked, however, because it determined that a shorter sentence (such as the 24-month sentence that he previously received for the same crime) would not adequately deter him from illegally entering the country a fifth time. The court also determined that a shorter sentence would not adequately account for the fact that he had committed multiple crimes each time he had entered the United States, including burglaries of private residences, burglary of a motor vehicle, multiple thefts, driving without a license, and driving under the influence. Ramirez-Alvarado has failed to meet his burden of showing that his downward variance sentence is unreasonably long in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the facts of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-10\">. In a way, then, the district court did give Ramirez-Alvarado credit for being honest with ICE. Of course, his real reward was not receiving an obstruction of justice enhancement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
