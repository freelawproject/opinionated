He contends that the district court plainly erred by entering judgment against him under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), because he was not removed from the United States following a conviction for an aggravated felony. Avila\u2019s previous conviction was based on an indictment for delivery of a controlled substance. The indictment indicated that Avila had actually transferred, constructively transferred, and offered to sell a controlled substance, each of which would have been sufficient on its own for a conviction. Because Avila\u2019s prior conviction could have been obtained under an offering-to-sell theory, which is not a felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act, it was not an aggravated felony. <em>See United States v. Ibarra-Luna, </em>628 F.3d 712, 714-16 &amp; n. 19 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Avila did not raise this argument in the district court, so we review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). To establish plain error, Avila must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but should do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">The parties agree on the appropriate resolution of this issue, and they are correct. Avila\u2019s conviction should have been entered under \u00a7 1326(b)(1) for being unlawfully present in the United States following removal subsequent to a felony conviction, which allows a maximum of a 10-year sentence of imprisonment, not under \u00a7 1326(b)(2) for being unlawfully present in the United States following removal subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony, which allows a maximum sentence of 20 years of imprisonment. Since the district court sentenced Avila to 36 months of imprisonment, which is well within the correct statutory maximum of 10 years of imprisonment, and since nothing in the record indicates that the district court\u2019s possibly-erroneous belief that the statutory maximum was 20 years of imprisonment affected its sentencing decision, Avila cannot show that the error affected his substantial rights and therefore cannot show plain error. <em>See Mon-dragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 369. Nevertheless, due to possible immigration consequences, remand is necessary for the entry of a corrected written judgment reflecting a conviction under \u00a7 1326(b)(1) instead of \u00a7 1326(b)(2). <em>See United States v. Mendoza-Perez, </em>496 Fed.Appx. 431, 438-39 &amp; n. 26 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-14\">Avila also contends that the district court erred by applying a 16-level en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>hancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), which authorizes an enhancement if the defendant was previously deported following a conviction for a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed was greater than 13 months. Avila argues that his prior conviction for delivery of a controlled substance under Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 481.112 was not a drug trafficking offense, because the Texas statute could be violated by <em>administering </em>a controlled substance, an act that is outside the definition of a drug trafficking offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) and the definition of- an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43) and \u00a7 1326(b)(2). After Avila filed his appeal, this court rejected this argument. <em>See United States v. Teran-Salas, </em>767 F.3d 453, 457-62 (5th Cir.2014). In <em>Terartr-Salas, </em>this court held that while there was a theoretical possibility that the defendant could be convicted under Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 481.112 under an administering theory, there was not a realistic possibility that the defendant was convicted under such a theory, making a conviction under Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 481.112 a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). Avila now acknowledges that the decision in <em>Teran-Salas </em>forecloses his argument as to administering (though not as to offering to sell); however, he maintains this argument for purposes of further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">AFFIRMED; REMANDED FOR CORRECTION OF JUDGMENT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b290-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
