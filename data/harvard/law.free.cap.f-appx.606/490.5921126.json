In that motion, he sought to reopen his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 federal habeas proceedings for grounds 5 through 8 of his original petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court previously dismissed Bucklon\u2019s original \u00a7 2254 petition as procedurally barred under Florida law because Bucklon had not briefed them in his appeal from the denial of his state post-conviction petition. However, in <em>Cunningham v. State, </em>131 So.3d 793 (Fla. 2d DCA 2012), Florida\u2019s Second District Court of Appeal clarified that where the state post-conviction court had summarily denied some grounds, but denied others after an evidentiary hearing, the Second District would consider the merits, without briefing, of <em>all </em>grounds that the state post-conviction court had summarily denied. <em>Id. </em>at 794-95. Buck-lon argues that this clarification is an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d justifying Rule 60(b)(6) relief. After careful consideration, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">In October 2004, Bucklon filed his first \u00a7 2254 petition in district court challenging his state court conviction. In grounds 5 through 8 of his amended petition, Buck-lon argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment for a variety of alleged errors. In its 2006 order denying \u00a7 2254 relief, the district court found that grounds 5 through 8 were procedurally barred under Florida law because Buck-lon had \u201cwaived and abandoned\u201d those grounds when he failed to brief them in his appeal from the state post-conviction court\u2019s denial of his Florida Rule, of Criminal Procedure 3.850 motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court explained that because \u201cBucklon\u2019s [state] postconviction appeal was from a rule 3.850 order after an evidentiary hearing,\u201d he \u201cwas obliged to file a brief upon appealing the denial of [state] postconviction relief.\u201d Although the Court at first granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on whether the district court had erred in finding Grounds 5 through 8 to be procedurally defaulted, we then <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed that appeal as untimely filed. In January 2008, the Supreme Court denied <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">In 2012, the Second District Court of Appeal issued its opinion in <em>Cunningham. </em>In that opinion, the court explained that between December 2000 and September 2010, its internal policy in an appeal of the denial of a Rule 3.850 motion required briefing only on grounds that were denied after an evidentiary hearing, not for grounds summarily denied before the evi-dentiary hearing. <em>Cunningham, 131 </em>So.3d at 794-95.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, in an appeal where the state post-conviction court had summarily denied some grounds, but denied others after an evidentiary hearing, the Second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>District would \u2014 absent briefing \u2014 still consider the merits of <em>all </em>grounds that the state post-conviction court had summarily denied. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Following <em>Cunningham, </em>Bucklon filed his present Rule 60(b)(6) motion, which the district court summarily denied. This Court then granted a COA on the following issue: \u201cWhether the Second District\u2019s order in <em>Cunningham v. State ... </em>constitutes \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) justifying reopening Mr. Bucklon\u2019s habeas petition as to Grounds 4 through 8.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">We review the denial of a motion for \u2022 relief from judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) for an abuse of discretion. <em>Howell v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>730 F.3d 1257, 1260 (11th Cir.2013). Rule 60(b)(6) allows for relief from an order for \u201cany ... reason that justifies relief\u2019 filed \u201cwithin a reasonable time.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6), (c)(1). A petitioner who seeks relief under Rule 60(b)(6) must prove \u201c \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 justifying the reopening of a final judgment.\u201d <em>Howell, </em>730 F.3d at 1260 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">-In <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005), the Supreme Court held that a change in its interpretation of the statute of limitations for filing a \u00a7 2254 petition did not constitute an extraordinary circumstance for reopening a prior \u00a7 2254 proceeding under Rule 60(b). <em>Id. </em>at 536, 125 S.Ct. at 2650; <em>see also Arthur v. Thomas, </em>739 F.3d 611, 631 (11th Cir.2014) (\u201c[A] change in decisional law is insufficient to create the \u2018extraordinary circumstance\u2019 necessary to invoke Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d). The Court explained that \u201c[i]t is hardly extraordinary that subsequently, [after the dismissal of the prisoner\u2019s petition based on the statute of limitations], this Court arrived at a different interpretation.\u201d <em>Gonzalez, </em>545 U.S. at 536, 125 S.Ct. at 2650. The Court also emphasized the petitioner\u2019s \u201clack of diligence\u201d, after the initial denial of his \u00a7 2254 petition because \u201cpetitioner neither raised that issue in his application for a COA, nor filed a petition for rehearing of the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s denial of a COA, nor sought certiorari review of that denial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537, 125 S.Ct. at 2651. For the Court, \u201c[t]his lack of diligence confirm[ed] that [the change in interpretation was] not an extraordinary circumstance justifying relief from the judgment in petitioner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">The facts are quite different here for two reasons. First, unlike in <em>Gonzalez, </em>Bucklon is not relying on the Second District\u2019s <em>Cunningham </em>order as a mere \u201cchange in decisional law,\u201d <em>Arthur, </em>739 F.3d at 631, or a \u201cdifferent interpretation,\u201d <em>Gonzalez, </em>545 U.S. at 536, 125 S.Ct. at 2650. Rather, the Second District\u2019s order clarified to federal courts how the Second District <em>had been interpreting </em>its own procedural rules during the time Bucklon filed his state post-conviction appeal, <em>see Cun</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number><em>ningham, </em>131 So.3d at 794-95 \u2014 a procedure that federal courts had misunderstood. In fact, a review of similar \u00a7 2254 proceedings pending or filed after <em>Cunningham </em>reflects that district courts in the Middle District of Florida have since relied on <em>Cunningham\u2019s </em>clarification to hold that unbriefed issues from the relevant time period were <em>not </em>procedurally barred. <em>See, e.g., Rockett v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>No. 8:08-cv-1417-T-23EAJ, 2014 WL 3809146, at *2 (M.D.Fla. Aug. 1, 2014) (\u201cRockett\u2019s failure to brief the summarily denied grounds of ineffective assistance of trial counsel ... caused no procedural default because the state appellate court automatically reviewed each ground under the practice confirmed in <em>Cunningham.\u201d)', Fogle v. Sec\u2019y of Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>No. 8:10-cv-2639-T-27EAJ, 2014 WL 806375, at *5 (M.D.Fla. Feb. 27, 2014) (same); <em>Edmunds v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>No. 8:10-CV-1426-T-27TGW, 2013 WL 4804533, at *18 n. 12 (M.D.Fla. Sept. 9, 2013) (same). In short, <em>Cunningham </em>did not constitute a mere change in law; it demonstrated that federal courts had misunderstood Florida state appellate court procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Our holding mirrors the Sixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion in <em>Thompson v. Bell, </em>580 F.3d 423 (6th Cir.2009). There, Thompson argued that \u201cthe Tennessee Supreme Court\u2019s promulgation of TSCR 39, which clarified that criminal defendants do not need to appeal their post-collateral relief actions to the Tennessee Supreme Court to exhaust their claims, demonstrates that the district court erred when it dismissed four of his ineffective assistance claims as procedurally defaulted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 442. The Sixth Circuit reaffirmed its prior holding that TSCR 39 constituted \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d for purposes of Rule 60(b)(6) because \u201cthe new rule indicated that the district court had failed to recognize a state\u2019s own procedural rule \u2014 thereby undermining the principle of comity on which AEDPA is based.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Distinguishing <em>Gonzalez, </em>the Sixth Circuit noted that \u201c[a] federal court\u2019s respect for another state\u2019s law was not at issue in <em>Gonzalez, </em>in which the Rule 60(b) motion was based solely on a change in federal decisional law interpreting a federal statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 443. Similarly here, to not follow Florida\u2019s clarification of its \u201cown procedural rule\u201d in <em>Cunningham </em>would \u201cundermin[e] the principle of comity on which AEDPA is based.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Second, unlike the petitioner in <em>Gonzalez, </em>Bucklon advanced his claim that the district court improperly found grounds 5 through 8 to be procedurally defaulted in his appeal from the denial of his Section 2254 petition, and a judge of this Court initially granted a COA on that issue. After this Court dismissed Bucklon\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction, Bucklon sought <em>certiorari </em>from the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, Bucklon also filed a Rule 60(b) motion in the district court challenging the finding that his appeal had been untimely. After the district court denied this motion and our Court denied a COA, he unsuccessfully sought reconsideration from this Court and <em>certiorari </em>from the Supreme Court. Unlike the \u201clack of diligence\u201d shown by the <em>Gonzalez </em>petitioner, Bucklon \u201craised th[e] issue in his application for a COA, ... filed a petition for rehearing of the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s denial of a COA, [and] sought certiorari review of that denial.\u201d <em>Gonzalez, </em>545 U.S. at 537, 125 S.Ct. at 2651.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Finally, Rule 60(c)(1) requires that Bucklon file his motion within a \u201creasonable time.\u201d Bucklon waited eighteen months after <em>Cunningham </em>was issued to file this Rule 60(b)(6) motion. This amount of time is reasonable here. Courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>in other jurisdictions have approved of longer amounts of time in allowing Rule 60(b)(6) relief in habeas cases. <em>See, e.g., Thompson, </em>580 F.3d at 443 (allowing Rule 60(b)(6) relief even though Thompson did not file suit until four years after the \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d at issue). And this conclusion is especially justified given Bucklon\u2019s overall diligence in advancing his claim since the start of his federal habeas petition, and the fact that he is currently a prisoner proceeding <em>pro se. </em>It is also understandable that Bucklon would have waited to see how <em>Cunningham </em>would be interpreted and applied by courts in the Middle District of Florida before filing his motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">In short, Bucklon has shown an extraordinary circumstance justifying Rule 60(b)(6) relief: a clarification of state procedure by a state court that informed us that our prior understanding was wrong. We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s denial of Bucklon\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-7\">. In <em>his </em>opening brief here, Bucklon also sought to reopen his habeas petition on ground 4. However, in his reply brief, he concedes that regardless of the outcome of this case, ground 4 will remain procedurally barred due to his failure to raise the claim in his direct criminal appeal. Thus, we do not address that ground here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b520-8\">. A state habeas petitioner who fails to properly raise his federal claims in state court is procedurally barred from pursuing those claims in federal court, absent a showing of cause for and actual prejudice from the default. <em>Bailey v. Nagle, </em>172 F.3d 1299, 1302 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b520-12\">.Bucklon's appeal of the state post-conviction court\u2019s denial of his Rule 3.850 motion was filed within this window.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\">. In <em>Spencer v. United States, </em>773 F.3d 1132 (11th Cir.2014) (en banc), this Court made clear that a COA must \"specify what issue or issues raised by the prisoner satisfy [the] requirement\" that \"an underlying error [be] of constitutional magnitude.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1137. The certificate in this case does not meet that criterion. However, the Court\u2019s grant of a COA, and its denial of the State\u2019s motion challenging it, both predate our <em>Spencer </em>decision. Additionally, as in <em>Spencer, </em>the parties here have already briefed the issue on the merits. Thus, we similarly \"decline to vacate the certificate at this late hour.\u201d <em>Spencer, </em>773 F.3d at 1137. Still, for certificates granted after our <em>Spencer </em>decision, the certificate must specify for what issue the prisoner has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b523-8\">. The government suggests that Bucldon must have filed his Rule 60(b)(6) motion within one year of the <em>Cunningham </em>decision. However, by its plain language, \"to the extent it is applicable, clause (6) appears to offer a means of escape from the one-year limit that applies to motions under clauses (1), (2), and (3).\u201d 11 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <em>Federal Practice and. Procedure </em>\u00a7 2864, at 490 (2d ed.2012). The government has offered no case supporting the proposition that eighteen months is a <em>de facto </em>unreasonable amount of time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
