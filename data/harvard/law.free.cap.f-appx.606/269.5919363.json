The magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation recommended the case be dismissed and the district court adopted the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge and dismissed the case. Avila appealed. Because, after review of the briefs, the record, and the relevant case law, we agree with the district court that Avila fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-27\">Even under the deferential approach due a pro se litigant, Avila\u2019s claims still fail.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a private citizen, Avila does not have standing to bring criminal claims against Hildalgo County. <em>See Linda R.S. v. Richard D., </em>410 U.S. 614, 619, 93 S.Ct. 1146, 35 L.Ed.2d 536 (1973). Moreover, all of his employment-related claims are precluded by the applicable statutes of limitations. Further, Avila has not established facts to show he was terminated or- discriminated against as a result of a \u201cpolicy, custom or practice\u201d of Hildago County, which is required to establish the county\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>liability. <em>Juarez v. Aguilar, </em>666 F.3d 325, 332 (5th Cir.2011). Combined, Avila\u2019s briefs and pleadings below do not contain \u201cenough factual matter\u201d to state a claim for relief that is \u201cplausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 556, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). The district court granted Avila three extensions of time to respond to Hidalgo County\u2019s motions to dismiss and to find counsel. He did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">The district court\u2019s order dismissing the case is AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-21\"> Pursuant to Fifth Cir.
