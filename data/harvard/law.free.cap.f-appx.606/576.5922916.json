Fish, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), of Fish\u2019s civil complaint as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-17\">Fish\u2019s complaint alleges violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), \u00cd5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u25a0 1962, <em>et seq. </em>An action brought under this Act must be brought within one year from the date on which the alleged violation occurred. Fish\u2019s action was filed more than eight years after his claim accrued. We assume <em>arguendo </em>that Fish\u2019s claims could be subject to equitable tolling. The district court\u2019s order dismissing the action adopted and approved the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation which concluded that \u201cit appears beyond doubt from the Complaint itself that Plaintiff cannot prove any set of facts that would avoid a statute of limitations bar.\u201d (Doc. 7 at 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-19\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of a plaintiffs complaint for failure to satisfy the statute of limitations. <em>Jackson v. Astrue, </em>506 F.3d 1349, 1352 (11th Cir.2007). We also review de novo whether a plaintiff is entitled to equitable tolling. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-20\">Where it is clear from the face of a complaint filed in forma pauperis that the claims asserted are barred by the statute of limitations, the claims are properly dismissed pursuant to \u00a7 1915 as frivolous. <em>Hughes v. Lott, </em>350 F.3d 1157, 1160 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-21\">Fish\u2019s complaint fails to show that the statute of limitations did not bar the action. And, Fish failed to meet his burden of showing that equitable tolling was warranted in this case. Equitable tolling is appropriate only when a plaintiff untimely files due to <em>\u201cextraordinary circumstances </em>that are both beyond his control and unavoidable even with diligence.\u201d <em>Arce v. Garcia, </em>434 F.3d 1254, 1261 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotations omitted) (emphasis in original). The circumstances here were neither beyond Fish\u2019s control nor unavoidable with diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-22\">The district court did not err in dismissing this action as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
