Bard, Inc. and Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc. (\u201cBard\u201d). No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-13\">Bard manufactures a medical device-called the Bard G2 inferior vena cava filter (\u201cG2 Filter\u201d) \u2014 that is designed to be placed inside a person\u2019s inferior vena cava (\u201cIVC\u201d) to prevent pulmonary embolisms. The device, which consists of a central shaft with twelve protruding \u201cstruts,\u201d anchors into the walls of the IVC and serves as a mechanical barrier to prevent clots from reaching the heart or.lungs.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-14\">In 2007, Anthony Payne (\u201cPayne\u201d) suffered from recurrent bilateral lower-extremity deep-vein thrombosis, putting him at increased risk of suffering a pulmonary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>embolism. In September 2007, Payne\u2019s doctor implanted a G2 Filter into Payne\u2019s IVC. In January 2008, scans showed that the struts of the G2 Filter had perforated Payne\u2019s IVC. In February 2009, more scans showed that Payne had suffered a pulmonary embolism. Scans also showed that the G2 Filter had fractured and that one of the struts had detached. Doctors have been unable to remove the G2 Filter or the fractured strut. Payne continues to suffer chest pain and shortness of breath.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Plaintiffs filed this civil action against Defendants, asserting four claims: (1) strict liability based on defective design; (2) strict liability based on defective manufacturing; (3) negligence; and (4) loss of consortium. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"AIp-\">\n<em>Daubert</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>1</em>\n</footnotemark>\n<em> Motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">In support of their claims, Plaintiffs sought to introduce the testimony of expert witness Dr. Hetzel. Dr. Hetzel\u2019s testimony was proffered mainly to establish that the G2 Filter implanted in Payne was defective and that Defendants\u2019 warnings and labels were inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">Following a <em>Daubert </em>hearing, the district court concluded that Dr. Hetzel was unqualified to testify competently about matters in the case and that Dr. Hetzel\u2019s methodologies were not sufficiently reliable or helpful. As a result, the district court \u2014 with a reasoned written opinion\u2014 granted Defendants\u2019 motion to exclude Dr. Hetzel\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">We review a district court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1258 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). \u201c[T]he deference that is the hallmark of abuse-of-discretion r\u00e9view requires that we not reverse an evidentiary decision of a district court unless the ruling is manifestly erroneous. Thus, it is by now axiomatic that a district court enjoys \u2018considerable leeway\u2019 in making these determinations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and quotation marks omitted). Even when a ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony may be \u201coutcome determinative,\u201d resulting in summary judgment, \u201cwe do not apply a stricter standard.\u201d <em>McDowell v. Brown, </em>392 F.3d 1283,1294 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-12\">Expert testimony is admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 702 if (1) \u201cthe expert is qualified to testify competently\u201d about the subject of the testimony; (2) the expert\u2019s methodology \u201cis sufficiently reliable as determined by the sort of inquiry mandated in <em>Daubert-, </em>\u201d and (3) the expert\u2019s testimony will \u201cassist[ ] the trier of fact, through the application of scientific, technical, or specialized expertise, to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d <em>Frazier, </em>387 F.3d at 1260. The party offering the expert testimony bears the bur-deh of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, the expert\u2019s qualification, reliability, and helpfulness. <em>Id.; Kilpatrick v. Breg, Inc., </em>613 F.3d 1329, 1335 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-13\">On appeal, Plaintiffs contend that Dr. Hetzel is qualified to testify based on his experience.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiffs point mainly to Dr. Hetzel\u2019s experience analyzing medical devices, including his participation in one project involving an IVC filter. When an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>expert witness relies mainly on experience to show he is qualified to testify, \u201cthe witness must explain how that experience leads to the conclusion reached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for the opinion, and how that experience is reliable applied to the facts.\u201d <em>Frazier, </em>387 F.3d at 1261.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">The district court noted that Dr. Het-zel\u2019s sole experience working with an IVC filter \u201coccurred more than twenty years ago, lasted only three to six months, and was only \u2018conceptual.\u2019\u201d In addition, Dr. Hetzel has never designed, tested, or manufactured an IVC filter and has taught no seminars and published no articles about IVC filters. Because Plaintiffs failed to establish a sufficient nexus between Dr. Hetzel\u2019s \u201climited and dated\u201d experience with IVC filters and the opinions he offered in this case, the district court concluded that Dr. Hetzel was unqualified to testify. The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">The opinions contained in Dr. Hetzel\u2019s Supplemental Report can be broken into four main categories: (1) medical opinions about the in vivo forces inside the IVC and the migration of Payne\u2019s G2 Filter and fractured strut; (2) opinions about the design and testing of the G2 Filter; (3) opinions about metallurgy, including the properties of Nitinol (the metal used to construct the G2 Filter); and (4) opinions about the adequacy of the warning labels on the G2 Filter.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">Plaintiffs failed to satisfy their burden of proof; the district court committed no manifest error in concluding that Dr. Het-zel was unqualified to testify. First, because Dr. Hetzel lacks medical training or experience, he is unqualified to testify as an expert on medical issues. Plaintiffs have also failed to show how Dr. Hetzel\u2019s limited experience working with a \u201cconceptual\u201d IVC filter over 20 years ago led to, or is pertinent to, the opinions he has reached in this case about the design, testing, or labeling of the G2 Filter. Dr. Hetzel also lacks the necessary training and experience to testify as an expert in metallurgy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-11\">Under the deferential standard of review applicable to the district court\u2019s exclusion of expert testimony, we see no reversible error. The district court analyzed carefully and thoroughly Dr. Hetzel\u2019s proffered testimony, qualifications and methodologies. Nothing evidences that the district court committed manifest error in determining that Dr. Hetzel\u2019s expert testimony \u2014 in its entirety<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-12\">\n<em>Motion to Reopen</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b971-13\">After the district court excluded Dr. Hetzel\u2019s testimony, Plaintiffs moved to reopen the deadline for expert disclosures so they could identify a replacement expert witness. The district court granted the motion, but only for the limited pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>pose of allowing Plaintiffs to disclose, as an expert witness, Murray Asch, M.D. (whom Plaintiffs had already identified as a \u201crebuttal\u201d witness).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court explained that \u201cit appears that Dr. Asch\u2014 who is well-known to Defendants \u2014 might be used as an expert in Plaintiffs\u2019, ease-in-chief without undue delay of the proceedings or prejudice to Defendants.\u201d Plaintiffs were given five days from the date of the district court\u2019s order to complete their disclosure and to notify the court about whether Dr. Asch would testify during Plaintiffs\u2019 case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to extend a deadline for an abuse of discretion. <em>Oravec v. Sunny Isles Luxury Ventures, L.C., </em>527 F.3d 1218, 1231 (11th Cir.2008). A party seeking the extension of an already-expired scheduling order deadline must show both good cause <em>and </em>excusable neglect. Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(b)(1), 16(b)(4). To establish \u201cgood cause\u201d a party must show that \u201cthe schedule cannot be met despite the diligence of the party seeking the extension.\u201d <em>Oravec, </em>527 F.3d at 1232. In determining whether a party has shown \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d warranting an extension, a court must consider all pertinent circumstances, including \u201cthe danger of prejudice to the nonmovant, the length of the delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings, the reason for the delay, including whether it was within the reasonable control of the movant, and whether the movant acted in good faith.\u201d <em>Advanced Estimating Sys. v. Riney, </em>77 F.3d 1322, 1325 (11th Cir.1996) (alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">The district court abused no discretion in granting Plaintiffs an extension that was limited both in time and in scope. The district court had already extended several of its scheduling deadlines, including granting the parties a 60-day extension for the disclosure of expert reports. Allowing Plaintiffs to identify and to disclose an entirely new expert so late in the proceedings would have likely resulted in substantial delay to the judicial proceedings and in prejudice to Defendants. And, having an expert witness stricken under <em>Daubert, </em>in and of itself, is insufficient to warrant an extension. <em>Cf Rink v. Cheminova, </em>400 F.3d 1286,1296 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that the district court abused no discretion in denying a continuance to allow for the replacement of an expert witness stricken under <em>Daubert). </em>Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate good cause or excusable neglect justifying an extension greater than the one granted by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">\n<em>Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">Under Florida law, a plaintiff asserting a product liability claim against a product manufacturer must show, among other things, that the product was defective and that the defect proximately caused plaintiffs injuries. <em>See West v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., </em>336 So.2d 80, 86-87 (Fla.1976). \u201c[Ejxpert testimony is often required to establish defective design of a product.\u201d <em>Worsham v. A.H. Robins Co., </em>734 F.2d 676, 685 n. 8 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">After the district court properly excluded Dr. Hetzel\u2019s testimony and granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to reopen, Plaintiffs notified the district court that Dr. Asch would <em>not </em>testify as an expert in their case-in-chief. Thus, Plaintiffs had no expert testimony establishing that the G2 Filter implanted in Payne was defective. Because Plaintiffs failed to present admissible evidence establishing a necessary element of their claims against Defendants, Deten-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>dants were entitled to summary judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b970-9\">. <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm. Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b970-10\">. At the <em>Daubert </em>hearing, Plaintiffs presented no live testimony and relied solely on excerpts from Dr. Hetzel's video deposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b970-14\">.Plaintiffs do not assert on appeal that Dr. Hetzel (who holds a Ph.D. in organic chemistry), is qualified to testify based only upon his educational training.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b971-7\">. For example, the record shows that, during a 2010 deposition in an unrelated case, Dr. Hetzel testified that he lacked sufficient expertise to testify as an expert about medical devices that have a metallurgical failure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b971-8\">. Contrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 assertions, the district court considered expressly Dr. Hetzel\u2019s qualifications to render an opinion about Defendants\u2019 filings with the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\u201d) at the <em>Daubert </em>hearing. The district court acknowledged that Dr. Het-zel had some experience preparing FDA applications, but concluded that he was unqualified-by education or experience-to testify about Defendants\u2019 FDA filings in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-15\">On the record before us, we also reject Plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the district court had an improper \"inherent mistrust for Dr. Hetzel.\u201d And we also reject the contention that such alleged distrust colored improperly the court's determination that Dr. Hetzel was unqualified to testify about the adequacy of Defendants\u2019 warning labels.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b972-6\">. The district court noted that its ruling was consistent with an earlier order by the magistrate judge, granting Plaintiffs additional time to disclose properly Dr. Asch as a rebuttal witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b973-19\">. Plaintiffs argue that the district court abused its discretion by ruling on Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion without first waiting for a final ruling on a discovery issue. Defendants had filed a motion for a protective order, asserting that an internal report prepared by Defendants' litigation consultant (the \"Lehmann Report\u201d) was inadmissible. Meanwhile, Defendants had filed a similar motion for a protective order about the Leh-mann Report in a related case against Defendants that was pending before the Middle District of Florida\u2019s Jacksonville Division (the <em>\"Tillman </em>Case\u201d). In the interest of judicial economy, the district court in this case referred Defendants\u2019 motion to the magistrate judge assigned to the <em>Tillman </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-20\">After the exclusion of Dr. Hetzel\u2019s testimony, Plaintiffs sought, among other things, to postpone consideration of Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment until after a final ruling on the Lehmann Report. The district court did not rule expressly on Plaintiffs\u2019 motion. Instead, the district court said it would reserve ruling on Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment if Plaintiffs timely filed a complete expert disclosure about Dr. Asch.</p>\n<p id=\"A0-\">The district court abused no discretion in granting Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion before a final ruling on the Lehmann Report in the <em>Tillman </em>case. First, Plaintiffs failed to satisfy the district court\u2019s stated precondition for postponing a ruling on summary judgment. Second, the ruling on the Lehmann Report would not have changed the outcome of this case. The Lehmann Report (prepared before the G2 Filter was on the market) discusses a different Bard filter and. says nothing about the G2 Filter. Thus, even if ruled admissible, the Lehmann Report could \"not, by itself, have established the defect element of Plaintiffs\u2019 case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
