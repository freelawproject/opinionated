The district court granted Defendant-Appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the suit with prejudice. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-26\">In 2012, Plaintiffs-Appellants Ruth Johnson and Floyd Hamilton, III, (\u201cFloyd\u201d) filed a wrongful death suit against Dr. Shivani Negi, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and Virginia officials William Harp and Ola Powers. The suit alleged that Dr. Negi fraudulently obtained her medical license from the Commonwealth of Virginia and that Virginia health officials negligently issued a medical license to Dr. Negi. According to Plaintiffs-Appellants, as a result of these events, Dr. Negi was able to obtain employment as a physician at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center (\u201cVAMC\u201d) in Alexandria, Louisiana and commit medical malpractice there, which r\u00e9sulted in the wrongful death of Floyd\u2019s father, Floyd Hamilton, Jr., a former patient at the VAMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-27\">In January 2013, the United States removed the matter on behalf of Dr. Negi to federal district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>\u00a7 1446(a)(1). In May 2013, the United States moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim for relief. In June 2018, the district court adopted the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge and dismissed the claims against the Commonwealth of Virginia, Harp and Powers. Additionally, Dr. Negi was dismissed from the suit and the United States was substituted as the proper party. Plaintiffs-Appellants moved for a new trial alleging that their claims were against Dr. Negi in her personal capacity. The United States subsequently filed a motion to dismiss with respect to the tort claims and a motion for summary judgment with respect to the fraud claim. Again adopting the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge, the district judge denied Plaintiffs-Appellants\u2019 motion for a new trial and granted the United States\u2019 motion for summary judgment and motion to dismiss, thereby dismissing the fraud claim and the other pending tort claims with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">On appeal, Plaintiffs-Appellants contend that the district court erred in granting Defendant-Appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, dismissing their claims. Plaintiffs-Appellants dedicate the majority of their argument on appeal to their allegations of fraud against Dr. Negi.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo.\u201d <em>James v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>743 F.3d 65, 68 (5th Cir.2014). We also conduct a de novo review <em>of </em>a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss. <em>See Stokes v. Gann, </em>498 F.3d 483, 484 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">After considering the parties\u2019 arguments as briefed on appeal, and after reviewing the record, the applicable law, and the district court\u2019s judgment and reasoning adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, conclusions and recommendation, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment and adopt its analysis in full.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b265-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-8\">. This court previously affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of Floyd\u2019s medical malpractice claims against Dr. Negi. <em>See Hamilton v. Negi, </em>595 Fed.Appx. 346, 349 (5th Cir.2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
