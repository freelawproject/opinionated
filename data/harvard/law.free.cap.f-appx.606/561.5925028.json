On appeal, Smith argues that he was improperly sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) because his three prior convictions under section 893.13(1) of the Florida Statutes were not \u201ccontrolled substance offenses\u201d within the meaning of the career offender provision. Smith argues that a prior conviction can only be a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d if it is \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the federal drug trafficking definition. Unlike federal law, his convictions under section 893.13(1) did not have a mens rea element, so they could riot be \u201ccontrolled substance offenses.\u201d He also argues that his prior offenses were related, and thus should not be counted separately, because the conduct in each was essentially the same, and because two of the three were consolidated for purposes of plea and sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-22\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision to classify a defendant as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1243 (11th Cir.2006). Sentencing arguments raised for the first time on appeal are reviewed only for plain error. <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>579 F.3d 1233, 1238 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-23\">A defendant is a career offender if, among other things, lie has at least two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>prior felony convictions for a controlled substance offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). A defendant will have \u201ctwo prior felony convictions\u201d if he was convicted before committing the current offense and if at least two of the sentences are counted separately under the Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.2(c). Prior sentences always are counted separately if imposed for offenses that were separated by an intervening arrest \u2014 that is, the defendant was arrested for the first offense before committing the second. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2). A \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-4\">means an offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-5\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Florida law punishes the sale, manufacture, delivery, or possession with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver, of cocaine as a second-degree felony. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(l). Doing the same with marijuana within 1000 feet of a school is also a second-degree felony. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 893.13(1)(c)(2). Second-degree felonies are punishable by up to 15 years of imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 775.082(3)(d). We have previously determined that a conviction under section 893.13(1) is a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under \u00a7 4B 1.2(b) in <em>United States v. Smith, </em>775 F.3d 1262, 1267-68 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">We have already rejected the mens rea argument that Smith raises for the first time on appeal, so his argument lacks merit even if it had been preserved. <em>See Smith, </em>775 F.3d at 1267. Here, Smith was properly sentenced as a career offender because his prior marijuana and cocaine convictions were offenses under state law, punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year, and concerned the distribution or dispensing, or possession with intent to distribute or dispense, of a controlled substance. <em>See Smith, </em>775 F.3d at 1267-68; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). Smith\u2019s convictions were based on three different arrests committed before the offense on appeal, so the district court properly concluded that Smith had two or more prior felonies, even if the conduct in each was similar. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(c); <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
