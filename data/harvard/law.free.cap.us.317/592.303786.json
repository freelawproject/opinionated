He alleges that that court has not taken any action upon his application. It does not appear that petitioner has exhausted his remedies in the state courts to obtain a determination, which would be a reviewable judgment. The motion for leave to file a petition for writ of habeas corpus is therefore denied without prejudice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
