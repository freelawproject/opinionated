The Motion for Rehearing and Vacation of an Order requests reconsideration of issues which have been raised and reviewed in earlier motions and appeals. Vernell still asks that his conviction be overturned because of the same \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d which was before this court at the time of his first direct appeal and because of the same perjured testimony and alleged wiretap which was before this court on the appeal from the denial of the motion for a new trial. The grounds raised in the instant \u00a7 2255 petition have been previously decided by both the district court and this court in petition for rehearing, motion for new trial, and the direct appeal therefrom. Accordingly, we AFFIRM. <em>See, e.g., Blackwell v. United States, </em>429 F.2d 514 (5 Cir. 1970); <em>Del Genio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>352 F.2d 304 (5 Cir. 1965).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
