Plaintiff alleges that he was totally disabled as a result of injuries received from an assault and battery perpetrated against him by his supervisor at the Union Camp Company. The reason for the dispute related to the manner of performance of a particular task which was part of plaintiff\u2019s duties. Plaintiff had notified the company on two prior occasions of assaults on the part of the supervisor. The district court decided as a matter of law that the distinction between a mere fellow employee and a fellow supervisory employee is immaterial to the right to maintain a common law action. The court granted summary judgment for defendant, holding that the injuries sued for arose in the course of and out of plaintiff\u2019s employment within the meaning of Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 114-102, and that the exclusivity provision, \u00a7 114-103, barred the common law action. A motion for reconsideration and to set aside judgment and to allow supplemental affidavit was denied, January 17, 1977. This appeal followed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-4\">Plaintiff Sands contends that his injuries are the result of an intentional tort by a supervisor and vicarious liability can be imputed to the employer because the injuries are not accidental injuries as contemplated by the Georgia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Plaintiff alleges that where defendant had knowledge of prior altercations and plaintiff\u2019s assailant acted in supervisory capacity as agent of defendant, that there is a question of fact as to whether defendant breached a common law duty to plaintiff. Plaintiff\u2019s theory is that assailant, as a supervisor, was essentially the alter ego of defendant, acting in furtherance of defendant\u2019s business, and defendant was therefore party to the intentional tort and liable under respondeat superior.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-5\">Defendant Union Camp contends that where a servant is injured by a fellow servant or superior employee in a dispute not provoked by the injured servant, arising over the conduct of the master\u2019s business, the injury may be the result of an accident in so far as the injured employee is concerned. Defendant contends that since the injury is the result of an \u201caccident\u201d, plaintiff\u2019s exclusive remedy is under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-9\">Recent decisions applying Georgia law afford guidance both as to the general purpose of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and with regard to the specific sections at issue here. <em>Massey v. Thiokol Chemical Corporation, </em>368 F.Supp. 668, 672 (S.D.Ga. 1973):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1426-10\">\u201cThe purpose of the workmen\u2019s compensation legislation was to do away with common law rules governing actions by employees under the law of master and servant and to replace such antique system with one that provided absolute liability of the employer and fixed compensation for accidental injury or death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2NB\">Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 114-102 defines compensable injury to be \u201cinjury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment\u201d. \u201cAccident\u201d includes every injury except diseases not naturally growing out of injuries arising out of and in the course of employment, injuries caused by wilful act of third person directed against employee for reasons personal to such employee, and wilful misconduct on part of employee. <em>See Reid </em>v. <em>Lummus Cotton-Gin Co., </em>58 Ga.App. 184, 185, 197 S.E. 904, 905 (1938); <em>Southern Wire and Iron, Inc. v. Fowler, </em>217 Ga. 727, 124 S.E.2d 738 (1962).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The fact that the injury is the result of wilful or criminal assault of third person upon employee while employee is engaged in work of his employment does not necessarily prevent injury from being accidental within the meaning of the compensation act. <em>Pinkerton National Detective Agency v. Walker, </em>157 Ga. 548, 122 S.E. 202 (1924); <em>Keen v. New Amsterdam Casualty Co., </em>34 Ga.App. 257, 129 S.E. 174 (1925).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An accident \u201carises out of employment\u201d when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>there is a causal connection between conditions under which work is required to be performed and resulting injury. <em>State Department of Labor v. Yates, </em>131 Ga.App. 71, 72, 205 S.E.2d 36, 37 (1974). The causative danger must be incidental to character of employment and not independent of master and servant relationship. <em>Francis v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>95 Ga.App. 225, 97 S.E.2d 553 (1957); <em>accord, Skelton v. W. T. Grant Company, </em>331 F.2d 593 (5th Cir. 1964). \u201cIn the course of employment\u201d refers to time, place and circumstances under which the accident took place. 131 Ga.App. at 72, 205 S.E.2d at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-5\">Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 114-103 states that where an employee and employer are under provisions of the Act, compensation to the employee \u201cshall exclude all other rights and remedies of such employee ... at common law or otherwise, on account of such injury ... or death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-6\">The Georgia Supreme Court interpreted the above sections of the Georgia Code in <em>Southern Wire &amp; Iron, Inc. v. Fowler</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> supra. </em>There the court held that an employee\u2019s sole remedy as against the employer, for failure of employer\u2019s president, who made no assault on employee, to furnish the employee a safe place in which to work was under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, regardless of the cause for such failure. 217 Ga. at 729, 730, 124 S.E.2d at 739-40. The court pointed out that the general rule in this country is not to allow common law actions against the employer for injuries brought about by a supervisory employee. Practical reasons for not distinguishing between fellow servants and supervisors were there stated. 217 Ga. at 731, 124 S.E.2d at 740. The court continued by citing with approval <em>McLaughlin v. Thompson, Boland &amp; Lee, Inc., supra </em>at n. 2 and <em>Echols v. Chattooga Mercantile Co., </em>74 Ga.App. 18, 38 S.E.2d 675 (1946).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Southern Wire </em>concludes that \u201cregardless of the cause for his [corporate defendant\u2019s president] failure to provide a safe place to work, the result is the same, the employee\u2019s sole remedy against the employer, Southern Wire &amp; Iron, Inc., was under the State Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s reliance on <em>Skelton v. Grant, supra, </em>and <em>Smith v. Rich\u2019s, Inc., </em>104 Ga.App. 883, 123 S.E.2d 316 (1961) in support of his theory of vicarious liability would appear to be misplaced. <em>Skelton </em>and <em>Smith </em>were both false imprisonment claims. The decision in the latter was based on <em>Fowler v. Southern Wire &amp; Iron, Inc., supra, </em>n. 1, the case which was reversed by the Supreme Court of Georgia in <em>Southern Wire </em>on the very issue to be decided <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>Skelton, </em>the Fifth Circuit reversed a Georgia district court decision \u2014 which purportedly relied on <em>Southern Wire </em>\u2014 barring the common law action of an employee against employer on false imprisonment grounds. Our Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1427-11\">\u201cIn the absence of any decision by the highest courts of the state of Georgia, we cannot construe the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts of that state as being designed to deprive an employee of any common law action which he might otherwise have against his employer, unless the action which he seeks to assert is one for an injury as to which relief has actually been granted under the compensation laws.\u201d 331 F.2d at 595.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>This is not in conflict with the interpretations of the Georgia Supreme Court. We simply found that there was nothing inherent in the relation of employer and employee that produced the treatment that is alleged to have been accorded plaintiff Skelton.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court noted that if the employee had been merely a customer in the store she would have been treated no differently than she was treated. Therefore, the Court reasoned, the facts as alleged did not constitute an accident giving rise to compensable injury but was rather an \u201cinjury caused by the wilful act of a third person.\u201d Nothing in the employer-employee relationship caused her injuries, and thus, a common law action was not barred by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The Court specifically did not rule on the extent to which such conduct (by an employee against one not in an employee role) might or might not bind the employer under the principle of respondeat superior.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The requisite causal link necessary to bring the injured party under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, that is, \u201carising out of and in the course of employment\u201d, which was lacking in <em>Skelton, </em>is present in the instant case. Plaintiff Sands does not contest the fact that the assault which resulted in his injuries grew out of and occurred in the course of his employment, though he maintains that this admission is to support the theory of vicarious liability. To maintain that the injuries were suffered in the course of employment for the purpose of vicarious liability but not for purposes of workmen\u2019s compensation legislation would seem to be inconsistent reasoning. Nor is it disputed that both plaintiff and defendant were subject to the Georgia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Plaintiff conceded in his Motion for Reconsideration that \u201cthe subject matter of the assault concerned the manner of performance of a particular task which was part of the Plaintiff\u2019s duties . . . because the assailant did not believe he was performing the duties of his employment in a proper manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-8\">Under the facts of the instant case, the injuries complained of appear to fall within the defined parameters of a compensable injury under the Georgia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act as interpreted by the Georgia Supreme Court. That remedy is exclusive. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1426-6\">. Reversing <em>Fowler v. Southern Wire, </em>104 Ga.

Injury to employee caused by wilful and intentional act of employer\u2019s president, acting as agent of employer, in removing employee from his regular employment and ordering him to work with his hands, without customary protective clothing, in acid vat with which employee was not familiar but which was known to employer and president to be damaging to human tissue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1427-8\">. The relevant portion of <em>McLaughlin </em>stated \u2019 that when an employee has accepted the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, his rights against the employer to recover on account of injuries sustained by reason of the breach of any duty arising out of the relation are determinable solely under provisions of the Act, and are not determinable at common law. <em>Echols </em>was an action for damages based upon an assault on an employee by the manager of the corporate defendant. There it was held that the injuries plaintiff sustained were clearly the result of an accident within the terms of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and being so, his remedy against the employer is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the State Board of Workmen\u2019s Compensation and not in the Superior Court of Chattooga County. <em>See also, Lynch v. General Motors Corp., </em>134 Ga.App. 113, 213 S.E.2d 525 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1428-5\">.

That issue is- the one which plaintiff would like for this Court to reach. However, to reach that issue, it would seem that there must be a prior determination that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is inapplicable . . . because, clearly, if the Act is applicable, it is exclusive as to the employee\u2019s rights against the employer.
