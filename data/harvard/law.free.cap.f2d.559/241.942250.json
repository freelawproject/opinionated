This appeal is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>from the latest efforts of the district court to follow the shifting signposts in this uncharted area. Following our instructions to reconsider attorneys\u2019 fees in light of <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975), and <em>Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974), the district court reaffirmed its prior award of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but denied plaintiffs any attorneys\u2019 fees or costs incurred in appellate proceedings. 70 F.R.D. 341 (N.D.Miss.1976). Both sides appealed. We determined to withhold disposition of the appeal pending a decision by the Supreme Court in <em>Stanton v. Bond,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in which the Seventh Circuit had awarded attorneys\u2019 fees against state officials, in the absence of statutory authorization, based on a finding of bad faith. However, the recent Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Award Act amends 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (R.S. \u00a7 722) to provide the statutory authorization mandated by <em>Alyeska </em>and removes the necessity for conditioning an award of attorneys\u2019 fees in such cases as this on bad faith of defendants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\">In any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, and 1981 of the Revised Statutes, title IX of Public Law 92-318, or in any civil action or proceeding, by or on behalf of the United States of America, to enforce, or charging a violation of, a provision of the United States Internal Revenue Code, or title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">P.L. 94-559, 90 Stat. 2641. Given this statutory authorization and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to vacate and remand <em>Stanton v. Bond,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we need only determine whether the new Act permits awards against state officials in their official capacities despite the proscription of the Eleventh Amendment,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as elucidated in <em>Edelman v. Jordan, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">In <em>Edelman v. Jordan, </em>the Supreme Court overturned a retroactive award of wrongfully withheld welfare benefits holding that \u201ca suit by private parties seeking to impose a liability which must be paid from public funds in the state treasury is barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\u201d 415 U.S. at 663, 94 S.Ct. at 1356. The Court was careful to say that the Eleventh Amendment did not prohibit prospective injunctions even when such relief would require the expenditure of state revenues. \u201cSuch an ancillary effect on the state treasury is a permissible and often an inevitable consequence of the principle announced in <em>Ex parte Young, </em>supra.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 668, 94 S.Ct. at 1358. Lower courts were left to wonder if attorneys\u2019 fees were akin to the monetary restitution prohibited by <em>Edelman </em>or were merely ancillary to injunctive relief. The Third and Sixth Circuits have held that the Eleventh Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>ment prohibits the award of attorneys\u2019 fees against a state.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The First, Second and Fourth Circuits have found them to have only the ancillary effect on the state treasury permissible under Edelman<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> All of these holdings predate the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, </em>427 U.S. 445, 96 S.Ct. 2666, 49 L.Ed.2d 614 (1976), that an amendment to Title VII authorizing a federal court to award monetary damages to a private individual against a state government does not violate the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">[W]e think that the Eleventh Amendment, and the principle of state sovereignty which it embodies, see <em>Hans v. Louisiana, </em>134 U.S. 1, 10 S.Ct. 504, 33 L.Ed. 842 (1890), are necessarily limited by the enforcement provisions of \u00a7 5'of the Fourteenth Amendment. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A234\">We think that Congress may, in determining what is \u201cappropriate legislation\u201d for the purposes of enforcing the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, provide for private suits against states or state officials which are constitutionally impermissible in other contexts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">427 U.S. 445 at 456, 96 S.Ct. at 2671, 49 L.Ed.2d at 621-22. The Court went on to affirm the lower court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees against state officials, finding that they were expressly authorized by Congress in Title VII cases and that \u201cCongress\u2019 exercise of power in this respect is also not barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>427 U.S. at 457, 96 S.Ct. at 2672, 49 L.Ed.2d at 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">The Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976 was enacted pursuant to Congress\u2019 powers under the Fourteenth Amendment, \u00a7 5, and specifically contemplates state officials as intended defendants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-9\">As with cases brought under 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1617, the Emergency School Aid Act of 1972, defendants in these cases are often State or local bodies or State or local officials. In such cases it is intended that the attorneys\u2019 fees, like other items of costs, will be collected either directly from the official, in his official capacity, from funds of his agency or under his control, or from the State or local government (whether or not the agency or government is a named party).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-14\">S.Rep. No. 94-1011, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. (1976), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1976, pp. 5908, 5913. Congress expressly intended the new act to apply to all cases pending at the time of its enactment. <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> H.R. No. 1558 at 4, n.6, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. (1976). <em>See also Bradley v. School Board of City of Richmond, </em>416 U.S. 696, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974). In <em>Rainey v. Jackson State College, </em>551 F.2d 672 (5th Cir. 1977), our court concluded that \u201c[t]he combination of <em>Fitzpatrick </em>and the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976 establishes that the Eleventh Amendment is no longer a bar to the award of attorney\u2019s fees against a state in actions under the statutes enumerated in the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-15\">Nor does <em>Muzquiz </em>v. <em>City of San Antonio, </em>528 F.2d 499 (5th Cir. 1976) (en banc), prevent the award of attorneys\u2019 fees against state officials in their official capacities. In its narrowest reading <em>Muzquiz </em>held that \u00a7 1983 injunctive relief tantamount to a money judgment for restitution does not lie against individual members of a governmental entity in their official capacities when the entity itself is not a person for \u00a7 1983 purposes. <em>Post-Muzquiz </em>decisions of this court have recognized \u00a7 1983 jurisdiction against individual members of a governmental board in their official capacities when injunctive or declaratory relief was sought. <em>Campbell v. Gadsden County District School Board, </em>534 F.2d 650 (5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>1976); <em>McGill v. Parsons, </em>532 F.2d 484, 485-86 n.1 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>Thurston v. Dekle, </em>531 F.2d 1264 (5th Cir. 1976). The question of attorneys\u2019 fees against official defendants after <em>Muzquiz </em>was specifically pretermitted in <em>Abbott v. Thetford, </em>529 F.2d 695, 701 (5th Cir. 1976). In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Bradley </em>and <em>Fitzpatrick </em>and the clear congressional directive to allow attorneys\u2019 fees to be awarded in civil rights cases, we choose not to interpret <em>Muzquiz </em>so expansively as to challenge such formidable authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The award of $41,750 for reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and $10,986.05 for reimbursable expenses, plus interest from the date of judgment, is affirmed. The denial of attorneys\u2019 fees for appellate proceedings is reversed and the case is remanded with instructions to award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees for post-judgment proceedings as authorized by the Civil Rights Attorney\u2019s Fees Awards Act of 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b321-16\">. On September 13, 1972, the district court held that the operation of Parchman Penitentiary violated the constitutional rights of the inmates. 349 F.Supp. 881 (N.D.Miss.1972). The findings on the merits were affirmed at 501 F.2d 1291 (5th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"AJaV\">On February 14, 1973, the district court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees on $41,750 and reimbursed plaintiffs\u2019 expenses of $10,986.05. This award was affirmed at 489 F.2d 298 (5th Cir. 1973). The intervening cases of <em>Edelman v. Jordan, </em>415 U.S. 651, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>662 (1974), and <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975), caused the Fifth Circuit sitting en banc to vacate and remand these judgments for reconsideration of attorneys\u2019 fees in light of these two decisions. 522 F.2d 81 (5th Cir. 1975) (en banc). The district court\u2019s reassessment of attorneys\u2019 fees following <em>Edelman </em>and <em>Alyeska </em>is the subject of this appeal. 70 F.R.D. 341 (N.D.Miss.1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b322-6\">. 371 F.Supp. 1368.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b322-7\">. 426 U.S. 905, 97 S.Ct. 2224, 48 L.Ed.2d 829 (1976), <em>granting cert. </em>in <em>Bond v.
