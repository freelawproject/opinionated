SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b530-33\">After a trial <em>de novo </em>pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145, the District Court affirmed the action of the Patent Office denying appellant\u2019s patent application. Appellant alleges trial court error in failing to perceive that the gist of his invention is the \u201cmathematical apportionment\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of auto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>motive wheel suspension elements shown in his patent application, and not the wheel suspension elements themselves. He insists that his invention defines \u201can intangible relationship, independent of specific structure,\u201d and that the trial court\u2019s finding of obviousness within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> resulted from its failure to recognize this distinction. Appellant readily concedes that the structural elements shown in his patent application to demonstrate the intangible relationship have been in the public domain for many years and are particularly described in the Metz patent which was cited as prior art by the Patent Office in denying his application. His invention, however, according to appellant, \u201clies in a concept; namely, mathematical apportionment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">Initially, it may be seriously questioned whether a \u201cconcept,\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> an \u201cintangible relationship,\u201d <footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>or even a \u201cmathematical apportionment\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is patentable. Certainly naked ideas, independent of the means to carry them out, are not patentable. Atlantic Works v. Brady, 107 U.S. (17 Otto) 192, 2 S.Ct. 225, 27 L.Ed. 438 (1882). And where, as here, the structure used to demonstrate the concept is old in the art, no basis for the issuance of a patent is shown. Compare The Telephone Cases, 126 U.S. 1, 533, 8 S.Ct. 778, 31 L.Ed. 863 (1887). It is true, of course, that a process is patentable under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But appellant does not even suggest that his invention qualifies for a process patent. See Cochrane v. Deener, 94 U.S. (4 Otto) 780, 788, 24 L.Ed. 139 (1876).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-13\">Moreover, appellant\u2019s contention that the District Court misconceived the nature of his invention is not supported by this record. The District Court, like the Patent Office Board of Appeals and the Patent Examiner, held that appellant\u2019s alleged invention was anticipated by Metz. Although Metz does not use the term \u201cmathematical apportionment,\u201d the principle is clearly disclosed in his invention. As the District Court stated: \u201cThe Metz patent describes a suspension arrangement which is predicated upon these very same mathematical relationships [appellant\u2019s equal rates of downward movement of the spring and the linkage].\u201d Lyman v. Ladd, D.D.C., 232 F. Supp. 754, 756 (1964). Continuing, the District Court added: \u201cIn any event, it certainly cannot be said that the mathematical relationship would have been unobvious to a person ordinarily skilled in the art with the Metz patent to guide-him.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-14\">This court has frequently stated that \u201cthe findings of the Patent Office, an expert administrative body, especially when confirmed by the District Court, will not be overturned here unless clearly-infected with error.\u201d Zenith Radio Corporation v. Ladd, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 54, 57, 310 F.2d 859, 862 (1962). The fact, that appellant, testifying in the District Court as his own expert witness,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>unimpressed with the Metz patent and challenged its viability as an anticipatory reference <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> would not in itself require the District Court to reverse the action of the Patent Office. The District Court weighed appellant\u2019s expert testimony against the record compiled in the Patent Office and found his expert testimony wanting. Its assessment of the credibility of that expert testimony is entitled to \u201cdue regard\u201d by this court. Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b530-20\">. Appellant\u2019s brief, at p. 5, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMi\">\u201cThe elements of the above-described assembly are old and appellant takes no position to the contrary (JA 67). Appellant\u2019s invention, and the point of novelty on which appellant predicates patentability, is the invention or discovery of a specific relationship between the frequency of the spring element and the gravity induced rate of downward movement of the mechanical elements of the system such that the wheel and the spring move downward through the same distance in the same time interval without creating unbalanced forces. This appellant calls \u2018mathematical apportionment.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b531-5\">. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7103 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">\u201cA patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set forth in section 102 of this title, if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary shill in the art to which said subject matter pertains. Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b531-7\">. See Westinghouse Elec. &amp; Mfg.
