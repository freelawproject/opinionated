The district court dismissed the petition because this contention had not at any time been submitted to a state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-23\">On this appeal counsel for the state has represented that the state will cooperate in the obtaining of a full and speedy hearing in the state courts on the merits of the petitioner\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-24\">In these circumstances, we think it will best serve all interests here involved to direct that the district court vacate its order dismissing this petition and stay further proceedings in this case until the petitioner shall have had an opportunity to present the question of denial of counsel to an appropriate state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-25\">The judgment will be vacated and the cause remanded for disposition in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
