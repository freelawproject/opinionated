H. Harris Construction Company drove a truck into the front end of a caterpillar tractor, which the plaintiff was operating, which jarred the tractor and caused a large clod of earth to fall upon him from the front-end loader of the tractor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>district court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The trial judge may grant a directed verdict only when there is no evidence which, if believed, would authorize a verdict against the movant. The trial judge must draw against the movant all reasonable inferences most favorable to 1 the party opposing the motion. A corollary to this controlling principle is that the case should be submitted to the jury if the evidence is of such a character \u2022 that reasonable men in an impartial exercise of their judgment may reach different conclusions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Drawing all reasonable inferences most favorable to the plaintiff, the following facts are established. From eleven until four-thirty o\u2019clock on the day he was injured, the plaintiff was in the process of loading trucks with wet earth. The operation required the plaintiff to drive the caterpillar tractor into a pile of wet earth in order to fill a large bucket on the front of the tractor, raise the bucket and swing around and dump the wet earth into trucks which would pull under the upraised bucket. The loading operation occurred on an incline. The position of the caterpillar when the plaintiff dumped the earth into the trucks was down the incline from the trucks. The trucks pulled off the street to be loaded. The routine for loading the trucks, as described by the plaintiff, was that \u201cI would go in [to the pile of earth] to get a load and I\u2019d hit the hoist and shift it and then I am coming out, fighting the brake pedals, coming around and loading it on the truck.\u201d As the plaintiff proceeded towards the street to meet the truck, he gradually lifted this bucket of earth. At the occasion of the accident, the plaintiff had moved over to the place where he met the trucks and stopped at full hoist \u201cand the truck was coming under, and when he was coming under, that is the last thing that I remember.\u201d The plaintiff sustained serious injuries when a large clod of wet earth fell on him from the full, upraised bucket. The force of the blow rendered him unconscious. When he regained consciousness, he saw that the arm of the end loader was \u201csitting down on the truck\u201d and that one of the planks which had been placed around the truck\u2019s bed, to increase the load capacity, had been broken by contact with the arm of the end loader. In answer to the question of whether he thought the truck had hit the front of the caterpillar, the plaintiff answered that \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say for sure or nothing, but I do believe from the depth of my heart, Roy, that the truck did hit the end loader; but I wouldn\u2019t go to oath with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">We agree with the district court that the plaintiff has failed to prove that the truck driver negligently struck the caterpillar. In Louisiana, as elsewhere, the mere occurrence of an accident does not give rise to a presumption of negligence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In an action in tort in Louisiana the plaintiff has the burden to prove negligence as an affirmative fact.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The mere statement of plaintiff\u2019s belief does not support a reasonable inference that the truck struck the tractor. Certainly the plaintiff has not supplied facts which show that the truck driver negligently struck the tractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">The judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-16\">. The plaintiff also alleged that his injuries resulted through the negligent design or manufacture of the caterpillar tractor or its appurtenances. However, the jury returned a verdict for the defendant, Aetna Casualty and Surety Company, and against the plaintiff on this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b406-6\">.

It does not appear that evidence of the driver\u2019s negligence may be supplied by the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur since the accident might have happened as the result of one of two causes: the plaintiff was on an incline and his tractor \u201crared back a little.\u201d See Minton v. Continental Ins. Co., La.Ct.App.1959, 110 So.2d 789, 792, 796.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
