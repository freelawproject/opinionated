C. Memo 1964-185), confirming petitioner\u2019s income tax deficiencies as assessed by the Commissioner for the years 1960 and 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-28\">The Commissioner assessed deficiencies in petitioner\u2019s income tax of $692.22 for 1960 and $655.32 for 1962. The 1960 deficiency arose from the disallowance of two claimed deductions: (1) Expenses incurred in commuting from her job as a substitute teacher in New York City schools and in maintaining a lodging in Philadelphia for weekend residence; (2) a worthless debt of $200 owed to the Princess by Mrs. Corley. The 1962 deficiency arose from the disallowance or reduction of four claims: (1) a reduction of a deduction for charitable contributions from $1,200 to $800; (2) a reduction for taxes paid from $1,700 to $192; (3) the disallowance of $635 in medical expenses; and (4) the reduction of a deduction for education expenses from $500 to $112.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>The Tax Court upheld the Commissioner as to most of these deficiencies but allowed the Princess increased deductions in 1962 for medical expenses, charitable contributions and education expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Under the circumstances, the Tax Court\u2019s conclusions were reasonable and its efforts to approximate petitioner\u2019s 1962 expenses were more than fair.'</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
