SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Appellant was convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon. 22 D.CCode \u00a7 502 (1961). On appeal he alleges trial court error in defining reasonable doubt, in charging the jury that \u201ca serious felony has been committed\u201d when the defense tendered was self-defense, and in allowing excessive comment on hearsay evidence by the prosecutor in his summation. No exception 'Was taken in the court below, however, to the court's charge or to the prosecutor\u2019s summation, and we find no basis for invoking the plain error rule.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-16\">It is noted that the trial court, in fts effort to make the concept of reasonable doubt clear to the jury, defined that concept in three different ways.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At one point the court charged the jury that reasonable doubt was \u201csuch a doubt as in the graver, more important transactions of life would cause an ordinary and prudent person to hesitate and pause.\u201d This instruction is in accord with the law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-17\"> The court then went further and told the jury that \u201c[i]n order to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>the evidence must be such that you would be willing to act upon it in the more important affairs of your own life,\u201d and that \u201cif * * * you have an abiding conviction of the defendant\u2019s guilt, such as you would be willing to act upon in the more weighty and important matters in your own affairs, then you have no reasonable doubt * * These portions of the charge on reasonable doubt are not in accord with the law <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AdA\">Being convinced beyond a reasonable doubt cannot be equated with being \u201cwilling to act * * * in the more weighty and important matters in your own affairs.\u201d A prudent person called upon to act in an important business or family matter would certainly gravely weigh the often neatly balanced considerations and risks tending in both directions. But, in making and acting on a judgment after so doing, such a person would not necessarily be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he had made the right judgment. Human experience, unfortunately, is to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The jury, on the other hand, is prohibited from convicting unless it can say that beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant is guilty as charged. Thus there is a substantial difference between a juror\u2019s verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and a person making a judgment in a matter of personal importance to him. To equate the two in the juror\u2019s mind is to deny the defendant the benefit of a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The Government relies on the old case of Hopt v. Utah, 120 U.S. 430, 7 S.Ct. 614, 30 L.Ed. 708 (1887), to support the \u201cwilling to act upon in the more weighty and important matters in your own affairs\u201d language in the instant charge. The <em>Hopt </em>case, in addition to being almost 80 years old, also relates to a charge given in a state court of Utah. Whatever precedential value it may have had with reference to federal cases is nonexistent since the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Holland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">The other issues presented may be quickly disposed of. The \u2019court, in charging the jury, did say, \u201cThis is a serious case, both from the standpoint of the Government and the standpoint of the defendant: from the standpoint of the Government because a serious felony has been committed * * This language can, of course, be construed the way appellant construes it. And when so construed, it does have the effect of negating appellant\u2019s plea of self-defense. But the language need not be so construed. Since the court gave a full charge on self-defense, obviously what it meant by this language was that from the standpoint of the Government a serious felony had been committed, and that it was up to the jury to determine whether this was so or not. Any ambiguity thought by trial counsel to exist in this portion of the charge could easily have been eliminated on request.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-13\">As to the prosecutor\u2019s repetitive reference to the number of stitches required to close the victim\u2019s wounds, certainly that was overdone, particularly since this evidence was hearsay. But since no objection was made to its admission or to the prosecutor\u2019s reference to it in summation, and in view of the strong evidence of guilt, we find no basis for reversal on this account. Rule 52(b), Fed.R.Crim.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\">\u201c * * * We think this section of the charge should have been in terms of the kind of doubt that would' make a person <em>hesitate to act, </em>see Bishop v. United States, 71 App.D.C. 132, 137-138, 107 F.2d 297, 303, rather than the kind on which he would he <em>willing to act. </em>* * *\u201d 348 U.S. at 140, 75 S.Ct. at 138.

The court\u2019s charge on reasonable doubt follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-10\">\u201cA reasonable doubt is a doubt that is based on reason, it is founded on reason, it is a doubt for which you may assign a reason. It is a doubt that connotes something of substance as compared to something shadowy. It is such a doubt as would leave a juror\u2019s mind, after a careful and candid investigation of all the facts and circumstances, so undecided that he cannot say that he has an abiding conviction of the defendant\u2019s guilt, or such a doubt as in the graver, more important transactions of life would cause an ordinary and prudent person to hesitate and pause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-11\">\u201cWhile the law does not require proof to be made to a mathematical or absolute certainty, it does not permit men to be convicted of crime on mere suspicion, conjecture or possibility of guilt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-12\">\u201cIn order to justify conviction the evidence should be such that when you consider it carefully and apply to it your sound and conscientious judgments as reasonable men and women, you can say that you have no reasonable doubt of the guilt of the defendant. If it would fall short of convincing you to that extent, this defendant should be given the benefit of a reasonable doubt and found not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-14\">\u201cA reasonable doubt may arise not only from the evidence produced at the trial, but also from a lack of evidence, for the law does not impose upon a defendant the duty of producing any evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-19\">\u201cIn order to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the evidence must be such that you would be willing to act upon it in the more important affairs of your own life, for as the Court has told you, you cannot convict a defendant on mere suspicion or conjecture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-20\">\u201cIf after an impartial comparison and consideration of all the evidence you can candidly say to yourselves that you are just not satisfied that this defendant is guilty, then you have a reasonable doubt, and under those circumstances it would be your duty under the law to return a verdict of not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-21\">\u201cOn the other hand, if after such comparison and such consideration of all the evidence you can truthfully say that you have an abiding conviction of the defendant\u2019s guilt, such as you would be willing to act upon in the more weighty and important matters in your own affairs, then you have no reasonable doubt, and under those circumstances it would be your duty under the law to return a verdict of guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b517-22\">.
