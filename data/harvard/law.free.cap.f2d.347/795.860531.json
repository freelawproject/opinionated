Code \u00a7 307 (1961) for funds expended in caring for appellee\u2019s ward, James H. Hatton, following his civil commitment pursuant to 21 D.C.Code \u00a7 314 (1961).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The expenses were incurred between August 5,1947, the time of the commitment, and April 29, 1952, at which time Hat-ton was transferred to the rolls of the Veterans Administration. A committee had been appointed for him on March 5, 1952. In the court below appellee asserted that, since Hatton\u2019s entire estate was derived from veteran benefit payments, the estate was exempt from the District\u2019s claim under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial judge, relying on our decision in Savoid v. District of Columbia, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 39, 288 F.2d 851 (1961), entered judgment for appellant as to the period from March 5, 1952, to April 29, 1952, the period following the appointment of Hatton\u2019s committee. No appeal is taken from this part of the judgment. For the period preceding the appointment of the committee, the trial judge entered judgment for appellee based on our decision in District of Columbia v. Reilly, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 9, 249 F.2d 524 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-14\">We agree that the <em>Reilly </em>case controls to make 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101 applicable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, it does not follow that Hatton\u2019s entire estate is exempt. In Porter v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co., 370 U.S. 159, 162, 82 S.Ct. 1231, 1233, 8 L.Ed.2d 407 (1962), the Supreme Court held veteran benefit payments exempt only so long as they \u201care readily available as needed for support and maintenance, actually retain the qualities of moneys, and have not been converted into permanent investments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b844-15\">Since it appears that Hatton\u2019s estate includes assets which would not be covered by this test, we remand the case to the District Court for a determination of what part of the estate should be subject to the claims of the District.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-16\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-9\">. The District of Columbia Code sections cited were recently revised by the District of Columbia Hospitalization of the Mentally Ill Act, Public Law 88-597, 78 Stat. 944, 21 D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 351-366 (Supp. IV 1965). However, the law relating to this case was not changed in any material respect. See Section. 19(b) of the Act, 78 Stat. 953.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b844-10\">. 72 Stat. 1229, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-12\">\u201c(a) Payments of benefits due or to become due under any law administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration shall not be assignable except to the extent specifically authorized by law, and such payments made to, or on account of, a beneficiary shall be exempt * * * from the claim of creditors, and shall not be liable to attachment, levy, or seizure by or under any legal or equitable process whatever, either before or after receipt by the beneficiary. $ :j: sj! <em>\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b844-19\">. While the reasoning of the later <em>Savoid </em>opinion appears inconsistent with the decision in <em>Reilly, </em>the distinction drawn in <em>Savoid, </em>110 U.S.App.D.C. at 40 n. 1, 288 F.2d at 852 n. 1, is not without support both in law, <em>e.g., </em>In re Bemowski\u2019s Guardianship, 3 Wis.2d 133, 88 N.W. 2d 22 (1958), and in reason. Disallowing the claim for expenses which accrued before the appointment of a committee protects the estate from depletion by claims accruing before it is protected by \u201cthe watchful eye of a guardian.\u201d See In re Bayly\u2019s Estate, 95 Cal.App.2d 174, 212 P.2d 587, 591 (1949).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
