The appellant has, by motion, urged that our judgment dismissing the appeal be recalled and vacated and that we reverse the injunctive order of the district court and direct that the complaint be dismissed. We conclude that the motion should be granted. The approved procedure, when a case has become moot while an appeal is pending, is to vacate or reverse the order or judgment from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>which the appeal was taken, \u201cwith directions * * * to dismiss the bill of complaint * * *, because the controversy involved has become moot and, therefore, no longer a subject appropriate for judicial action.\u201d Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. R. Co. v. Anchor Coal Co., 279 U.S. 812, 49 S.Ct. 262, 73 L.Ed. 971. See also United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36, 71 S.Ct. 104, 95 L.Ed. 36; Duke Power Co. v.

Oil Transport Co., 365 U.S. 768, 81 S.Ct. 911, 6 L.Ed.2d 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">Our reversal of the district court\u2019s injunctive order is not to be regarded as a determination of the propriety of the issuance of the order. The sole ground of our reversal is that the cause has become moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-7\">The judgment of this Court dismissing the appeal is recalled, vacated and set aside. The order of the district court is vacated and the cause is remanded with directions to dismiss the complaint and the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-8\">Prior judgment recalled and vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-9\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
