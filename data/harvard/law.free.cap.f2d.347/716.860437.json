A careful, competent argument is made on behalf of petitioner. This is based on the facts that the corporations operated as a business unit with the same executive officer who owns all of the stock in both corporations. However, the dispositive factor is that Section 1504 of the 1954 Code which defines an \u201caffiliated group\u201d leaves no room whatsoever for judicial construction as urged. The statute reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-25\">\u201cAs used in this chapter, the term \u2018affiliated group' means one or more chains of includible corporations connected through stock ownership with a common parent corporation which is an includible corporation j-j-_. * X</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-27\">Under the facts petitioner and Branch Coal Corporation do not qualify as an \u201caffiliated group\u201d within Section 1504. The decision of the Tax Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
