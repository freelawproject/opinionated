After a jury trial, he was convicted on all counts. He now appeals <em>pro se </em>attacking the sufficiency of the evidence and claiming that his arrest was unlawful, that he received no preliminary hearing, and that the indictment was insufficiently informative as to the crimes charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-26\">The Government\u2019s case rested largely on the testimony of Gilchrist\u2019s accomplice, Dorothy Bertr\u00e1n, with whom he had arranged identification papers and who actually presented the forged check for cashing. Her testimony was sufficient, if believed, to establish Gilchrist\u2019s guilt on all three counts- \u2014 his possession of the stolen check and his aiding and abetting her in its forging and uttering. Most of Gilchrist\u2019s points on appeal are merely arguments directed to possible inconsistencies in the Bertr\u00e1n testimony, some based on extra-record informatio^___ which go to her credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-27\"> The illegal arrest claim has not been made before and is not open now. The same principle applies to appellant\u2019s claim that he was not afforded a preliminary hearing which, in any event, was no longer required once the indictment was returned. Moreover, the alleged illegality would call only for exclusion of evidence seized or \u2014 on some occasions \u2014 \u2022 of oral statements made, of which there were none.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>As for the indictment, it charged in the statutory language with sufficient clarity and reference to the precise letter and check in question. That is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
