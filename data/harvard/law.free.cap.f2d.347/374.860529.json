The appellant had previously pleaded guilty, with advice of counsel, to three counts of a ten count indictment charging the presentation of false claims for refund of income taxes in violation of Section 287, Title 18 U.S.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">In his motion, the appellant alleged (1) that he was convicted as a result of an illegal arrest and therefore detained illegally, (2) that the Government failed to take appellant before the United States Commissioner for a preliminary examination and the setting of bail while he was in state custody, and (3) that he was deprived of his rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the Federal Constitution as a result of being interviewed by agents of the United States Internal Revenue Service while in the custody of state authorities for a separate violation of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">The appeal has no merit. We have repeatedly held that \u201cWhen a defendant voluntarily and knowingly pleads guilty at his trial this constitutes a waiver of all non jurisdictional defenses, * * * The conviction and sentence which follow a plea of guilty are based solely and entirely upon said plea and not upon any evidence which may have been improperly acquired by the prosecuting authorities.\u201d Thomas v. United States, 290 F.2d 696, 697 (9th Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 964, 82 S.Ct. 446, 7 L. Ed.2d 401, Hoffman v. United States, 327 F.2d 489, 490 (9th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-14\">Appellant was not deprived of his constitutional rights, and the order denying his motion is</p>\n<p id=\"b423-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
