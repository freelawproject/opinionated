United States, 10 Cir., 263 F.2d 911: \u201cAn indictment charging an offense under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 174 must allege that the accused knew that the contraband was imported or brought into the United States contrary to law.\u201d Knowledge that the contraband was unlawfully imported or brought into the United States is an essential element of the of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>fense charged, and the specific contention is that the indictment in our case failed to so allege in the words of Robinson. It is true that the indictment did not use the literal words of the Robinson case, but it does charge that the petitioner \u201cdid knowingly and fraudulently and contrary to law import into the United States a quantity of a derivative and preparation of opium * * * in violation of 21. U.S.C. 174.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">There is no magic to the words used in Robinson to allege guilty knowledge. The wording of this indictment clearly and sufficiently charges guilty knowledge as an essential element of the offense. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-16\">. The motion filed and as considered in the trial court also alleged the deprivation of counsel of his own choice. But he has now abandoned this contention and at the bar of the court-appointed counsel stated that he had been specifically directed to confine his appeal to the legal sufficiency of the indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
