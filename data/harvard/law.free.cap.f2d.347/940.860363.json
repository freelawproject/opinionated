United States, 376 U.S. 364, 84 S.Ct. 881, 11 L.Ed.2d 777 (1964) was released the same day the instant case was tried, and hence could not have come to the attention of the District Judge. The Preston case limited searches without warrant incident to a lawful arrest to those which are not \u201cremote in time or place from the arrest.\u201d Preston v. United States, supra at 367, 84 S.Ct. at 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">As to this issue, our review of this record convinces us that the testimony it contains is inadequate to resolve the constitutionality of the search and seizure here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">Judgment vacated and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Williams v. United States, 282 F.2d 940, 941 (C.A. 6, 1960); United States v. Williams, 314 F.2d 795 (C.A. 6, 1963).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
