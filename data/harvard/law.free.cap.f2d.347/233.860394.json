The sole issue was whether the deceased, Fawcett, was an employee of the defendant within the meaning and purpose of the Act at the time of his death. That issue was fully explored by affidavits, oral testimony and exhibits. The district court held that there was no genuine issue of fact. Thinking that no reasonable man could differ with the conclusion that the deceased was not an employee of the defendant at the time he met his death, the district court entered a full opinion, findings of fact and conclusions of law,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-21\">The various relevant factors under law in determining whether the injured or killed person was an employee of the railroad carrier with respect to the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act have been ruled several times by the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After careful consideration, we find ourselves in agreement with the opinion, findings, and conclusions of the district court. The judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"AqS\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-16\">. Reported in 242 F.Supp. 675.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b281-17\">.
