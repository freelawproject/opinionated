The agent also saw one Caser\u00eda, defendant\u2019s accomplice, pick up the bag. A New York City detective testified that, from her vantage point one block west, she saw defendant throw the bag on the ground where Caserta picked it up to bring to her. The bag contained narcotics. Another agent partly corroborated the first agent\u2019s testimony. Therefore, we conclude that defendant\u2019s possession of the paper bag containing narcotics was purposive as a part of the delivery of narcotics to Caser\u00eda. See United States v. Davis, 328 F.2d 864, 866 (2d Cir. 1964); United States v. Gregory, 309 F.2d 536, 537-538 (2d Cir. 1962), cert. denied sub nom. Sumpter v. United States, 373 U.S. 953, 83 S.Ct. 1684, 10 L.Ed.2d 707 (1963); United States v. Barrington, 291 F.2d 481 (2d Cir. 1961); United States v. Santore, 290 F.2d 51, 64-65 (2d Cir. 1959), adhered to on rehearing <em>in banc, </em>290 F.2d 74, 79 (1960), cert. denied as to other defendants, 365 U.S. 834-835, 81 S.Ct. 745, 5 L.Ed.2d 743 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-18\">It was not inconsistent for the trial judge to acquit defendant on the conspiracy count while convicting him on the substantive counts. United States v. Wilson, 342 F.2d 43, 45 (2d Cir. 1965); United States v. Dovico, 329 F.2d 52 (2d Cir. 1964); United States v. Robinson, 320 F.2d 880, 881-882 (2d Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-19\">As to the third contention, that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4705(a) (1958) requires the government to prove that defendant had not received a written Treasury order from Caserta we would apply the rule that \u201cit is not incumbent upon the government either to allege * * * or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>prove * * * that a purchaser of opium [or other narcotic drug] did so without a written order on the form prescribed.\u201d Chin Gum v. United States, 149 F.2d 575, 577 (1st Cir. 1945); accord, United States v.
