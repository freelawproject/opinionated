Patricia Grabowski (decedent) after the one-year statute of limitations on such claims had passed. G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 9. The petitioner filed his claim pursuant to G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 13, arguing that, because he was a minor, the statute of limitations tolled the accrual of his claim against the estate. G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 7. A Probate and Family Court judge granted the administratrix\u2019s motion to dismiss the claim. The petitioner appealed and we granted a joint application for direct appellate review. The petitioner also filed a bill in equity in the county court pursuant to G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 10, claiming that justice and equity required that his claim be allowed to go forward and that he was not chargeable with culpable neglect. The parties submitted a statement of agreed facts to a single justice, who reserved and reported the bill in equity to the full court. Because we conclude that the petitioner\u2019s claim should be allowed to proceed pursuant to G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 10, we remand the matter to the single justice, who is directed to issue an order granting the petition in part and remanding the case to the Probate and Family Court for a determination of the amount owed to the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\"><em>Facts and procedural background. </em>The petitioner was bom in Worcester in 1996, and resided at property owned by the decedent<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from birth at least through August, 2004.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In September, 1998, the premises were inspected and found to be in violation of State law requiring premises with young children to be lead free (G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 197), regulations for lead poisoning prevention and control (105 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 460.00 [2001]), and the State sanitary code. The violations were found to present a material danger to the occupants, constituting an emergency, and the premises were ordered to be deleaded by early December, 1998. Nevertheless, the premises were not de-leaded until October 18, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">On June 30, 2002, the decedent died. Her will left her entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>estate to her deceased husband and made no provision for his predeceasing her.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">When he filed his claim in the Probate Court, the petitioner submitted evidence of his injuries and losses, including two evaluations. In the first evaluation, the petitioner was determined to suffer \u201csignificant delays in language processing, verbal memory, difficulty in attention and output due to lead poisoning sustained in his home, which will require many interventions in the classroom and home, and which will affect him vocationally and economically.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The second evaluation determined the present value of his economic loss due to the lead poisoning and \u201cresulting vocational loss\u201d to be $927,841.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The petitioner\u2019s attorney presented a letter of demand to the decedent\u2019s attorney on December 19, 2002, concerning the petitioner\u2019s damages from lead poisoning. Through counsel, the decedent\u2019s attorney, who would eventually be appointed the estate\u2019s administratrix, responded to the petitioner by a letter dated February 18, 2003.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The letter stated that the decedent\u2019s attorney had petitioned to be appointed administratrix of the estates of the decedent and her late husband. The record shows that the petition for appointment was not actually filed until April 4, 2003. The letter referenced other letters the petitioner\u2019s attorney had sent to the decedent\u2019s attorney. It also stated that once the decedent\u2019s attorney was appointed administratrix, she would be willing to enter into negotiations concerning the petitioner\u2019s claim. The letter requested additional medical information and asked the petitioner\u2019s attorney to contact counsel to discuss the matter. At oral argument, the petitioner\u2019s attorney stated that there was no further communication from the administratrix until September, 2003 (discussed <em>infra), </em>and the record does not indicate otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The decedent\u2019s attorney was appointed administratrix on May 23, 2003, approximately five weeks before the expiration of the one-year statute of limitations on claims against the estate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 9. However, the petitioner\u2019s attorney did not file a claim against the estate before June 30, 2003. Instead, the petitioner\u2019s attorney wrote letters to the administratrix\u2019s attorney in July and September, 2003. The administratrix\u2019s attorney responded by a letter, dated September 15, 2003, stating that the petitioner\u2019s claim was barred by the statute of limitations pursuant to G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 9, and that the estate would make no offer to him. Moreover, the insurance policy for the premises contained a lead poisoning exclusion, thus foreclosing a remedy for the petitioner pursuant to G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 9A.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">On November 21, 2003, the petitioner filed a claim against the decedent\u2019s estate under G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 13,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> arguing that because he was a minor, his claim had not accrued within the one-year statute of limitations. G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 <em>7.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>A Probate Court judge granted the administratrix\u2019s motion to dismiss the claim on the ground that the one-year statute of limitations had passed. He rejected the petitioner\u2019s arguments concerning the tolling of the claim under G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 7. He also stated that, even if the tolling statute did apply, the petitioner\u2019s claim accrued when \u201ca reasonable seven-year old child, in the Plaintiffs position, would have been put on notice that the Defendant\u2019s negligence caused . . . [his] speech and learning disabilities.\u201d The judge found that the petitioner\u2019s claim accrued when the petitioner\u2019s attorney sent a letter to \u201cthe administrator\u201d of the estate of the decedent\u2019s husband, presenting the petitioner\u2019s claim. The petitioner appealed from the judge\u2019s ruling and also filed a bill in equity pursuant to G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>We decide this case pursuant to G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 10. Because \u00a7 10 is the proper remedy for the circumstances of this case, we need not address whether the judge erred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>denying the petitioner\u2019s claim under \u00a7 13 as an alternative remedy.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">General Laws c. 197, \u00a7 9, contains a short statute of limitations to facilitate the prompt settlement of estates. <em>Downey </em>v. <em>Union Trust Co., </em>312 Mass. 405, 408 (1942). However, G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 10, is a remedy available to a creditor who fails to bring a claim against an estate within the time prescribed but who nevertheless shows both that justice and equity require recognition of a meritorious claim and that failure to bring the claim was not due to carelessness or lack of diligence. <em>Id. </em>at 408-409. See <em>Hastoupis </em>v. <em>Gargas, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 27, 32 (1980) (G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 10, not confined to cases of fraud, accident, or mistake); <em>Mullins </em>v. <em>Garthwait, </em>875 F. Supp. 14, 19-20 (D. Mass. 1994). Accordingly, we must determine whether justice and equity require this court to allow the petitioner\u2019s claim to go forward and whether the petitioner is chargeable with culpable neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\"><em>Justice and equity. </em>The decedent\u2019s property, where the petitioner lived from birth,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> was in violation of the statutes and regulations concerning lead-based paint. The violations were not remedied until over one year after an order issued to do so. The applicable statute imposes strict liability for damage caused by the presence of lead-based paint if a young child resides on the premises. <em>Bencosme </em>v. <em>Kokoras, </em>400 Mass. 40, 43-44 (1987) (discussing strict liability imposed by G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 194, 197, 199). As discussed, the parties agree that the petitioner has presented evidence of injury from his exposure to lead poisoning and evidence of the economic and vocational losses. Because the administratrix filed a motion to dismiss,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the record does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>reveal whether the administratrix will offer any defenses to the petitioner\u2019s claim against the estate. This fact, however, does not affect our conclusion that the claim itself is meritorious, leaving aside the statute of limitations issue. See generally <em>Parker </em>v. <em>D\u2019Avolio, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 394, 398-399 (1996) (discussing defense of causation and damages concerning lead poisoning). See also <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Citron, </em>372 Mass. 96, 97-98 (1977), quoting <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957) (allowance of motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim should be upheld only where, taking allegation in complaint as true, plaintiff could prove no facts in support of his claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">In addition, the estate has not shown prejudice. The adminis-tratrix\u2019s only argument, which is addressed below, is that the petitioner had notice of the decedent\u2019s death and that carelessness or lack of diligence was the reason the petitioner did not file a claim against the estate within the one-year statute of limitations. However, the petitioner\u2019s attorney made a demand on the decedent\u2019s attorney by letter dated December 19, 2002, thus putting the estate on notice of the claim at least by that date. See <em>Mullins </em>v. <em>Garthwait, </em>875 F. Supp. 14, 21 n.10 (D. Mass. 1994) (estate not harmed where executor knew claim would be brought). The parties also agree that, in a letter sent in February, 2003, the administratrix\u2019s attorney told the petitioner\u2019s attorney that the administratrix had not yet been appointed, but when she was, she would be willing to undertake negotiations. As discussed, however, the record shows that the administratrix did not file her petition for administration until April, 2003. Furthermore, there is no insurance to cover the petitioner\u2019s injuries. Given these facts, we conclude that the petitioner has a meritorious claim that justice and equity require us to recognize. <em>Downey </em>v. <em>Union Trust Co., supra </em>at 409. We now turn to whether the petitioner is chargeable with culpable neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\"><em>Culpable neglect. </em>The administratrix argues that the carelessness or lack of diligence by the petitioner\u2019s attorney creates culpable neglect on the part of the petitioner. However, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>conclude that, in these circumstances, the petitioner cannot be charged with culpable neglect. In <em>Hastoupis </em>v. <em>Gargas, supra </em>at 29-31, a decedent\u2019s will did not reflect his oral promise to the plaintiff to leave him one-half of the decedent\u2019s estate in return for performing services. The plaintiff, who spoke limited English and had little formal education, sought advice from an experienced and respected member of the bar who failed to file suit against the estate within the statute of limitations. The court held that the plaintiff was not chargeable with culpable neglect. It further held that where the plaintiff\u2019s attorney misunderstood or misinterpreted the salient provisions of G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 9, there was no culpable neglect, and his conduct was not attributable to the client creditor. <em>Id. </em>at 32-34. Agency principles (which might operate to make an attorney\u2019s neglect attributable to the client as principal) do not apply to G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 10. See <em>id. </em>at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The circumstances in this case are even more compelling than in the <em>Hastoupis </em>case. Here, the petitioner is a minor who has suffered lead poisoning, a condition covered by a statute with strict liability. At this time, he is dependent on his mother to take appropriate action on his behalf. There is no insurance available to cover his injuries. In addition, there is no evidence that the petitioner\u2019s mother, who filed the claim on the petitioner\u2019s behalf, did not act in good faith, and the administra-trix has not argued otherwise. The petitioner\u2019s mother is a woman of limited education, having dropped out of school while repeating the ninth grade. She apparently sought the advice of counsel, whom the parties agree has been practicing law in Massachusetts since 1975. The attorney sent the December, 2002, demand letter to the administratrix. Moreover, the estate was thus on notice concerning this claim, misinformed the petitioner\u2019s attorney concerning the status of the administra-trix\u2019s application for appointment, and lulled the petitioner\u2019s counsel into the belief that the administratrix, once appointed, would be willing to settle the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">In the <em>Hastoupis </em>case, the attorney missed the statute of limitations, yet the court did not hold the client chargeable with culpable neglect because \u201cmany a well intentioned lawyer has felt the pricks of the statute\u2019s brambles.\u201d <em>Hastoupis </em>v. <em>Gargas, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number><em>supra </em>at 34 (affirming grant of relief under G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 10, after attorney failed to file suit until after the statute of limitations had expired). See <em>Downey </em>v. <em>Union Trust Co., supra </em>at 408. Here, the petitioner\u2019s attorney sent the demand letter of December, 2002, putting the estate on notice of the petitioner\u2019s claim and eliciting a promise to negotiate after being appointed. Although we express no opinion on the ultimate merits of the theory, it also was understandable for the attorney to assume that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 7, tolled the statute of limitations, thereby allowing the petitioner to file a claim under G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 13. See <em>Hastoupis </em>v. <em>Gargas, supra. </em>See also <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>405 Mass. 439, 442 (1989) (tolling of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 7, applies to special statute of limitations, where Legislature did not intend to adopt a shortened statute of limitations for special statute and the statute itself is silent as to tolling period); <em>Harrigan </em>v. <em>Marvell, </em>325 Mass. 185, 189 (1950) (plaintiff and her attorney acting in good faith in seeking issuance of citation to prosecute action they believed had merit).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">In these circumstances, it would be unjust to charge the petitioner with culpable neglect for the mother\u2019s attorney\u2019s failure to file a claim against the estate within one year. G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\"><em>Damages. </em>General Laws c. 197, \u00a7 10, gives this court the authority to award a judgment in the amount of a creditor\u2019s claim from the assets not yet distributed from the estate at the time the bill in equity was filed. On this record, we do not know what assets, if any, have been distributed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>although the parties stipulated that the petitioner has presented evidence of damages, there is nothing in the record that shows whether the administratrix agrees with the petitioner\u2019s figure or will offer some defense. Therefore, these issues need to be resolved by the Probate and Family Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons stated, we conclude that justice and equity require that the petitioner\u2019s claim go forward. Accordingly, the petition under G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 10, is granted in part, and the case is remanded to the county court where an order will issue remanding the matter to the Probate and Family Court for a determination of the amount owed to the petitioner and further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b732-7\">The decedent owned the property with her husband until his death on December 9, 2001. He left his entire estate to the decedent. Although the petitioner also filed a claim against the husband\u2019s estate, we shall refer only to the claim against the decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b732-8\">The record is not clear whether the petitioner still resides there.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b733-7\">It appears from the record that the petitioner\u2019s blood test results, dated February 24, 1997, through October 11, 2001, were sent to the Department of Public Health\u2019s childhood lead poisoning prevention program.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b733-8\">The decedent\u2019s attorney had been serving as guardian to both the decedent and her husband before their deaths.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b734-7\">General Laws c. 197, \u00a7 13, allows a creditor whose right of action has not accrued within \u201cone year after the date of death of the deceased\u201d to present his claim to the Probate Court any time before the estate is settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">The petitioner\u2019s tort claim qualifies him as a creditor of the estate. See <em>Pelletier </em>v. <em>Chouinard, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 92, 93 n.1 (1989), quoting <em>New England Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>310 Mass. 424, 429-430 (1941).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b734-9\"> General Laws c. 260, \u00a7 7, tolls the accrual of an action by a minor or an individual incapacitated by mental illness until the disability is removed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b735-7\">General Laws c. 197, \u00a7 10, states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-8\">\u201cIf the supreme judicial court, upon a bill in equity filed by a creditor whose claim has not been prosecuted within the time limited by section nine, deems that justice and equity require it and that such creditor is not chargeable with culpable neglect ... it may give him judgment for the amount of his claim against the estate . . . but such judgment shall not affect any payment or distribution made before the filing of such bill and notice.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b735-9\">The mother was pregnant with the petitioner when she moved into the premises.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b735-10\">Although the administratrix stated that the motion to dismiss was based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>on lack of subject matter jurisdiction (Mass.

R. Civ. P. 12 [b] [6], 365 Mass. 754 [1974]) due to the statute of limitations and the inapplicability of G. L. c. 197, \u00a7 13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b738-7\">In his brief, the petitioner claims that the assets have not been distributed and that the parties agreed to freeze them. In his brief and at oral argument, counsel for the administratrix stated that the estate\u2019s only asset is real estate and that, by operation of law, the assets of the estate have been distributed. In one submission to the Probate Court, the petitioner\u2019s attorney stated that, on information and belief, the estate consisted of two parcels of real estate. For the purposes of this opinion, we assume that the assets have not been \u201cdistributed.\u201d The record is scant, showing only that on October 15, 2004, the administratrix filed her first account, indicating that the estate had a balance of $282,802.12, which may include the real estate.
