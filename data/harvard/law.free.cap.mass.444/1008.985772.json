App. Ct. 915 (2003) \u2014 could have been adequately addressed through a petition for a rehearing or an application for further appellate review. Indeed, the petitioner filed both a petition for a rehearing and an application for further review raising, among other things, the same point he made in his G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, petition, and both were denied. The single justice correctly denied the petition in these circumstances. Contrary to the petitioner\u2019s argument, he was not entitled as of right to review of his claim on the merits under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b907-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number><em>Fatal Raheman, </em>pro se.</attorneys>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-12\">Nor was he entitled to relief in the nature of certiorari (which he also sought in his petition).
