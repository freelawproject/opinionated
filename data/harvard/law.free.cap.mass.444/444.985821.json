Damiano was a party, and evidence derived from that conversation, including a bag of marijuana found in a search of Damiano\u2019s pockets at the time of his arrest, a large quantity of cocaine subsequently seized from his house, and statements he made to the police at the police station.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The basis on which the motion was allowed was a determination by the motion judge that Damiano\u2019s telephone conversation was intercepted in violation of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510 et seq. (Title HI).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commonwealth sought interlocutory relief. A single justice granted leave to appeal and designated the appeal to be heard by this court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 28E; Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>R. Crim. R 15 (a) (2), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996). For the following reasons, we affirm the judge\u2019s suppression order in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We recite the facts as found by the judge, supplemented by uncontested testimony from the motion hearing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>430 Mass. 725, 726 n.5 (2000). On the afternoon of January 27, 2001, a private citizen was listening to a store-bought police scanner in her Wareham home when she intercepted a telephone conversation. Although it was possible to change to a different frequency, she decided to listen to the remainder of the conversation, during which two unidentified men agreed to meet at Vel\u2019s Restaurant in Wareham. At one point during the conversation, she heard one of the men, apparently Damiano, say \u201cit all depends on how hungry you are.\u201d The other man, later identified as Peter Morrison, told Damiano that he would be driving a black Mercury Cougar motor vehicle. It was subsequently determined that Morrison had initiated the call using a cordless telephone, and that Damiano had received it on a cellular telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The listener inferred from the conversation that the two men were meeting to complete a drug transaction, and contacted the Wareham police. A police dispatcher conveyed the information to two Wareham police officers who drove their unmarked vehicle to Vel\u2019s Restaurant and parked in a lot across the street. A couple of minutes later, a black Mercury Cougar automobile pulled into the restaurant\u2019s parking lot. The police observed Damiano leave a nearby house, cross the highway, and approach the driver\u2019s side of Morrison\u2019s vehicle. Damiano either handed something to or took something from Morrison and entered the passenger side of the vehicle. Morrison pulled out of the parking lot, headed north on the highway, and made a left turn into the parking lot in which the police officers were parked. Three marked cruisers then proceeded to pull the vehicle over. Damiano was ordered out of the car and searched. A bag of marijuana was found in his pocket and he was placed under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>arrest. An officer at the scene noticed a child watching from the window of the house from which Damiano had come. Consequently, police were sent to secure the premises until a search warrant could be obtained. Damiano\u2019s wife and child were found on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Damiano was taken to the police station and twice advised of his Miranda rights. He was also informed that the police intended to obtain a warrant to search his house. There was no evidence that he was informed of the intercepted telephone conversation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Upset that the police were posted at his house (with his wife and child), and in order to hasten their departure, Damiano eventually told the officers that he kept a small amount of marijuana in a nightstand in his bedroom. He also signed a written consent form, permitting the police to search the house. With the assistance of a police dog, the police discovered a large stash of cocaine hidden behind a locked door off the kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>In 1968, largely in response to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Berger </em>v. <em>New York, </em>388 U.S. 41 (1967), and <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U.S. 347 (1967), Congress enacted Title III. <em>Bartnicki </em>v. <em>Vopper, </em>532 U.S. 514, 522-523 (2001). One of its stated purposes was to \u201cprotect[] the privacy of wire and oral communications.\u201d Pub. L. 90-351, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., reprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2153. To further this purpose, Title HI makes it a crime, except in limited circumstances, to intentionally intercept a \u201cwire,\u201d \u201coral,\u201d or \u201celectronic communication,\u201d or to intentionally disclose the contents of such a communication.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511. Title III also prohibits the admission in evidence of unlawfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>intercepted \u201cwire\u201d or \u201coral\u201d (but not \u201celectronic\u201d) communications, and evidence derived therefrom. Specifically, \u00a7 2515 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-4\">\u201cWhenever any wire or oral communication has been intercepted, no part of the contents of such communication and no evidence derived therefrom may be received in evidence in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court, grand jury, department, officer, agency, regulatory body, legislative committee, or other authority of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision thereof if the disclosure of that information would be in violation of this chapter.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>The Commonwealth contends that the telephone conversation between Morrison and Damiano constituted an \u201celectronic communication,\u201d not a \u201cwire\u201d or \u201coral\u201d communication, and as such, the suppression remedy provided in \u00a7 2515 is inapplicable to this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, it maintains that a \u201csignal broadcast by a portable or cordless telephone is a radio signal and, therefore, an electronic communication.\u201d The Federal cases relied on by the Commonwealth to support this contention, however, involve interceptions that took place before Congress amended Title III in 1994 to ensure that communications taking place on cordless telephones were included within the definition of \u201cwire communication.\u2019\u2019<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Price </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>260 F.3d 1144, 1147 (9th Cir. 2001) (Title III \u201cdid not protect cordless phone conversations that took place before the statutory amendment in 1994,\u201d but \u201cnone of the intercepted conversations\u201d at issue \u201ctook place after 1993\u201d). It is clear that the exclusionary provision of Title III \u201cnow applies to the interception of conversations over both cellular and cordless phones.\u201d <em>Bart-nicki </em>v. <em>Vopper, supra </em>at 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The Commonwealth next urges us to apply a \u201cclean hands\u201d exception to \u00a7 2525, so as to permit the introduction in evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>of any unlawfully intercepted wire or oral communication where, as here, the police are only the recipients and not the interceptors of the communication. There is some disagreement among the Circuit Courts of the United States Court of Appeals as to whether communications unlawfully intercepted by private citizens must be suppressed as evidence when there has been no government involvement. Compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vest, </em>813 F.2d 477, 481 (1st Cir. 1987) (\u201callow[ing] the government\u2019s use of unlawfully intercepted communications where the government was not the procurer \u2018would eviscerate the statutory protection of privacy from intrusion by illegal private interception\u2019 \u201d), with <em>United States </em>v. <em>Murdock, </em>63 F.3d 1391, 1403 (6th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1187 (1996) (\u201cnothing in the legislative history [of Title HI] . . . requires that the government be precluded from using evidence that literally falls into its hands\u201d). However, the majority of courts that have ruled on the \u201cclean hands\u201d exception have rejected it. See <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Funk, </em>146 F.3d 1003, 1012-1013 (D.C. Cir. 1998); <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>United States Army, </em>125 F.3d 1296, 1302 (9th Cir. 1997); <em>In re Grand Jury, </em>111 F.3d 1066, 1077-1079 (3d Cir. 1997). We agree \\yith the judge that government involvement in the unlawful interception of a wire or oral communication is not required to trigger Title Hi\u2019s exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">The plain language of \u00a7 2515 mandates the suppression of any intercepted wire or oral communication and any \u201cevidence derived\u201d from that communication \u201cif the disclosure of that information would be in violation of\u201d Title III. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2515. \u201cSection 2511(l)(c) is also unambiguous, making it a crime whenever one \u2018intentionally discloses, or endeavors to disclose, to any person the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication, knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through the interception of a wire, oral, or electronic communication in violation of this subsection.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Grand Jury, supra </em>at 1077 (rejecting \u201cclean hands\u201d exception to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2515). Nothing in the literal language of the statute indicates that Title HI permits the government, in cases such as this, to disclose the contents of an illegally intercepted wire or oral communication when the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>ment was not the unlawful interceptor of that communication.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Title Hi\u2019s \u201cevidentiary prohibition must be applied to perpetrators and non-perpetrators alike.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1078.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">The legislative history of Title III also supports a literal interpretation of \u00a7 2515. The basic purpose of the statute \u201cis to \u2018protec[t] the privacy of wire . . . and oral communications.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bartnicki </em>v. <em>Vopper, supra </em>at 526, quoting S. Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. 66 (1968). Title in \u201cprevent[s] private, not just governmental, wiretapping.\u201d <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>United States Army, supra </em>at 1302 (rejecting \u201cclean hands\u201d exception to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2515). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vest, supra </em>at 481 (\u201cprotection of privacy from invasion by illegal private interception as well as unauthorized governmental interception plainly \u2018play[s] a central role in the statutory scheme\u2019 \u201d). As one member of Congress stated, in connection with the 1986 amendments to Title III, the statute protects private communications from \u201ca corporate spy, a police officer without probable cause, or just a plain snoop.\u201d 131 Cong. Rec. 24366 (1985) (statement of Sen. Leahy). An unlawful invasion of privacy by a private citizen \u201cis compounded by disclosure in court or elsewhere.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vest, supra. </em>\u201cThe impact of this second invasion is not lessened by the circumstance that the disclosing party (here, the government) is merely the innocent recipient of a communication illegally intercepted . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>As such, we decline to read into \u00a7 2515 a \u201cclean hands\u201d exception that Congress itself did not see fit to write into the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">We are similarly unpersuaded that the \u201cinvestigation or law enforcement\u201d provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2517 authorize the use of the intercepted telephone call in this case. Section 2517(1) and (2) provides that \u201c[a]ny investigative or law enforcement officer who, by any means authorized by this chapter, has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>obtained knowledge of the contents of\u201d intercepted communications may disclose or use those contents when \u201cappropriate to the proper performance of . . . official duties.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Commonwealth contends that the police went to Vel\u2019s Restaurant to corroborate the reported content of the intercepted communication, and that this activity constituted the \u201cperformance\u201d of \u201cofficial duties\u201d because the officers were investigating an alleged violation of Title HI. We need not decide whether, if this were the case, the exception in \u00a7 2517 would apply, because there is no evidence in the record to support this claim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, the judge correctly ruled that the contents of the intercepted communication and \u201cevidence derived therefrom\u201d must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The Commonwealth next argues that the evidence seized from Damiano\u2019s home is not evidence \u201cderived\u201d from the illegal interception because its discovery was sufficiently attenuated from that interception to dissipate the taint of its illegality. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 609 (1975) (Powell, J., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>concurring in part) (\u201cThe notion of the \u2018dissipation of the taint\u2019 attempts to make the point at which the detrimental consequences of illegal police action become so attenuated that the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule no longer justifies its cost\u201d). It makes a similar claim with respect to statements Damiano made at the police station after waiving his Miranda rights. While a close case, on this point we agree.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">In using the language \u201cno evidence derived therefrom\u201d in \u00a7 2515, \u201cCongress expressly adopted a \u2018the fruit of the poisonous tree\u2019 doctrine for wiretap evidence,\u201d <em>Chandler </em>v. <em>United States Army, supra </em>at 1304, and with it the correlative attenuation rule. See S. Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. (1968), reprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2185 (\u00a7 2515 \u201capplies to suppress evidence directly ... or indirectly obtained in violation of the chapter. . . . There is, however, no intention to change the attenuation rule\u201d). Consequently, we look to our constitutional jurisprudence to guide our analysis regarding the application of that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine as articulated in <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 487-488 (1963), has been applied to evidence derived from violations of both the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perrot, </em>407 Mass. 539, 546-548 (1990) (pocketbook from burglary seized as result of statement illegally obtained from defendant suppressed); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pietrass, </em>392 Mass. 892, 900-901 (1984) (clothing seized from defendant after unlawful warrantless entry and search suppressed). In determining whether evidence obtained after such a violation must be suppressed, the issue is not whether \u201cbut for\u201d the prior illegality the evidence would not have been obtained, but \u201cwhether ... the evidence . . . has been come at by exploitation of [that] illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>385 Mass. 244, 258 (1982), quoting <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 488. \u201c[I]nfection will be held to have occurred when the illegality of the police behavior is sufficiently grave and the connection between the il<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>legality and the making of the statements is sufficiently intimate.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvia, </em>380 Mass. 180, 183 (1980), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fielding, </em>371 Mass. 97, 113 (1976). In this sense, the attenuation rule is \u201cnot an exception to the exclusionary rule but a test of its limits.\u201d R.G. Steams, Massachusetts Criminal Law: A District Court Prosecutor\u2019s Guide 120 (23d ed. 2003).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">It is the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to establish that the evidence it has obtained and intends to use is sufficiently attenuated from the underlying illegality so as to be purged from its taint. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fredette, </em>396 Mass. 455, 459 (1985), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cote, </em>386 Mass. 354, 362 (1982). The underlying illegality in this case is the unlawful interception of a wire communication by a private party in violation of Title III, not an unlawful arrest.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The contents of that communication, once conveyed to the police, were used to justify the stop and arrest of Damiano. As the judge found, without the information contained in the interception, there would not have been probable cause to effectuate the arrest. In this sense, the arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>was dependent on the underlying interception, and the marijuana seized from Damiano in its course was equally \u201cintimate\u201d to, and dependent on, that underlying illegality. In these circumstances, it cannot be said that the marijuana was secured \u201cby means sufficiently distinguishable\u201d from the illegal interception to be purged of its primary taint.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The more difficult question is whether the evidence obtained voluntarily from Damiano after he was transported to the station, and after he waived his Miranda rights, was sufficiently attenuated from that primary illegality.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The Supreme Court has said that whether there has been adequate attenuation in the context of an admission secured following an illegal arrest depends on the facts of each case examined in light of four factors: (1) the temporal proximity of the admission to the arrest; (2) the presence of intervening circumstances between the arrest and the admission; (3) the observance of the Miranda mie subsequent to the unlawful arrest; and (4) the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct. <em>Kaupp </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>538 U.S. 626, 633 (2003) (per curiam).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We look to these factors for guidance, albeit in the context of a different form of illegality, and one not involving the police or other government officials. We examine first, and in conjunction with each other, the temporal proximity of the illegal interception to Damiano\u2019s admission (and consent), and the presence of any intervening events. Here, the record is unclear as to precisely how much time elapsed between the illegal interception and the moment when Damiano made admissions and consented to a search of his house, although both occurred on the same day. The record is clear, however, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>admissions and consent occurred not at the time of his arrest, but after Damiano had been transported to the police station and had engaged in a series of discussions with officers there. The record is also clear that Damiano initially denied having any marijuana in his home, but later changed his story and signed a form consenting to its search after he learned that the police had secured the premises with his wife and child present, and intended to obtain a search warrant. Finally, it is clear, as the motion judge found, that Damiano\u2019s admissions were made voluntarily; his consent to the search was voluntary; and his actions were motivated by a desire to hasten the departure of the police from his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Turning next to whether the police properly observed Dami-ano\u2019s Miranda rights, it is clear from the judge\u2019s findings that they did. He was advised twice orally of those rights at the police station, and before making any statements or consenting to a search of his home, he executed a written waiver of them. The significance of the observance of these rights, and their waiver, must be assessed in light of the nature of the primary illegality, here the private citizen\u2019s illegal interception. In the context of an unlawful arrest, both this court and the United States Supreme Court have made it clear that the protection of constitutional rights requires that \u201ca confession \u2018obtained by exploitation of an illegal arrest\u2019 may not be. used against a criminal defendant,\u201d <em>Kaupp </em>v. <em>Texas, supra </em>at 627, quoting <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 603 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, supra </em>at 258, and that compliance with Miranda alone, following such an arrest, is insufficient to purge a subsequently given confession from its taint. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>457 U.S. 687, 690 (1982), quoting <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra </em>(\u201cIf Miranda warnings were viewed as a talisman that cured all Fourth Amendment violations, then the constitutional guarantee against unlawful searches and seizures would be reduced to a mere \u2018form of words\u2019 \u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, supra </em>at 258 (\u201cThe giving of Miranda warnings alone will not make the inculpatory statements sufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint\u201d). These important constitutional considerations, however, are not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">We are not faced with determining whether Damiano\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>voluntary post-Miranda statements and consent were sufficiently divorced from an illegal detention occasioned by a violation of the Constitution. As discussed above, there was nothing unlawful in the arrest of Damiano, and no violation of his constitutional rights. Rather, we must determine whether Damiano\u2019s statements and consent were sufficiently attenuated from the illegal interception of his communications by a private citizen. A similar question was recently considered by the Supreme Court of Maryland in <em>Miles </em>v. <em>State, </em>365 Md. 488 (2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1163 (2002). In that case, a citizen, listening to a police scanner, illegally overheard a conversation that appeared to concern a robbery-murder and the concealment of evidence. He contacted the police, and gave them a recording he had made of the conversation. The police listened to the recording, and identified one of the participants to be the defendant\u2019s wife. Based on this information, they obtained a search warrant, searched the wife\u2019s home, and arrested her. Once arrested, the wife voluntarily consented to a further search of the premises, and voluntarily gave the police other information about where evidence regarding the murder was hidden. The court (applying a State law exclusionary rule identical to Title HI) was faced with deciding what had been \u201cpurged\u201d from the taint of the illegal interception and what had not. It concluded that the tape-recorded conversation and any evidence found during the execution of the search warrant were inadmissible under the statutory exclusionary rule. It also concluded, however, that the wife\u2019s voluntary consent to search and her voluntary statements, even though made while in custody and shortly after her arrest, were intervening events \u201cpurging] the taint of the original illegality of the taped cellular phone conversation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530. Evidence discovered as a result of those voluntary acts was therefore admissible at her husband\u2019s trial. The court\u2019s ruling, while based on its consideration of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d <em>id., </em>rested in large measure on its determination that \u201c[w]hile an individual\u2019s waiver of Miranda warnings taken alone would be insufficient to purge the unlawful conduct under a Fourth Amendment analysis, [the wife\u2019s] conduct . . . [was] \u2018sufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint\u2019 associated with the intercepted phone call.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 526, quoting <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra </em>at 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>We are similarly of the view that observance of Damiano\u2019s Miranda rights, his waiver of those rights after his transportation from the scene of the arrest, and his subsequent statements and consent are circumstances that weigh heavily in favor of a finding that the evidence garnered thereafter was not obtained by exploiting the underlying illegal interception but by way of Damiano\u2019s voluntary acts. As such, the evidence would have been obtained by means sufficiently distinguishable from that illegality to purge it of the primary taint.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Finally, we consider the nature of the police conduct. While we have rejected the \u201cclean hands\u201d exception to \u00a7 2515, the complete lack of police involvement in the underlying illegal interception is not an insignificant fact in assessing the necessary reach of the exclusionary rule and the adequacy of the attenuating circumstances in the context of a criminal investigation and prosecution.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 484 (1976). It was not improper for the police officers to have received or pursued the unsolicited lead provided by a citizen regarding an imminent criminal transaction within their jurisdiction. Even if there had been time (which there was not) for a definitive assessment that the information had been illegally obtained, the duty of the police was to act. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brandwein, </em>435 Mass. 623, 631 (2002) (police not required to ignore information provided to them by private citizen even if done so in violation of confidentiality obligation). While the conduct of the private citizen in intercepting Dami-ano\u2019s telephone conversation may have been patently unlawful, the actions of the police in responding to the information, placing the defendant under surveillance in a public place, and arresting him after they observed what they believed to be a drug transaction were reasonable and undertaken in good faith. \u201cAp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>plication of the exclusionary rule in this situation could not have the slightest deterrent effect on the behavior of [the police]. \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, </em>381 Mass. 465, 470-471 (1980), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ceccolini, </em>435 U.S. 268, 280 (1978) (rejecting application of exclusionary rule to lawfully obtained statement made after defendant was shown unlawfully obtained statement of codefendant). Our consideration of this factor also weighs in the Commonwealth\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">In sum, our examination of the facts in this case, in light of the factors set forth in <em>Kaupp </em>v. <em>Texas, supra, </em>leads us to conclude that the evidence seized in the consented to search of Damiano\u2019s house, and any statements he made at the police station after waiving his Miranda rights, were sufficiently attenuated from the unlawful interception as to be purged from its primary taint.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judge correctly suppressed the contents of the intercepted communication and the evidence seized in the search of Damiano\u2019s person at the time of his arrest. The remainder of the evidence should not have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The order of the motion judge is accordingly affirmed in part and reversed in part. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The Commonwealth also appeals from an order denying its motion for reconsideration of the suppression order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Damiano\u2019s attempt to obtain relief under the Massachusetts wiretap statute, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, was rejected by the judge who, relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santoro, </em>406 Mass. 421, 423 (1990), declined to suppress the telephone conversation because it was intercepted by a private individual, rather than the government. In light of our conclusion with respect to the application of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510 et seq. (Title HI), we do not reach the State law question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Damiano argues that the Commonwealth\u2019s interlocutory appeal should be dismissed without review of the merits because the appeal is procedurally defective. Specifically, he contends that the Commonwealth failed to file a timely notice of appeal and, instead, filed an untimely motion for reconsideration of the suppression order.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Having reviewed the procedural history of this case, we conclude that Damiano\u2019s claim is without merit. The motion judge\u2019s initial order suppressing the evidence was entered on March 6, 2003. On April 14, the Commonwealth filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied on May 19. On May 22, 2003, the Commonwealth filed a notice of appeal under Mass. R. Crim. P. 15, as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996), and Mass. R. A. P. 3, as amended, 430 Mass. 1602 (1999). The Commonwealth filed its application for interlocutory appeal with a single justice of this court on May 27. Damiano contends that the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for reconsideration should have been filed within the time period allowed for the filing of a notice of appeal. Rule 4 (b) of the Massachusetts Rules of Appellate Procedure, as amended, 431 Mass. 1601 (2000), requires that notices of appeal be filed within thirty days. It is within the judge\u2019s discretion, however, to reconsider interlocutory orders during the pendency of a case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haskell, </em>438 Mass. 790, 793 (2003); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Downs, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 467, 469 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>(1991), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Cronk, 396 Mass. 194, 196-197 (1985) (\u201cAs to interlocutory orders which are not dispositive of a case, reconsideration may be sought within a reasonable time during the pendency of the case before the trial court\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The only evidence on this point was the testimony of a Wareham police officer that he did not recall that Damiano was told about the overheard telephone conversation between him and Morrison.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The Commonwealth argues that the interception here was not intentional, and thus not unlawful. In 1986, Congress amended 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511, to change the requisite state of mind from \u201cwillful\u201d to \u201cintentional.\u201d Insight into what Congress meant when it used the term \u201cintentional\" can be found in the amendment\u2019s legislative history:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">\u201cAs used in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the term \u2018intentional\u2019 is narrower than the dictionary definition of \u2018intentional.\u2019 \u2018Intentional\u2019 means more than that one voluntarily engaged in conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>or caused a result. Such conduct or the causing of the result must have been the person\u2019s conscious objective. An \u2018intentional\u2019 state of mind means that one\u2019s state of mind is intentional as to one\u2019s conduct or the result of one\u2019s conduct if such conduct or result is one\u2019s conscious objective. The intentional state of mind is applicable only to conduct and results. Since one has no control over the existence of circumstances, one cannot \u2018intend\u2019 them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Pub. L. 99-508, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3577. We agree with the motion judge that the private citizen\u2019s conduct satisfies the state of mind requirement in \u00a7 2515. At the motion hearing, the citizen testified that she knew how to \u201cscan away\u201d from personal telephone calls intercepted by her police scanner and that she had done so in the past. When she heard the conversation between Morrison and Damiano, however, she did not hit the scan button. Instead, she listened to the remainder of the conversation, which she estimated to be five minutes long. It is therefore apparent that the interception was her \u201cconscious objective\u201d and not \u201cthe product of inadvertence or mistake.\u201d <em>In re Pharmatrak, Inc., </em>329 F.3d 9, 23 (1st Cir. 2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b464-10\">A \u201cwire communication\u201d is defined as \u201cany aural transfer made in whole or in part through the use of facilities for the transmission of communications by the aid of wire, cable, or other like connection between the point of origin and the point of reception (including the use of such connection in a switching station) furnished or operated by any person engaged in providing or operating such facilities for the transmission of interstate or foreign communications or communications affecting interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(1), as amended by Pub.
