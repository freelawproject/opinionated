L. c. 265, \u00a7 22 (a). Following a postverdict inquiry of the jurors,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the trial judge determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>the jury had been exposed to an extraneous matter (the flight of Kincaid\u2019s coventurer), and ordered a new trial. The Commonwealth appealed and the Appeals Court reversed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kincaid, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 657 (2004). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review, and now affirm the trial judge\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the trial evidence only to the extent relevant to the postverdict inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">a. <em>The trial. </em>The Commonwealth\u2019s theory was that the defendant and Richard Lampron, as joint venturers, raped Lam-pron\u2019s former girl friend, whom we call Gail. The defense theory was consent. According to Gail\u2019s trial testimony, on September 23 and 24, 1998, while she was stupefied, the defendant and Lampron engaged in sexual acts with her against her will. In addition, a \u201cbarrette\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was inserted into her vagina. There was testimony that the episode was recorded on videotape.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Two friends of the defendant and Lampron, who had viewed portions of the videotape, stated that they believed that Gail appeared nonresponsive. According to one of them, the videotape depicted Lampron inserting the \u201cbarrette\u201d into her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Following the incident, in the presence of Lampron, the defendant described to other acquaintances what \u201cwe did to [Gail],\u201d including sticking \u201ca hair clip or a barrette\u201d inside her and not being able to get it out; that Gail was \u201cunconscious\u201d; that they took a \u201cmuscle relaxer\u201d from her purse; and that Lampron then cautioned the defendant not to reveal any more.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">During the police investigation of the crime, the defendant gave the police a detailed written description of the incident in which he denied having sexual contact with Gail, and maintained that he had witnessed Lampron engaging in consensual sexual activity with her. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing showed, however, that DNA found on the \u201cbarrette\u201d was consistent with having come from the defendant, Gail, and a second male.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">At trial, the defendant, faced with the DNA evidence, changed his story and claimed that the intercourse was consensual. His <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>contention was supported by Erica Dewey, his girl friend at the time of trial. She testified that she had viewed the videotape, and that it indicated Gail was aware of what was happening, actively participated in the sexual activity with the defendant and Lampron, and did not appear incapacitated or dragged.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The defendant testified, stating that he had hidden the videotape of the incident in the trunk of his car because he believed Lampron would try to take it from him. The defendant also said that, after he told Lampron that he was being investigated and was going to the district attorney\u2019s office, Lampron did take the videotape. The videotape was not produced at trial and its disappearance and contents were the subject of much trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">At the time of trial, September, 2001, Lampron was a fugitive, his whereabouts unknown.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge and counsel took pains to keep this information from the jury and there was no reference to Lampron\u2019s flight or his status as a fugitive. To this end, the judge instructed that \u201cfor various legal reasons it is not uncommon that persons charged as coventurers are tried separately, and you are not to speculate as to why that is the case here. It is irrelevant to your proper deliberations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">b. <em>The postverdict inquiry. </em>In May, 2002, the defendant moved for a postverdict inquiry claiming that the jury had been exposed to a significant extraneous fact: Lampron\u2019s flight. The defendant\u2019s attorney filed an affidavit stating that one deliberating juror, juror A, claimed that the jurors might have some information about Lampron\u2019s flight that they had not learned at trial, and that the information had influenced her decision. The judge conducted hearings in July and August of 2002, during which he inquired of all the jurors to determine whether they had learned anything of Lampron\u2019s absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">The standard of review of findings made in a postverdict inquiry is clear error. \u201cThere is no reason to give a judge\u2019s finding of fact less weight in a postverdict context than we ordinarily would, i.e., we accept his finding unless clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>erroneous.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciminera, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 101, 109, <em>S.C., </em>384 Mass. 807 (1981). \u201c[A] finding of fact by the trial judge will not be deemed \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 unless the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 156, cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1137 (1982), quoting <em>New England Canteen Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>372 Mass. 671, 675 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">We summarize the testimony at the hearing on the motion for a postverdict inquiry. Juror A (who initially had reported her concerns) stated that another juror, in discussing his view of the defendant\u2019s guilt, \u201calluded to the fact that the other person named had taken off,\u201d and that she had not known that. She stated that a third juror said, \u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to know that.\u201d Juror A indicated that this information affected her own view of the defendant\u2019s guilt. She also stated that the juror who initially mentioned Lamprori\u2019s flight spoke with a distinctive accent.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Juror B, the juror with the distinctive accent, testified that there had been \u201cmention\u201d of Lampron\u2019s absence, but denied that he had raised the subject. He could not recall which juror had mentioned the topic first and also believed that there was trial testimony about Lampron\u2019s flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In addition to jurors A and B, five others remembered discussion during deliberations of Lampron\u2019s absence. Juror C stated that the jury were curious about Lampron\u2019s absence, and that she thought a juror with a distinctive accent stated, \u201cI think I\u2019ve heard that he\u2019s no longer around here, he took off; something to that effect,\u201d and that either she or another juror objected to this statement. Juror C also stated that the jurors agreed that it was not information introduced to them and that they should not consider it in their decision-making process. Juror D believed that there was probably discussion about Lam-pron\u2019s flight, but thought that the jurors had learned of it from evidence presented at trial, perhaps from the testimony regarding the missing videotape. Juror E\u2019s recollection was that the jury assumed that Lampron \u201cwas on the run,\u201d but did not remember how the issue came up. Juror F recalled that the jurors had mentioned Lampron\u2019s flight but could not say who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>stated that Lampron had fled and thought there might have been evidence about the subject during trial. Juror G inferred that she must have learned of Lampron\u2019s flight through some comment by another juror, but could not remember specifically how she had come to that conclusion. Five jurors did not recall any mention of Lampron\u2019s having \u201ctaken off,\u201d \u201cbeing on the run,\u201d or any similar explanation for his absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The judge made careful and detailed findings and included bis assessment of the credibility of the jurors\u2019 testimony at the hearing. The judge found that \u201cat one point a juror raised the issue of Lampron\u2019s absence; it may have been by a comment or a question,\u201d that \u201c[ajfter Lampron\u2019s name came up, another juror stated, in substance, that Lampron was on the run, that is, that he had fled.\u201d The judge further found that one juror, \u201cin explaining his thinking[,j alluded to the fact that [Lampron] had taken off.\u201d The judge found it probable that juror B made the statement that Lampron was \u201con the run.\u201d He did so on the basis that the testimony of jurors A and C was credible, and because he did not credit juror B\u2019s denial of making such a statement. He doubted juror B\u2019s credibility in part because juror B \u201cnoticeably hesitated\u201d when asked \u201cthe relevant question.\u201d The judge concluded that the juror\u2019s hesitation stemmed from his \u201crecognition that he said something during deliberations that he should not have.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The judge concluded that \u201cit is more probable that there had been an explicit, fact-like reference to Lampron\u2019s flight rather than the jury having reasoned, opined, or assumed its way to that conclusion.\u201d The judge determined that the defendant had shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the jury were exposed to extraneous matter during their deliberations. He further ruled that the Commonwealth had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not prejudiced by the extraneous matter. Specifically, the judge determined that, aside from the \u201cordinary inference\u201d drawn from a coventurer\u2019s flight, the jury would make the further inference (based on Kincaid\u2019s testimony that Lampron had stolen the videotape) that Lampron had fled with the tape because it showed that the sexual activity was nonconsensual. In reaching his decision, the judge declined to consider juror A\u2019s testimony that learning of Lampron\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>flight affected her view of the case. The judge agreed with the defendant\u2019s contention in his posthearing memorandum that a new trial was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The Commonwealth appealed to the Appeals Court on the ground that (1) the judge\u2019s finding that the jury had been exposed to an extraneous matter was clearly erroneous and that on the evidence the jury permissibly could infer that Lampron had fled; and (2) even if the jury had been exposed to extraneous matter, the Commonwealth had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not prejudiced. The Appeals Court agreed with the Commonwealth on both grounds. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kincaid, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 657, 661-666 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>When there is a claim of extraneous influence on a jury, a two-step procedure is to be followed. First, the defendant \u201cbears the burden of demonstrating that the jury were in fact exposed to the extraneous matter. To meet this burden he may rely on juror testimony.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fidler, </em>377 Mass. 192, 201 (1979). If the defendant meets this burden and the judge finds that extraneous matter came to the attention of the jury, \u201cthe burden then shifts to the Commonwealth to show beyond a reasonable doubt that [the defendant] was not prejudiced by the extraneous matter.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The judge here followed the <em>Fidler </em>procedure and concluded, with respect to the first step, that the defendant had satisfied his burden of proof by showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the jury were exposed to extraneous matter during their deliberations. Although we have not previously stated explicitly the level of proof required for the defendant to meet his burden to show that the jury were exposed to extraneous matter, we today hold that a defendant\u2019s burden is to prove exposure to extraneous matter by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We adopt this standard because once there is a suggestion that the process has been tainted, we should not make it excessively difficult for the defendant to establish the existence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>of the taint. The preponderance standard is sufficient, particularly in light of the fact that it applies only to the first part of a two-step procedure. Other cases have imposed a similar burden on the defendant when there is a suggestion of improper influence on jurors. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>399 Mass. 617, 626 (1987) (defendant bears burden of showing juror is not impartial by preponderance of evidence); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laguer, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 310, 314 (1994) (defendant \u201chad the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that the jury were exposed to ethnic or racial bias\u201d). The judge applied the correct burden of proof to the first stage of the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Applying the standard of review previously discussed, we consider whether the judge properly concluded that the jury were exposed to extraneous matter. While this is a close question, we must defer to the findings of the judge unless those findings are clearly erroneous. The dispute is essentially whether juror B was repeating something that he learned from an extraneous source or was speculating as to the reason for Lam-pron\u2019s absence. While it is possible that the jury could have concluded that Lampron had fled because of evidence adduced at trial, there was also evidence that this matter came from an outside source.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The resolution of this issue is a question of fact for the judge. The finding that juror B gleaned this information from an extraneous source is warranted by the fact that juror C testified that juror B said, \u201cI think I\u2019ve <em>heard\" </em>(emphasis supplied). From this statement, the judge could draw a reasonable inference that \u201cI think I\u2019ve heard\u201d does not mean \u201cI am speculating\u201d or \u201cI am drawing my own conclusion,\u201d but rather, \u201cI think I was told.\u201d The judge credited the testimony of the reporting witness (juror C) as he was entitled to do, and drew a reasonable inference from the reported statement that juror B received the information from a third party and was not merely speculating. That inference, while by no means compelled, was certainly permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">In addition, the judge relied on the recollections of other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>jurors that the juror who made the statement said that Lampron was \u201con the run\u201d or \u201chad fled.\u201d The judge was entitled to conclude, as he did, that these words suggest a statement of fact, rather than an assumption. The judge also gave weight to the fact that juror B \u201cnoticeably hesitated\u201d when asked if such a statement had been made, and concluded it was due to juror B\u2019s having \u201csaid something during deliberations that he should not have.\u201d As the judge is \u201cin the best position to judge the weight and credibility of the evidence,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 156 (1982), quoting <em>New England Canteen Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ashley, </em>372 Mass. 671, 675 (1997), we defer to his conclusions regarding the credibility of the various jurors\u2019 testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lazarovich, </em>410 Mass. 466, 478 (1991) (\u201cIt was for the judge to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses who testified at the hearing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">We note also that all parties made great effort during trial not to mention the reason for Lampron\u2019s absence. The judge instructed the jury not to speculate on the reason that Lampron was not being tried with the defendant, telling them that separate trials of alleged coventurers were \u201cnot uncommon.\u201d Taken together, the judge\u2019s admonition and the parties\u2019 forbearance reduce the likelihood that something occurred within the confines of the trial that would have invited the jury to speculate on the possibility that Lampron had fled or caused them to reach such a conclusion. By comparison, the defendant demonstrated that there had been considerable publicity concerning the case, including specific reporting in the media of Lampron\u2019s status as a fugitive. Based on the record of the postverdict inquiry, we cannot say that the judge clearly erred in concluding that the source of the information was probably extraneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">We do not find persuasive the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that the lack of direct evidence of the source of juror B\u2019s knowledge impairs a conclusion that extraneous matter was introduced to the jury. Our cases have not required identification of the source of a juror\u2019s knowledge of the extraneous matter. It is only necessary that there be adequate evidence that the knowledge did not come from the evidence at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>392 Mass. 28, 39-40 (1984) (after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>verdict reached juror stated he knew defendant had criminal record); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fidler, </em>377 Mass. 192, 199-200 (1979) (finding extraneous influence where juror stated someone shot at defendant previous month). See also <em>Jeffries </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>114 F.3d 1484, 1488 (9th Cir. 1997) (juror informed other jurors that defendant was convicted armed robber).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">The case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schoen, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 731, 733-734 (1987), relied on by the Commonwealth, is not to the contrary. In that case, the jury, while still deliberating, asked a question that suggested that they knew or had guessed that a person involved in the crime had pleaded guilty to a lesser included offense. <em>Id. </em>at 731-732. The judge forcefully instructed the jury not to speculate on what had happened to the other person, probed the jurors for extraneous influences, and found that there were none. <em>Id. </em>at 732-733. The Appeals Court concluded in that case that the judge had not erred in denying the defendants\u2019 motion for a mistrial. <em>Id. </em>at 734. In the instant case, on the basis of permissible findings, the judge reached the opposite conclusion. Each time, the appellate court defers to the judge\u2019s role in assessing juror credibility. <em>Id. </em>at 733-734.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">We next consider whether the judge erred in the second step of the process, i.e., in determining that the Commonwealth had not met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Kincaid was not prejudiced by the extraneous matter. In this assessment, the judge must focus on the probable effect of the extraneous fact on a \u201chypothetical average jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fidler, supra </em>at 201. \u201cThe judge may consider such matters as: (1) the fact that the improper remark prompted an immediate reprimand from another juror ... (2) whether there was overwhelming evidence of guilt. . . and (3) whether the extraneous matter produced such a high probability of prejudice that error must be inferred\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 201 n.8. The judge concluded that the first two factors weighed in favor of the Commonwealth. Juror B\u2019s remark met with a prompt reprimand from juror C, and the Commonwealth \u201cpresented a strong, compelling case.\u201d The judge decided, however, that the extraneous matter created a high probability of prejudice. He believed that the jury likely would reason \u201cthat Lampron fled because he was guilty, he was guilty because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>intercourse was non-consensual, and the videotape must therefore reflect that fact.\u201d Thus, knowledge of Lampron\u2019s flight would corroborate the Commonwealth\u2019s testimony concerning the videotape and undermine that of the defendant and his girl friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The judge\u2019s conclusion, that Lampron\u2019s flight in these circumstances created a high probability of prejudice, is not clearly erroneous. As the judge recognized, the flight of a co-venturer suggests his guilt, and suggests further that his partner is guilty as well. The likely assumption by the jury, that Lam-pron perceived that he and Kincaid were guilty, would create prejudice against Kincaid. Added to that is the significance of the missing videotape. That Lampron fled with the videotape (as suggested by Kincaid\u2019s testimony that he believed Lampron had taken the videotape) indicated that the tape showed that the sexual activity was nonconsensual. This eviscerates Kincaid\u2019s defense of consent and it does so based on totally extraneous information.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">While not an inescapable conclusion that a hypothetical average jury would follow this logic, such a finding was warranted. The judge could conclude that the introduction of the extraneous matter would destroy the defense\u2019s credibility. Because the judge permissibly found that there was an extraneous influence, and determined that the Commonwealth had not satisfied its burden to show that Kincaid was not prejudiced by the extraneous matter, a new trial must be granted. Having made the two foundational findings, the judge retains no discretion to deny a new trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cuffie, </em>414 Mass. 632, 638 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The Commonwealth attempts to draw support for its position that the defendant was not prejudiced from cases in which we have stated that evidence of a codefendant\u2019s flight does not require severance of joint trials under the rule established in <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123 (1968). These cases do not hold that a jury\u2019s knowledge of a codefendant\u2019s flight is not prejudicial. Rather, the cases stand for the proposition that separate trials for each defendant are not mandated where the degree of prejudice is not so severe and there are strong, timely limiting instructions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pontes, </em>402 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>311, 314-315 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>358 Mass. 314, 321 (1970); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Steven, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 978, 979 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 673, 676-677 (1977). The amount of prejudice created by a jury\u2019s knowledge of a codefendant\u2019s flight is attenuated enough that, when combined with proper limiting instructions, separate trials may not be constitutionally <em>required. </em>However, the amount of prejudice from knowledge of a codefendant\u2019s flight is sufficient to justify a judge\u2019s finding of prejudice, at least where, as here, the judge has determined that the peculiar circumstances of the case (including the absence of any curative instruction about flight) would lead a hypothetical average jury to draw an inference more damaging to the defendant than evidence of flight alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">We mention one other matter. A judge may not inquire into the deliberative process of the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fidler, supra </em>at 198 (\u201cOur decision does not permit evidence concerning the subjective mental processes of jurors, such as the reasons for their decisions\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Royster, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 970 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scanlan, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 173, 184 (1980) (\u201cwe would embark on a slippery slope indeed if we began to monitor and evaluate the internal procedures of the jury\u201d). We recognize the difficulty of conducting the <em>Fidler </em>inquiry without touching on forbidden ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">Here, the judge attempted to confine his questioning to learning what was said in order to ascertain whether there was an extraneous influence during the jury\u2019s deliberations. It may happen, as it did here, that a juror responds to a permissible question with an answer that inappropriately reveals aspects of the deliberations. Giving cautionary instructions to each juror at the outset of the inquiry and, if necessary, again during the inquiry will reduce the likelihood of answers that stray into revelation of the jury\u2019s thought process. The jurors can be instructed to respond about any information that was not mentioned during the trial (appropriate), but not to describe how the jurors used that information or the effect of that information on the thinking of any one or more jurors (inappropriate). Once any juror has established that extraneous information was mentioned, by whom, and whether anyone said anything else about the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>traneous information (not what they thought about it or did with it), the inquiry of that juror is complete. As soon as the judge determines that the defendant has satisfied his burden of establishing the existence of an extraneous influence, the questioning of all jurors should cease.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Nevertheless, some inappropriate information may be learned from the postverdict inquiry, as occurred here. If so, that information cannot be ignored. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cuffie, supra </em>at 638 (\u201cThe judge, having ventured into the forbidden area of the deliberative process . . . cannot ignore the fruits of his excursion\u201d). If, as happened here, a judge learns that a juror has, in fact, been influenced by extraneous information, there must be a new trial. See <em>id.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The Commonwealth does not dispute that the judge in this case applied the correct legal standards, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fidler, supra </em>at 201. The Commonwealth points us to no Massachusetts case, and we have not located one, where an appellate court has reversed a trial judge\u2019s finding of extraneous influence with resulting prejudice to the defendant after the judge applied the proper standards. While the facts of this case are close, it is in just such difficult cases that deference to the trial judge in assessing the credibility of the evidence before him is most appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The Superior Court\u2019s order that the defendant be granted a new trial is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-13\">The defendant was acquitted of drugging another with the intent of having unlawful sexual intercourse.
