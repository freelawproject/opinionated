Through its elected and appointed officials, the city of Fall River (city or Fall River) has attempted to prevent Mendoza from doing so, repeatedly denying his application for an adult entertainment license and passing various restrictive ordinances. The dispute eventually resulted in litigation. After a series of judgments in the Superior Court, both parties appealed. The city appeals from judgments that its public indecency ordinance (indecency ordinance),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which purports to ban all public nudity, violates art. 16 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 77 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution (\u201cThe right of free speech shall not be abridged\u201d), and that Mendoza is entitled to a portion of his attorney\u2019s fees and costs as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (2000). Mendoza appeals from a judgment that, given the scope of Oliver\u2019s current zoning variance, he must obtain a new variance in order to offer nude dancing there.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">Consistent with our prior decisions interpreting art. 16, we conclude that the city\u2019s indecency ordinance violates the guarantee of free expression contained therein, and affirm the judgment declaring the ordinance unconstitutional. We also affirm the judgment that nude dancing is not a permissible use under the property\u2019s current variance. Finally, we affirm the award to Mendoza of his attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">1. <em>Background. </em>This case arises from protracted licensing proceedings and litigation between Mendoza and the city that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>we detail below. Since 1983, Oliver\u2019s has operated as a restaurant and bar at its present location, adjacent to an airport in the Fall River Industrial Park.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Oliver\u2019s has held a live entertainment license since 1985 and has hosted various types of entertainment and music for its patrons, including rock and roll concerts for up to 400 people. In 1996, the airport closed, and the owner of the Oliver\u2019s parcel, Cathleen Viveiros, received a zoning variance from the zoning board of appeals of Fall River (board of appeals) to continue operating the establishment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We reserve discussion of the circumstances surrounding the granting of this variance for the section of the opinion that addresses its scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In 1997, Mendoza, the operator of Oliver\u2019s who leased the property from Viveiros, filed an application with the licensing board of Fall River (licensing board) for an adult entertainment license to present nude dancing. After a public hearing, the licensing board denied the application as premature, finding that adult entertainment was not within the scope of the property\u2019s 1996 zoning variance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Within two months of the denial, the city enacted an amendment to its zoning ordinance to provide for an adult entertainment special permit procedure and an adult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>entertainment overlay district, confining such uses to an area located outside the Fall River Industrial Park. Subsequently, Mendoza filed a lawsuit against the city and the licensing board challenging the denial of his license application, the validity of the licensing board\u2019s process for issuing adult entertainment licenses, and the validity of the zoning ordinance amendment and overlay district.</p>\n<p id=\"AV7\">In 1999, Mendoza filed a second application with the licensing board, seeking to expand the scope of Oliver\u2019s existing entertainment license to include nude dancing. After a public hearing, the licensing board denied the application on its merits, finding that Mendoza had failed to establish that the license he sought would not adversely affect the public\u2019s health, safety, or order as required by G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 183A.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In response, Mendoza filed a second lawsuit against the city and the licensing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>board in the form of a petition for certiorari, challenging the denial of the license, the 1997 zoning ordinance and overlay district, and the procedure for obtaining an adult entertainment license. On June 28, 2000, a judge in the Superior Court entered partial summary judgment for Mendoza, holding that the licensing board had improperly shifted the burden of proof under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 183A, to him, and that a license must issue unless the licensing board meets its burden of justifying the denial by enumerating the factors it considered and providing a reasoned basis for the result. The judge then remanded the case to the licensing board for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">On remand, the licensing board again denied Mendoza\u2019s application. Several days before the licensing board issued its written denial, the city enacted a public indecency ordinance, which, inter alia, banned public nudity in Fall River. The city also enacted a related amendment to its zoning ordinance, making changes to the adult entertainment overlay district, deleting nude dancing as a permissible use in such a district, and revising the adult entertainment special permit process. The new district again did not include any part of the Fall River Industrial Park.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">In December, 2000, Mendoza amended the complaint in his second lawsuit to challenge the latest denial of his application by the licensing board and to assert State and Federal constitutional challenges to the city\u2019s new ordinances related to public indecency and adult entertainment. On January 2, 2001, the judge ruled on further motions for summary judgment filed by the parties, concluding that the licensing board failed to meet its burden under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 183A, to justify its denial of the license. In particular, the judge rejected the licensing board\u2019s reliance on studies of the secondary effects of adult entertainment in loca-tians outside of Massachusetts, finding that those studies \u201cdo not provide enough information with which to rationally reach a conclusion regarding the specific business involved in the instant case.\u201d He further found that Mendoza was in compliance with G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 183A, and entered an order requiring the licensing board to issue the adult entertainment license, retroactively effective to September 1, 1999, the date of the first denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Mendoza\u2019s 1999 application.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As ordered by the judge, the licensing board issued an adult entertainment license to Oliver\u2019s on January 10, 2001, but conditioned it on the establishment\u2019s adherence to the public indecency ordinance banning all public nudity.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">To avoid the enforcement of the indecency ordinance, Mendoza obtained a preliminary injunction against the city from a second judge, premised on Mendoza\u2019s likely success on the merits of his constitutional challenge to it. On April 2, 2001, Oliver\u2019s began presenting nude dancing. The city sought review before a single justice of the Appeals Court, who vacated the preliminary injunction on April 30, 2001. After a month of performances, nude dancing at Oliver\u2019s ended.</p>\n<p id=\"AXj\">Mendoza\u2019s first and second lawsuits were thereafter consolidated, and Mendoza filed four motions for partial summary judgment separately challenging the constitutionality of the indecency ordinance, the overlay district ordinance, the special permit ordinance, and the licensing board\u2019s and the city\u2019s ac-tians in 1997. The city and licensing board filed a cross motion for summary judgment on all claims. A third judge granted Mendoza\u2019s motions in part, issuing a declaratory judgment that the indecency ordinance, while not violative of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, was unconstitutional under art. 16. The city appealed from this judgment. The judge\u2019s rulings on Mendoza\u2019s other motions were not appealed from by either party.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ARvG\">On September 11, 2002, a bench trial on Mendoza\u2019s remaining claims was held in the Superior Court before a fourth judge, who found that Oliver\u2019s original 1996 zoning variance did not permit adult entertainment and that Mendoza would have to obtain an additional zoning variance to present nude dancing at Oliver\u2019s. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Mendoza appealed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The judge also issued declaratory judgments invalidating the adult entertainment overlay district and special permit process on State and Federal constitutional grounds. The city has not appealed from these judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">In his decision, the judge invited requests for the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. After considering the parties\u2019 submissions, the judge determined that Mendoza was the \u201cprevailing party\u201d in the litigation and thus entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs related to his successful Federal constitutional claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, but not entitled to those fees and costs related to his State constitutional claims. The city and licensing board appeal from the legal conclusion underlying the award that Mendoza was the \u201cprevailing party.\u201d We transferred the parties\u2019 appeals from the Appeals Court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">2. <em>Constitutionality of the public indecency ordinance under art. 16. </em>Enacted in November, 2000, during a flurry of legislative activity directed at restricting adult entertainment in the city, the indecency ordinance makes it a \u201csummary offense\u201d knowingly or intentionally to \u201cappearf] in a state of nudity\u201d in a \u201cpublic place.\u201d The indecency ordinance defines \u201c[njudity\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">\u201c[T]he showing of the human male or female genitals, pubic hair or buttocks with less than a fully opaque covering; the showing of the female breast with less than a fully opaque covering of any part of the nipple; the exposure of any device, costume, or covering which gives the appear-anee of or simulates the genitals, pubic hair, natal cleft, perineum anal region or pubic hair region; or the exposure of any device worn as a cover over the nipples and/or are-ala of the female breast, which device simulates and gives the realistic appearance of nipples and/or areola.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-16\">It applies in any \u201cpublic place,\u201d including \u201cplaces of entertainment, taverns, restaurants, clubs, theaters, dance halls, banquet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>halls, party rooms or halls limited to specific members, restricted to adults or to patrons invited to attend.\u201d It does not apply to children under ten years of age or to women breastfeeding infants under two years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"AOP\">The indecency ordinance includes a statement of legislative purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE1\">\u201cIt is the purpose and intent of this section to address and mitigate the deleterious secondary effects of public nudity, since such secondary effects have been found as a result of numerous studies, and after other public input, to include increased crime, adverse impacts on public health, adverse impacts on the business climate of the city, adverse impacts on the property values of residential and commercial properties, and adverse impacts on the quality of life in the city, all of which secondary impacts are adverse to the health, safety, and general welfare of the city and its inhabitants. The provisions of this section are written in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>City of Erie, et al. </em>V. <em>Pap\u2019s A.M. tdba \u2018Kandyland,\u2019 </em>[529 U.S. 277] (2000). The provisions of this section have neither the purpose nor the intent of imposing a limitation or restriction on anyone\u2019s constitutional rights, but merely seek to address the deleterious secondary effects that stem from the conduct described here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxC\">As drafted, it is virtually identical to the ordinance upheld by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Erie </em>v. <em>Pap\u2019s A.M., </em>529 U.S. 277 (2000) <em>(Erie). </em>In that case, which generated no majority opinion, the Court concluded that the Erie, Pennsylvania, ordinance did not violate an adult entertainment business owner\u2019s right of free expression under the First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution because it was a valid content-neutral regulation of conduct justified by the city\u2019s legitimate interest in preventing the harm-fui secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments. <em>Id. </em>at 296-302 (opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"AFZ\">In rejecting Mendoza\u2019s Federal constitutional challenge to the ordinance here, the judge concluded that <em>Erie </em>foreclosed any facial challenge to the ordinance under the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Constitution.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> He then proceeded to analyze the ordinance under art. 16 and ruled that art. 16 is more protective of nude dancing than the First Amendment. Declaring the ordinance unconstitutional, the judge found that (1) the ordinance was a content-based restriction on speech that was not precisely drawn to serve a compelling State interest; (2) even if the ordinance were content neutral, it would nevertheless be unconstitutional because it was not narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest and failed to provide ample alternative channels of communication; and (3) the ordinance was unconstitutionally overbroad in that it punished expressive conduct with no connection to the alleged secondary effects of public nudity. In its appeal from this judgment, the city challenges each of the judge\u2019s three grounds for invalidating the ordinance, urging us to adopt the controlling First Amendment analysis of the ordinance under <em>Erie </em>for the purposes of art. 16. The city\u2019s appeal thus requires us to decide whether the ordinance is constitutional under art. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">As a threshold matter, it is beyond debate that nude dancing enjoys constitutional protection as a form of expression. <em>Cabaret Enters., Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>393 Mass. 13, 15-17 (1984) <em>(Cabaret Enters.). Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sees, </em>374 Mass. 532, 537-538 (1978). See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>South Bend, </em>904 F.2d 1081, 1089-1104 (7th Cir. 1990) (Posner, J., concurring), rev\u2019d sub nom. <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Glen Theatre, Inc., </em>501 U.S. 560 (1991) (describing why nude and erotic dancing qualify as \u201cexpression\u201d with references to historical and cultural sources). Although the Supreme Court has said that nude dancing is \u201cexpressive conduct within the outer perimeters of the First Amendment, though . . . only marginally so,\u201d <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Glen Theatre, Inc., supra </em>at 566 (opinion of Rehnquist, C.J.), this court has rejected such qualification under art. 16. <em>Cabaret Enters., supra </em>at 16-17, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sees, supra </em>at 537-538 (\u201cFor the purpose of assessing the amount of protection to which nude dancing is constitutionally entitled, we declined in <em>Sees </em>to distinguish between barroom-type nude dancing and performances of greater artistic or socially redeeming significance\u201d). The ordinance bans all public nudity, includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>ing constitutionally protected nude dancing, the entertainment Mendoza seeks to present at Oliver\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"AulO\">a. <em>Level of scrutiny. </em>We turn first to the level of scrutiny to be applied. Relying on the reasoning of the plurality opinion in <em>Erie, supra </em>at 289-296, the city urges us to find that the ordinance is content neutral and subject to the more permissive \u201cintermediate\u201d standard of review for the regulation of expressive conduct set forth in <em>United States </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>391 U.S. 367, 376-377 (1968). See <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Rock Against Racism, </em>491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989); <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Community for Creative Non-Violence, </em>468 U.S. 288, 293 (1984); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>430 Mass. 1205, 1209 (2000); <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Back Bay Cultural Ass\u2019n, </em>418 Mass. 175, 179 (1994). Mendoza, on the other hand, defends the judge\u2019s finding that the ordinance is content based because its language and the timing of its enactment unquestionably confirm that its purpose was to restrain nude dancing at Oliver\u2019s, and therefore a \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d standard should be applied. See <em>Erie, supra </em>at 328-332 (Stevens, J., dissenting); <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Glen Theatre, Inc., supra </em>at 592-594 (White, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"AO2\">We need not, however, decide whether the ordinance is content based or content neutral because whether we apply a strict scrutiny or an intermediate scrutiny standard of review, the ordinance fails the test of art. 16. See <em>T &amp; D Video, Inc. </em>v. <em>Revere, </em>423 Mass. 577, 581 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"A51\">b. <em>Intermediate scrutiny of the ordinance under art. 16. </em>For a content-neutral restriction of expressive conduct to pass constitutional muster, it must (1) \u201cfurther[] an important or substantial governmental interest . . . unrelated to the suppression of free expression,\u201d and (2) it must do so by means \u201cno greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, supra </em>at 377.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This form of scrutiny is the same as is applied to content-neutral \u201ctime, place, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>manner\u201d regulations. See <em>T &amp; D Video, Inc. </em>v. <em>Revere, supra; Boston </em>v. <em>Back Bay Cultural Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 182; <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Rock Against Racism, supra. </em>In other words, the regulation must be \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d to advance the government interest \u201cwithout at the same time banning or significantly restricting a substantial quantity of speech that does not create the . . . evils [the city seeks to eliminate].\u201d <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Back Bay Cultural Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 182, quoting <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Rock Against Racism, supra </em>at 799 n.7. A regulation will not satisfy this requirement if it \u201cunreasonably limitfs] alternative avenues of communication.\u201d <em>T &amp; D Video, Inc. </em>v. <em>Revere, supra </em>at 581, quoting <em>Renton </em>v. <em>Playtime Theatres, Inc., </em>475 U.S. 41, 47 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-15\">In prior cases in which we have had occasion to review ordinances restricting nudity in establishments licensed for the sale of alcohol, it was not necessary for us to apply the \u201cnar-rawly tailored\u201d prong of intermediate scrutiny. See <em>Cabaret Enters., supra </em>at 17; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sees, supra </em>at 537. The records in both cases \u201cfailed to demonstrate [any] justification for the imposition of a restraint on the exercise of a right guaranteed by art. 16.\u201d <em>Cabaret Enters., supra. </em>See <em>T &amp; D Video, Inc. </em>v. <em>Revere, supra </em>at 581 (\u201cRevere made no attempt to justify its . . . [ordinances by reference to the secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses .... The legislative record is barren\u201d). Here, on the other hand, the city has at least advanced and attempted to document a governmental interest in banning public nudity.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-29\">Notwithstanding any other motivations, the city\u2019s stated inten-tians \u2014 of curbing crime, including prostitution and rape, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>preserving property values, and minimizing dangers to public health \u2014 are without doubt substantial government interests. The ordinance in this case, however, completely prohibits a constitutionally protected form of expressive conduct within the city limits. It not only \u201cunreasonably limits alternative avenues of communication,\u201d it eliminates all avenues for Mendoza or any other citizen of the city to present nude dancing in the city. See <em>A.F.M., Ltd. </em>v. <em>Medford, </em>428 Mass. 1020, 1021 (1999) (upholding adult bookstore\u2019s preliminary injunction against adult entertainment zoning ordinance because \u201ccity was obligated, as a practical matter, to ensure that its regulatory scheme did not unreasonably foreclose avenues for communica-tian of the material the plaintiff intended to sell\u201d). As such the ordinance is tantamount to censorship of such protected expression. No matter what the formulation of the test, such a complete ban is not \u201cnarrowly tailored,\u201d and is unconstitutional on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"AifM\">In so ruling, we reject the city\u2019s argument that erotic dancers, clad in the oft-cited sartorial combination of \u201cpasties and G-strings,\u201d may nevertheless express an equivalent \u201cmessage\u201d without dropping \u201cthe last stitch.\u201d <em>Erie, supra </em>at 294 (opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.). The \u201cnudity of the dancer is an integral part of the emotions and thoughts that a nude dancing performance evokes. . . . The sight of a fully clothed, or even a partially clothed, dancer generally will have a far different impact on a spectator than that of a nude dancer, even if the same dance is performed. The nudity is itself an expressive component of the dance . . . .\u201d <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Glen Theatre, Inc., supra </em>at 592 (White, J., dissenting). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sees, supra, </em>we recognized the constitutionally protected expressive nature of nude dancing under art. 16 and reaffirmed it in <em>Cabaret Enters. </em>Nothing in <em>Erie </em>persuades us to change our view.</p>\n<p id=\"Acro\">c. <em>Overbreadth under art. 16. </em>The overbreadth of the ordinance drives an alternative fatal stake into its heart. While our preceding scrutiny of the ordinance under art. 16 analyzed its application to Mendoza\u2019s attempts to offer nude dancing in an establishment licensed for adult entertainment, our over-breadth analysis tests the constitutionality of the ordinance by examining its \u201cpotential application\u201d to the expression of others. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>368 Mass. 580, 585 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>A \u201cclear and precise enactment may ... be \u2018overbroad\u2019 if in its reach it prohibits constitutionally protected conduct.\u201d <em>Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Operation Rescue, </em>406 Mass. 701, 715 (1990), quoting <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 114 (1972). \u201c[W]here conduct and not merely speech is involved ... the overbreadth of a statute must not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oakes, </em>401 Mass. 602, 605 (1988), vacated and remanded, 491 U.S. 576 (1989), quoting <em>Broadrick </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 615 (1973).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The ordinance\u2019s sweep unapologetically includes \u201cwork[s] of unquestionable artistic and socially redeeming significance,\u201d like the rock musical \u201cHair,\u201d the play \u201cEquus,\u201d and Richard Strauss\u2019s opera \u201cSalome\u201d and Oscar Wilde\u2019s play of the same name.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sees, supra </em>at 537. See <em>Erie, supra </em>at 326 (Stevens, J., dissenting); <em>Doran </em>v. <em>Salem Inn, Inc., </em>422 U.S. 922, 933 (1975); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>South Bend, </em>904 F.2d 1081, 1089-1104 (7th Cir. 1990) (Posner, J., concurring).

Despite the wide range of nonexpressive nudity prohibited by the ordinance (including nude sunbathing, indecent exposure, obscenity, and the imposition of nudity on an unwilling or unsuspecting person, see <em>Cabaret Enters., supra </em>at 17), its blanket restrictions would provide \u201creal and substantial deterrent\u201d to the exercise of the right of free expression by the citizens of Fall River, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohmer, </em>374 Mass. 368, 374 (1978), even through varieties of expressive nudity that in no way give rise to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>\u201csecondary effects\u201d it seeks to curtail. In enacting a ban of nudity even more extensive than the barroom antinudity ordinances invalidated by this court in <em>Sees </em>and <em>Cabaret Enters., </em>the city has traveled in the constitutionally unacceptable direction of banning even more protected expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">d. <em>Art. 16 and the First Amendment. </em>In holding that the ordinance violates art. 16, we recognize that our analysis departs from the Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of similar ordinances under the First Amendment. <em>Erie, supra. Barnes </em>v. <em>Glen Theatre, Inc., </em>501 U.S. 560 (1991). Neither party disputes, however, that art. 16 may provide greater protection for nude dancing than the First Amendment. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sees, supra </em>at 537-538. Cf. <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>415 Mass. 258, 268-269 (1993) (\u201cindependent protections of freedom of speech which are found in . . . art. 16 would lead us to reach the same result even if there existed no Federal constitutional support for the principles which we applied\u201d). We adhere to the principle that this court will exercise its independent judgment to uphold the cherished protections of the Declaration of Rights as a matter of State constitutional law. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>429 Mass. 658, 668 (1999); <em>Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>424 Mass. 586, 590 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 373 (1985); <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Allied Stores Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>388 Mass. 83, 87-89 (1983); <em>Moe </em>v. <em>Secretary of Admin. &amp; Fin., </em>382 Mass. 629, 651 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Although the analysis under art. 16 is generally the same as under the First Amendment, see <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>430 Mass. 1205, 1209 n.3 (2000), and cases cited, we leave open the possibility that, as here, art. 16 will call for a different result. In our weighing the ordinance in this case and the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in upholding a similar ordinance, we conclude that the Federal rule does not adequately protect the rights of the citizens of Massachusetts under art. 16. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mavredakis, </em>430 Mass. 848, 858 (2000). Not surprisingly, other State Supreme Courts have come to the same conclusion. See <em>Pap\u2019s A.M. </em>v. <em>Erie, </em>571 Pa. 375, 394 (2002) (on remand from United States Supreme Court, Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held Erie ordinance invalid on State constitutional grounds).

L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10. The petition for the variance requested the right to \u201coperate a restaurant, lounge, bar, function facility, theatre, hall, or other place of amusement, entertainment or assembly in an industrial park district.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The petition explained the hardship that would be faced if a variance was not granted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7Q\">\u201cBuilding Permit for requested use was initially granted for premises as an accessory and incidental use to an airport in 1981. With close of airport, owner wishes to insure |&gt;zc] that existing facility is properly zoned for continued operation and for the purposes of insuring [sz'c] marketability and possible refinancing. Existing premises were designed and built for requested use and have no other economic use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">The petition also stated that the proposed use would not be detrimental to the neighborhood because the \u201c[pjremises have been used for requested purposes since 1981 without objection\u201d and would not \u201cderogate from the intent and purpose of the zoning ordinance\u201d because the \u201c[fjacility has provided ameni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>ties to adjoining airport and industrial park since 1981 as an accessory use.\u201d Additionally, it stated that \u201c[tjhere are no residential or commercial facilities in the vicinity that would be affected or have been affected by the actual and proposed use.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">At the public hearing on the variance, counsel for Viveiros represented that she was seeking a variance to satisfy the request of a financing institution to establish that the existing use remained legal after the airport closure. According to the transcript of the proceedings, counsel said, \u201cThere is no contemplated additions or changes to the structure. It\u2019s just to continue the existing use to satisfy the powers that be as far as use of the land is concerned. That\u2019s the purpose of this petition.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> After no objection was made, the board of appeals unanimously approved the petition without discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The variance decision, recorded at the registry of deeds, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">\u201cIn the matter of the petition of Cathleen Viveiros for permission to operate a restaurant, lounge, bar, function facility, theater, hall or other place of amusement, entertainment or assembly waiving use and dimensional requirements in an Industrial Park District [IP].

In a vote of 5-0 the Board unanimously granted the petitioners request. . . . <em>The Board found that the existing business has been operating at this site for over twelve years and the petitioner would like to continue the same. The Board determined that since there will be no changes to the existing building or use of the building it would be an avoidable hardship to deny this petition. </em>The proposed use serves many of the businesses in the Industrial Park and is not a detriment to the area, nor does the use derogate from the intent and purpose of the zoning ordinance.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Noting Viveiros\u2019s representations to the board of appeals that the use of the property would not change,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the trial judge held that the variance did not authorize Mendoza to offer nude dancing at Oliver\u2019s. Specifically, the judge rejected Mendoza\u2019s argument that his intention to offer adult entertainment constituted a protected intended use of the property within the scope of the zoning variance when Mendoza first applied for an adult entertainment license in 1997. The judge found that notwithstanding zoning ordinance amendments enacted after the effective date of Mendoza\u2019s adult entertainment license, Mendoza\u2019s 1996 variance never permitted the presentation of nude dancing at Oliver\u2019s. Mendoza appeals from this aspect of the trial judge\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Mendoza argues that, on the effective date of his adult entertainment license, nude dancing was an allowed use as of right in three of the city\u2019s business districts. And, given that the language in Oliver\u2019s variance was broader than the language describing the allowed uses in the city\u2019s business districts, that variance, which contains no express condition, should be read to allow nude dancing as well. Mendoza also faults the trial judge for placing special emphasis on the representations of Viveiros and her counsel in proceedings before the board of appeals, arguing that the inquiry should look solely to the face of the decision (as recorded at the registry of deeds) and that such representations cannot bind property owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">In defense of the judge\u2019s ruling, the city and licensing board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>argue that the scope of the variance should be strictly construed to exclude nude dancing, given the board\u2019s express finding that the use of the property would not change. The variance itself and the transcript of the proceedings reveal that the board of appeals never evaluated whether a variance for a new adult entertainment use should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">First, we fail to discern the legal basis for relying on the representations of the owner of the property and her counsel in the variance petition and at the public hearing in 1996. Purchasers of property or their attorneys are not expected or required to look behind the face of recorded variance decisions to ascertain their effective scope, unless those decisions expressly incorporate other plans or records by reference. See <em>DiGiovanni </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Rockport, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 339, 346-347 (1985) (requiring strict adherence to original plans referenced in variance); Healy, Procedure for Obtaining Variances and Special Permits, 1 Massachusetts Zoning Manual \u00a7 10.14.5(f), at 10-48 (Mass. Continuing Legal Educ. 1999 &amp; Supp. 2002) (\u201cConditions that do not appear on the face of a recorded decision should not ... be held to bind a mortgagee or purchaser who acquires an interest in the affected property without notice or knowledge of the error\u201d). This principle is consistent with the Zoning Enabling Act\u2019s command that permit granting authorities must make specific and detailed findings that analyze the statutory requirements when granting variances. G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10. See <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Amherst, </em>383 Mass. 1, 10 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">On the other hand, the face of the variance in this case admits considerable ambiguity. In favor of Mendoza\u2019s interpretation are the variance\u2019s extensive list of permitted uses: \u201ca restaurant, lounge, bar, function facility, theater, hall or other place of amusement, entertainment or assembly.\u201d This list contemplates a wide range of public accommodations, without explicit limitation. In the city\u2019s favor, the paragraph describing the board\u2019s findings indicates that the variance should be far narrower: \u201cThe Board determined that since there will be no changes to the existing building or use of the building it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>be an avoidable hardship to deny this petition.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In essence, the legal foundation for the board\u2019s decision rests directly on the express finding that Oliver\u2019s existing use will not be changed, and the finding could thus be read as a binding condition on the variance, despite not being denominated as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In these circumstances, we agree with the judge that the best interpretation of the variance reads the board\u2019s finding as a limiting condition on the use of the property.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Within the stringent statutory requirements of the Zoning Enabling Act, variances are not allowed as a matter of right, and should be \u201csparingly granted.\u201d <em>Barron Chevrolet, Inc. </em>v. <em>Danvers, </em>419 Mass. 404, 408 (1995), quoting <em>Mendes </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Barnstable, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 527, 531 (1990). Where there is ambiguity on the face of a variance decision, it should be resolved against the holder of the variance. See <em>DiGiovanni </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Rockport, supra </em>at 347 (\u201clanguage of a variance is to be construed against the individual requesting the variance, rather than against the granting authority\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Given the effect of the variance\u2019s limitation, we turn to the question whether nude dancing might constitute an existing use within the terms of the variance. The judge found that even if the property\u2019s existing uses were unrelated to any variance and, instead, were prior nonconforming uses, the introduction of adult entertainment in the form of nude dancing would constitute an impermissible \u201cchange or substantial extension\u201d of such prior use. In reaching this conclusion, the judge relied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>(1) the licensing board\u2019s separate categorization of adult entertainment on applications for entertainment licenses pursuant to G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 183A; (2) the Zoning Enabling Act\u2019s authorization of special permits specifically for adult eritertainment, G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 9 (a); (3) the common notion that adult entertainment is a discrete medium of entertainment with special properties; and (4) the \u201cadverse impacts\u201d of adult entertainment on other industrial park users.</p>\n<p id=\"AqA\">Pointing to the establishment\u2019s distance from residences and its history of offering well-attended rock and roll shows, Mendoza challenges the judge\u2019s reliance on the alleged impacts of nude dancing in the Fall River Industrial Park. Mendoza also argues that adult entertainment is a subset of entertainment, within the broad scope of the \u201centertainment\u201d use once allowed as an accessory use to the airport and now through the variance decision. In response, the city advances studies analyzing the harmful secondary effects of adult entertainment to support the trial judge\u2019s finding that nude dancing constitutes a new use not within the scope of the variance.</p>\n<p id=\"A927\">Although we understand the judge\u2019s rationale for analogizing Oliver\u2019s proposed use of nude dancing to the modification of a prior nonconforming use, and applying the test for such a modification to determine whether it would constitute a \u201cchange or substantial extension of such use,\u201d G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6; see <em>Bridgewater </em>v. <em>Chuckran, </em>351 Mass. 20, 23 (1966), even that test may be too generous to Mendoza. Unlike prior nonconforming uses, which originated as legal uses of property, uses within a variance only become legal with the permission of the permit granting authority. See <em>Barron Chevrolet, Inc. </em>v. <em>Danvers, supra </em>at 408. Variances allowing nonconforming uses should be unusual because they are individual waivers of local legislation.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See <em>Norcross </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of the Bldg. Dep\u2019t of Boston, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>255 Mass. 177, 185 (1926) (\u201cIt is only in rare instances and under exceptional circumstances that relaxation of the general restrictions established by the statute ought to be permitted. The power granted is only for the relief of specific instances, peculiar in their nature\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Consequently, the same factors that counsel us to read the variance to be limited by the board\u2019s finding that the use of property would not change also lead us to conclude that nude dancing does not constitute an existing use within the scope of the variance. See <em>Mendes </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Barnstable, supra </em>at 531 (\u201cIt would be anomalous if a variance, by its nature sparingly granted, functioned as a launching pad for expansion as a nonconforming use\u201d). In this case, the variance confines the property\u2019s future use to Oliver\u2019s past uses. As is particularly appropriate where the variance holder urges a broad reading of a use variance to support a nonconforming use, we strictly construe the limitation. On the record before us, prior to the 1996 variance, Oliver\u2019s had been used as a restaurant, bar, a function hall, and a venue for live entertainment (including solo musicians, rock and roll bands, and disc jockeys), but not as a venue for adult entertainment or nude dancing. Accordingly, we need not decide whether \u201cadult entertainment\u201d is within or outside the general category of \u201centertainment,\u201d as a strict reading of the variance permits only those forms of entertainment that Oliver\u2019s hosted prior to 1996.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Because the record is clear that Oliver\u2019s never presented nude dancing prior to 1996, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>we hold that such a use cannot be an \u201cexisting use\u201d within the scope of this particular variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">We affirm the judge\u2019s ruling that the existing variance does not permit nude dancing at Oliver\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">4. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. </em>Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, State and Federal courts may award, in their discretion, a \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u201d to prevailing parties in civil rights litigation.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u201cThe purpose of [the statute] is to ensure \u2018effective access to the judicial process\u2019 for persons with civil rights grievances.\u201d <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 429 (1983).

In a written memorandum, the judge analyzed the disposition of the case and awarded Mendoza $155,696 for attorney\u2019s fees and $2,361.48 for other expenses. Relying on <em>Far-rar </em>v. <em>Hobby, </em>506 U.S. 103 (1992), the judge found that Mendoza had \u201cachieved substantial, substantive success entitling him to reasonable compensation for appropriate hours of legal services.\u201d In his computation of the award, the judge deducted from Mendoza\u2019s request by subtracting (1) time spent on chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>lenging the city\u2019s public indecency ordinance because Mendoza prevailed in that aspect of the litigation solely on his State constitutional claim,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> (2) time spent on Mendoza\u2019s rejected claim that the terms of the variance for Oliver\u2019s permitted adult entertainment, and (3) twenty hours from the seventy-six hours billed for the preparation of the filings related to the fee award because the full request was excessive for the work performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The city and licensing board argue that Mendoza is not a \u201cprevailing party,\u201d and is thus not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees or costs under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. In support of their contention, they point out that Mendoza has not obtained the practical relief the lawsuits sought \u2014 the ability to present nude dancing at Oliver\u2019s. Mendoza asks us to affirm the judge\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs because the judge was correct that he was the \u201cprevailing party\u201d in the litigation. Because Mendoza does not challenge the judge\u2019s calculation of the fee award, we confine our review to the threshold question whether Mendoza was a prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\u201c[T]o qualify as a prevailing party, a civil rights plaintiff must obtain at least some relief on the merits of his claim.\u201d <em>Farrar </em>v. <em>Hobby, supra </em>at 111. Second, the \u201cplaintiff must obtain an enforceable judgment against the defendant from whom fees are sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Third, \u201c[wjhatever relief the plaintiff secures must directly benefit him at the time of the judgment or settlement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn short, a plaintiff \u2018prevails\u2019 when actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant\u2019s behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111-112.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The lower court\u2019s judgments in this case invalidated all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>the challenged adult entertainment ordinances and secured Mendoza an adult entertainment license for Oliver\u2019s from the licensing board under G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 183A. The city and licensing board concede that this relief allows Mendoza to satisfy the first requirement of \u201cprevailing party\u201d status because he has obtained \u201cat least some relief on the merits of his claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111. In their argument that Mendoza is not a \u201cprevailing party,\u201d they assert that the judgments do not constitute relief that modifies their behavior in a way that directly benefits Mendoza because the sole practical relief Mendoza sought was the ability to present nude dancing at Oliver\u2019s, relief that he failed to obtain due to the judge\u2019s interpretation of the zoning variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Notwithstanding the city\u2019s and licensing board\u2019s arguments to the contrary, the declaratory and equitable relief awarded in this case satisfies both the second and third requirements for Mendoza\u2019s \u201cprevailing party\u201d status, as both types of relief are \u201cenforceable judgment[s]\u201d against them that \u201cdirectly benefit\u201d Mendoza. <em>Id. </em>at 111. As the judge held, the judgments provide Mendoza substantive rights to prevent the city\u2019s enforcement of its invalidated ordinances against Oliver\u2019s. The judgments actively prevent the city and licensing board from pursuing unconstitutional courses of action, which they defended vigorously throughout the litigation. Because the city and licensing board are no longer able to enforce the adult entertainment ordinances or to deny Oliver\u2019s an adult entertainment license, Mendoza is now eligible to apply for a zoning variance that would permit nude dancing.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the judgments \u201cmaterially alter[ed] the legal relationship between the parties . . . in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111-112. This distinguishes the relief here from the type of relief that \u201ccould not in any way have benefited [a] plaintiff.\u201d <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>488 U.S. 1, 4 (1988) (where plaintiffs in challenge to prison policies no longer in prison, \u201ccase was moot before judgment issued, and the judgment therefore afforded the plaintiffs no relief whatsoever. . . .

An attorney representing the city presented a legal opinion that Mendoza lacked a license for nude dancing and that the 1996 variance for the property would preclude such a use without an additional variance from the board of appeals, and played the tape recording of the 1996 meeting, during which the board of appeals granted the variance. In addition, the city\u2019s attorney submitted to the licensing board summaries of studies that analyzed the secondary effects of adult entertainment on certain cities. Members of the general public also addressed the licensing board, opposing Mendoza\u2019s application.

That the evidence marshaled by the city in support of its stated rationale to combat \u201csecondary effects\u201d of the proscribed conduct singles out establishments like Mendoza\u2019s and not other forms of public nudity seems a strong indicator that the ordinance is directed at the form of nudity common in adult entertainment.

Sec. 21-121(l)(f).\u201d Section 21-121(1) of the city\u2019s zoning ordinance in effect in 1996 specifies allowed uses in a business district, including \u201c[h]otel, restaurant or other eating place,\u201d and \u201c[c]lub, or other organization, dance hall, theatre, hall or other place of amusement or assembly.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Counsel began his remarks before the board of appeals by saying, \u201cThis looks more threatening perhaps, than it really is.

Patently, the Board of Appeals confined the variance to continuation of Oliver\u2019s existing business which had been operating in the industrial district for twelve years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"AuC\">The trial judge made this ruling in the context of rejecting Mendoza\u2019s argument that he need not reach the question of the constitutionality of the adult entertainment zoning ordinance enacted after the first denial of Mendoza\u2019s application for an adult entertainment license. This leaves the judge\u2019s ruling on the scope of the variance in a peculiar posture, as the judge next invalidated the city\u2019s adult entertainment overlay district and special permit process. We thus review the judge\u2019s legal analysis de nova, with the recognition that this case does not involve any party\u2019s specific challenge or defense of the variance itself. As the trial judge noted in the introduction to his decision, \u201coriginal jurisdiction resides in the City to determine whether nude dancing at Oliver\u2019s within the industrial district conforms with G. L. c. 40A and the zoning ordinance of the City.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The variance decision does not track the statute\u2019s criteria for granting a variance, which, inter alla, require the petitioner to face a \u201csubstantial hardship\u201d if the petition is denied. G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 10. The validity of the variance, however, is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b222-8\">We acknowledge that this variance raises potentially problematic issues of notice, particularly because the decision does not specify the property\u2019s existing use; this omission might pose difficulty for a subsequent purchaser without notice of the existing use. Notice, however, is not an issue in this case. Although the ownership of the Oliver\u2019s property is not clear from the record, Mendoza\u2019s 1997 complaint, amended in 1999, states that Mendoza, doing business as Oliver\u2019s, \u201chas held a seven day liquor license for the premises continuously since 1983,\u201d \u201chas held an entertainment license for the premises continuously since 1994,\u201d and, as of 1999, \u201coccupie[d] the premises under a written lease.\u201d As the longtime operator of Oliver\u2019s and the proponent of nude dancing at the property throughout the proceedings in this case, Mendoza had actual notice of the property\u2019s existing use.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"Aqr\">Although all variances are unusual forms of relief from zoning requirements, use variances should be particularly extraordinary because they inherently undermine the local zoning ordinance\u2019s division of uses. See M. Bobrowski, Massachusetts Land Use and Planning Law \u00a7 8.04, at 261 (2d ed. 2002) (\u201cUse variances ... are greatly disfavored\u201d). General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 10, bars zoning variances for nonconforming uses unless specifically authorized by the local zoning ordinance. The city\u2019s zoning ordinance authorizes such use variances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Anticipating this conclusion, Mendoza argues that discerning prior uses would create a \u201cproof nightmare\u201d for courts and that \u201centertainment\u201d should be given its ordinary expansive meaning. If the text being interpreted were a generally applicable local zoning ordinance or statute, we would agree. <em>Framingham Clinic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Framingham, </em>382 Mass. 283, 290 (1981), citing <em>Kurz </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of N.

In the context of use variances, we are confident that property owners will be able to defend zoning enforcement actions against them so long as they confine their uses to the variances\u2019 terms.
