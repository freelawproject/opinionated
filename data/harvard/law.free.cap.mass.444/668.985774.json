L. c. 175, \u00a7 1101 (a), which mandates that, in certain circumstances, the insurer of a group health insurance policy continue to provide coverage to the divorced spouse of a group member.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prior to his divorce, the plaintiff, James J. Foster, now a resident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>of Massachusetts, was married to Paula Foster,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> an employee of the New York City board of education (New York City) and at all relevant times a resident of New York City. Paula was a member of group health insurance plans offered by New York City, and James received health benefits under those policies as her dependent spouse. Each group insurance plan contained a provision that insurance coverage of a dependent spouse would terminate in the event of divorce from the group member. At some time following the divorce (the record does not say when), the defendants refused to provide continued health insurance coverage to James.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">In 2003, James commenced this action in the Superior Court alleging that the provisions of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 1101 (a), as amended through St. 1986, c. 579, \u00a7 5, require that the defendants continue to provide comprehensive health insurance coverage to him. He relies on the last sentence of \u00a7 1101 (a), which, since 1986, has provided that continued health insurance coverage \u201cshall apply to any policy issued or renewed within or without the commonwealth and which covers residents of the commonwealth.\u201d G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 1101 (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For the reasons we discuss below, G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 1101 (a), is applicable to a divorced dependent spouse if, and only if, the member spouse (here Paula) is a resident of Massachusetts. Because Paula resided in New York at the time of divorce, insured by insurers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>not subject to Massachusetts regulation, we affirm the summary judgment entered in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\"><em>Facts and procedural history. </em>In 1972, James married Paula, a teacher in the New York City public school system. New York City contracted with Group Health Incorporated (GHI) and Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield (Empire), both New York insurance companies, to provide comprehensive medical and hospital benefits, respectively, to New York City employees and their dependents enrolled in the New York City employee benefits program.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The insurance policies were approved by the New York State insurance department, issued in New York, and by their terms were governed by the laws of the State of New York. As a New York City employee, Paula was a covered member of both the GHI and Empire group health insurance plans, and James was entitled, as her dependent spouse, to receive health benefits under those policies for a \u201cnominal\u201d premium. Both policies expressly provided that coverage of a dependent spouse would cease on divorce from the member spouse.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">In August, 1987, James became a resident of Massachusetts. He remained married to Paula, who continued to reside in New York City, employed in the public schools.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> James and Paula were divorced in Massachusetts in 1992. In 2001, on her retirement from her employment by New York City, Paula changed her coverage under the GHI policy from family to individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>coverage.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In sworn statements James has asserted that, after he moved to Massachusetts, both GHI and Empire reimbursed him for claims for medical services provided to him in Massachusetts, but that because of the divorce,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Empire and GHI have now rejected claims for medical services provided to him.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">In September, 2003, James commenced this action in the Superior Court. He sought an injunction ordering GHI and Empire to comply with G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 1101 <em>(a), </em>and to \u201cprovide benefits to [him] to the same degree and under the same terms as would have existed but for the judgment of divorce.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> After Empire answered the complaint, James moved for summary judgment against it. Empire filed a cross motion for summary judgment. GHI moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction, with a supporting affidavit. James countered with a motion for summary judgment against GHI. Both GHI and Empire argued that Massachusetts courts lacked personal jurisdiction over them, and that James\u2019s claims failed as a matter of law because the group policies at issue expressly provided no coverage to a former spouse. GHI also argued that application of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 1101 (a), would violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Following a single hearing, a Superior Court judge denied James\u2019s motions for summary judgment, allowed Empire\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and entered summary judgment for GHI pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). The judge ruled that coverage for James had terminated under the terms of the insurance policies; that G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 1101 <em>(a), </em>was inapplicable because the parties to the group insurance contracts, the defendants and New York City, had agreed to be bound by New York law; that the provisions of the policies terminating James\u2019s benefits on divorce were controlling; and that James had suggested \u201cno persuasive reason\u201d why a Massachusetts court should decline to enforce the contracts. She did not directly address James\u2019s statutory claim, which is the heart of his case. Final judgment dismissing the complaint entered in August, 2004, from which James appealed. We granted his application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>In reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we view the evidence in its light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and determine whether the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. See <em>Beal </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Hingham, </em>419 Mass. 535, 539 (1995). We may consider any ground supporting the trial judge\u2019s ruling. <em>Hawthorne\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Warrenton Realty, Inc., </em>414 Mass. 200, 210 n.6 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">In this case, the material facts are not in dispute. Our resolution therefore turns solely on the interpretation of the last sentence of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 1101 (a). The defendant insurers point to their respective policies, each providing that group health insurance for a dependent spouse terminates when he is divorced from the member employee.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See note 6, <em>supra. </em>James counters that G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 1101 (a), trumps the express language of any group health insurance contract denying coverage to a former spouse so long as the dependent spouse resides in Massachusetts. We reject any such interpretation of the statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>not only because it strains common sense, <em>Clarke </em>v. <em>Kentucky Fried Chicken of Cal., Inc., </em>57 F.3d 21, 29 (1st Cir. 1995), but because to do otherwise would give rise to grave doubts about the statute\u2019s constitutionality, which we presume was contrary to the Legislature\u2019s intent. See <em>Providence, Fall River &amp; Newport Steamboat Co. </em>v. <em>Fall River, </em>183 Mass. 535, 542 (1903) (\u201cit is [the court\u2019s] duty to assume that the Legislature intended to act within its constitutional authority\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">A hypothetical example exposes the deficiency of James\u2019s argument. Under his interpretation of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 1101 (a), a California insurance company regulated by the California Insurance Commissioner, that issued a group health insurance policy to a California employer (policyholder) to cover California employees (members), and which in fact covered only California employees and their dependents, would be subject to G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 1101 <em>(a), </em>if, at any time prior to divorce, a dependent spouse established Massachusetts residency. Thus, under James\u2019s theory, G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 1101 (a), would mandate postdi-vorce continuation coverage even if the California insurer had no contacts with Massachusetts, did no business in Massachusetts, had contracted to terminate coverage of former spouses, and even if a dependent spouse relocated to Massachusetts for the sole purpose of obtaining health care continuation benefits following an anticipated divorce. We shall not impute to the Massachusetts Legislature an intent to regulate out-of-State insurance companies that have no contact with Massachusetts, and have never contracted to provide coverage to Massachusetts residents. Rather, we are confident on a review of the statutory history of the 1986 amendment that the Massachusetts Legislature intended merely to clarify that a dependent spouse of a Massachusetts insured (member) would have access to postdivorce coverage regardless whether the insurer of the Massachusetts member was located within or without the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">We begin our discussion by describing G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 1101 <em>(a), </em>before it was amended in 1986. See <em>Haley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>394 Mass. 466, 477 n.9 (1985); <em>Barclay </em>v. <em>DeVeau, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 236, 241, <em>S.C., </em>384 Mass. 676 (1981), citing 1A C. Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>tion \u00a7 22.34 (4th ed. 1972) (provisions of amendatory act to be considered together with provisions of original act). Section 1101 is part of the comprehensive statutory scheme set forth in G. L. c. 175, which contains numerous provisions regulating commercial insurance companies doing business in Massachusetts. That chapter grants to the Massachusetts Commissioner of Insurance broad authority to regulate insurers, transactions among insurers and their policyholders, and the specific content of insurance policies. General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 110, in turn, regulates commercial insurance companies that \u201cdeliver[ ] or issue[ ] for delivery [group policies] in the commonwealth.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Initially inserted by St. 1981, c. 735, G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 1101, provided that the former dependent spouse of a member of a health insurance policy \u201cprovided for in [G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 110],\u201d i.e., a policy regulated by Massachusetts (\u201cdelivered or issued for delivery in the commonwealth\u201d), would (unless the divorce judgment specified otherwise) remain eligible for continued coverage under the member\u2019s group health insurance policy, at the group premium rate, until remarriage of either the group plan member or the dependent former spouse.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> If the member spouse remarried, an unmarried former dependent spouse could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>maintain continued coverage, if the divorce decree so provided, by means of a rider to the family plan or the issuance of a family plan, either of which could require the dependent spouse to pay a \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d increased premium rate, as determined by the Massachusetts commissioner. The provisions of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 1101 <em>(a), </em>therefore applied only when a member spouse belonged to a group plan regulated by the Massachusetts commissioner. Stated differently, prior to the 1986 amendment, James would not have been entitled to continuation benefits because the group policy at issue was not one regulated by Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">We turn now to the 1986 amendment. By this amendment, the Legislature clarified that the existing provisions of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 1101 <em>(a), </em>applied to out-of-State insurers. The circumstances of the enactment of the 1986 amendment illuminate this interpretation of the statute. See <em>Triplett </em>v. <em>Oxford, </em>439 Mass. 720, 723 (2003), quoting <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513 (1975) (factors relevant to ascertaining Legislature\u2019s intent include \u201ccause of [statute\u2019s] enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The 1986 amendment was enacted in the wake of the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>471 U.S. 724 (1985) <em>(Metropolitan Life). </em>That case concerned, inter alla, the applicability of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 47B, which mandated that mental health benefits be included in group insurance policies issued pursuant to G. L. c. 175, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>\u00a7 110. The Massachusetts Attorney General brought suit for declaratory and injunctive relief against two out-of-State insurers (New York and Connecticut) to enforce G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 47B. <em>Id. </em>at 734. The out-of-State insurers had issued group health insurance policies to out-of-State policyholders who employed or represented \u201cemployees <em>residing </em>in Massachusetts\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>The insurers refused to provide the mandated mental health benefits, arguing that the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001 et seq. (ERISA), and the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151 et seq. (NLRB), preempted the Massachusetts statute. <em>Metropolitan Life, supra </em>at 727. The Supreme Court held that G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 47B, constituted \u201cState regulation of the \u2018business of insurance\u2019 \u201d and was not preempted by either Federal statute. <em>Id. </em>at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\"><em>Metropolitan Life </em>concerned only mandated mental health benefits. Subsequently, the Attorney General apparently sought to clarify that other benefits mandated by G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 110 (\u00a7 1101, among others), were available to members of group insurance plans who resided in Massachusetts, regardless of the location of their insurer or policyholder. In January, 1986, four Senate bills were filed, one of which, 1986 Senate Doc. No. 752, was a petition of the Attorney General. He proposed that a sentence be added to \u00a7 1101 <em>(a) </em>as follows: \u201cThe provisions of this subsection shall apply to any policy issued or delivered within or without the Commonwealth.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Of the three other Senate bills, all of which had the same sponsor, only one proposed any change to \u00a7 1101. That bill would have added a subsection <em>(d) </em>to \u00a7 1101, making that section applicable \u201cto all insurance plans classified above [i.e., within paragraphs 1101 <em>(a)-(c) </em>of \u00a7 1101] whether written within or without the Commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-25\">On June 5, 1986, the Senate Committee on Insurance noted that the four bills had been referred to it, and reported out 1986 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Senate Doc. No. 1978, entitled \u201cAn Act relating to the extraterritorial application of mandated insurance benefits.\u201d The Senate proposed revisions to all mandated benefits provisions of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 110, including \u00a7 1101, to the effect that \u201c[t]he provision of this section shall apply to any policy issued or renewed within or without the commonwealth which covers residents of the commonwealth. \u2019 \u2019<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Following passage by the House of Representatives and the Senate, the Governor signed 1986 Senate Doc, No. 1978 into law on December 9, 1986. As its title confirms, the 1986 amendment gave extraterritorial application to existing mandated benefits. Nothing suggests that mandated benefits were to be made available to members like Paula who were <em>not </em>residents of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">We therefore decline to adopt the statutory construction urged on us by the plaintiff. See <em>Providence, Fall River &amp; Newport Steamboat Co. </em>v. <em>Fall River, </em>183 Mass. 535, 542 (1903) (court\u2019s obligation is \u201cto treat the words of the statute, if possible, in such a way as to give them legal effect\u201d). James is no more entitled to continuation coverage now than he was before 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">For all of these reasons we conclude that the mandated benefits provisions of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 1101 (a), are not available to the plaintiff where his former spouse resided in New York at the time of divorce, insured by insurers not subject to Massachusetts regulation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b684-24\">A group health insurance policy, also known as a general or blanket policy, is a comprehensive policy that covers a number of individual persons, typically employees or union members.

The Legislature appropriately narrowed the proposed language to circumstances where members who were insured by such policies actually resided in Massachusetts, the factual circumstances addressed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>471 U.S. 724, 734 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b693-9\">The plaintiff has not called our attention to, nor have we discovered, any commentator or author who has suggested that a dependent former spouse may benefit from the provisions of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 1101 (a), where the member spouse has never been a resident of the Commonwealth.
