Krohn (petitioner) applied for admission to the Massachusetts bar. Because the petitioner had been convicted of two felonies, the Board of Bar Examiners (board) conducted an investigation. By a three-to-two vote, the board declined to recommend the petitioner for admission to the bar. The petitioner appealed to a single justice, who reserved and reported the matter to the full court. Because we conclude that the petitioner, by his submissions, including his submissions to this court, has failed to satisfy his burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>proving that he is currently fit to practice law, we deny his application for admission to the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\"><em>Facts and procedural background. </em>In 1977, the petitioner pleaded guilty, in Federal court, to two felonies, conspiracy and extortion. His convictions were brought to the board\u2019s attention through a personal statement submitted with a letter of support to the board from an associate dean of his law school.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consequently, the board investigated his fitness for admission to the bar.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The board held hearings<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> at which the petitioner testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The petitioner testified before the board that a Mexican national (victim) had swindled him out of a large sum of money in the early 1970\u2019s, at a time when the petitioner was living in Mexico under the alias Henry Blackwell. The petitioner was charged with kidnapping but pleaded guilty to the lesser offenses. At his plea hearing, he admitted that he and another individual used a false identity to lure the victim to Dulles International Airport for purposes of extorting the money.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The petitioner admitted that his coconspirator met the victim at the airport and took him to a car \u201crented by [the petitioner], using [a] . . . credit card\u201d under another false name. The victim was taken to an apartment in Maryland that had been rented and was \u201ccoerced to write approximately seven letters to member of [the victim\u2019s] family.\u201d The letters were in the victim\u2019s handwriting and had the petitioner\u2019s fingerprints on them. The letters instructed various persons to dismiss a lawsuit the victim had instituted against the petitioner, and to transfer assets to the petitioner (i.e., Henry Blackwell). As part of the plea, the government agreed not to prosecute the petitioner for any other crimes related to the case and the petitioner expected to serve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>approximately three and one-half years in prison. The petitioner was sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment and he served approximately three years of his sentence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">These felonies are very serious and were, one may fairly conclude, committed as retribution for a wrong perpetrated on the petitioner by the victim. At the time the petitioner committed the crimes, in 1973, he was thirty-five years old, and held a master\u2019s degree and a doctorate from Harvard University, which he earned in the 1960\u2019s. His doctorate is in mathematics. He was accomplished in his field. He coauthored a computer science theory that was published in a textbook. He had owned, and sold at a profit, his own computer business, making him financially secure. He also owned property in the District of Columbia. See <em>Matter of Prager, </em>422 Mass. 86, 96 (1996) (admission to bar denied despite board recommendation for admission; at time applicant committed felonies, he was mature, well educated, and possessed adequate financial resources).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The petitioner submitted numerous letters in support of his application for admission, each of which attested to his present good character, including his generous devotion of time to helping others.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> One supportive letter was from a law professor who supervised the petitioner\u2019s field work and'also testified on his behalf at his hearing before the board. Two labor law attorneys also wrote letters stating that the petitioner\u2019s representation (while he was a law school student) of an employee of the Po<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>laroid Corporation during a proceeding involving the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) (discussed <em>infra) </em>resulted in a determination that a company union was illegal, and both letters praised the petitioner\u2019s contribution to the community. The petitioner also called character witnesses at his hearing, who stated that they believed that he had a good character.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The board issued a report on October 8, 2003.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The board gave the petitioner \u201cthe benefit of the doubt in respect of his criminal and litigation history.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, based on a letter that the petitioner sent to counsel for the Polaroid Corporation during a dispute involving the NLRB matter and on two of the petitioner\u2019s submissions to the board, the board listed sixteen instances of conduct that caused it concern.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In his submissions to the board, the petitioner accused the board of bad faith and misrepresentation, accused pro bona counsel for the board of bad faith, attacked the legal system in general, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>character of Federal officials who were involved in his criminal case in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">All members of the board agreed with the findings set forth in the board\u2019s report, but they disagreed over whether the findings concerning the petitioner\u2019s conduct supported the conclusion that he possessed a serious character flaw, rendering him unfit to practice law. The dissenters stated that the petitioner\u2019s memorandum and objections, however offensive, represented a temporary \u201csiege mentality,\u201d and the \u201cuncomely hubristic aspect of his personality\u201d did not render him unfit.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\"><em>Standard for admission to the bar. </em>The right to practice law \u201cis a peculiar privilege granted ... to those who demonstrate special fitness in intellectual attainment and in moral character.\u201d <em>Matter of Prager, </em>422 Mass. 86, 101 (1996), quoting <em>Matter of Keenan, </em>314 Mass. 544, 546-547 (1943). \u201cThe license to practice law may not be withheld arbitrarily or discriminatorily.\u201d <em>Matter of Prager, supra </em>at 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\u201cThe commission of a felony is . . . conclusive evidence of lack of good moral character at the time of the offense,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 91-92, but a \u201cprior conviction is not an absolute bar to admission ...

See note 7, <em>supra; Wei Jia </em>v. <em>Board of Bar Examiners, 427 </em>Mass. <em>777, </em>782-783 (1998). See also G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">We have reviewed all the documents in the record and all submissions to this court and are left with significant doubts concerning the petitioner\u2019s character and fitness to practice law. <em>Matter of Prager, supra </em>at 100. Accordingly, we conclude that the petitioner has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that his admission to the bar would not be \u201cdetrimental to the integrity of the bar, the administration of justice, or the public interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93, citing SJ.C. Rule 4:01, \u00a7 18 (5).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>In re Application of Converse, supra </em>at 170-171, quoting <em>In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number><em>Appeal of Lane, supra </em>at 511. However, before we begin our discussion of the reason for our conclusion, we address an error the board made in admitting evidence concerning the petitioner\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">Initially, the board decided it was bound by the petitioner\u2019s guilty plea, the voluntariness of which was affirmed by United States <em>vs. </em>Krohn, No. 79-6316 (4th Cir. June 20, 1980). <em>Matter of Prager, </em>422 Mass. 86, 88, 89, 91-92 (1996) (guilty plea conclusive evidence of lack of good moral character at time). Relying, inter alla, on <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Niziolek, </em>395 Mass. 737 (1985) (in subsequent civil litigation, guilty plea merely admissible as evidence of guilt), the petitioner asserted in his memorandum (see note 9, <em>supra) </em>that his plea of guilty constituted only some evidence of guilt and that he was entitled to present evidence that he pleaded guilty for reasons other than guilt. The board was persuaded and allowed the petitioner to present such evidence. This was error and should not have occurred.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Allowing such evidence would be inconsistent with the rule applied to practicing attorneys subject to disciplinary proceedings. Supreme Judicial Court Rule 4:01, \u00a7 12 (2), as appearing in 425 Mass. 1313 (1997), states that \u201c[a] conviction of a lawyer for any crime shall be conclusive evidence of the commission of that crime in any disciplinary proceeding.\u201d The term \u201cconviction\u201d includes a guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">We now discuss the reasons for our conclusion that the petitioner has not met his burden of proving his fitness to practice law, beginning, in chronological order, with examples from the petitioner\u2019s submissions in various legal contexts, including submissions to this court and to the board.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">1. <em>The petitioner\u2019s submissions in other legal contexts, </em>a. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>1995, while the petitioner was a law school student, he acted as a representative for an employee of Polaroid Corporation (Polaroid) in a proceeding involving the NLRB. In its report, the board expressed concern about two documents the petitioner sent to the attorney representing Polaroid during the course of the NLRB process. One document was apparently an internal Eastman-Kodak Company document and there was, as well, an internal Polaroid memorandum concerning it. In the letter to Polaroid\u2019s attorney, the petitioner stated that he had \u201ccome across a most troubling pair of documents\u201d in the course of his \u201cresearch and preparation on behalf\u201d of his client in the matter before the NLRB. The petitioner stated that the documents appeared to be authentic and:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">\u201cPolaroid seemingly could only have obtained the internal Kodak memorandum in question through unauthorized means. My follow-up inquiry into this matter moreover suggests to me that the attached documents represent merely the tip of an ice-berg which, furthermore, also involves organizations other than Kodak. As a matter of courtesy, I have decided to advise you of the above-described situation because the action which I contemplate taking potentially could publicly embarrass your client. Unless you care to persuade me before Friday, April 8, 1994 either that the memoranda in question are not genuine or that Polaroid had come into possession ... in a licit manner ... I intend to transmit both memoranda along with certain supplementary material to legal counsel for Kodak in order to enable Kodak to initiate whatever proceedings it may deem appropriate to recover for any wrongful injury which Polaroid has caused Kodak through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Polaroid\u2019s apparent misappropriation of Kodak\u2019s trade secrets and/or confidential commercial information.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The petitioner did send the documents to Kodak, and the petitioner\u2019s client was subsequently fired after Polaroid determined that she was the one who released them to the petitioner.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Concerning his decision to bring the documents to light, the petitioner testified before the board that he was not threatening Polaroid. He stated that his sole motive was to \u201csolidify derogatory material about Polaroid for distribution to the employees in support of the union.\u201d He thought that if he could show that Polaroid stole documents from Kodak, it would make Polaroid look bad. He also testified that he was \u201cirked\u201d that the attorney for Polaroid had sought to have the petitioner disqualified as the client\u2019s representative by releasing a copy of his plea agreement to the appeals department of the NLRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">We agree with the board that the petitioner\u2019s sending such a letter during the NLRB process is a cause for concern. We disagree with the petitioner\u2019s assertion that he was not threatening Polaroid. Moreover, even though the petitioner testified that sending the letter was \u201can error in judgment,\u201d there is nothing in the record to indicate that the petitioner recognizes that his overzealousness contributed to his client\u2019s losing her job. The petitioner did state that the reason the documents came to him anonymously was because employees were afraid of being discharged for coming forward with information. Given that this is what he believed about the employment environment at Polaroid, it is evidence of poor judgment concerning the well-being of his client for him to have sent the letter, seemingly without contemplating the risk to which he may have been exposing his client.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">b. In 1995, the petitioner wrote a letter to Greater Boston Legal Services (GBLS) on behalf of another Polaroid employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>who apparently was told by an attorney for GELS that GBLS\u2019s interpretation of a statute prevented it from introducing certain testimony at the employee\u2019s arbitration. GBLS apparently told the employee that he was free to retain other counsel if he was unhappy with GBLS\u2019s decision. The petitioner sent a letter protesting the decision in which he, inter aha, (1) stated, in the heading, that the letter was regarding \u201csuggestion of apparent serious ethical problem,\u201d (2) stated in the first paragraph that GBLS\u2019s handling of the case \u201cappears to present a serious ethical question,\u201d and (3) suggested that GBLS was not living up to its ethical duty zealously to represent its clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">2. <em>The petitioner\u2019s submissions to this court, </em>a. The following exchange occurred during one of the board\u2019s hearings as the petitioner offered in evidence an exhibit that contained materials related to his conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">Chairman Barshak: \u201cNext we will take into evidence [petitioner\u2019s exhibits related to his criminal conviction]. We\u2019re admitting it all into evidence. It may serve more purposes than you have in mind, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">The petitioner: \u201cWell, can I please?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aio-dedup-0\">Chairman Barshak: \u201cNo please. This is not a conversation, we have to follow the rules. You have to wait for the questions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">The petitioner: \u201cOkay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">In paragraph number four of its report, the board noted the petitioner\u2019s reaction to this exchange, in which he accused Bar-shak of calling him \u201csimpleminded,\u201d as one of its reasons for concern over the applicant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">In his petition to the single justice, the petitioner answered paragraph number four by stating that its first sentence \u201ccites applicant\u2019s words out of context, apparently for the purpose of demonstrating a purported example of lack of civility by applicant in berating [a] former attorney.\u201d He then elaborated on what he had written in his memorandum, to which the board had taken exception, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>\u201cThe condescending barb which Chairman Barshak directed to applicant about what applicant may have had in mind when he offered Exhibit \u201814\u2019 into evidence was wholly gratuitous in that it contributed nothing substantive to the proceeding and, by way of aggravation, was completely unprovoked by anything which applicant had previously said or done. Chairman Barshak clearly made the comment for the sole purpose of demeaning applicant before his wife and others present by belittling applicant\u2019s judgment. The clear gist of the remark was that applicant, in his simplicity, did not understand, as did Chairman Bar-shak in his wisdom, that the exhibit which applicant had offered into evidence might be more detrimental than beneficial to applicant\u2019s case. The offensiveness of the remark from applicant\u2019s point of view was magnified by the extremely broad discretion within which Chairman Barshak and the rest of the Board may operate in making the highly subjective determination of whether applicant is morally fit to be an attorney, which circumstances chilled applicant from responding more insistently.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">He included a footnote that stated that by the exchange quoted above, \u201cChairman Barshak silenced the applicant when applicant sought, by way of response, to explain why he had prepared and offered Exhibit \u201814\u2019 into evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The petitioner concluded by stating that his objection to Mr. Barshak\u2019s remark was justified because members of the board <em>should </em>be bound by the same rules that govern the conduct of judges. Although board members are not, in fact, bound by the rules that govern judicial conduct, the petitioner alleged that Barshak \u201cinfringed that provision when he gratuitously humiliated the applicant by directing the above-quoted barb at him.\u201d By way of a footnote, the petitioner also brought to the single justice\u2019s attention \u201cwhat appears to be a serious gap in the legal framework which presently governs the functioning of the Board of Bar Examiners; namely, the absence of a pertinent code of conduct . . . and of an entity with authority to investigate and discipline complaints about violations of that code [because] an applicant who has been subjected to abusive language by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>member of the [bjoard . . . may not validly complain about that conduct. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">The exchange with Barshak occurred while certain procedural issues (admission of exhibits) were being dealt with. The petitioner was attempting to inject his statement into the process and was prevented from doing so. The petitioner\u2019s reaction is not in keeping with being able to deal with a \u201csense of reality\u201d in dealing with the legal system. <em>In re Application of Converse, </em>258 Neb. 159, 171 (1999), quoting <em>In re Appeal of Lane, </em>249 Neb. 499, 513 (1996). His conclusion that the remarks were designed to humiliate him led him to make arguments that are beyond the bounds of legitimate argument.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>414 Mass. 450, 456 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">b. During the course of the petitioner\u2019s application process, one board member, the late John Dunn, recused himself. Before addressing the petitioner\u2019s discussion of Dunn in his submissions to this court, we provide some context.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">In an affidavit submitted to the board, the petitioner states that when he was first thinking about attending law school, he was concerned about how his felony convictions might affect his eventual application for admission to the bar. He obtained a copy of the application for admission form and noticed that, at that time, the question about felony convictions (Question 11) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>asked applicants to reveal felony convictions within the previous seven years. He states that he also spoke to the then executive director of the board and was assured that the board was only interested in felonies that occurred within seven years. He states that, relying on this information, he applied to and attended law school. However, when he applied for admission in 1996, the board did take into account his felony convictions.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">In addition, before the petitioner pleaded guilty to the two felonies in 1977, he had been arrested twice before concerning the same crime, but was not prosecuted. Dining his first arrest in 1973, he retained an attorney, James M. Pool, to represent him. <em>Matter of Pool, </em>401 Mass. 460, 461 (1988). Attorney Pool was later disbarred because, during the course of his representation of the petitioner, Pool committed a \u201cserious breach of client confidentiality [and] fail[ed] to disclose significant facts\u201d to the petitioner that affected the amount of fee he received.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 460-461.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">John Dunn apparently represented Pool in a lawsuit filed by the petitioner against Federal officials and Pool and was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>character witness for Pool during proceedings before the Board of Bar Overseers.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">In paragraph five of its report, the board noted the petitioner\u2019s reaction to Dunn as one of its reasons for concern over the applicant\u2019s conduct. The petitioner accused Dunn of sharing information that Dunn allegedly received from Pool with other board members, thereby prejudicing his application. In addition, in his memorandum, the petitioner also stated that the recusal of Dunn would not be enough to satisfy his concern. However, after the petitioner submitted his memorandum, Dunn recused himself so that he would not take part in the board\u2019s decision, and the board reconsidered and decided (erroneously, discussed supra) to allow the petitioner to present evidence of his innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Despite the petitioner\u2019s persuasion of the board to hear this evidence, Dunn\u2019s recusal before a final board recommendation on the petitioner\u2019s application, the fact that the board stated that it would not draw any adverse inferences from the petitioner\u2019s convictions, and the fact that this court, although granting a deference to a recommendation of the board, reviews the record de nova, the petitioner has persisted in using Dunn as a vehicle to attack the entire board. He alleges in his brief (without support in the record) that the reason the board considered the convictions at all was because of Dunn\u2019s influence over the board. He asserts that Dunn was the reason the board denied his motion to exclude the felony convictions, declined discovery motions and other requests, and did not issue reasons for its decision to deny the petitioner\u2019s requests, and states that the board\u2019s treatment of his felonies is different from the way the board has handled other applicants\u2019 felonies. In fact, in a footnote in his brief, the petitioner states: \u201cNote also the enormous disparity to applicant\u2019s detriment in the treatment afforded the applicant in this matter compared with the revolving-door reinstatement accorded to applicant\u2019s disbarred former attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Pool\u2019s reinstatement was the subject of a decision by this court. <em>Matter of Pool, </em>401 Mass. 460 (1988). The petitioner\u2019s characterization of that ten-page decision as a \u201crevolving-door reinstatement\u201d is unwarranted and impugns the work of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>court.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Moreover, the petitioner acknowledges that he has no proof of his assertions about Dunn\u2019s alleged influence over the board, but states that if the court will grant his requests for an evidentiary hearing and discovery, he might be able to prove it. The petitioner\u2019s assertions of impropriety and his statement that he might be able to prove the assertions are not enough of a showing for us to order either discovery or an evidentiary hearing. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodreau, </em>442 Mass. 341, 348-349, 355 (2004) (judge did not abuse discretion in denying motion for new trial without evidentiary hearing where defendant\u2019s submissions did not contain sufficient credible information to \u201ccast doubt\u201d on assessment of competency).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">c. One particularly egregious claim impugns the integrity of both the board and, albeit indirectly, the Justices of this court. In his brief and his petition to the single justice, the petitioner discusses that the board mentioned that he had not been accepted into Harvard Law School twice in its report. The board mentioned it once in connection with its statement that it would not draw adverse inferences from his involvement in litigation and once in connection with a disparaging remark the petitioner made about bar counsel in his objections document. In the objections document, the petitioner himself made particular reference to the Harvard lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The petitioner\u2019s lawsuit against Harvard Law School was the subject of an opinion by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. <em>Krohn </em>v. <em>Harvard Law Sch., </em>552 F.2d 21 (1st Cir. 1977). In his petition to the single justice, the petitioner spent several paragraphs criticizing the board for not stating in its report that the lawsuit occurred in 1975, \u201cmanifesting] a complete disinterest in hearing applicant\u2019s explanation of the considerations which had prompted him to file the lawsuit in the first place,\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and the inaccuracy of the board\u2019s statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>that his lawsuit was based on a contention that Harvard College was created by the Constitution of the Commonwealth, when it was created by the \u201cGeneral Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1636.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Concerning this last point, the petitioner states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-6\">\u201c[The board] incorrectly imputed to applicant the allegation in that lawsuit of patently untrue historical facts as the basis for applicant\u2019s at first blush unreasonable legal theory therein, thereby suggesting on the part of applicant a degree of crass ignorance and an utter lack of realism. It is as though the Board by this device has sought to send to this Court \u2014 a number of whose justices are furthermore graduates of or have been closely connected with Harvard University and/or its law school \u2014 a subliminal message discrediting applicant as a person not to be taken seriously. Having previously observed elsewhere the use with devastating effect of such a less than commendable tactic, applicant intends by this discussion to forestall the profitable use of such an illegitimate subliminal message here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">In addition, in the statement of facts in his brief to this court, the petitioner states in a footnote that these references, inter alla, \u201cthereby insinuate] the existence in applicant of a degree of personal mediocrity for having been rejected or presumption for having applied in the first place.\u201d In a footnote he also responds to the board dissenters\u2019 statement that he had an \u201cuncomely hubristic aspect of his personality\u201d by stating: \u201capplicant hopes that he is not again \u2018demonstrating an uncomely hubristic aspect of his personality\u2019 ... by here affirming his belief that his view of Harvard\u2019s legal status is compelled by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>principled application of . . . law [in light of] the history of Harvard and [governing] statutes.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">We allow the petitioner\u2019s tendency to recrimination to speak for itself and reject his argument that the board is trying to influence the Justices by its reference to the fact that the petitioner (who joins countless others who have been rejected) was not admitted into Harvard Law School. The argument is absurd with respect to the petitioner\u2019s allegations of the board\u2019s motivation. It is also disrespectful of the work of this court.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">d. In his reply brief, the petitioner responded to a comment in the board\u2019s brief stating that the pages in the record appendix before this court are mostly without serial page numbers. This statement is true. The pages in the volumes are not sequential as to each other (i.e., volume two begins on page 1, not page 410) and some pages have no visible numbers. The petitioner, after noting that he took care in his assembly of the volumes, chose to address the board\u2019s statement as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">\u201cThe [b]card inaccurately asserts that the \u2018record appendix [is not sequentially numbered]\u2019 and exploits that untruthful and unjustly disparaging statement as a pretext to excuse its systematic failure to support by proper reference to the Record Appendix frequently inaccurate and/or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>misleadingly incomplete assertions of fact throughout its brief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">In their submissions to this court, attorneys address errors in one another\u2019s briefs and submissions, even where, as here, it was not necessary. The level of care the petitioner took in assembling the record appendix, as well as veracity of the board\u2019s statement concerning pagination, are obvious as the court conducts its review of the case. We do not deny the petitioner\u2019s right to try to correct what he perceives to be an error. However, especially because what the board stated was not an error, we are troubled by the petitioner\u2019s personalization of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">e. In paragraph six of its report, the board identified the petitioner\u2019s irrelevant personal attack on a former United States magistrate, accusing him of giving \u201ccorrupt\u201d assistance to James Pool as a cause for concern. In his brief, the petitioner again includes this irrelevant and unsupported attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">This attack on the legal system is inappropriate and does not comport with the professionalism that is required of an attorney. In <em>Matter of Hiss, </em>368 Mass. 447, 448 (1975), Hiss maintained his innocence despite his conviction of two counts of peijury. There was no hint in the facts that Hiss engaged in any unprofessional conduct or made any frivolous, unsupported, or libelous accusations against any tribunal. <em>Id. </em>at 467 (noting that \u201c[h]is testimony contained no hint of present animosity or grudge against those who convicted him. The conviction itself had not shaken his faith in the judicial system\u201d). Like Hiss, the petitioner maintains his innocence. Of course, the petitioner is not required subjectively to maintain a personal trust in the legal system. However, whatever his subjective views of the legal system, his unprofessional, unsupported attacks on not only the Federal system, but also on the work of this court, and the work of the board, do not demonstrate the requisite professionalism, respect, and demeanor required of an attorney. The petitioner\u2019s approach in this regard raises substantial concern about his fitness to practice law. <em>Matter of Prager, supra </em>at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">3. <em>Petitioner\u2019s defenses. </em>The petitioner has acknowledged that if his conduct had occurred during a civil proceeding, it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>be unacceptable. See <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>414 Mass. 450, 456 (1993); <em>In re Application of Converse, </em>258 Neb. 159, 171 (1999). However, he contends that he was required by the holding in <em>Matter of Prager, </em>422 Mass. 86 (1996), to reveal his innermost thoughts and feelings concerning morality, and that is exactly what he did through his various submissions to the board and the court. This argument has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">In <em>Matter of Prager, supra </em>at 100-101, the court set out guidance to the board on inquiries concerning an applicant\u2019s character. The court stated: \u201cA hearing to determine character and fitness should be more of a mutual inquiry for the purpose of acquainting this court with the applicant\u2019s innermost feelings and personal views on those aspects of morality, attention to duty, forthrightness and self-restraint which are usually associated with the accepted definition of \u2018good moral character.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>In re Application of Davis, </em>38 Ohio St. 2d 273, 274 (1974). The applicant is required to cooperate with the board\u2019s inquiry. <em>Matter of Prager, supra </em>at 101, citing <em>In re Application of Davis, supra. </em>The entire purpose of the application process is to determine the applicant\u2019s fitness to practice law. Accordingly, <em>Matter of Prager, supra, </em>invites the applicant to prove to the court that the <em>applicant </em>possesses the requisite fitness so that the court can be confident that allowing an applicant to practice law would not be detrimental to the public interest. <em>Id. </em>at 93-94. The conduct of someone else generally is not relevant to the exploration of the applicant\u2019s fitness because it sheds no light on the ultimate question: whether the applicant is fit to practice law. Repeated, unsupported, ad hominem attacks on the ethics, integrity, and motivations of others involved in the process do, however, reflect adversely on the applicant\u2019s fitness to practice law. Even assuming that <em>Matter of Prager, supra, </em>invites such an assessment of others, in order for the applicant to demonstrate he possessed the requisite fitness, his critique would have to be within acceptable bounds of argument, which the petitioner concedes his arguments are not.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> It is the ascription of base or unethical motives to various individuals involved in the process, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>without support in the record, that is the conduct that exceeds the bounds of legal argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">In his brief to this court, the petitioner argues that he cannot be held accountable for the two documents on which the board relied in making its recommendation because his attorney is the one who submitted them.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> However, the petitioner admitted in oral argument before the single justice that he wrote the first draft of both documents and submitted them to his attorney for her to edit and submit to the board.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Indeed, the memorandum makes frequent use of \u201cwe\u201d as the pronoun of choice when arguments to the board are asserted. He also stated that <em>he </em>interspersed in the two documents his personal reservations about the conduct of those involved in his application and that he believed that <em>his </em>views were reasonable and fully warranted by the facts. At one of the hearings before the board, the petitioner accepted responsibility for the objections document, and went on to explain his reason for his accusatory tone concerning some of bar counsel\u2019s proposed findings. Moreover, the over-all tenor of the document is no different from the tenor of documents he submitted to this court. As his attorney\u2019s client, he could be subject to court sanctions if he was responsible for inappropriate material being submitted to a court. See <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Steele, supra </em>at 457. The same principle applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The petitioner also argues that his statements were taken out of context by the board. We have read the petitioner\u2019s submissions in their entirety, and the argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">4. <em>Other concerns. </em>We have discussed the fact that through his submissions in the context of other legal proceedings, to the board, and to this court, the petitioner has failed to prove his fitness to practice law, by leaving us with doubts about his character. <em>Matter of Prager, supra </em>at 100. We also note that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>petitioner has displayed a tendency to mischaracterize certain matters. Rule 8.1 of the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct, 426 Mass. 1427 (1998), states: \u201cAn applicant for admission to the bar . . . shall not: (a) knowingly make a false statement of material fact; or (b) fail to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension known by the person to have arisen in the matter . . . .\u201d We cite some examples.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">a. <em>In </em>support of his motion to exclude his convictions from the board\u2019s consideration, the petitioner submitted an affidavit in which he stated: \u201cIn apparent violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u2018FERPA\u2019) of 1974, the law school felt at liberty to advise the [b]card in 1996 of the conviction. I myself had not mentioned the 1977 conviction in the \u2018Applicant\u2019s Statement to Board of Bar Examiners\u2019 form which I had completed and submitted to the [b]card in 1996.\u201d This statement, with its implicit attack on the integrity of his law school, does not tell the full story. It is true that he did not mention his convictions on the application. However, after discussing the conviction issue with an associate dean, the petitioner (then the applicant), rather than object to the dean\u2019s inclusion of this information, submitted a personal statement concerning his convictions to accompany the dean\u2019s letter to the board. Thus, the law school could not have violated his rights under FERPA, assuming such an act would constitute a violation.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Moreover, while he was in law school, the petitioner himself revealed his convictions to this court when he applied for permission to practice law in a field work class pursuant to SJ.C. Rule 3:03.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">b. The petitioner asserts in his reply brief that the board\u2019s \u201clethargy or inactivity\u201d is largely responsible for the seven years that elapsed from the time of his application for admission until the board\u2019s decision in 2003. In support of this assertion, he cites the fact that the date of his last hearing before the board was December, 2002, but the board did not issue its decision until October, 2003, despite letters from the petitioner indicating his concern over the delay. This ten-month time period is correct, but the petitioner omits two important facts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>First, the board responded to those letters, informing the petitioner that it had a voluminous record to review.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Second, much of the delay in the seven years it took to complete the proceeding is attributable to the petitioner. The petitioner and his attorney acknowledged that they were the cause of delay during one of the hearings. In fact, in 2000, the board did not receive documentation it requested. The board, in writing, apparently gave the petitioner a deadline by which the documents had to be submitted. When the petitioner failed to submit them, the board reported the petitioner as not qualified. After learning that the petitioner was out of the country, which was why he failed to respond, the board asked that the court restore his application status to active.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">c. The petitioner asserted in his affidavit that accompanied the letter from the associate dean of his law school that he was released on parole after approximately three years because of conclusive proof of his innocence.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> He also asserted this claim at one of the hearings. However, the petitioner testified that three years was part of the plea arrangement and that he took the plea based on probabilities. Moreover, a document in the record, created in 1979, shows that the petitioner was eligible for parole in December, 1980, approximately three years after his plea. There is nothing in the record discussing the reasons for granting parole to the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Viewing the petitioner\u2019s conduct as a whole, we are left with significant doubts about his character and fitness and conclude that the petitioner has failed to meet his burden to prove that he is fit to practice law. While he was in law school, he sent a threatening letter to opposing counsel in the NLRB matter. He has attacked the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, a former United States magistrate, a former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>member of the board and the board as a whole, and, indeed, this court\u2019s decision reinstating James Pool to the bar. Contrast <em>Matter of Hiss, </em>368 Mass. 447, 467 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The petitioner asserts that if he misread the requirements of <em>Matter of Prager, supra, </em>he did so in good faith and, therefore, his submissions to the board should not be held against him. This argument has no merit. He was on notice that the content of his submissions would be an issue before this court, and he could have chosen to prove the board\u2019s dissenters correct in their assessment that the two submissions he made were anomalous. Instead, he chose to make submissions that continue in the same vein. Before this court, the petitioner has stated, inter alla, without record support, that the board was trying improperly to influence the Justices; that the board\u2019s behavior should subject its members to discipline; that this court\u2019s decision in <em>Matter of Pool, </em>401 Mass. 460 (1988), was a \u201crevolving-door reinstatement\u201d; and that this court indiscriminately reappoints members of the board, essentially conferring lifetime membership on those members. The petitioner also continued an irrelevant attack on Federal officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Moreover, his penchant for hyperbolic and dramatic language about what he perceives to be misconduct by others shows a seeming lack of understanding of the seriousness of the accusations he makes. Given all of this, coupled with the petitioner\u2019s mischaracterizations of other matters, we cannot say that the petitioner has met his burden of proving that he is fit to practice law. Accordingly, we must resolve our doubts about his character \u201cin favor of protecting the public by denying admission\u201d to the petitioner.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>Matter of Prager, supra </em>at 100, quoting <em>Matter of Jaffee, </em>319 Or. 172, 177 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">The matter is remanded to the county court for entry of a judgment affirming the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-7\"> While the petitioner was in law school, he needed permission to participate in a field work class pursuant to S.J.C.

He informed the court of his convictions at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b410-8\">As discussed <em>infra, </em>the petitioner did not believe that his felony convictions would be investigated by the board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Except where relevant, we make no distinction between the specific hearings and refer to a single hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b410-10\">The petitioner and his coconspirator used fictitious names and contacted American business associates of the victim, pretending that they were interested in a legitimate business transaction with the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b411-7\">By pleading guilty, the petitioner avoided a trial whereby his coconspirator, consistent with statements he made to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I.), would likely have made allegations that the petitioner murdered the victim and dismembered his body, and that the victim\u2019s body was put in a trunk and thrown into Chesapeake Bay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b411-12\">This court has stated that letters from people who knew a person\u2019s character both before and after their wrongdoing and whose evaluations reflect that fact are most helpful. <em>Matter of Prager, </em>422 Mass. 86, 99 (1996), citing <em>Matter of Rowell, </em>305 Or. 584, 590 (1988). Although many letters written on behalf of the petitioner were from people who knew him for a long time, all but one of the letters were submitted by individuals who have known the petitioner only since his release from prison. The letter from the individual who knew him prior to his incarceration did not address the changes in the petitioner since that time. In fact, the letter does not mention the felony convictions at all. Only one witness knew the petitioner from about the time the felonies were committed. Her understanding of the felonies was based on what the petitioner told her and did not comport with what he admitted at his plea hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b412-6\">We deny the petitioner\u2019s motion to strike the votes of two board members because one attended only one of the petitioner\u2019s hearings before the board and the other did not attend any of the hearings because she was appointed to the board subsequent to the hearings. The motion, even if allowed, would not change the result. All of the board members agreed on the factual findings. Striking two votes would still leave the factual findings undisturbed. Our decision is based on the board\u2019s unanimous factual findings, other undisputed facts in the record before the board and in the petition and submissions to this court, and our review of the entire matter de nova. See <em>Wei Jia </em>v. <em>Board of Bar Examiners, </em>427 Mass. <em>777, </em>782 (1998) (\u201cWhile we grant substantial deference to . . . the board ... we have the final authority to determine who may practice law in the Commonwealth\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Because the petitioner had initiated several lawsuits in the past, the board was concerned with litigiousness. The petitioner instituted several suits concerning his conviction, including a Federal suit against the attorney who represented him during his plea and a suit against Harvard Law School. We need not disturb the board\u2019s finding that it drew no negative inferences from this litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The two submissions relied on by the board were: \u201cApplicant\u2019s Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of His Petition for Admission to the Bar\u201d (memorandum) and \u201cApplicant\u2019s Objections to Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law by Counsel to the Board of Bar Examiners\u201d (objections). The memorandum was submitted before the final hearing before the board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b412-9\">We have reviewed the record and considered the petitioner\u2019s arguments concerning the findings and conclude there is no reason to disturb them.

United States <em>vs. </em>Krohn, Crim. No. 77-162-A, Civil Action No. 81-120-A (E.D. Va. May 11, 1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b415-9\">In defending his actions, one of the petitioner\u2019s arguments is that it is a violation of his due process rights for the board to have used the documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>he submitted to it against him without warning. This argument has no merit. Due process requires that an applicant be informed of the \u201ccharges\u201d against him and provided with an opportunity to confront witnesses who supply information adverse to him. See <em>Matter of Tobin, </em>417 Mass. 92, 101 (1994); <em>In re Application of Feingold, </em>296 A.2d 492, 498 (Me. 1972), citing <em>Willner </em>v. <em>Committee on Character &amp; Fitness, </em>373 U.S. 96 (1963). In this case, the \u201ccharges\u201d were known to the petitioner: his character and fitness for admission to the bar. The petitioner\u2019s own submissions during the course of the board\u2019s investigation are not \u201ccharges\u201d against him, and therefore, no right of confrontation applies. Moreover, the petitioner\u2019s comments were solicited at the last hearing before the board and he has addressed the issues raised by the board in his petition to the single justice and in his brief to this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b417-8\">The petitioner testified that, although he learned where they came from, he had received the documents anonymously; the petitioner also testified that despite the fact that the NLRB concluded that Polaroid had a good faith basis to discharge his client, the client was wrongly accused.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b417-9\">Indeed, in his appeal to the NLRB\u2019s general counsel from the regional director\u2019s decision not to charge Polaroid with unjustly firing his client, the petitioner stated, \u201cSince her dismissal, [my client] has been unable to find permanent employment, in large part because Polaroid routinely advises her prospective employers seeking a reference that [she] is an unreliable employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>who betrayed the trust which Polaroid had placed in her by pilfering proprietary company documents.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b420-9\">The petitioner returned to this point in the postscript to his brief entitled \u201cAdditional Innermost Feelings and Personal Views.\u201d There, the petitioner accused the board of \u201creflexive bureaucratic retaliation,\u201d lacking in candor, and lacking in understanding of basic legal principles, all of which would subject its members to bar discipline.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b420-10\">Moreover, the petitioner had a similar reaction to statements made to him in 1995 by the administrative law judge who heard an NLRB matter concerning Polaroid (the petitioner, who at that time was in law school, represented a Polaroid employee).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">At one point in the proceeding, the judge was trying to deal with the question whether a stipulation was factually correct. Although the judge clearly stated six times that he later would allow the petitioner to state his views, the petitioner kept insisting that he be heard. The judge twice stated that he would allow the petitioner to \u201csound off.\u201d When the petitioner brought these words to the judge\u2019s attention, the judge apologized. Nevertheless, in two documents he submitted subsequently during the NLRB process, the petitioner returned to the \u201csound off\u201d comment. In one document he stated that the judge, \u201c(much to the delight of the Respondent\u2019s three attorneys) despectively characterized as \u2018sounding off\u2019 the [the petitioner\u2019s] prospective efforts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The convictions were brought to the attention of the board by a letter from an associate dean of the petitioner\u2019s law school and through the petitioner\u2019s personal statement submitted therewith. In 1996, the law school certificate confirming that an applicant was graduated from the law school required the law school to submit any information that was adverse as to an applicant\u2019s moral character or fitness to practice law. The board is required to consider all matters that are material to a person\u2019s good moral character. See S.J.C. Rule 3:01, \u00a7 5.1, as appearing in 411 Mass. 1321 (1992). See also <em>Matter of Prager, </em>422 Mass. 86, 101 (1996). Moreover, S.J.C. Rule 3:01, \u00a7 4.1, as amended, 397 Mass. 1212 (1986), requires the board publicly to publish the names of applicants so that objections can be made. Thus, the petitioner\u2019s argument that the board\u2019s consideration of his felonies was improper and discriminatory because a question on his application form only inquired about felonies no older than seven years is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b421-7\">The petitioner told Pool that he had safe deposit boxes that contained cash, a gun, and false identifications. The only available keys were in the possession of the F.B.I. Unbeknownst to the petitioner, Pool entered into an agreement with the assistant United States attorney to provide Pool with keys to the petitioner\u2019s safe deposit boxes so that Pool could retrieve money for the petitioner\u2019s defense, in exchange for the government\u2019s learning the location of the boxes and the aliases under which they were listed. <em>Matter of Pool, </em>401 Mass. 460, 461-462 (1988). \u201c[Bjased on an affidavit that was at best obscure as to the source of the information, the F.B.I. obtained a search warrant\u201d and gained access to the boxes and their contents. <em>Matter of Pool, 4 </em>Mass.

[and] foster[s] within the board the development of a laxity as that which the [b]card has exhibited in the instant matter.\u201d See note 17, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b423-7\">As evidence, the petitioner quoted the following exchange at his hearing:</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">Board member Richmond: \u201cWhat did the appeals court say?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>The petitioner: \u201cWell, it\u2019s interesting I have to . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Board member Muldoon: \u201cExcuse me. Did they affirm or?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">The petitioner: \u201cThey affirmed but. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">Board member Muldoon: \u201cPlease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">Chairman Barshak: \u201cWe can read the opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">Board member Muldoon: \u201cPlease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-14\">The petitioner: \u201cAll right, all right.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b425-8\">The petitioner again raised the \u201chubristic\u201d comment in his reply brief, when he was responding to the board\u2019s argument that the petitioner\u2019s due process argument was premised on the assumption that he should have been warned not to submit improper memoranda. The petitioner spent over two pages arguing that this was a material misrepresentation of his due process claims and called for sanctions lest \u201clesser attorneys, future applicants and the public . . . reasonably draw [a] . . . cynical conclusion.\u201d He then added a footnote that stated, in part: \u201cApplicant hopes that the Court not find applicant to have exhibited \u2018uncomely hubris\u2019 . . . unbefitting his lowly station by venturing herein to comment with all sincerity upon the troubling incongruity of the presence in the Board\u2019s brief of a gross misrepresentation to applicant\u2019s detriment \u2014 not very dissimilar to those repeatedly made by counsel to the Board in their submission to the Board . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b425-9\">The petitioner articulated a similar theme while he was still serving his sentence. He argued, in an affidavit he submitted in support of his motion for relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, that one of the reasons he pleaded guilty was because, if he went to trial, was convicted and appealed, he believed that his appeal would not get a fair hearing before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. He also asserted that there was a \u201ccozy relationship\u201d between the law clerks of the justices on the panel and the prosecutors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b427-6\">In his submission to the single justice, the petitioner spends much time arguing that his statements about bar counsel were fully warranted by the record. In his reply brief, he states that the board misapprehended his reasons for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>attacking bar counsel, stating that he simply was trying to acquaint the court with his innermost feelings and thoughts concerning morality as required by <em>Matter of Prager, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b428-9\">In his brief, the petitioner states that he did inject his personal views into the documents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Btis attorney submitted an affidavit that contends that while the petitioner \u201cprimarily researched and originally drafted\u201d the two documents, she meticulously edited them, and they should be viewed as a \u201ccollaborative\u201d effort no more attributable to the petitioner than to her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b429-7\">As discussed, see note 19, <em>supra, </em>the law school was required to disclose to the board any adverse information affecting the petitioner\u2019s ability to practice law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The board stated that it reviewed over 2,000 pages. Indeed, the documents submitted to this court comprise over 4,000 pages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b430-8\">The petitioner wrote in his affidavit: \u201cBased upon [Immigration and Naturalization Service] records, the U.S. Parole Commission released me from prison at the earliest possible date lawfully consistent with my sentence and, in so doing, by necessary implication accepted my claims to it that I had been unjustly convicted. Otherwise, according to the Parole Guidelines then in force, I would have been required to serve the entirety of my sentence which, with allowance for \u2018good time,\u2019 would have amounted to two-thirds of the sentence rather than the one-third which I actually served.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b431-9\">We also deny the petitioner\u2019s request for a refund of the costs of filing this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
