In particular, the Commonwealth points to a series of telephone calls made by the defendant Jermaine Edwards to Crockett while Edwards was incarcerated at the Suffolk County house of correction at South Bay, and just prior to two scheduled trial dates, in which the two can be heard orchestrating Crockett\u2019s leaving the jurisdiction. Crockett ultimately did appear in court, but refused to testify. We follow Federal and State courts that have considered the issue and adopt the \u201cforfeiture by wrongdoing\u201d doctrine whereby a defendant is deemed to have lost the right to object (on both confrontation and hearsay grounds) to the admission of the out-of-court statements of a witness whose unavail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>ability the defendant has played a meaningful role in procuring.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that this case must be remanded to the Superior Court for a determination whether, under the doctrine as we adopt it, Edwards forfeited his right to object on confrontation and hearsay grounds to the admission for substantive purposes of Crockett\u2019s grand jury testimony. As the Commonwealth has adduced no evidence to support its contention that the remaining two defendants were involved in the alleged procurement of Crockett\u2019s unavailability, we affirm the motion judge\u2019s denial of the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to introduce Crockett\u2019s testimony against those defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\"><em>Background. </em>We summarize the facts and procedural history, but reserve for later discussion the details relevant to procuring the witness\u2019s unavailability. The parties have stipulated to the following facts, although the defendants make no admission as to their truth and reserve the right to contest them at trial. Because the procedural history plays an important role in our decision, we set it forth in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The charges against the defendants stem from the July 3, 2001, shooting of Yves Andre, a taxicab driver, in the Hyde Park section of Boston. The victim told Boston police officers that he had been shot by a young black male, approximately seventeen years of age, whom he had picked up in his taxicab along with two other young black males. As a result of the shooting, the victim is paralyzed from the waist down.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">In September, 2001, a Suffolk County grand jury indicted Jermaine Edwards, Eric Davis, and Tyrone Brown in connection with the shooting. Edwards was charged with armed assault with intent to murder (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18 [&gt;]); assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>unlawful possession of a firearm (G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 [a]); unlawful possession of ammunition (G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 [A]); and peijury (G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 1). Eric Davis was charged with assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon; suborning peijury (G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 3); perjury; and being an accessory after the fact (G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 4). Tyrone Brown was charged with assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon; peijury; and accessory after the fact.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Jeremy Crockett testified on three occasions before the grand jury (August, 2, 8, and 9, 2001), each time elaborating on and amending his earlier testimony concerning the events of July 3, 2001. The three defendants spent the night at Crockett\u2019s home on the evening of July 3, 2001, and Crockett testified about his conversations with, and observations of, the defendants on that date. His testimony incriminated all three. For example, Crockett testified that one of the defendants, on arriving at his home, told him, \u201cCobby dude just got shot,\u201d and that the defendants searched for a gun that Edwards had hidden on a pathway. Crockett was, and remains, the Commonwealth\u2019s key witness. Without his testimony, the Commonwealth acknowledges that it has insufficient evidence to pursue any of the nonperjury charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The trial was initially scheduled for June 10, 2003, and the Commonwealth expected that Crockett would testify against the defendants. The trial did not go forward on that date, and on June 21, 2003, Crockett first informed the prosecution that he did not want to testify and would prefer to serve a sentence for contempt of court. Crockett then failed to appear for several trial dates, including one scheduled for December 8, 2003. On December 12, 2003, Crockett was taken into custody by Boston police on a copias. Although granted immunity, after the appropriate hearing, Crockett persisted in his refusal to testify at the defendants\u2019 scheduled trial and, on April 12, 2004, was found in contempt of court in violation of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20H, and sentenced to 365 days in the house of correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The defendants\u2019 trial was eventually rescheduled for June, 2004. Prior to commencement of trial, the Commonwealth filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>a motion in limine to admit Crockett\u2019s grand jury testimony as substantive evidence on the ground that the defendants wrongfully procured his unavailability (refusal to testify) through collusion with the witness, and thus waived their confrontation rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Edwards filed a motion in limine to preclude the introduction of Crockett\u2019s grand jury testimony as substantive evidence on the grounds that the testimony was inadmissible hearsay, and that the Commonwealth presented no proof that Crockett\u2019s refusal to testify was \u201cat the instruction of ... or based upon fear of Mr. Edwards, or that his refusal was grounded in intimidation\u201d or \u201ccoercion],\u201d rather than \u201cthe result of [Crockett\u2019s] own free will.\u201d Brown filed a motion in limine to prohibit the Commonwealth from introducing \u201cany evidence at all that any of its witnesses, especially Jeremy Crockett, was either threatened or induced by a person [other than Brown] . . . not to testify in this matter.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the alternative, Brown moved for severance from his codefendants. Davis has not filed a motion in limine on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">A Superior Court judge held a hearing on the motions in limine at which no testimony was presented and no exhibits were marked as evidence. As its primary indication of collusion, the Commonwealth relied on its representation of the contents of several recorded telephone conversations, initiated by Edwards while he was incarcerated and made just prior to two scheduled trial dates (those on June 10, 2003, and December 8, 2003), in which Edwards allegedly conspired with Crockett and others to procure Crockett\u2019s unavailability for trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Commonwealth offered to play the recordings for the judge, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>he declined the offer. Relying on the Commonwealth\u2019s proffer,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and issuing his findings and rulings from the bench, the judge denied the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to admit Crockett\u2019s grand jury testimony as substantive evidence against any of the defendants. The judge allowed Edwards\u2019s motion to preclude the admission of the testimony and Brown\u2019s motion to prohibit the introduction of evidence of threats or inducements.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He apparently did accept the premise that a defendant who procures a witness\u2019s unavailability cannot object on confrontation or hearsay grounds to the admission of the out-of-court statements of that witness. To trigger such forfeiture, he stated, however, that the Commonwealth must \u201cshow that the defendants] participated in [Crockett\u2019s] absence in a significant way.\u201d The judge found that the telephone conversations \u201cat best show that [Crockett] on his own had decided that he wasn\u2019t going to testify,\u201d and that \u201cthere\u2019s no showing that any of the defendants participated in encouraging or threatening with regard to [Crockett\u2019s] refusal to testify.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The Commonwealth petitioned a single justice of this court seeking relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, from the judge\u2019s order denying its motion, or in the alternative leave to appeal under Mass. R. Crim. R 15, as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996). The Commonwealth also requested a stay of the trial proceedings pending review. The single justice ordered the trial stayed and reserved and reported the matter to the full bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>The defendants assert that the judge properly denied the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to admit Crockett\u2019s grand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>jury testimony for substantive purposes because it consists of inadmissible hearsay and its use at trial would violate the defendants\u2019 confrontation rights. Without question, Crockett\u2019s grand jury testimony consists of hearsay, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silanskas, </em>433 Mass. 678, 693 (2001), and we shall assume it is not admissible under any exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth v. Rice, </em>441 Mass. 291, 305 (2004) (to be admissible, hearsay generally must fall within exception to hearsay rule). The confrontation clauses of our Federal and State Constitutions pose another potential obstacle to the admission of Crockett\u2019s grand jury testimony. Under the Sixth Amendment and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, a defendant has the right to confront the witnesses against him. The United States Supreme Court, in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36 (2004), held that, with respect to testimonial evidence such as the grand jury testimony at issue here, the confrontation clause requires both \u201ctmavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68. The defendants here have had no prior opportunity to cross-examine Crockett.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Notwithstanding these potential barriers to its admission, the Commonwealth urges this court to admit the testimony by adopting the doctrine of \u201cforfeiture by wrongdoing.\u201d Whether to adopt the \u201cforfeiture by wrongdoing\u201d doctrine is a question of law, which we review de nova. See, e.g., <em>State v. Hallum, </em>606 N.W.2d 351, 354 (Iowa 2000). See also <em>Commonwealth v. Vuthy Seng, </em>436 Mass. 537, 543, cert. denied, 537 U.S. 942 (2002) (adequacy of Miranda warnings is question of law reviewed de nova); <em>Commonwealth v. Miller, </em>366 Mass. 387, 389 (1974) (independently reviewing judge\u2019s conclusion of law). Noting the broad embrace of the doctrine by Federal and State courts nationwide, and recognizing the compelling public policy interests behind its enactment, we adopt the doctrine in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>the Commonwealth. We then consider its proper scope. Finally, we endeavor to review the motion judge\u2019s findings and rulings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">1. <em>Adopting the doctrine of \u201cforfeiture by wrongdoing.\u201d </em>The United States Supreme Court first applied the doctrine of \u201cforfeiture\u201d or \u201cwaiver\u201d by wrongdoing in <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>United States, </em>98 U.S. 145, 158 (1878):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">\u201cThe Constitution does not guarantee an accused person against the legitimate consequences of his own wrongful acts. . . . [I]f [a defendant] voluntarily keeps the witnesses away, he cannot insist on his [Sixth Amendment] privilege. If, therefore, when absent by his procurement, their evidence is supplied in some lawful way, he is in no condition to assert that his constitutional rights have been violated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The Supreme Court has recently affirmed the doctrine\u2019s validity in <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, supra </em>at 62 (\u201cthe rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing [which we accept] extinguishes confrontation claims on essentially equitable grounds\u201d). Beginning in the 1970\u2019s, several United States Courts of Appeals followed the <em>Reynolds </em>lead and adopted the forfeiture doctrine. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rouco, </em>765 F.2d 983, 995 (11th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1124 (1986); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Potamitis, </em>739 F.2d 784, 788 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Argitakos </em>v. <em>United States, </em>469 U.S. 918, and cert. denied, 469 U.S. 934 (1984); <em>Steele </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>684 F.2d 1193, 1201 (6th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1053 (1983); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thevis, </em>665 F.2d 616, 630 (5th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Evans </em>v. <em>United States, </em>456 U.S. 1008, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Hood </em>v. <em>United States, </em>458 U.S. 1109, and cert. denied, 459 U.S. 825 (1982); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Balano, </em>618 F.2d 624, 629 (10th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 840 (1980); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carlson, </em>547 F.2d 1346 (8th Cir. 1976), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Hofstad </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number><em>United States, </em>431 U.S. 914 (1977). In 1997, the forfeiture by wrongdoing rule was codified in the Federal Rules of Evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule. See Fed. R. Evid. 804 (b) (6).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Some version of the doctrine has likewise been adopted in at least fourteen States and the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Several other State courts, while not having applied the doctrine in any case, have recognized its legitimacy.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> While States vary with respect to the scope of the doctrine,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we are aware of no jurisdiction that, after considering the doctrine, has rejected it.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">In addition to the widespread support it enjoys, the forfeiture rule furthers important public and jurisprudential interests. \u201cThe rule has its foundation in the maxim that no one shall be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong . . . .\u201d <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 159. See <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, supra </em>at 62 (recognizing \u201cforfeiture by wrongdoing\u201d doctrine based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>on \u201cessentially equitable grounds\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carlson, supra </em>at 1359 (\u201cThe Sixth Amendment does not stand as a shield to protect the accused from his own misconduct or chicanery\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Houlihan, </em>92 F.3d 1271, 1282-1283 (1st Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1118 (1997) (doctrine \u201censure[s] that a wrongdoer does not profit in a court of law by reason of his miscreancy\u201d). \u201cThe rule ... is [also] based on a public policy protecting the integrity of the adversary process by deterring litigants from acting on strong incentives to prevent the testimony of an adverse witness.\u201d <em>Steele </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra </em>at 1202. Additionally, the doctrine furthers the truth-seeking function of the adversary process, allowing fact finders access to valuable evidence no longer available through live testimony. See <em>Alberts </em>v. <em>Devine, </em>395 Mass. 59, 67, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Alberts, </em>474 U.S. 1013 (1985) (\u201csociety is entitled to every person\u2019s evidence in order that the truth may be discovered\u201d). Moreover, by discouraging untoward behavior toward witnesses by defendants, it serves to protect witnesses from intimidation, pressure, threats, and even physical harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">The forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine is also consistent with Massachusetts law. We have already recognized that the right to cross-examine adverse witnesses under art. 12 is not absolute, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>424 Mass. 618, 633 (1997), and may be lost by misconduct. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flemmi, </em>360 Mass. 693, 694 (1971), quoting <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337, 342-343 (1970). Moreover, we have long recognized in other contexts the equitable principle, at the heart of the forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine, that a party may not gain advantage from his own wrong. See, e.g., <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>203 Mass. 556, 565 (1909) (\u201cThe law will not allow a man to profit by his own wrongdoing\u201d); <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>146 Mass. 89, 97 (1888), <em>S.C., </em>150 Mass. 411 (1890) (noting \u201cnumerous cases in which it is held that one shall not be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong\u201d). Also instructive, we have applied the \u201ccurative admissibility doctrine,\u201d where a party is estopped from objecting to hearsay admitted to rebut incompetent evidence where the original evidence (offered by the objecting party) created significant prejudice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruffen, </em>399 Mass. 811, 813-814 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>Despite the abundant support for its adoption, Davis urges us not to recognize the forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine, claiming that art. 12 extends greater protections than the Sixth Amendment. Davis points to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, supra </em>at 631, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bergstrom, </em>402 Mass. 534, 541-542 (1988), for this proposition. While both cases recognize potentially broader protections under art. 12 than the Sixth Amendment, those cases \u201cinvolved the physical configuration of the courtroom and the defendant\u2019s ability literally \u2018to meet\u2019 testifying witnesses \u2018face to face\u2019 as required by the plain language of art. 12\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whel-ton, </em>428 Mass. 24, 28 (1998). \u201cIn cases involving the hearsay rule and its exceptions, we have stated that art. 12 provides no greater protection than the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the context of the present controversy, art. 12 should be viewed coexten-sively with the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Given the overwhelming precedential and policy support for its adoption, we recognize the \u201cforfeiture by wrongdoing\u201d doctrine in the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">2. <em>Scope of the doctrine, </em>a. <em>Edwards\u2019s conduct. </em>The doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing, based on equitable considerations, contemplates some wrongful act on the part of the defendant. See <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 159 (because rule is based on \u201cmaxim that no one shall be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong ... if there has not been, in legal contemplation, a wrong committed, the way has not been opened for the introduction of the testimony\u201d). The Commonwealth argues that \u201ccollusion\u201d with a witness to procure the witness\u2019s unavailability constitutes a wrongdoing. In particular, the Commonwealth claims that a joint plan between a defendant and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>witness to remove the witness from the jurisdiction in order to avoid testimony is sufficient to trigger forfeiture. Edwards, on the other hand, contends that there is no support in the case law of other jurisdictions for the proposition that \u201ccollusion\u201d \u2014 i.e., an agreement or conspiracy \u2014 is a wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Without question, the doctrine should apply in cases where a defendant murders,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> threatens,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> or intimidates<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> a witness in an effort to procure that witness\u2019s unavailability. Similarly, forfeiture will be triggered where a defendant commits a criminal act, such as a violation of our witness tampering statute, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> in order to procure the witness\u2019s unavailability. While no court has expressly applied the doctrine to \u201ccollusion,\u201d no court has rejected such a broad application either. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ochoa, </em>229 F.3d 631, 639 n.3 (7th Cir. 2000) (not reaching issue whether \u201cknowingly aiding a witness in becoming unavailable\u201d is enough to waive confrontation rights under Fed. R. Evid. 804 [b] [6], but noting that \u201cno case has refused to apply the [r]ule to such circumstances\u201d and that criminal conduct is not required for forfeiture).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The doctrine has been applied to a wider range of actions by defendants that have contributed to witness unavailability, including those that, while not expressly labeled as such, may be considered \u201ccollusion.\u201d For example, the Supreme Court, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number><em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 159-160, applied the doctrine where a defendant refused to reveal the location of his wife, a witness, to the authorities so that she could be served with a subpoena. The Court inferred that the defendant had been \u201cinstrumental in concealing or keeping the witness away\u201d from his refusal to disclose her location and the fact that the defendant did not otherwise account for his wife\u2019s absence. <em>Id. </em>at 160. The Court cited no evidence of intimidation, bribery, threats, criminal activity, or harm to the wife. Also instructive, the Supreme Court of Iowa, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hallum, </em>606 N.W.2d 351 (Iowa 2000), applied the doctrine where a defendant wrote letters encouraging the witness, his half-brother, to \u201chang in there\u201d and telling him not to discuss the case over the telephones. <em>Id. </em>at 356-357. The court found that the defendant had procured his brother\u2019s unavailability \u201cby encouraging and influencing\u201d him not to testify. <em>Id. </em>at 358. The <em>Hallum </em>court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">\u201cThe broad scope of conduct that may give rise to a forfeiture is consistent with the philosophy underlying the forfeiture rule: . . . \u2018[T]he disclosure of relevant information at a public trial is a paramount interest, and any significant interference with that interest, other than by exercising a legal right to object at the trial itself, is a wrongful act.\u2019 . . . Thus, it is the fact that a defendant\u2019s conduct interferes with the interest in having witnesses testify at a public trial that makes the defendant\u2019s conduct wrongful.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 356, quoting <em>Steele </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>684 F.2d 1193, 1201 (6th Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">As quoted above, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in <em>Steele </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra, </em>defined a \u201cwrongful act\u201d as \u201cany significant interference\u201d with the interest in \u201cthe disclosure of relevant information at a public trial.\u201d In that case, the witness was living with one of the coconspirators, had a child with him, and her lawyer was paid by him. The court determined that the coconspirator had exerted \u201cinfluence and control\u201d over the witness and \u201cinduce[dj her not to testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1198, 1203. Finally, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Pappalardo, </em>152 Misc. 2d 364, 369 (N.Y. 1991), the court found a waiver based on a \u201cjoint plan\u201d to prevent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>the witness\u2019s testimony. The court found that \u201cthe defendant and this witness were involved in planning and preparing strategies to enable [the witness] to avoid testifying,\u201d and that the \u201cdefendant was and is extensively involved\u201d in the witness\u2019s refusal to testify. <em>Id. </em>at 371. The court crafted a broad test for the doctrine, holding that a defendant waives confrontation and hearsay objections by wrongdoing if \u201cthe defendant is involved in this unlawful refusal to testify through \u2018knowledge, complicity, planning or in any other way.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366, quoting <em>Holtzman </em>v. <em>Hellenbrand, </em>92 A.D.2d 405, 414 (N.Y. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Other courts, while not yet applying the forfeiture doctrine to cases involving a defendant\u2019s collusion with a witness to plan the witness\u2019s unavailability, have articulated very broad tests for the doctrine\u2019s application that, by their terms, would appear to include such collusion. For example, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit required the prosecution to show \u201c(1) the defendant . . . was involved in, or responsible for, procuring the unavailability of the declarant \u2018through knowledge, complicity, planning or in any other way,\u2019 . . . ; and (2) the defendant. . . acted with the intent of procuring the declarant\u2019s unavailability as an actual or potential witness.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dhinsa, </em>243 F.3d 635, 653-654 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 897 (2001), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>116 F.3d 641, 668 (2d Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 524 U.S. 905 (1998). See <em>People </em>v. <em>Pappalardo, supra. </em>See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cherry, </em>217 F.3d 811, 820 (10th Cir. 2000) (defendant waives confrontation and hearsay objections where, in part, \u201che or she participated directly in planning or procuring the declarant\u2019s unavailability through wrongdoing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The public policy interests underlying the doctrine are best served by applying the doctrine to cases in which a defendant colludes with a witness to procure that witness\u2019s unavailability. A defendant should no more be able to benefit from wrongful collusion with a witness than from threats or worse. Moreover, direct evidence of witness intimidation is rare. What may appear as an \u201cagreement\u201d by a witness not to testify, or a witness\u2019s independent \u201cdecision\u201d to avoid testifying, in fact may be a product of coercion, pressure, or threats. Thus, evidence that a witness agreed to a plan to ensure the witness\u2019s unavailability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>(i.e., there was \u201ccollusion\u201d rather than \u201ccoercion\u201d) should not shield a defendant from that witness\u2019s testimony where the defendant was involved in the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">We hold that a defendant forfeits, by virtue of wrongdoing, the right to object to the admission of an unavailable witness\u2019s out-of-court statements on both confrontation and hearsay grounds on findings that (1) the witness is unavailable; (2) the defendant was involved in, or responsible for, procuring the unavailability of the witness; and (3) the defendant acted with the intent to procure the witness\u2019s unavailability. A defendant\u2019s involvement in procuring a witness\u2019s unavailability need not consist of a criminal act, and may include a defendant\u2019s collusion with a witness to ensure that the witness will not be heard at trial.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">While this test should be sufficient in most instances to resolve the issue whether a defendant procured the unavailability of a witness, the facts of the instant cases, complicated as they are, convince us of the need to provide some additional guidance regarding the scope of the forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine, particularly as it applies to collusion. A finding that a defendant somehow influenced a witness\u2019s decision not to testify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>is not required to trigger the application of the forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine where there is collusion in implementing that decision or planning for its implementation. Certainly, a defendant must have contributed to the witness\u2019s unavailability in some significant manner. However, the causal link necessary between a defendant\u2019s actions and a witness\u2019s unavailability may be established where (1) a defendant puts forward to a witness the idea to avoid testifying, either by threats, coercion, persuasion, or pressure<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>; (2) a defendant physically prevents a witness from testifying; or (3) a defendant actively facilitates the carrying out of the witness\u2019s independent intent not to testify. Therefore, in collusion cases (the third category above) a defendant\u2019s joint effort with a witness to secure the latter\u2019s unavailability, regardless of whether the witness already decided \u201con his own\u201d not to testify, may be sufficient to support a finding of forfeiture by wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Furthermore, that a defendant and a witness are ultimately unable to carry out their plan to engineer the witness\u2019s unavailability through the precise method intended does not necessarily preclude a finding of forfeiture in collusion cases. Where a defendant\u2019s goal in colluding with a witness is to deprive the Commonwealth of valuable testimony, the defendant may be no less successful where the desired result is achieved by means other than those originally contemplated (such as a witness\u2019s refusal to testify). As noted above, there must be some causal connection between the defendant\u2019s actions and the witness\u2019s ultimate unavailability. The method by which the witness becomes unavailable must, at the very least, be a logical outgrowth or foreseeable result of the collusion. Thus, where the defendant has had a meaningful impact on the witness\u2019s unavailability, the defendant may have forfeited confrontation and hearsay objections to the witness\u2019s out-of-court statements, even where the witness modified the initial strategy to procure the witness\u2019s silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Finally, a defendant\u2019s intentional procurement of a witness\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>unavailability through collusion will constitute a per se wrongdoing sufficient to trigger the doctrine, even if the collusion is carried out through lawful means. As an initial matter, collusion with a witness implies some degree of improper or untoward interference with official process. More importantly, any action on the part of a defendant that satisfies all elements of the doctrine as set forth above will most certainly be sufficiently \u201cwrongful\u201d to justify forfeiture. \u201c[I]t is the fact that a defendant\u2019s conduct interferes with the interest in having witnesses testify at a public trial that makes a defendant\u2019s conduct wrongful!;] the nature of the defendant\u2019s conduct is not as important as the effect of that conduct on the witness\u2019s willingness to testify.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hallum, </em>606 N.W.2d 351, 356 (Iowa 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Edwards points to the case of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>284 F.3d 758, 763-764 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1031 (2002), in support of his argument that a defendant must commit a wrongdoing independent of the procurement of the witness\u2019s unavailability to fall within the doctrine\u2019s reach. However, the <em>Scott </em>court, in requiring an independent wrongdoing, was interpreting Fed. R. Evid. 804 (b) (6), which expressly requires that a party have \u201cengaged or acquiesced <em>in wrongdoing </em>that was intended to, and did, procure the unavailability of the declarant\u201d (emphasis added). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>284 F3d at 762. Even if the <em>Scott </em>court is correct in its interpretation of the Federal rule, a matter we need not visit, we are not bound by that interpretation. The forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine, as we have articulated it above, contains no independent \u201cwrongdoing\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">b. <em>Standard of proof. </em>We now determine the standard required to prove forfeiture under the doctrine articulated above. We, like virtually all of the jurisdictions that have considered the issue, hold that the prosecution must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant procured the witness\u2019s unavailability. A majority of United States Courts of Appeals have applied the preponderance standard,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and Fed. R. Evid. 804 (b) (6) adopts that standard. See advisory committee note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>to Fed. R. Evid. 804 (b) (6). A majority of those States that have ruled on the standard of proof have similarly applied the preponderance standard.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The preponderance standard is also consistent with our own case law While the Commonwealth must prove all the essential \u00e9lements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt, see <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364 (1970), preliminary questions of fact and subsidiary facts need only be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>432 Mass. 124, <em>127 </em>n.4 (2000). Moreover, the admission of statements through the forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine is functionally equivalent to the rule regarding the admission of coconspirator and joint venturer statements. We admit for substantive purposes certain out-of-court statements made by one joint venturer or coconspirator against another on a showing by a preponderance of the evidence that there existed a joint venture or coconspiracy between them.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>431 Mass. 241, 246 (2000) (applying preponderance standard to coconspirator statements); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>430 Mass. 838, 844 (2000) (applying preponderance standard to joint venturer statements).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">The defendants cite the cases of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>792 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>F.2d 441 (4th Cir. 1986), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Eury </em>v. <em>United States, </em>479 U.S. 1037 (1987); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mastrangelo, su</em>pra; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thevis, </em>665 F.2d 616, 631 (5th Cir. 1982); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Houlihan, </em>887 F. Supp. 352, 360 (D. Mass. 1995); and People v. Geraci, 85 N.Y.2d 359, 367 (1995), in support of the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard. Two of these cases have been superseded in their endorsement of the clear and convincing standard. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Zlatogur, </em>271 F.3d 1025, 1028 (11th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 946 (2002) (rejecting <em>Thevis </em>standard because Fed. R. Evid. 804 [b] [6] adopted preponderance standard subsequent to <em>Thevis </em>decision); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Houlihan, </em>92 F.3d 1271, 1280 (1st Cir. 1996) (adopting preponderance standard). Contrary to the defendants\u2019 contentions, two of the remaining cases do not adopt the clear and convincing standard. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, supra </em>at 442 (not deciding standard required); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mastrangelo, supra </em>at 273-274 (advocating preponderance standard). Only the <em>Geraci </em>case can be relied on for support of the clear and convincing standard. The court justified the imposition of the higher burden of proof mainly on what it viewed as the \u201cgreat[cr] degree of accuracy\u201d it provides. <em>People </em>v. <em>Geraci, supra </em>at 368. We decline to follow New York\u2019s conclusion because \u201ca higher standard of proof under the forfeiture doctrine would not actually separate out the more from the less reliable hearsay and admit only the former (it would simply reduce the scope of the doctrine\u2019s application).\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>White, </em>116 F.3d 903, 912 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 960 (1997). Furthermore, the higher burden of proof \u201cmight encourage behavior which strikes at the heart of the system of justice itself.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mastrangelo, supra </em>at 273. See <em>Devonshire </em>v. <em>United States, </em>691 A.2d 165, 169 (D.C.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Vines </em>v. <em>United States, </em>520 U.S. 1247 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">c. <em>Evidentiary hearing. </em>Jurisdictions differ on whether a judge must hold an evidentiary hearing prior to making a determination that a defendant has forfeited the right to object to the introduction of the out-of-court statements of an unavailable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>witness.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We are of the view that, prior to a determination of forfeiture, the parties should be given an opportunity to present evidence, including live testimony, at an evidentiary hearing outside the jury\u2019s presence. We note that the hearing is not intended to be a mini-trial, and accordingly, hearsay evidence, including the unavailable witness\u2019s out-of-court statements, may be considered. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mastrangelo, supra </em>at 273 (requiring evidentiary hearing prior to waiver determination in which exclusionary rules, other than privileges, do not apply). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fletcher, 52 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 166, 168 n.2 (2001) (hearsay may be considered at suppression hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">3. <em>Application of doctrine to Edwards. </em>The Commonwealth has alleged conduct (collusion) that, as a matter of law, could be sufficient to support a finding of forfeiture by wrongdoing against Edwards. We now consider whether, applying the facts of this case to the forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine as we have articulated it above, the judge was correct in concluding that Edwards, by virtue of his alleged collusion with Crockett, did not forfeit his right to object to the introduction for substantive purposes of the grand jury testimony. A judge\u2019s findings of fact are generally accorded deference, and we review them for clear error. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vuthy Seng, </em>436 Mass. 537, 543 (2002), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mello, </em>420 Mass. 375, 381 n.8 (1995) (on review of motion to suppress, \u201cwe do not disturb the judge\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous\u201d). In the instant case, however, the judge and the parties were operating without any guidance regarding whether or to what extent this court would adopt the forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine. It is not surprising, therefore, that the judge\u2019s findings provide an insufficient basis for appellate review of his denial of the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to admit Crockett\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>against Edwards. As noted above, the judge appeared to adopt the doctrine of forfeiture by wrongdoing. Lacking appellate guidance, however, he did not identify with precision the test he applied to determine whether there was to be forfeiture in this case. He required proof that \u201cthe defendant participated in [Crockett\u2019s] absence in a significant way,\u201d but it is unclear whether he accepted collusion as a possible basis for forfeiture. Moreover, we cannot discern the standard of proof against which the judge weighed the proffered evidence. A further difficulty is that the judge did not conduct an evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Finally, the judge declined the Commonwealth\u2019s offer to play portions of the recorded telephone conversations during the hearing, accepting for the purpose of the motion the Commonwealth\u2019s representations as to their content.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Having listened to the recordings in full, we are of the opinion that they provide significant additional insight and evidence relevant to the application of the forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine to these cases, and that their full import cannot be gleaned from the Commonwealth\u2019s summary of those calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Given these deficiencies in the record, we can neither accept nor reject the judge\u2019s findings of fact with respect to Edwards. We cannot determine whether those findings are supported by the record or whether, instead, a determination of forfeiture by wrongdoing is required against Edwards. Now that we have adopted the forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine and clarified its scope, including the procedural requirement that a ruling on forfeiture be preceded by an evidentiary hearing, this case must be remanded to the Superior Court for an evidentiary hearing on the issue whether defendant Edwards, by virtue of his alleged collusion with Crockett, forfeited his right to object to the substantive admission of Crockett\u2019s grand jury testimony on both confrontation and hearsay grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>4. <em>Application of doctrine to Davis and Brown. </em>The Commonwealth\u2019s case with respect to Davis and Brown stands on wholly different footing. The judge found that there was no evidence that Davis or Brown participated in procuring Crockett\u2019s unavailability. The Commonwealth asserts that the codefendants \u201cengaged in a coordinated pattern of conduct designed to evade criminal punishment.\u201d According to the Commonwealth\u2019s theory, Davis and Brown forfeited their rights because Edwards\u2019s conduct in procuring Crockett\u2019s unavailability was \u201ca continuation of\u201d and \u201cin furtherance\u201d of a joint effort or conspiracy by all three defendants to cover up their participation in the crime and avoid conviction, and it was \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d as a consequence of the ongoing conspiracy. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>286 F.3d 950, 965 (7th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1134 (2003); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cherry, </em>217 F.3d 811, 820 (10th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Regardless whether the forfeiture by wrongdoing doctrine would apply in this jurisdiction to coconspirators to the procurement of a witness\u2019s unavailability, as in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cherry, supra, </em>the doctrine cannot be applied to Davis and Brown in the circumstances of this case. Because the Commonwealth has not even alleged facts (before the motion judge or this court) sufficient to support a conclusion of forfeiture by Davis or Brown, we need not remand the case for further proceedings on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">We note at the outset that the Commonwealth did not charge any of the defendants with conspiracy and that the only charges based on a joint venture theory, assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, were dismissed against Davis and Brown. The Commonwealth has alleged no evidence of any \u201cconspiracy\u201d or \u201cjoint effort\u201d among the defendants to secure Crockett\u2019s unavailability. Edwards\u2019s alleged procurement of Crockett\u2019s unavailability did not begin, according to the Commonwealth, until after Edwards was in custody, and the Commonwealth does not claim any contact between Edwards and the other codefendants after this point (other than pointing to a vague reference in one of Edwards\u2019s recorded telephone calls to a letter [\u201ckite\u201d] sent to Davis [\u201cE\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">The evidence presented by the Commonwealth with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>to Davis and Brown concerns primarily the alleged actions of the three defendants in the immediate aftermath of the crime. At best, these allegations speak to some earlier conspiracy or joint venture to cover up the shooting, a concerted effort that had long since ended by the time of Edwards\u2019s alleged collusion with Crockett. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>397 Mass. 65, 71 (1986) (statement of alleged joint venturer made while participants in custody not admissible because any joint venture considered over); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dahlstrom, </em>345 Mass. 130, 134 (1962) (declarations of joint venturer made six days after crime did not occur during pendency of joint undertaking and thus not competent against defendant); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mannos, </em>311 Mass. 94, 105-106 (1942) (conspiracy ends when its object has been accomplished or frustrated). See also <em>Grunewald </em>v. <em>United States, </em>353 U.S. 391, 401-402 (1957) (\u201csubsidiary conspiracy to conceal may not be implied from circumstantial evidence showing merely that the conspiracy was kept a secret and that the conspirators took care to cover up their crime in order to escape detection and punishment\u201d). Moreover, the Commonwealth has presented no evidence that Edwards\u2019s actions in colluding with Crockett were \u201cin furtherance\u201d of any conspiracy involving the other two defendants, or that the collusion was \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d to Davis and Brown \u2014 two elements required by the courts in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cherry, supra. </em>Were we to adopt the rule set forth by United States Courts of Appeal in <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Cherry, </em>the facts as alleged by the Commonwealth are insufficient to support its application. Even accepting the Commonwealth\u2019s proffer, Davis and Brown could not have forfeited their rights to object to the substantive admission of Crockett\u2019s grand jury testimony under any coconspirator or joint venturer theory. The judge\u2019s findings and rulings with respect to those defendants, although made without the benefit of today\u2019s opinion, need not be revisited.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>\u201c[This] question is one of broad public policy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>whether an accused person, placed upon trial for crime and protected by all the safeguards with which the humanity of our present criminal law sedulously surrounds him, can with impunity defy the processes of that law, paralyze the proceedings of courts and juries, and turn them into a solemn farce . . . .\u201d <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>223 U.S. 442, 458 (1912), quoting <em>Falk </em>v. <em>United States, </em>15 App. D.C. 446, 460 (1899), cert. denied, 181 U.S. 618 (1901).
