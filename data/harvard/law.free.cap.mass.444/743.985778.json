Chimko appealed from the order and elected to have his appeal heard by a judge of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(c)(1) (2000). The District Court judge affirmed the order as to misrepresentation, and certified the following questions to this court. See SJ.C.

In April, 2003, Antonio Lucas (debtor), acting pro se, filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief. The petition listed the names and addresses of three creditors holding mortgages on the debtor\u2019s residence in Lawrence, including Household Finance. In May, Chimko, an attorney not licensed to practice law in Massachusetts, contacted the debtor by mail on behalf of Household Finance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The mailing included a cover letter; a reaffirmation agreement, under which the debtor could elect to reaffirm the debt rather than surrender the property, see 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 521(2)(A) (2000); a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>\u201creaffirmation data sheet\u201d; and a \u201cnotice of pro se reaffirma tian of debt secured by real property\u201d (notice of pro se reaffirmation).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The cover letter was printed on the letterhead of Chimko\u2019s Michigan law firm, Shermeta, Chimko &amp; Adams, P.C., and identified Household Finance as \u201cOur Client.\u201d The letter advised that the law firm could not give the debtor legal advice, but directed the debtor to contact Chimko if he had any questions or concerns. The enclosed reaffirmation agreement, into which Chimko had entered the original terms of the Household Finance mortgage, was modeled on Local Bankruptcy Form <em>6.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The reaffirmation data sheet requested the following information: the debtor\u2019s address and telephone number; the name, address, and telephone number of the debtor\u2019s employer; and the debtor\u2019s monthly net income. The notice of pro se reaffirmation, which Chimko captioned as a pleading and intended to file with the Bankruptcy Court as an attachment to the executed reaffirmation agreement, began: \u201cNOW COMES, Creditor, HOUSEHOLD FINANCE CORPORATION H, by and through its attorneys, SHERMETA, CHIMKO &amp; ADAMS, P.C.....\u201d The notice requested that the court advise Household Finance of any hearing on the reaffirmation agreement by contacting \u201cagent for Creditor . . . DARRYL J. CHIMKO.\u201d The notice concluded: \u201cIf Creditor is not notified of any Hearing on Reaffirmation concerning the attached Reaffirmation Agreement, Creditor shall proceed in a manner consistent with the plain language of [11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(c)] and shall consider the attached Reaffirmation Agreement to be valid, so long as all other requirements to obtain a valid Reaffirmation Agreement are present under 11 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 524.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">On May 27, 2003, Chimko sent the debtor a second letter. Printed on law firm letterhead and designating Household Finance as \u201cOur Ghent,\u201d this letter advised the debtor that the Chapter 7 bankruptcy department of Shermeta, Chimko &amp; Ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>ams, P.C. had not received the debtor\u2019s executed reaffirmation agreement. The debtor subsequently executed the reaffirmation agreement. In June, Chimko signed the reaffirmation agreement as \u201cAgent for Creditor\u201d and filed it with the Bankruptcy Court, along with the notice of pro se reaffirmation and a cover letter that was printed on law firm letterhead and made no reference to Chimko\u2019s status as Household Finance\u2019s \u201cagent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">On July 7, 2003, on the basis of these filings, a Bankruptcy Court judge ordered Chimko to appear at a hearing \u201cand show cause why (1) the Notice of Pro Se Reaffirmation of [D]ebt Secured by Real Property should not be stricken and the Reaffirmation Agreement not accepted for filing; (2) sanctions should not be imposed upon Household Finance Corporation II and/or its agent for attaching the Notice to the Reaffirmation Agreement which (a) conflicts with the Massachusetts Local Bankruptcy Rules; (b) requires that notice be given to an address other than the creditor\u2019s address . . . and (c) purports to permit the creditor to ignore any binding order of this Court with respect to the Reaffirmation Agreement if notice of a hearing is not given to the agent; and (3) sanctions, including any appropriate referrals, should not be imposed upon the agent for the unauthorized practice of law in Massachusetts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">At the hearing, Chimko testified that the reaffirmation agreements he sends to pro se debtors are drafted by corporate counsel for the creditor. He further testified that the use of the word \u201cattorneys\u201d in the notice of pro se reaffirmation was a typographical error and that Shermeta, Chimko &amp; Adams, P.C., and Household Finance were parties to a \u201cmanagement agreement,\u201d rather than attorney and client. Based in part on a chart produced by Chimko (by order of the court) that identified a number of additional cases in Massachusetts in which he had signed documents referring to himself as attorney for the creditor, the judge concluded that, \u201c[ajlthough Chimko might have not intentionally held himself out to be anything other than an agent, through his habitual correspondences with the firm\u2019s letterhead, admitted typographical error, and repeated behavior in committing these errors, Chimko has misrepresented his status to the Debtor and the Court.\u201d The judge further concluded that Chimko (acting as agent for Household Finance) had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by preparing a reaffirmation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>agreement in which contractual rights were modified and created, by providing the debtor \u201cwith a form of notice he believed would be of assistance to [him] in understanding the reaffirmation process,\u201d and by corresponding with the debtor and the court on firm letterhead. As a remedy, the judge sanctioned Chimko in the amount of $500 and forwarded a copy of his memorandum of decision to the Massachusetts board of bar overseers and the Michigan attorney discipline board.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">On November 10, 2003, Chimko appealed from the decision to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. After oral argument, the District Court judge affirmed the order \u201cas to its conclusion that Chimko\u2019s communications were misleading under the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d Applying Massachusetts law to the question whether Chimko engaged in the unauthorized practice of law, the judge concluded that Chimko\u2019s actions did not constitute the practice of law. Finding the \u201cquestion . . . not entirely free from doubt,\u201d however, the judge certified the above questions to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Rule 9010(a) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure provides that a \u201cdebtor, creditor, equity security holder, indenture trustee, committee or other party may (1) appear in a case under the [Bankruptcy] Code and act either in the entity\u2019s own behalf or by an attorney authorized to practice in the court, and (2) perform any act not constituting the practice of law, by an authorized agent, attorney in fact, or proxy.\u201d Rule 9010(a) \u201cis certainly not a model of clarity.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Valley Elec. Membership Corp., </em>141 B.R. 309, 312 (Bankr. E.D. La. 1992). It has been interpreted as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number><em>Id. </em>10 Collier, Bankruptcy, par. 9010.02 (15th ed. rev. 2005). In relevant part, the rule thus permits a creditor to \u201cappear\u201d either through an attorney authorized to practice in the court or through an agent, so long as that agent does not perform any act constituting the practice of law. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Valley Elec. Membership Corp., supra </em>at 312-313.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>\u201cA . . . creditor . . . may (1) appear in a case under the [Bankruptcy] Code and act in the entity\u2019s own behalf, (2) appear in a case under the [Bankruptcy] Code through an attorney authorized to practice in the court, (3) appear in a case under the [Bankruptcy] Code through an authorized agent or attorney in fact, who may perform any act not constituting the practice of law, or (4) appear in a case under the [Bankruptcy] Code by proxy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>The District Court judge first addressed whether Chimko was an attorney authorized to practice in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Massachusetts. Local Bankruptcy Rule 9010-1 (2005) provides that only \u201ca member in good standing of the bar of United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts\u201d or an attorney granted leave \u201cin the discretion of the [Bankruptcy] Court\u201d may practice before the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Massachusetts. Admission to the bar of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts depends in large part on fulfilling our requirements for admission to the Massachusetts bar. Rule 83.5.1(a)(1) of the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (2005). Rule 5.5 of the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct, 426 Mass. 1410 (1998), prohibits a lawyer from \u201cpracticing] law in a jurisdiction where doing so violates the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction.\u201d The parallel rule of the American Bar Association (ABA) Model Rules of Professional Conduct was amended in 2002 to except from this general prohibition a \u201clawyer admitted in another United States jurisdiction\u201d who \u201cprovide[s] legal services on a temporary basis in this jurisdiction that . . . arise out of or are reasonably related to the lawyer\u2019s practice in a jurisdiction in which the lawyer is admitted to practice.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Noting this distinction and declining to predict our application of amended ABA Model Rule 5.5 to this case, the District Court judge \u201c consider [ed] Chimko as both [Chimko] and the Bankruptcy Court did, as an \u2018agent\u2019 rather than \u2018an attorney authorized to practice in the court.\u2019 \u201d Resolution of the certified questions thus turns on whether Chimko, as Household Finance\u2019s agent, \u201cperform[ed] any act . . . consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>tuting the practice of law\u201d under Massachusetts law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Fed. R. Bank. P. 9010(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">\u201cIt is not easy to define the practice of law.\u201d <em>Lowell Bar Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Loeb, </em>315 Mass. 176, 180 (1943). \u201cTo a large extent each case must be decided upon its own particular facts.\u201d <em>Matter of the Shoe Mfrs. Protective Ass\u2019n, </em>295 Mass. 369, 372 (1936). Here, Chimko\u2019s conduct was limited to three separate but related actions: (1) completing a reaffirmation agreement, (2) providing the debtor with a notice of pro se reaffirmation, and (3) corresponding with the debtor and the Bankruptcy Court using law firm letterhead. We address each of these actions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Reaffirmation agreements arise under the Federal Bankruptcy Code. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(c) (2000). The Bankruptcy Court judge concluded, without further analysis, that Chimko had prepared a reaffirmation agreement that both modified and created contractual rights. The reaffirmation agreement, however, was drafted by Household Finance\u2019s corporate counsel. In form, it is substantially similar to Local Bankruptcy Form 6, differing primarily in its use of bold text in the \u201cNotice to Debtor\u201d provision. In substance, it is identical to Local Bankruptcy Form 6. Chimko simply filled in the terms of the original mortgage in the appropriate blank spaces and signed the document as \u201cAgent for Creditor.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">We have rejected the proposition \u201cthat whenever, for compensation, one person . . . performs for another some service that requires some knowledge of law, or drafts for another some document that has legal effect, he is practising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>law.\u201d <em>Lowell Bar Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Loeb, supra </em>at 181.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Chimko\u2019s preparation of the reaffirmation agreement is akin to the nonattomey\u2019s preparation of preprinted income tax returns, conduct we have held not to be the practice of law. <em>Id. </em>at 186. This is not a situation in which Chimko failed, to make the disclosures required for the court to approve a reaffirmation agreement, <em>In re Carlos, </em>215 B.R. 52 (Bankr. C.D. Cal. 1997); \u201cinvoked his \u2018professional judgment in applying legal principles to address [Household Finance\u2019s] individualized needs,\u2019 \u201d <em>Taub </em>v. <em>Weber, </em>366 F.3d 966, 970 (9th Cir. 2004), quoting <em>Oregon State Bar </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>149 Or. App. 171, 183 (1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1117 (1998); or dispensed legal advice on bankruptcy matters from an office located in a State in which he was not authorized to practice, <em>In re Peterson, </em>163 B.R. 665 (Bankr. D. Conn. 1994). See <em>State Unauthorized Practice of Law Comm. </em>v. <em>Paul Mason &amp; Assocs., Inc., </em>46 F.3d 469, 470 (5th Cir. 1995) (finding actions of bankruptcy service, which included \u201cfilling] in appropriate blanks on a reaffirmation form provided by its creditor clients,\u201d inoffensive to the prohibition in rule 9010[a] against the unauthorized practice of law). We consequently conclude that Chimko\u2019s preparation of the reaffirmation agreement does not lie \u201cwholly within the practice of law [such that it] cannot lawfully be performed by . . . any other person not a member of the bar.\u201d <em>Lowell Bar Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Loeb, supra </em>at 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">The notice of pro se reaffirmation presents a closer case. Chimko captioned the document as a pleading and filed it with the Bankruptcy Court. The local bankruptcy rules require all pleadings filed with the court to be signed by an attorney and to set forth the attorney\u2019s board of bar overseers or pro hac vice number.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Local Bankruptcy Rule 9011-1 (2005). More importantly, in the view of the Bankruptcy Court judge, Chimko <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>provided the debtor with a copy of the notice. The Bankruptcy Court judge concluded that such action was intended to provide legal assistance and thus constituted the practice of law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The District Court judge disagreed, concluding \u201cthat Chim-ko\u2019s preparation of the notice did not constitute the practice of law because the \u2018assistance\u2019 he provided did not relate to any specific legal problem.\u201d Moreover, the notice, which merely outlines the procedure by which reaffirmation agreements (in the case of a pro se debtor) are approved by the court, and requested notice of any hearing on this particular reaffirmation agreement, was generic. Other courts have concluded that \u201cthe mere general dissemination of legal information by nonlawyers does not constitute the unauthorized practice of law.\u201d <em>Oregon State Bar </em>v. <em>Smith, supra </em>at 182. Equally significant in our view, however, is the fact that the notice was addressed to the court, and not to the debtor. Although Chimko included the notice with his initial correspondence to the debtor, seemingly as a courtesy to a party acting pro se, the notice itself made clear that its intended audience was the court. In such circumstances, we cannot conclude that Chimko furnished legal advice to the debtor and thereby engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. <em>Matter of the Shoe Mfrs. Protective Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 372 (\u201cthe establishment of the legal rights <em>of others </em>[and] the practice of giving or furnishing legal advice as to such rights . . . are . . . aspects of the practice of law\u201d [emphasis added]).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Finally, the Bankruptcy Court judge determined that Chim-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>kc\u2019s use of law firm letterhead to correspond with both the debtor and the court \u201csuggests he was engaged in the practice of the law.\u201d While the use of firm letterhead may support the judge\u2019s finding that Chimko misrepresented his status with respect to Household Finance, we are not persuaded that this action of itself constitutes the practice of law. Chimko sent three letters to the debtor and one letter to the Bankruptcy Court. Each letter was printed on the letterhead of Chimko\u2019s law firm, which appeared as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-5\">SHERMETA, CHIMKO &amp; ADAMS, P.C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-6\">Attorneys and Counselors at Law</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"app-dedup-0\">445 South Livemois Suite 333</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"axu-dedup-0\">P.O. Box 80490</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-7\">Rochester Hills, MI 48308-0490</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqqA\">(248) 652-8200</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"akq-dedup-0\">Fax (248) 652-8596</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">The names of each attorney in the law firm flanked this central heading. Chimko did not hold himself out as a Massachusetts attorney on the law firm\u2019s stationery. <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>Ogden, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 142, 150 (1980). Nor was Chimko a suspended or disbarred attorney who held himself out as an attorney in good standing. <em>Matter of McInerney, </em>389 Mass. 528, 536 (1983). Significantly, none of the letters contained legal advice. To the contrary, Chimko\u2019s first letter to the debtor stated: \u201cPlease note that we cannot give you legal advice.\u201d Thus, we conclude that Chimko did not engage in the practice of law by printing his correspondence with the debtor and the Bankruptcy Court on the letterhead of his law firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">Even if we were to conclude that one or the other of the services set out in the first certified question, and provided by Chimko, constituted the practice of law, they would be services falling at the very periphery of such practice. They do not involve either rendering legal advice to or soliciting Massachusetts clients, or even engaging in a legal contest in a Massachusetts forum on behalf of an out-of-State client. <em>Estate of Condon </em>v. <em>McHenry, </em>65 Cal. App. 4th 1138, 1146 &amp; n.7 (1998) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>(finding California has no interest in disciplining out-of-State attorney practicing law on behalf of out-of-State client where such attorney does not \u201cphysically com[e] into California to practice law in [California] courts\u201d). Rather, these services involve ensuring the timely filing, processing, and tracking of routine forms with the Bankruptcy Court in Massachusetts, on a temporary basis, related to work for a client in another jurisdiction where the attorney was licensed to practice law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>State Unauthorized Practice of Law Comm. </em>v. <em>Paul Mason &amp; Assocs., Inc., </em>46 F.3d 469, 470, 472 (5th Cir. 1995) (filing creditor\u2019s proof of claim, monitoring status of case, and negotiating reaffirmation agreement \u201clong . . . recognized by the bankruptcy courts as administrative functions that can be performed by authorized nonlawyer agents without offending rule 9010[a]\u2019s prohibition against the unauthorized practice of law\u201d).
