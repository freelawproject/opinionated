L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, from the allowance by a judge in the District Court of a motion for issuance of certain summonses requested by the defendant pursuant to Mass. R. Crim R 17 (a) (2), 378 Mass. 885 (1979), in connection with charges pending against him for indecent assault and battery on a child. The defendant has asserted that the summonses are necessary to his defense, that the Commonwealth lacks standing to challenge the issuance of the summonses, and that the judge\u2019s allowance of the motion was proper. The single justice reserved the case and reported the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>matter to the full court, noting two issues: \u201c(1) On this record, does the Commonwealth have standing to appeal or otherwise seek review of the District Court judge\u2019s order granting leave for the summonses to issue in this case? (2) If so, was the judge\u2019s action proper?\u201d We conclude that the Commonwealth has standing to challenge the issuance of rule 17 (a) (2) summonses. We affirm in part and vacate in part the order allowing the motion for the issuance of the summonses. We remand the case with instructions that, as to those portions of the order allowing the motion for the issuance of the sum-manses that are vacated, the defendant\u2019s motion be denied without prejudice. We further conclude that the defendant may resubmit a motion for the issuance of summonses in a manner that comports with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lampron, </em>441 Mass. 265, 268-271 (2004) <em>(Lampron). </em>See <em>Jansen, petitioner, ante </em>112, 116-120 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"Acq\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the relevant facts from the record submitted on the report of the single justice. The defendant was charged with four counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen years, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B. The complainant, a neighbor of the defendant, was twelve years of age at the time of her complaint. She alleged that she had been sexually assaulted by the defendant, in the defendant\u2019s home, when she was nine and ten years of age. Criminal proceedings against the defendant began after the complainant disclosed her allegations to two of her classmates (one by Internet chat, and the other in a conversation at school) and met with a school counsellor and counselling intern.</p>\n<p id=\"agt-dedup-0\">In interviews and statements, the complainant told police that she had suffered abuse by the defendant on several dates while she was in the fourth grade and once in the fifth grade, in 1999 and 2000. The defendant, who has a son approximately the same age as the complainant and who regularly drove the complainant and his son to their elementary school, told the police that, while he had physical contact with his neighbor, including kissing her on the cheek, sitting with her on his lap, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>and throwing her into the air in a playful manner, he did not assault her as she had alleged.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">During pretrial discovery, the defendant learned that as part of the complainant\u2019s disclosure to the police, she had produced a statement in the form of a journal entry,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> detailing certain abuse she claimed to have suffered at the hands of the defendant. The same statement revealed the complainant\u2019s statements that her \u201cparents didn\u2019t love\u201d her, that she was \u201cdepressed,\u201d and that she felt excessive pressure from her parents, who \u201calways expected\u201d her to \u201cbe the best.\u201d The same document detailed the complainant\u2019s grief about the recent death of her grandmother. Defense counsel submitted two signed affidavits summarizing additional information produced through discovery. In defense counsel\u2019s opinion, the discovery documents contained hints that the complainant\u2019s parents might be collaborating with the prosecution in an effort to avoid any action against them by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-20\">After reviewing the discovery documents, defense counsel focused on the possibility that the complainant had fabricated her allegations. As stated in defense counsel\u2019s supplemental affidavit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-22\">\u201cThe defense theory is that the complainant is stressed by her home life, i.e., the death of the complainant\u2019s grandmother and her parents\u2019 high expectations for her to do well academically . . . she is mentally unstable, and she is, therefore, unreliable with respect to her allegations of sexual abuse against the defendant. Also, the defense theory is that the DSS records will tend to show that the complainant\u2019s parents are cooperating with the prosecution of this untrue case against the defendant due to their own exposure to potential criminal and/or civil liability, if they were not to cooperate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ah4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Approximately six months after the issuance of the criminal complaint against him, and before a trial date had been set, the defendant moved for issuance of summonses pursuant to rule 17 (a) (2), seeking extensive production from numerous sources of documents that defense counsel believed to contain informatian relevant to the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"APE\">In affidavits supporting his motion for issuance of the sum-manses, defense counsel asserted that each of the requested records would be relevant and material. Defense counsel further insisted that he had no other means to obtain the requested records and that he had good reason to fear destruction of the records, because the journal and notes of the SAIN<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> interview had been destroyed, and because electronic records are easily deleted.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>A District Court judge allowed the motion for issuance of the summonses. The Commonwealth\u2019s motion to reconsider was denied.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Commonwealth sought emergency relief from the single justice. Shortly thereafter, we decided <em>Lampron, supra, </em>where we discussed for the first time the test that must be satis-fled before a court orders the issuance of rule 17 (a) (2) summonses.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>We discuss, as a preliminary matter, why the Commonwealth has standing to challenge the issuance of rule 17 (a) (2) summonses and, second, why in these circumstances it is appropriate to allow a portion of the defendant\u2019s motion, and to deny the remainder without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-15\">a. <em>Standing. </em>In response to the defendant\u2019s challenge to the Commonwealth\u2019s standing to object to his motion for issuance of summonses, the Commonwealth responds that it has an interest in ensuring compliance with the prohibition on a party\u2019s attempt to use rule 17 (a) (2) as a \u201cdiscovery device\u201d or for a \u201cfishing expedition.\u201d See <em>Lampron, supra </em>at 269-270. The Commonwealth also argues that it has an interest in protecting its witnesses, avoiding the burden on third parties of having to hire their own counsel, preventing the undue lengthening of trial, and avoiding overemphasis on the complainant\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-26\">A majority of courts interpreting Fed. R. Grim. P. 17 (c), on which our rule 17 (a) (2) is based, <em>Lampron, supra </em>at 270, have allowed the government to challenge the issuance of subpoenas duces tecum to third parties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>224 F.3d 752, 755-756 (8th Cir. 2000) (affirming magistrate judge\u2019s allowance of government\u2019s motion to quash subpoena duces <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>tecum); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>895 F.2d 1135, 1145-1146 (6th Cir. 1990) (affirming District Court judge\u2019s allowance of government\u2019s motion to quash subpoena for records from third party). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Raineri, </em>670 F.2d 702, 712 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1035 (1982) (government\u2019s standing to move to quash defendant\u2019s subpoena for additional witness testimony rests on \u201cits interest in preventing undue lengthening of the trial, undue harassment of its witness, and prejudicial over-emphasis on [the witness\u2019s] credibility\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We agree. The Commonwealth, charged with prosecuting the case, will often be able to assist a judge in determining whether a motion under rule 17 (a) (2) involves an improper \u201cfishing expedition.\u201d See <em>Lampron, supra </em>at 269. The Commonwealth, of course, also has an interest in preventing unnecessary harassment of a complainant and other Commonwealth witnesses caused by burdensome, frivolous, or otherwise improper discovery requests. A complainant or witness should be forced neither to retain counsel nor to appear before a court in order to challenge, on the basis of a partial view of the case, potentially impermissible examination of her personal effects and the records of her personal interactions. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Decaro, </em>252 Conn. 229, 253-254 (2000). Those dangers are particularly obvious where, as here, the summonses are directed at minors and their caretakers. The Commonwealth has standing to challenge a defendant\u2019s motion for summonses.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">b. <em>Merits. </em>A judge\u2019s task in reviewing a defendant\u2019s request for rule 17 (a) (2) summonses is to balance the defendant\u2019s right to mount a defense with the Commonwealth\u2019s right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>prevent unnecessary delay of the trial and unwarranted harassment of witnesses and third parties. The \u201cprocedure for issuanee of a summons for the production of documentary evidence and objects under rule 17 (a) (2),\u201d which we discussed in <em>Lampron, supra </em>at 270, is designed to effectuate such a balance. In <em>Lampron, </em>we adopted the standards articulated by the Federal courts regarding the issuance of a subpoena for production of documentary evidence \u201c[bjecause our rule was modeled after Fed. R. Crim. R 17 (c) and is intended to address the same circumstances . . . <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, \u201cthe party moving to subpoena documents to be produced before trial must establish good cause, satisfied by showing \u2018(1) that the documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the party cannot properly prepare for trial without such production and inspection in advance of trial and that the failure to obtain such inspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial; and (4) that the application [was] made in good faith and is not intended as a general \u201cfishing expedition.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 269, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nixon, </em>418 U.S. 683, 699-700 (1974). \u201c[R]ule 17 is reserved for evidentiary materials that are likely to be admissible at hearing or at trial . . . and not invoked merely for the exploration of potential evidence.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Bowman Dairy Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>341 U.S. 214 (1951). In determining under the first part of the four-part test whether the material sought is \u201cevidentiary and relevant,\u201d \u201cthe evidentiary standard of relevance applies,\u201d and the defendant must show \u201cthat the documentary evidence has a \u2018rational tendency to prove [or disprove] an issue in the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 269-270, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chretien, </em>383 Mass. 123, 136 (1981). While a judge must be sensitive to the interaction between the Federal standard and the subtleties in the Commonwealth\u2019s evidentiary rules, <em>Lampron </em>puts to rest the defendant\u2019s assertion that the Commonwealth\u2019s standard under rule 17 (a) (2) differs from the Federal standard of Fed. R. Crim. P. 17 (c).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-37\">In proceedings to issue summonses to third parties, the mov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>ing party has the burden of demonstrating that the requirements of rule 17 (a) (2) have been met. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Arditti, </em>955 F.2d 331, 345-346 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 998 (1992), and cert. denied sub nom. <em>Avila </em>v. <em>United States, </em>506 U.S. 1054 (1993). Even where the defendant\u2019s request is unopposed, the judge hearing the motion must ensure that the procedure we outlined in <em>Lampron </em>is not abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Here, both parties err in their proposed application of rule 17 (a) (2). The Commonwealth suggests an overly narrow reading of the defendant\u2019s rights, while the defendant interprets the rule too broadly. We are especially concerned that the prosecutor opposed every one of the defendant\u2019s requests, which effectively deprived the judge of the opportunity for a meaningful evaluation of defense counsel\u2019s request. The prosecutor\u2019s obligations demand a more reasoned and constructive approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">A single example from the record illuminates the problem. The defendant requested access to all of the complainant\u2019s elementary and middle school attendance records. The defendant was charged with assaulting the complainant on days when he drove her to her elementary school, and specifically on September 8 or 10, 1999. The relevance and evidentiary value of the complainant\u2019s school attendance records for September 8 and 10, 1999, is unquestionable. On the other hand, the defendant\u2019s request for the complainant\u2019s attendance records at middle school three years later cannot be justified under <em>Lampron.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Because we issued our decision in <em>Lampron </em>after the judge had ruled in this matter, we limit our interlocutory review of this case. See <em>Northeast Petroleum Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>395 Mass. 207, 212 (1985), <em>S.C., </em>401 Mass. 44 (1987). To expedite the resolution of this matter, we affirm those portions of the judge\u2019s order to which the Commonwealth should have offered no objection, for materials with direct relevance to this case and, apart from speculative objections, clear eviden-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>tiary value.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Specifically, we affirm the judge\u2019s order insofar as it allowed summonses to issue to the complainant\u2019s middle school, for \u201call reports, memoranda, documents, notes or files relating to or concerning\u201d sexual abuse allegations raised by the complainant. Because the complainant acknowledges that she recorded the dates of her abuse in her journals, we also affirm the summons to the complainant\u2019s father for copies of the complainant\u2019s journals from 1999 and 2000.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Furthermore, because the complainant first complained of her abuse in an electronic communication to another child, we affirm the summonses to the parents of that child and to the complainant\u2019s father for electronic communications by the complainant from 1999 through May, 2003 that pertain to the defendant. For the reasons stated above, we also affirm issuance of a summons to the complainant\u2019s elementary school for the complainant\u2019s attendance records for September, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">We further affirm the order issuing the summons to the Department of Social Services (department). Those documents that meet the <em>Lampron </em>test may properly be the subject of a summons for production. The department may, of course, raise any applicable privilege in response to the summons. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>423 Mass. 216 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>416 Mass. 169 (1993). See also note 10, supra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>404 Mass. 339, 340-344 (1989) (appropriate for judge to examine confidential department records prior to disclosure to defense counsel). Cf. <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 59-61 (1987) (in camera review of State child protective agency records satisfies constitutional requirements).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The remainder of the order is vacated, with the provision that the defendant be allowed a new opportunity to request the issu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>anee of summonses in accordance with the rules announced in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lampron, </em>441 Mass. 265, 269-271 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"AKv\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"apy-dedup-0\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-33\">We include this information for background purposes only. The defendant\u2019s statement was made at the police station after the defendant, according to the police report, had been informed of and had waived his Miranda rights.

When a SAIN interview is conducted, members of several different agencies may be present. Normally, representatives of one or more agencies interview the child, while the representatives of other agencies watch from behind a mirrored window. The complainant\u2019s interview was conducted by an assistant district attorney, a victim witness advocate, and a department investigator. Two detectives were in attendance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b244-32\">The Commonwealth\u2019s motion to reconsider contended that the defendant\u2019s motion was untimely, that his requests were not sufficiently specific, that none of the material requested was relevant to his defense, and that the defendant had not shown that he had no alternate means of gathering the requested documents. The Commonwealth also argued that the summonses would be an invasion of the privacy of the complainant and others \u2014 an argument that was, as we will discuss below, untimely.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b244-34\">In Federal practice, orders to appear in court or for production of documents from a third party generally are termed \u201csubpoenas\u201d or \u201csubpoenas duces tecum.\u201d In Massachusetts, orders for the same purposes generally are termed \u201csummonses.\u201d See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1440, 1450 (7th ed. 1999) (subpoena defined as a \u201cwrit commanding a person to appear before a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>or other tribunal\"; summons defined as a \u201cnotice requiring a person to appear in court as a juror or witness\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\">The defendant cites two Federal cases that denied the government standing to move to quash subpoenas to third parties.

There may also be occasions in which a defendant seeks leave from the court to move ex parte for the issuance of a summons, an issue we need not and do not address in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b246-38\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lampron, </em>441 Mass. 265 (2004) <em>(Lampron), </em>also puts to rest the misconception that the standard for issuance of a rule 17 (a) (2) sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>mons is the same as the standard for discovery under Mass. R. Crim. R 14. See Mass R. Crim. R 14, as appearing in 442 Mass. 1518 (2004) (effective Sept. 7, 2004). The policy goals of the two rules differ, as do the procedures they require. See <em>Lampron, supra </em>at 268 n.4. Consequently, the parties\u2019 citations to cases interpreting rule 14 are of limited utility in evaluating the defendant\u2019s rule 17 motion.
