In 1998, Ann and Donald J. Grenier agreed to buy lot 93 from Gove, contingent on regulatory approval for the construction of a single-family house on the property. Because Chatham prohibits construction of new residences in the conservancy district, the zoning board of appeals of Chatham (board) denied the Greniers a building permit. Gove and the Greniers sought relief in the Superior Court on statutory and constitutional grounds, contending that the prohibition against residential construction on lot 93 did not substantially further a legitimate State interest and that the board had effected a taking of lot 93, without compensation, in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and art. 10 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. After a two-day bench trial, a judge in the Superior Court mled in favor of the defendants on all counts. The Appeals Court affirmed. <em>Grenier </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Chatham, 62 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 62 (2004).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We granted Gove\u2019s application for further appellate review, and now affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">1. <em>Background. </em>Lot 93 is located in the Little Beach section of Chatham, nearly all of which was acquired by Gove\u2019s parents (the Home family) in 1926. In time, members of the Home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>family developed a motel, marina, rental \u201ccottage colonies,\u201d and a number of single-family houses in Little Beach. The family also sold several lots for development. In 1975, that portion of Little Beach still owned by the Home family was divided, by the terms of the will of Gove\u2019s mother, among Gove and her three brothers. Gove received several lots outright and sixteen other lots in fractional ownership, to be shared with her brothers. Gove also obtained title to at least two cottages. Gove continues to own one cottage in Little Beach; she sold a second in 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Little Beach is part of a narrow, low-lying peninsula, bounded by Chatham Harbor and Stage Harbor, at the extreme southeastern comer of Cape Cod. In recent years, a \u201cbreach\u201d has formed in the barrier island that long separated Chatham Harbor from the open ocean. The breach, which is widening, lies directly across the harbor from Little Beach, and a land surveyor familiar with the area testified that Little Beach is now \u201cwide open to the Atlantic Ocean\u201d and prone to northeasterly storm tides. Chatham is known for its vulnerability to storms, and, according to an expert retained by Gove and the Greniers, in recent years Chatham has \u201cas a direct result of the breach\u201d experienced a \u201csignificant erosion problem,\u201d including \u201c[h]puses falling into the sea.\u201d The same expert testified that, since the appearance of the breach, \u201cthere had been a significant rise in the mean high water [near lot 93] along Chatham Harbor.\u201d The record indicates that virtually no development has occurred in Little Beach since 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Even before the breach developed, Little Beach was prone to inundation by seawater. Gove testified that the area was flooded by hurricanes in 1938, 1944, and 1954, and by a significant offshore ocean storm in 1991. None of these storms struck Chatham directly, but in the 1944 hurricane, Stage Harbor experienced a storm surge some nine feet above sea level. The 1954 hurricane damaged buildings and flooded roads in Little Beach. The 1991 storm flooded the area around lot 93 to a depth of between seven and nine feet above sea level, placing most, if not all, of the parcel underwater. The 1944, 1954, and 1991 storms, while significant, were less severe than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>hypothetical \u201chundred year storm\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> used for planning purposes, which is projected to flood the area to a depth of ten feet. According to another expert called by Gove and the Greniers, during storms, roads in Little Beach can become so flooded as to be impassable even to emergency vehicles, and access to the area requires \u201cother emergency response methods,\u201d such as \u201c[hjelicopters or boats.\u201d The same expert conceded that, in an \u201cextreme\u201d event, the area could be flooded for four days, and that, in \u201cmore severe events\u201d than a hundred year storm, storm surge flooding in Little Beach would exceed ten feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Lot 93 itself consists of approximately 1.8 acres. The lot is within approximately 500 feet of both Stage Harbor and Chatham Harbor and, according to one expert, is susceptible to coastal flooding \u201cfrom both the front side and the backside of [the] property.\u201d The lot is bisected by a tidal creek, which is prone to flooding as well. The highest point on the property is 8.7 feet above sea level, and much of the property is less than four feet above sea level and technically a \u201cwetland.\u201d According to a 1998 map issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, lot 93 lies entirely within flood hazard \u201cZone A,\u201d an area defined by its vulnerability to \u201c[significant flooding\u201d in \u201chundred year storms.\u201d Lot 93 also lies immediately outside \u201cZone V\u201d where, during a hundred year storm, significant flooding with wave action can be expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Gove inherited lot 93 in 1975, when residential development was permitted on the parcel. In 1985, however, the town placed all of the land within the hundred year coastal flood plain, including lot 93, into the conservancy district. The stated purposes of the conservancy district include maintaining the ground water supply, protecting coastal areas, protecting public health and safety, reducing the risk to people and property from \u201cextreme high tides and the rising sea level,\u201d and conserving natural resources. The town zoning officer testified that the conservancy district serves to mitigate the \u201ctotal public safety problem\u201d of coastal flooding, and was specifically intended to protect both residents and public safety personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">The bylaw governing the conservancy district bars without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>exception the construction of new residential dwellings. The bylaw does allow specified nonresidential uses, either as of right or by special permit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The zoning officer testified that the nonresidential uses are less likely to create a danger in the event of a flood than are residential structures, in part because structures \u201cancillary\u201d to homes \u201ctend to break off\u201d in storms and \u201cdo a lot of collateral damage to other structures and property,\u201d whereas such damage is less likely when nonresidential structures, normally more firmly anchored to the ground, are built.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">In the years before the zoning regulations were amended to restrict development in the hundred year flood zone, Gove attempted to sell lot 93.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> She listed the lot and another she owned with a local broker but \u201chad no offers\u201d on the properties, and she withdrew them from the market. Gove further testified that, whatever its value before the breach developed, lot 93\u2019s worth had \u201cplummeted\u201d as a result of the breach and the property \u201chad no value . . . whatsoever\u201d in the early 1990\u2019s. By the late 1990\u2019s, property in the area had gained value, she said, but the land, she clarified, was still most attractive to those who \u201chave lived in the area\u201d and were unswayed by frequent media reports of storm damage in Chatham.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">In 1998, the Greniers contracted to purchase lot 93 from Gove for $192,000, contingent on their ability to obtain permits for a home and a septic system on the site. The Greniers proposed to develop a house on lot 93 on land between 5.3 and 7.0 feet in elevation. They proposed to construct the home raised on pilings, so that the level of the first floor would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>above the level of a hundred year flood.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">A zoning officer denied the Greniers a permit to build a house on the property. The board upheld the decision of the zoning officer. Gove and the Greniers then filed one suit against the selectmen and board and another against the conservation commission of Chatham. A Superior Court judge consolidated the actions, and the parties agreed to a bifurcated trial in which all claims, except for the issue of compensation, would first be tried before a judge, with issues of compensation then tried, if necessary, to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">After a two-day trial during which both parties presented expert testimony, the Superior Court judge found \u201c[i]t is undisputed that [lot 93] lies in the flood plain and that its potential flooding would adversely affect the surrounding area.\u201d He found insufficient evidence to support Gove\u2019s takings claim, and concluded that she and the Greniers had failed to carry their burden of demonstrating that the board\u2019s decision was \u201clegally untenable,\u201d \u201can abuse of discretion, or was arbitrary or capricious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>At trial, Gove attempted to prove that the board had effected a taking of lot 93 by subjecting the property to land use regulation in a manner that failed substantially to advance legitimate State interests. <em>Lopes </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>417 Mass. 299, 303-304 (1994) <em>(Lopes). </em>See <em>Nectow </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>277 U.S. 183 (1928) (invalidating irrational application of zoning ordinance). Gove also contended that the town had deprived her of any beneficial use of lot 93, see <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>South Carolina Coastal Council, </em>505 U.S. 1003 (1992) <em>(Lucas), </em>and disrupted her reasonable expectation of developing the property. See <em>Penn Cent. Transp. Co. </em>v. <em>New York City, </em>438 U.S. 104 (1978) <em>(Penn Central).</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We discuss Gove\u2019s theories in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">a. <em>Legitimate State interests. </em>Relying on <em>Lopes, </em>Gove argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>first that the zoning regulations, as applied to lot 93, failed substantially to advance legitimate State interests. See <em>Greenfield Country Estates Tenants Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Deep, </em>423 Mass. 81, 86 (1996). <em>Lopes </em>followed the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Agins </em>v. <em>Tiburon, </em>447 U.S. 255, 260 (1980) <em>(Agins), </em>that \u201c[t]he application of a general zoning law to particular property effects a taking if the ordinance does not substantially advance legitimate [S]tote interests.\u201d See <em>Lopes, supra </em>at 305. This term, however, the United States Supreme Court reconsidered the validity of the <em>Agins </em>\u201csubstantially advance[s] [S]tote interests\u201d standard \u201cas a freestanding takings test,\u201d and concluded that \u201cthis formula prescribes an inquiry in the nature of a due process, not a takings test, and that it has no proper place in our takings jurisprudence.\u201d <em>Lingle </em>v. <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc., </em>125 S. Ct. 2074, 2083 (2005) <em>(Lingle).</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">In practical effect, <em>Lingle </em>renders a zoning ordinance valid under the United States Constitution unless its application bears no \u201creasonable relation to the State\u2019s legitimate purpose.\u201d <em>Exxon Corp. </em>v. <em>Governor of Maryland, </em>437 U.S. 117, 125 (1978). See <em>Lingle, supra </em>at 2085; <em>id. </em>at 2087 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (discussing nature of due process review). This highly deferential test neither involves \u201cheightened scrutiny,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 2085, nor allows a court to question the \u201cwisdom\u201d of an ordinance. <em>Exxon Corp. </em>v. <em>Governor of Maryland, supra </em>at 124. See <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Skrupa, </em>372 U.S. 726, 730-732 (1963); <em>Nectow </em>v. <em>Cambridge, supra </em>at 188; <em>Euclid </em>v. <em>Ambler Realty Co., </em>272 U.S. 365, 395 (1926). To the extent that <em>Lopes </em>conflicts with <em>Lingle, </em>our earlier decision is, of course, overruled.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>In this case, the evidence clearly establishes a reasonable relationship between the prohibition against residential development on lot 93 and legitimate State interests.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Gove offered no testimony meaningfully questioning the conservancy district\u2019s reasonable relationship to the protection of rescue workers and residents, the effectiveness of the town\u2019s resources to respond to natural disasters, and the preservation of neighboring property.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Having addressed Gove\u2019s due process concerns, we now consider her takings claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">b. <em>Takings. </em>While the takings clause is directed primarily at \u201cdirect government appropriation or physical invasion of private property,\u201d the Supreme Court has \u201crecognized that government regulation of private property may, in some instances, be so onerous that its effect is tantamount to a direct appropriation or ouster \u2014 and that such \u2018regulatory takings\u2019 may be compensable under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>Lingle, supra </em>at 2081. See <em>Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, </em>535 U.S. 302, 323-324 (2002) (\u201cwe do not apply our precedent from the physical takings context to regulatory takings claims\u201d). Not every regulation affecting the value of real property constitutes a taking, for \u201cGovernment hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change.\u201d <em>Lingle, supra, </em>quoting <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Mahon, </em>260 U.S. 393, 413 (1922). A regulation \u201cgoes too far\u201d and becomes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>a \u201ctaking\u201d in any case \u201cwhere government requires an owner to suffer a permanent physical invasion of her property\u201d or where it \u201ccompletely deprive[s] an owner of <em>\u2018all </em>economically beneficial us[e]\u2019 of her property\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Lingle, supra, </em>quoting <em>Lucas, supra </em>at 1019. \u201cOutside these two relatively narrow categories . . . regulatory takings challenges are governed by the standards set forth in <em>[Penn Central].\u201d Lingle, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Gove does not claim that the conservancy district regulations effected a physical occupation of her property, so we discuss, first, why Gove has not shown a \u201ctotal\u201d regulatory taking under <em>Lucas, supra </em>at 1026. We then address why she has not shown that she is entitled to compensation under <em>Penn Central, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">i. <em>\u201cTotal\u201d regulatory takings. </em>In <em>Lucas, supra </em>at 1019, the Supreme Court concluded that a land use regulation that denies a plaintiff <em>\u201call </em>economically beneficial use of her property,\u201d constitutes a taking \u201cexcept to the extent that \u2018background principles of nuisance and property law\u2019 independently restrict the owner\u2019s intended use of the property\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Lingle, supra </em>at 2081, citing <em>Lucas, supra </em>at 1026-1032. The plaintiff in <em>Lucas </em>had paid $975,000 for two residential lots at a time when he was \u201cnot legally obliged to obtain a permit . . . in advance of any development activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1006, 1008. Two years later, the State enacted laws that, a State court found, rendered the two parcels \u201cvalueless,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1007, leading the Supreme Court to conclude that a total regulatory taking could be established. <em>Id. </em>at 1031-1032.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">In <em>Palazzolo </em>v. <em>Rhode Island, </em>533 U.S. 606, 630-631 (2001) (Palazzolo), the Supreme Court further explained that, to prove a total regulatory taking, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the challenged regulation leaves \u201cthe property \u2018economically idle\u2019 \u201d and that she retains no more than \u201ca token interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 631, quoting <em>Lucas, supra </em>at 1019. The plaintiff in <em>Palazzolo </em>was unable to prove a total taking by showing that an eighteen-acre property appraised for $3,150,000 had been limited, by regulation, to use as a single residence with \u201c$200,000 in development value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 616, 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">Here, the facts are no more indicative of a total taking than those considered by the Supreme Court in <em>Palazzolo. </em>Even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>we limit our analysis to lot 93, Gove has failed to prove that the challenged regulation left her property \u201ceconomically idle.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Her own expert testified that the property was worth $23,000, a value that itself suggests more than a \u201ctoken interest\u201d in the property. See <em>Rith Energy, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>270 F.3d 1347, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 536 U.S. 958 (2002) (discussing \u201ctoken interest\u201d). Moreover, the expert\u2019s $23,000 valuation did not take into account uses allowed in the conservancy district, either as of right or by special permit, which she admitted could make the property \u201can income producing proposition.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See note 7, <em>supra. </em>The judge\u2019s finding that lot 93 retained significant value despite the challenged regulation invalidates Gove\u2019s theory: she cannot prove a total taking by proving only that one potential use of her property \u2014 i.e., as the site of a house \u2014 is prohibited. <em>Lucas, supra </em>at 1019, requires that the challenged regulation \u201cdenies <em>all </em>economically beneficial use\u201d of land. See <em>Lingle, supra </em>at 2082 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>(in <em>Lucas </em>context \u201cthe complete elimination of a property\u2019s value is the determinative factor\u201d).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We now turn to the <em>Penn Central </em>inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">ii. <em>The Penn Central inquiry. </em>Recent Supreme Court opinions have emphasized that almost all regulatory takings cases involve the \u201cessentially ad hoc factual inquiries\u201d described in <em>Penn Central, supra </em>at 124. See <em>Lingle, supra; Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, supra </em>at 321-326, 335-336 (2002) (temporary moratoria on development); <em>Palazzolo, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The <em>Penn Central </em>framework eschews any \u201cset formula\u201d or \u201cmathematically precise variables\u201d for evaluating whether a regulatory taking has occurred, emphasizing instead \u201cimportant guideposts\u201d and \u201ccareful examination ... of all the relevant circumstances.\u201d <em>Palazzolo, supra </em>at 633, 634, 636 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). The relevant \u201cguideposts\u201d include: the actual \u201ceconomic impact of the regulation\u201d on the plaintiff; the extent to which the regulation \u201chas interfered with\u201d a landowner\u2019s \u201cdistinct investment-backed expectations\u201d; and the \u201ccharacter of the governmental action.\u201d <em>Lingle, supra </em>at 2081-2082, quoting <em>Penn Central, supra </em>at 124. See <em>Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, supra </em>at 320; <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Brimfield, </em>423 Mass. 152, 154, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1028 (1996). In the end, \u201cthe <em>Penn Central </em>inquiry turns in large part, albeit not exclusively, upon the magnitude of a regulation\u2019s economic impact and the degree to which it interferes with legitimate property interests.\u201d <em>Lingle, supra </em>at 2082.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Considering all of the evidence at trial, we agree with the judge that Gove failed to show that the conservancy district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>regulations had a substantial \u201ceconomic impact\u201d on her or deprived her of \u201cdistinct investment-backed expectations\u201d in lot 93. <em>Lingle, supra </em>at 2082, quoting <em>Penn Central, supra </em>at 124. As an initial matter, Gove\u2019s failure to introduce a thorough assessment of lot 93\u2019s current value left the judge no basis to conclude that she suffered any economic loss at all. But even if we assume that residential development is the most valuable potential use of lot 93, Gove did not prove that the prohibition against a house on lot 93 caused her a loss outside the range of normal fluctuation in the value of coastal property. See <em>Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, supra </em>at 332, quoting <em>Agins </em>v. <em>Tiburon, </em>447 U.S. 255, 263 n.9 (1980) (\u201cfluctuations in value ... are \u2018incidents of ownership\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">Lot 93 is a highly marginal parcel of land, exposed to the ravages of nature, that for good reason remained undeveloped for several decades even as more habitable properties in the vicinity were put to various productive uses. Lot 93 is now even more vulnerable than ever to coastal flooding. Nevertheless, recent appreciation in coastal property (belatedly, and for the time being) has given the parcel some development value. Absent the coastal conservancy district regulations, lot 93 might well be worth more. But this is a new \u2014 and insofar as it relates to residential development, wholly speculative \u2014 value that has arisen after the regulations became effective. Before the enactment of the regulations, Gove had no reasonable expectation of selling the property for residential development, a fact she recognized by removing the property from the market for want of an offer. Nor did Gove have any reasonable expectations of a better outcome as late as the early 1990\u2019s, when lot 93 had, by Gove\u2019s own estimation, \u201cno value whatsoever.\u201d Gove could not have developed reasonable expectations of selling lot 93 for residential development <em>after </em>the early 1990\u2019s, by which time the regulations had barred any such development for several years. The takings clause was never intended to compensate property owners for property rights they never had. See <em>Lucas, supra </em>at 1030 (outside \u201ctotal\u201d regulatory takings context, \u201cthe Takings Clause does not require compensation when an owner is barred from putting land to a use that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>proscribed by . . . \u2018existing rules or understandings\u2019 \u201d); <em>Boston Chamber of Commerce </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>217 U.S. 189, 195 (1910) (Holmes, J.) (\u201cthe question is what has the owner lost\u201d); <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Brimfield, supra </em>at 155. See also <em>Palazzolo, supra </em>at 641-643 (Stevens, J., concurring in part) (takings claim is \u201cdetermined by the impact of the event that is alleged to have amounted to a taking\u201d). Gove\u2019s argument is not furthered by the Greniers\u2019 tentative offer to pay $192,000 for the parcel contingent on receiving approval to build a single-family house, a proposition that all parties reasonably should have known was highly dubious at best, particularly since the regulations did not permit such variances. It is similarly fallacious for Gove to claim that the regulations diminished the value of her property from $346,000 (the appraiser\u2019s estimate of the value of lot 93 at the time of the trial <em>if </em>it were suitable for a three-bedroom home) to $23,000 (the appraiser\u2019s estimate of the land\u2019s \u201cun-buildable\u201d worth).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">This is not a case where a bona fide purchaser for value invested reasonably in land fit for development, only to see a novel regulation destroy the value of her investment. Gove did not purchase lot 93; she inherited the property as part of the devise from her mother in which she received other real property of significant value. See note 15, <em>supra. </em>By this we do not suggest that Gove\u2019s takings claim is defeated simply on account of her lack of a personal financial investment. See <em>Palazzolo, supra </em>at 634-635 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring) (\u201cWe . . . have never held that a takings claim is defeated simply on account of the lack of a personal financial investment by a . . . donee, heir, or devisee\u201d). Rather, Gove\u2019s failure to show any substantial \u201cpersonal financial investment\u201d in lot 93 emphasizes her inability to demonstrate that she ever had any <em>reasonable </em>expectation of selling that particular lot for residential development, or that she has suffered any substantial loss as a result of the regulations. In these circumstances \u201cjustice and fairness\u201d do not require that Gove be compensated. <em>Penn Central, supra </em>at 124, quoting <em>Goldblatt </em>v. <em>Hempstead, </em>369 U.S. 590, 594 (1962). To the contrary, it seems clear that any compensation would constitute a \u201cwindfall\u201d for Gove. See <em>Palazzolo, supra </em>at 635-636 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring) (discussing nature of test for \u201creasonableness\u201d of property owner\u2019s expectations).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>We add that \u201cthe character of the governmental action\u201d here, <em>Lingle, supra </em>at 2082, quoting <em>Penn Central, supra </em>at 124, is the type of limited protection against harmful private land use that routinely has withstood allegations of regulatory takings. It is not at all clear that Gove has \u201clegitimate property interests\u201d in building a house on lot 93. <em>Lingle, supra. </em>The judge found that \u201cit is undisputed that [lot 93] lies in the flood plain and that its potential flooding would adversely affect the surrounding areas\u201d if the property were developed with a house.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Reasonable government action mitigating such harm, at the very least when it does not involve a \u201ctotal\u201d regulatory taking or a physical invasion, typically does not require compensation.

That the Greniers\u2019 proposed residential development would have been in compliance with wetlands and State health regulations also does not lessen the legitimacy of the challenged zoning regulation, which serves different purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b779-4\">There may be good reason to view the impact of the conservancy district regulations on lot 93, in the context of Gove\u2019s entire holding in Little Beach, and perhaps even the entire parcel purchased by her parents in 1926. Because we conclude that the facts as applicable solely to lot 93 do not warrant a conclusion that there has been a taking, we need not address the so-called \u201cdenominator problem,\u201d and we leave the vexing questions there involved for another day, as did the Supreme Court in <em>Palazzolo </em>v. <em>Rhode Island, </em>533 U.S. 606, 631-632 (2001) (Palazzolo).

The appraiser conceded that, used as a marina or boat storage facility, as is a neighboring property, lot 93 could become \u201can income producing proposition,\u201d and that the property also could have value for stabling horses (a use available as of right), but that she had not considered either potential use of the property in arriving at her $23,000 valuation. In addition to this testimony, Ann Grenier testified that homeowners in the vicinity of lot 93 used their property for boat storage. A town zoning officer testified that the town had issued permits for the construction of boat storage buildings on improved and unimproved lots within the conservancy district. Gove and the Greniers presented no evidence that they had ever been denied use of lot 93 for any nonresidential purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Because Gove has failed to prove that the challenged regulation left lot 93 \u201ceconomically idle,\u201d and because she retains far more than a token interest in her property, <em>Palazzolo, supra </em>at 631, quoting <em>Lucas, supra </em>at 1019, we need not consider whether the house the Greniers had proposed to construct on lot 93 otherwise would have been prohibited by \u201cbackground principles of nuisance and property law.\u201d Lingle, <em>supra </em>at 2081, quoting <em>Lucas, supra </em>at 1026-1032. <em>Palazzolo, supra </em>at 630. <em>Lucas, supra </em>at 1029-1031.

We reject Gove\u2019s contention that, by including one sentence in his ruling referring specifically to the problem of wave action, the judge meaningfully questioned the efficacy of the coastal conservancy district regulations, as applied to lot 93, in mitigating damage from coastal flooding not driven by waves.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
