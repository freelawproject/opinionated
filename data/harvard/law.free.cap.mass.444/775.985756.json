L. c. 164, \u00a7 34B, following installation of a replacement pole. A judge in the Superior Court concluded that the bylaw is preempted by G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 34B, and granted summary judgment in favor of the pole owners. He declared the bylaw invalid because its adoption exceeded the town\u2019s legislative authority pursuant to \u00a7 6 of art. 89 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution (home rule amendment).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The town appealed, and we granted the parties\u2019 joint application for direct appellate review. Because the bylaw \u201chas the practical effect of frustrating the fundamental State policy of ensuring uniform and efficient utility services to the public,\u201d <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>420 Mass. 702, 706 (1995), we affirm.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>Before turning to the procedural history and merits of the case, we first discuss the genesis of \u201cdouble pole sets\u201d and the approaches taken by the Legislature, the Department of Telecommunications and Energy (department), the plaintiffs, and the town of Bedford (town) to minimize their occurrence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Approximately ninety per cent of the utility poles in Massachusetts are owned jointly by electric and telephone companies, such as the plaintiffs. Other enterprises, however, have statutory rights to use the poles,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a situation that complicates matters when an owner needs to replace an existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>pole.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When a pole needs replacement, the owner places a new pole adjacent to it so that owners of the attached facilities (users) may transfer their attachments from the existing pole to the new pole. Users complete the transfers sequentially, relying on their specialized expertise and training to prevent interruption of services. The transfer of pole facilities must take place in a predetermined sequence to ensure the safety of workers performing the transfers and to avoid the disruption of services.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Only after all the attachments are transferred to the new pole can the owner remove the old pole. The presence of double pole sets for prolonged periods while attachments are transferred from the old to the new pole present aesthetic and safety concerns. See, e.g., note 17, <em>infra. </em>The Legislature enacted G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 34B, placing a ninety-day limit on the utility pole replacement process just described, but made no express provision for its enforcement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">On January 9, 2002, more than four years after the enactment of G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 34B, the department began an investigation into the status of double poles, acting pursuant to G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 76.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The department directed pole owners to provide an inventory of double pole sets in each municipality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>and a report describing their practices for notifying users of pending facility transfers and ensuring the removal of old poles pursuant to \u00a7 34B. Following a meeting with the department, the utility companies collectively worked to implement the pole lifecycle management (PLM) system, a Statewide system for coordinated double pole management.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">On July 31, 2003, the Legislature directed the department to study the issue of the number of double poles in the Commonwealth and issue a report.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> All parties to this case participated in a public hearing held by the department on September 30, 2003.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> On November 28, 2003, the department issued its report and recommendations to the Legislature. See Report of the Department of Telecommunications and Energy Relative to Reducing the Number of Double Utility Poles Within the Commonwealth, D.T.E. 03-87 (2003) (Report). In the Report, the department recommended \u201ccontinued [Statewide enforcement of [\u00a7 34B], in order to ensure uniform and efficient services to the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. The department reasoned that individual \u201cby-laws enforcing the removal of poles and the transfer of wires, while designed to further legitimate local interests, would frustrate this fundamental policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>department declined the Legislature\u2019s invitation to propose enforcement legislation, such as \u201ca penalty mechanism.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15. The department expressed its hope that \u201cadditional experience with the operation of the PLM\u201d system, \u201cin operation for less than one year,\u201d would help it \u201cidentify the root causes of the double pole problem in Massachusetts so that any penalties can be properly targeted.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Because \u201cpole owners also must demonstrate that they are complying with [\u00a7 34B],\u201d the department reported that it \u201cwill require pole owners to file semi-annual reports on the status of double poles\u201d and \u201csubmit within 60 days of this Report detailed plans for eliminating the backlog of double poles as soon as reasonably practicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">On October 27, 2003, before the department had issued the Report, the town voted to add \u00a7 46.23 (bylaw) to its General Bylaws, imposing a penalty on pole owners of $100 per day for each double pole set existing in Bedford for more than ninety days.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The bylaw was reviewed and approved by the Attorney General, pursuant to G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 32, and became effective on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>November 14, 2003.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The ninety-day grace period after which the town could impose fines against pole owners pursuant to the bylaw expired on February 14, 2004. As of February 23, 2004, 334 double pole sets existed in Bedford, all jointly owned by the plaintiffs. According to the town, several of the double pole sets create specific safety and aesthetic concerns.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The plaintiffs contend that the old poles in question have since been removed, or that any delay in removing them is due to the town\u2019s delays in moving its fire alarm facilities to the new poles. See note 14, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">On February 10, 2004, the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Superior Court seeking a preliminary injunction, temporary restraining order, and permanent injunction enjoining the town from enforcing the bylaw against them.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The plaintiffs also sought declaratory judgment invalidating the bylaw. After a hearing, the judge denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for injunctive relief, but stayed the order until the town \u201ccertifies that all of its facilities have been removed from the old poles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Following a hearing on the parties\u2019 cross motions for summary judgment, a judge in the Superior Court allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion and denied the town\u2019s motion on August 12, 2004.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>\u201cMunicipalities may not adopt by-laws or ordinances that are inconsistent with State law.\u201d <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>425 Mass. 697, 699 (1997). Accord <em>Boston Gas </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number><em>Co. </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>420 Mass. 702, 703 (1995), and cases cited. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>\u201cTo determine whether a local ordinance is inconsistent with a statute, this court has looked to see whether there was either an express legislative intent to forbid local activity on the same subject or whether the local regulation would somehow frustrate the purpose of the statute so as to warrant an inference that the Legislature intended to preempt the subject.\u201d <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Newton, supra, </em>quoting <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Somerville, supra </em>at 704. Accord <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>363 Mass. 136, 155-156 (1973). \u201cMoreover, in some circumstances we can infer that the Legislature intended to preempt the field because legislation on the subject is so comprehensive that any local enactment would frustrate the statute\u2019s purpose.\u201d <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Somerville, supra. </em>See <em>Wendell </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>394 Mass. 518, 527-528 (1985). See also <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>369 Mass. 831, 834-835 (1976) (inferring intent to preempt from comprehensive legislative scheme).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">\u201cWe have stated that the purpose of G. L. c. 164,\u201d which governs manufacture and sale of gas and electricity, \u201cis to ensure uniform and efficient utility services to the public.\u201d <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Newton, supra </em>at 699. Accord <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Somerville, supra </em>at 706. See <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Lowell, supra </em>at 834 (emphasizing \u201cdesirability of uniformity of standards applicable to utilities\u201d regulated by department). We have also concluded that, given the \u201ccomprehensive nature\u201d of G. L. c. 164, \u201cthe Legislature intended to preempt local entities from enacting legislation in this area.\u201d <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Somerville, supra </em>at 704. See <em>Fafard </em>v. <em>Conservation Comm\u2019n of Barnstable, </em>432 Mass. 194, 204 (2000), citing <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Newton, supra </em>at 699 (thorough State regulation of public utilities industry preempts local ordinance), and <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>390 Mass. 772, <em>774 </em>(1984) (recognizing comprehensiveness of G. L. c. 164).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">The town makes no argument that persuades us that the rule announced in our earlier cases should not apply to the bylaw. Although there is no express legislative intent to forbid local activity regarding double pole removal, the \u201ccomprehensive nature\u201d of G. L. c. 164 implies that the Legislature intended to preempt municipalities from enacting legislation on the subject. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>We reject the town\u2019s assertion that the Legislature\u2019s enactment of statutes authorizing municipalities to exert limited control over utilities and utility poles evinces an intent to allow bylaws such as the one at issue here.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Cf. note 3, <em>supra. </em>These express grants of authority are instead strong evidence that the Legislature intended to preempt local activity on the subject absent an affirmative grant. See, e.g., <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Newton, supra </em>at 703 (G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 75, \u201cprovides limited authority to a municipality and must yield at times to the broader grant of authority given to the department\u201d); <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Somerville, supra </em>at 706 (municipality \u201ccannot use its limited authority [pursuant to G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 75,] to enact an ordinance which has the practical effect of frustrating the fundamental State policy of ensuring uniform and efficient utility services to the public\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">No statute grants authority to the town to enforce G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 34B, by imposing a fine on pole owners or otherwise. To the contrary, the Legislature\u2019s comprehensive delegation of regulatory authority to the department<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and its directive that the department study and report on the double pole issue and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>propose legislation to penalize noncompliance with \u00a7 34B, see note 12, <em>supra, </em>demonstrate the Legislature\u2019s intent that the department enforce \u00a7 34B on a Statewide basis in the absence of specific contrary legislation. We agree with the motion judge that \u201c[t]he Legislature\u2019s request ... is powerful evidence of legislative intent to delay the imposition of penalties until [the Legislature] had considered the findings of the [department]. It is also evidence that the Legislature intended to take the findings of the [department] into account, or to at least consider [its] recommendations, before allowing local regulation over the double pole problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The Report, in which the department recommended \u201cleaving the Department authority intact\u201d and \u201ccontinued [Statewide enforcement of [\u00a7 34B] in order to ensure uniform and efficient services to the public,\u201d confirms the department\u2019s recognition of its Statewide authority to ensure that regulated utilities comply with \u00a7 34B. See Report, <em>supra </em>at 7, 9. \u201cWe afford substantial deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute that it is charged with administering.\u201d <em>Franklin W. Olin College of Eng\u2019g </em>v. <em>Department of Telecomm. &amp; Energy, </em>439 Mass. 857, 861 (2003). See <em>Iodice </em>v. <em>Architectural Access Bd., </em>424 Mass. 370, 373 (1997) (\u201cIn examining the extent of the board\u2019s powers, we accord deference to the board\u2019s own construction thereof and construe such powers so as to facilitate the agency\u2019s function as designated by the Legislature\u201d). See also <em>MCI Telecomm. Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecomm. &amp; Energy, </em>435 Mass. 144, 150-151 (2001), quoting <em>Stow Mun. Elec. Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>426 Mass. 341, 344 (1997) (\u201cWhere, as here, the case involves interpretation of a complex statutory and regulatory framework, \u2018[w]e give great deference to the department\u2019s expertise and experience in areas where the Legislature has delegated to it decision making authority\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">The Report describes how local regulations such as the bylaw at issue here would frustrate the goal of G. L. c. 164 to ensure uniform and efficient utility services to the public. The department concluded that a \u201cstatutory grant to authorize municipal regulation of double poles is likely to see substantial variation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>in implementation and enforcement by the 351 cities and towns ... a risk that is easily avoided by leaving the Department authority intact.\u201d Report, <em>supra </em>at 9. Comments made by officials from several towns as part of the public hearing, who proposed different ways to penalize noncompliance, amply support this conclusion.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The department explained that \u201cpole owner compliance with differing municipal requirements could increase costs to pole owners\u201d and ultimately to consumers, because \u201c[c]osts associated with poles, the replacement and removal of poles, and the related transfer of wires, are normally included in the utility\u2019s rates, and are subject to Department review and approval pursuant to the Department\u2019s ratemaking authority.\u201d Report, <em>supra </em>at 7-8, 9, citing G. L. c. 159, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 17, 19, 20; and G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 94. See <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Newton, supra </em>at 703 n.13 (\u201cClearly, the differences between the municipalities in assessing costs impedes . . . uniformity . . . moreover, where the system becomes less uniform, such balkanization is likely to lead to less efficient services\u201d). In short, local enforcement of \u00a7 34B would force pole owners to divert resources from the primary task of double pole removal to the ancillary task of conforming the removal process to varying local ordinances and bylaws, increasing the cost of utility services to consumers without providing concomitant benefits over Statewide enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Other considerations persuade us that local enforcement of \u00a7 34B would frustrate the intent of G. L. c. 164 to ensure uniform and efficient utility services. Local enforcement could lead to a system dominated by inappropriate economic incen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>fives that compel pole owners to devote resources to those cities and towns where the penalties are the most onerous. One town may increase its fines above those imposed by other municipalities to persuade pole owners to shift their focus to removing the poles within its borders. Permitting a town to manipulate the prioritization of pole removal to the disadvantage of other municipalities would threaten the provision of uniform and efficient utility services to the public. Unlike the department, an individual city or town seeking to further its purely local interests does not weigh the often competing interests of pole owners, pole users, utility consumers throughout the State, and other municipalities, a task necessary to craft a uniform and efficient approach to double pole removal. See <em>Pereira </em>v. <em>New England LNG Co., </em>364 Mass. 109, 119 (1973), quoting <em>New York Cent. R.R. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>347 Mass. 586, 592 (1964) (\u201cLegislature intended a broad and balanced consideration of all aspects of the general public interest and welfare and not merely examination of the local and individual interests\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b792-7\">Article 89, \u00a7 6, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution (home rule amendment) provides, in pertinent part: \u201cAny city or town may, by the adoption, amendment, or repeal of local ordinances or by-laws, exercise any power or function which the general court has power to confer upon it, <em>which is not inconsistent with </em>the constitution or <em>laws enacted by the general court. . </em>.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b792-8\">We acknowledge the amicus brief of KeySpan Energy Delivery New England and the amicus brief filed jointly by Massachusetts Electric Company and Nantucket Electric Company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b792-9\">As of October 14, 2003, there were 25,686 double pole sets in Massachusetts, representing about two per cent of the approximately 1,228,684 utility poles then existing in the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b792-10\">To promote competition in the telecommunications services market, Federal and State laws mandate that pole owners provide cable and telecommunications carriers with nondiscriminatory access to utility poles for the placement of their facilities.

L. c. 40, \u00a7 21) is far too low to be an effective deterrent. . . . Lexington recommends that the penalty structure consist of a daily fine, increasing over time for each day a pole owner is in violation of the statute (e.g., $20 per day [for the] first 30 days, $30 per day for the second 30 days, and $40 per day thereafter). . . . Milton, on the other hand, suggests that a fine of $100 per day is necessary to provide an effective deterrent.... Lexington further recommends a \u2018stop the clock\u2019 provision when calculating fines or penalties to allow for conditions beyond a utility company\u2019s control that would prevent the removal of the double pole within the statutory 90-day deadline (e.g., natural disasters or labor actions).\u201d Report, <em>supra </em>at 11-12.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
