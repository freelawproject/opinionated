L. c. 123A, \u00a7\u00a7 12-16 (2004 petition). The judge ruled that the 2004 petition represented an impermissible collateral attack on a 1991 judgment that Chapman was not a sexually dangerous person. The Commonwealth contends that collateral estop-pel principles are inapplicable because its current petition presents a factual issue (Chapman\u2019s present sexual dangerousness) different from the one litigated in 1991 (Chapman\u2019s sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>dangerousness at that time), and because it intends to introduce evidence different from what was available in 1991. We conclude that the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not bar the Commonwealth\u2019s petition, that the petition set forth a sufficient factual basis to support the Commonwealth\u2019s allegation of present sexual dangerousness, and that the judge prematurely dismissed the petition. Therefore, we vacate the judge\u2019s order and remand the matter to the Superior Court for a probable cause hearing pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">1. <em>Background. </em>In September, 1977, Chapman was convicted of two counts of rape of a child and was sentenced to a prison term of from fifteen to thirty years. Shortly thereafter, he pleaded guilty to counts of sodomy, open and gross lewdness, assault with intent to commit a felony, unnatural acts with a child under fourteen years, and indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen years, for which he was sentenced to a prison term of from six to ten years. In both cases, the evidence demonstrated that Chapman had lured young boys into wooded areas under the pretext of searching for his missing dog. Once there, he sexually assaulted them.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">In November, 1977, Chapman was found to be a sexually dangerous person and, the following March, was transferred from prison to the Massachusetts Treatment Center (treatment center).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1991, Chapman filed a petition for release from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>treatment center pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 9.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a two-day evidentiary hearing, the judge found that Chapman\u2019s convictions of rape of a child \u201cculminated a [ten] year history of child abuse in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania. [Chapman\u2019s] sexual activities involved attraction to blond, blue eyed hairless boys, [ten] or [eleven] years of age. It started with observing them naked and progressed to fellatio and sodomy. In all there were about [fifty] victims.\u201d This finding, and Chapman\u2019s apparent diagnosis as a pedophile, were not contested issues at the hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> What was at issue was whether the treatment Chapman had received at the treatment center had tempered his pedophilia such that he was no longer sexually dangerous. On this subject, four \u201cqualified examiners\u201d testified.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Commonwealth called Dr. David Jones and Dr. Lisa Brooks. Both opined that Chapman had made considerable progress with treatment. Dr. Jones further testified, however, that Chapman remained a sexually dangerous person based on \u201cthe repetitive history and fixation with up to [fifty] incidents with boys who fit the description which attracted [him], his lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>of empathy for his victims, lack of true remorse, his failure to understand the nature of his obsession and the absence of internalized control.\u201d Similarly, Dr. Brooks, who had interviewed Chapman for the Commonwealth five times in the preceding two years, concluded that Chapman remained sexually dangerous. Dr. Richard Ober testified on behalf of Chapman and concluded that Chapman was not sexually dangerous because he understood his behavioral problems, expressed remorse and sadness for his victims, and had developed an ability to maintain significant relationships with adults both within and without the treatment center. Dr. Eric Sweitzer, who had worked with Chapman in weekly, individual therapy sessions for approximately two years, testified that although Chapman might still experience temptation to commit sexual offenses, he was not then sexually dangerous because the intensity of those temptations had decreased and Chapman had learned strategies to manage his anger and had \u201can excellent support group in his Christian Religion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The hearing judge \u201cadoptfed] the opinions\u201d of Dr. Ober and Dr. Sweitzer and ruled that the Commonwealth had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Chapman was then a sexually dangerous person. He ordered Chapman discharged from the treatment center and transferred back to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">On September 16, 2004, approximately one month before Chapman\u2019s anticipated release from prison, the Commonwealth filed its 2004 petition in which it sought a temporary order committing Chapman to the treatment center pending the disposition of the petition, see G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 (&lt;?); a hearing to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that Chapman is a sexually dangerous person, see G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 12 (c); and, if so, a sixty-day commitment to the treatment center for evaluation by two qualified examiners, see G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13 <em>(a). </em>Among the facts alleged in the 2004 petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>was Chapman\u2019s refusal to participate in sex offender treatment since 1991. Also included was a written evaluation by Dr. Robert Joss (dated September 10, 2004), who, after a review of thirty-six documents and reports pertinent to Chapman\u2019s criminal, psychiatric, and institutional history, opined that Chapman suffered from a form of pedophilia that had proved to be particularly resistant to change.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">In assessing whether Chapman\u2019s pedophilia rendered him currently sexually dangerous, Dr. Joss considered what he labeled \u201cstatic\u201d factors (over which a person has no control, such as prior history) and \u201cdynamic\u201d factors (\u201cover which [a] person may exhibit some control and to which treatment programs are addressed\u201d) relevant to analyzing the risk of reoffending. With respect to the dynamic factors, Dr. Joss found that (1) the type of treatment Chapman participated in at the treatment center up until 1991 (\u201cindividually oriented and psy-chodynamically based\u201d) has since proved to be generally ineffective with sex offenders; and (2) after Chapman\u2019s transfer back to prison he had been offered but refused treatment that was \u201ccognitive \u2014 behaviorally oriented and group based\u201d and that would normally be recommended where \u201carousal associated with pedophilia is noted to be a continuing problem.\u201d Dr. Joss\u2019s evaluation also noted that subsequent to his transfer from the treatment center to prison in 1991, Chapman had attended religious services for the purpose of transporting contraband for other inmates and had been disciplined for assaulting another inmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Based on his review of Chapman\u2019s history and an analysis of the static and dynamic factors relating to his likelihood of reof-fending, Dr. Joss concluded that Chapman posed, at best, a \u201cmoderate risk\u201d and, at worst, a \u201chigh risk\u201d to reoffend sexually.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Ultimately, \u201c[b]ased upon the information available [to him],\u201d it was Dr. Joss\u2019s expert opinion that Chapman was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>currently a sexually dangerous person as defined in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1, in that \u201che is likely to engage in sexual offenses if not confined to a secure facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">On October 5, 2004, Chapman moved to dismiss the Commonwealth\u2019s petition on collateral estoppel grounds. On October 14, 2004, the judge allowed the motion, ruling that the 2004 petition was a collateral attack on the 1991 adjudication because (1) the Commonwealth\u2019s 2004 petition was \u201cbased only on factors that were present\u201d in 1991, except Chapman\u2019s refusal to participate in sex offender treatment since that adjudication; and (2) such refusal did not amount to \u201cadditional evidence\u201d on which a finding of current sexual dangerousness could properly be based. Consequently, the judge concluded that a finding of sexual dangerousness on the basis of the 2004 petition would violate due process in light of this court\u2019s holding in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Travis, </em>372 Mass. 238, 249 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">The Commonwealth filed an emergency motion with the Appeals Court to stay Chapman\u2019s release pending appeal. A single justice of the Appeals Court expressed \u201cserious doubt\u201d as to the correctness of dismissing the petition and stayed the motion judge\u2019s order.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On October 19, 2004, after a hearing on the matter, the single justice extended the stay and the temporary detention of Chapman and ordered an expedited appeal of the motion to dismiss before a panel of the Appeals Court. We transferred the case here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>We have previously held that although the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution does not apply to G. L. c. 123A commitment proceedings, \u201cas a matter of fundamental fairness under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a finding that an individual is no longer sexually dangerous must be as immune from subsequent or collateral attack as is a criminal judgment of acquittal.\u201d <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Travis, supra </em>at 249.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Hill, petitioner, </em>422 Mass. 147, 155, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 867 (1996) (\u201cDue process in this context implies an aspect of constitutionally compelled res judicata\u201d). \u201cCollateral estoppel is available to a defendant as a shield against a subsequent attempt by the government to litigate an issue necessarily decided in previous litigation between the defendant and the government. . . where there is (1) a common factual issue; (2) a prior determination of that issue in litigation between the same parties; and (3) a showing that the determination was in favor of the party seeking to raise the estoppel bar.\u201d <em>Krochta </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>429 Mass. 711, 715-716 (1999). Chapman contends that the principles of collateral estoppel preclude the Commonwealth from relitigating the issue of Chapman\u2019s sexual dangerousness because the 1991 adjudication constituted a final determination between the same parties on the common factual issue of that dangerousness. We conclude, however, that the Commonwealth\u2019s petition does not seek to relitigate an issue previously adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Travis, supra </em>at 249 n.5, we noted that the protection afforded a determination made under G. L. c. 123A \u201capplies only to circumstances in which there has been a finding that an individual is not sexually dangerous <em>at that particular time </em>and a subsequent or collateral attack is made on that finding as it relates to the individual\u2019s status <em>at the time the finding was </em>made\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In the context of the present case, the Commonwealth would be precluded from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>subsequently challenging the judge\u2019s 1991 finding, for example, on the basis of newly discovered evidence demonstrating that Chapman was in fact sexually dangerous at the time the judge found he was not. Similarly, it could not seek to vacate the judgment based on evidence that the judge had made a mistake in 1991 due to the evolving and inexact nature of psychiatric prediction. See <em>id. </em>at 249, 250 (\u201cThe not sexually dangerous finding is an unconditional adjudication of status at the time of the hearing, and as such may not be reevaluated in light of subsequent events\u201d). However, neither the doctrine of collateral estoppel nor substantive due process prevents a judge from determining whether probable cause exists to find that Chapman (many years later) is <em>presently </em>a sexually dangerous person on a showing of sufficient facts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass. 489, 503 (2000) (\u201ccommitment proceedings turn on a person\u2019s current mental condition\u201d). Accordingly, we examine the facts set forth by the Commonwealth to determine whether its petition seeks merely to relitigate Chapman\u2019s status in 1991, or whether it is sufficient to support the allegation of present sexual dangerousness and can proceed properly to the next stage along the statutorily prescribed course.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, supra </em>at 505-506, we held that the Commonwealth was not estopped from seeking to commit Bruno where, its petition contained evidence of conduct that postdated a determination made by two qualified examiners that Bruno was not sexually dangerous.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As we noted, \u201cdue to the additional evidence contained in the current commitment petition, the issue therein, whether [the defendant] is currently a sexually dangerous person, is quite different from whether he was sexually dangerous [in the past].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 506. See <em>Gomes </em>v. <em>Gaughan, </em>471 F.2d 794, 797 (1st Cir. 1973) (rejecting petitioner\u2019s collateral estoppel argument where \u201cissue before the court in [the most recent proceedings] (his then propensities) was not the same as that in [the prior proceedings]; nor was the \u2018evidence\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> While we might agree that if the Commonwealth\u2019s 2004 petition had relied solely on Dr. Joss\u2019s opinion that the type of treatment Chapman received prior to 1991 has proved to be an ineffective treatment for sex offenders, it would be insufficient to overcome the doctrine of collateral estoppel with respect to the 1991 adjudication that was based largely on expert testimony regarding the success of that form of treatment on Chapman\u2019s condition. That, however, is not this case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Here, the Commonwealth\u2019s petition seeks a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>present determination of sexual dangerousness predicated not only on Chapman\u2019s criminal history and sexual misconduct prior to 1991, but also on conduct engaged in thereafter. Most importantly, Chapman, although an admitted pedophile, chose not to participate in sex offender treatment programs appropriate to his condition during the thirteen years subsequent to his release from the treatment center.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Chapman argues that he was not obligated to continue with sex offender treatment after the 1991 adjudication, and therefore, his declining such treatment is not conduct sufficient to support a showing of sexual dangerousness. The issue is not whether Chapman was \u201cobligated\u201d to participate in sex offender treatment programs, but rather the effect of his failure to participate in such programs on the current state of his mental abnormality and therefore his sexual dangerousness. This failure is particularly relevant to Chapman\u2019s present ability to control a mental abnormality (pedophilia) that otherwise creates a substantial risk of additional sexual offenses, where his own expert witness (and treating therapist) testified in 1991 that Chapman might \u201cstill have inclinations and temptation\u201d but had reduced their intensity through then ongoing therapy. These facts, set forth in the 2004 petition and elaborated on in Dr. Joss\u2019s evaluation incorporated therein, are sufficient to \u201creject [Chapman\u2019s] claim that the Commonwealth is precluded from initiating commitment proceedings against him.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, supra </em>at 506 (rejecting defendant\u2019s collateral estoppel argument where defendant refused sex offender therapy and violated parole as result of nonsexual offenses committed after defendant was deemed no longer sexually dangerous). We therefore conclude that it was error to dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Finally, with respect to Chapman\u2019s custodial status, if a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>person is scheduled to be released from prison \u201cprior to the court\u2019s probable cause determination,\u201d the court may \u201ctemporarily commit such person . . . pending disposition of the petition,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 495, if the Commonwealth can make \u201ca sufficient showing based on \u2018evidence before the court,\u2019 that the person named in the petition is sexually dangerous . . . and... is likely to commit future harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 503-504, quoting G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(e). </em>This threshold has been met in the present petition on the basis of the facts alleged and Dr. Joss\u2019s detailed expert evaluation of Chapman\u2019s present dangerousness. Consequently, the petitioner is to be detained pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 12 <em>(e), </em>pending a probable cause hearing.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The order is vacated and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b32-6\">In 1977, G. L. c. 123A provided that, \u201c[i]f a prisoner under sentence in any jail, house of correction or prison . . . appeared] to the sheriff. . . or to the district attorney for the district in which such prisoner was sentenced to be a sexually dangerous person and in need of the care and treatment provided at the center, such officer [was permitted to] notify the commissioner of mental health, who [would] thereupon cause such prisoner to be examined by a psychiatrist at the institution wherein he [was] confined.\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 6, as appearing in St. 1958, c. 646, \u00a7 1. If the examining psychiatrist determined that the prisoner might be sexually dangerous, the sheriff or the district attorney filed a motion to commit the prisoner to the treatment center for an observation period not to exceed sixty days. <em>Id. </em>If the prisoner was subsequently determined to be not sexually dangerous by his examining psychiatrists, the judge was required to \u201corder such prisoner to be reconveyed to the institution wherein he was serving his sentence, there to be held until the termination of his sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the examining psychiatrists determined that the prisoner was sexually dangerous, a hearing was held. On a finding of sexual dangerousness, the judge committed the prisoner to the center \u201cfor an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>indeterminate period of a minimum of one day and a maximum of such person\u2019s natural life\u201d or made \u201csuch other disposition upon the recommendation of the department of mental health consistent with the purpose of treatment and rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">In 1990, \u00a7\u00a7 3-6 and 7 of G.

Approximately one month before Chapman\u2019s scheduled release, the Commonwealth petitioned to recommit Chapman to the treatment center as a sexually dangerous person. G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 (b). Because the Commonwealth\u2019s petition and the supporting expert report impermissibly ignore the preclusive effect of the 1991 finding that Chapman was not sexually dangerous, and point to no evidence of Chapman\u2019s conduct after the 1991 judicial determination that would, even if proved, establish probable cause to \u201cbelieve that [Chapman] is a sexually dangerous person,\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 (c), I conclude that the motion judge correctly dismissed the petition. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">I do not question the court\u2019s holding that, prior to Chapman\u2019s release from prison in 2004, the Commonwealth could again petition to commit Chapman as a sexually dangerous person pursuant to G. L. c. 123A. The issue \u201cwhether [Chapman] is currently a sexually dangerous person, is quite different from whether he was sexually dangerous in [1991].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass. 489, 506 (2000) <em>(Bruno). </em>See <em>Travis, supra </em>at 249 n.5 (finding individual is not sexually dangerous at particular time \u201cwould not bar subsequent statutorily and constitutionally valid proceedings under this chapter to determine an individual\u2019s status at the time of the subsequent proceedings\u201d). My concern stems from the Commonwealth\u2019s impermissible attack on the 1991 judicial determination, the Commonwealth\u2019s substantial reliance in its petition and supporting materials on facts that may not be considered because the 1991 decision must be given preclusive effect, and on the absence of any other relevant facts in its petition concerning Chapman\u2019s conduct since that determination in 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">In <em>Bruno, supra </em>at 504-506, this court reaffirmed that a judicial determination of a person\u2019s sexual dangerousness must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>be given preclusive effect: <em>Bruno </em>did not weaken in any respect the central holding in <em>Travis </em>that \u201ca finding that an individual is no longer sexually dangerous must be as immune from subsequent or collateral attack as is a criminal judgment of acquittal.\u201d <em>Travis, supra </em>at 249. See <em>Gomes </em>v. <em>Gaughan, </em>471 F.2d 794, 797 (1st Cir. 1973) (\u201cthe oppressive misuse of multiple commitment proceedings would doubtless be a violation of due process\u201d). In <em>Bruno, </em>unlike here, the Commonwealth had new evidence of the defendant\u2019s conduct following the prior proceedings sufficient to support a finding of probable cause of sexual dangerousness. Aggravated rape was the underlying conviction against Lawrence Bruno. After his release from incarceration, Bruno was arrested while on parole for, among other things, \u201cassaulting his girl friend with whom he lived,\u201d new conduct suggestive of sexual dangerousness. <em>Bruno, supra </em>at 491 n.2, 506. Thus in <em>Bruno, </em>we recognized that the <em>subsequent </em>conduct of a person not found to be sexually dangerous may be grounds for later G. L. c. 123A proceedings. See <em>id. </em>at 505, 506, citing <em>Travis, supra </em>at 249 n.5.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">As contrasted to the circumstances in <em>Bruno, </em>the Commonwealth in this case, in my view, has not alleged any facts of Chapman\u2019s conduct since 1991 to meet even the low threshold of G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 (6). Stripped of its revisitation of the 1991 determination,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Commonwealth\u2019s allegations fall into three categories, none of which, alone or in combination, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>\u201csufficient\u201d under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(b). </em>First, the Commonwealth asserts that Chapman\u2019s sexual dangerousness may be shown through \u201cthe inefficacy of the treatment that he received before 1991 and the discouraging recidivism rate of those who also received such treatment.\u201d I agree with the court that such evidence <em>cannot </em>be used to prove that Chapman is now sexually dangerous, for to hold otherwise would be to permit the very attack on the earlier judicial determination that <em>Travis </em>and <em>Bruno </em>expressly forbid. <em>Ante </em>at 21-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Evidence concerning the efficacy of treatment that Chapman received before 1991 is not evidence of his conduct since 1991; it establishes only that new science suggests that the Superior Court judge who in 1991 determined that the Commonwealth had not met its burden of proving Chapman sexually dangerous, may have come to the wrong conclusion. Implicit in the Commonwealth\u2019s theory that new scientific evidence is relevant to a determination whether Chapman is now sexually dangerous is an assumption that the Commonwealth may seek to challenge the findings of an earlier petition whenever it can proffer expert evidence that undermines an earlier judicial determination. Expert opinions and scientific scholarship concerning predictive factors of sexually dangerous recidivism are in a state of constant flux. See R.K. Hanson &amp; K. Morton-Bourgon, Predictors of Sexual Recidivism: An Updated Meta-Analysis (2004). See also <em>Kansas </em>v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 360 n.3 (1997) (\u201cpsychiatric professionals are not in complete harmony in casting pedophilia, or paraphilias in general, as \u2018mental illnesses\u2019 \u201d). It will almost always be possible to rely on \u201cnew\u201d science to attack an earlier determination of sexual dangerousness. Here, permitting the Commonwealth to rely on Dr. Joss\u2019s concerns about the correctness of the 1991 determination would be contrary to our rulings in <em>Travis </em>and <em>Bruno, </em>and would provide an easy avenue for the \u201coppressive misuse of multiple [sexually dangerous person] commitment proceedings [that] would doubt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>less be a violation of due process.\u201d <em>Gomes </em>v. <em>Gaughan, supra </em>at 797. See <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>105 Cal. App. 4th 1046, 1061-1062 (2003) (holding that experts share State\u2019s burden of showing new evidence subsequent to earlier judicial determination that defendant was not subject to commitment as sex offender). As the motion judge realized, if the Commonwealth were permitted to present expert opinion to challenge the basis of the 1991 determination, \u201ceveryday being a new day, there would be no end to the number of [pjetitions the Commonwealth could file as to a respondent\u2019s sexual dangerousness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">The Commonwealth also cites Chapman\u2019s prison disciplinary record as supporting its allegation that he is a sexually dangerous person. As the court recognizes, the disciplinary record contains no such support. <em>Ante </em>at 24 n.16. The Commonwealth conceded that \u201cChapman\u2019s disciplinary history is non-eventful.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cNon-even tful\u201d prison behavior is not probative of sexual dangerousness. See <em>Addington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>441 U.S. 418, 426-427 (1979) (\u201cAt one time or another every person exhibits some abnormal behavior which might be perceived by some as symptomatic of a mental or emotional disorder, but which is in fact within a range of conduct that is generally acceptable. Obviously, such behavior is no basis for compelled treatment and surely none for confinement\u201d). If Chapman\u2019s record of prison disciplinary actions was sufficient to support a determination that there is probable cause to believe Chapman is sexually dangerous, it is hard to conceive of <em>any </em>circumstance in which the Commonwealth could not meet its burden. There was no showing that, in the more that thirteen years since he was determined to be not sexually dangerous, Chapman has engaged in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>misconduct of a sexual nature.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> His prison disciplinary record is anodyne.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Third, the Commonwealth argues that Chapman\u2019s failure to enter into sex offender treatment since 1991 is probative of sexual dangerousness. It is here \u2014 and only here \u2014 that the court agrees with the Commonwealth. In the circumstances of this case, I am not persuaded. The Commonwealth alleged that Chapman \u201chas refused sex offender treatment\u201d since his release from the treatment center, and for purposes of a motion to dismiss, I accept the allegation. I note, however, that the Commonwealth has made no showing that any participation was required of Chapman, or even that it was recommended to him \u2014 only that, as Dr. Joss explained, treatment \u201cwould normally be recommended\u201d to an individual in Chapman\u2019s position.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Even if Chapman \u201crefused\u201d to participate in sex offender treatment, this cannot be probative of his present mental state. The very purpose of the 1991 determination was to free Chapman from the requirement that he be subjected to continued sex offender \u201ctreatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Concluding that there is probable cause to believe Chapman is sexually dangerous because he did not undergo sexual offender treatment or therapy after he was determined not sexu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>ally dangerous in 1991 is, given the circumstances, exactly the type of \u201carbitrary, wrongful government action\u201d that the due process clause bars. <em>Foucha </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>504 U.S. 71, 80 (1992), quoting <em>Zinermon </em>v. <em>Burch, </em>494 U.S. 113, 125 (1990). See <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 331-332 (1986); <em>Bruno, supra </em>at 503; <em>Hill, petitioner, </em>422 Mass. 147, 154-155, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 867 (1996). The court\u2019s holding allows the Commonwealth to initiate G. L. c. 123A proceedings against a defendant previously found not sexually dangerous not because he has engaged in conduct probative of sexual dangerousness, but because he has not voluntarily undergone some unspecified, nonmandatory treatment. The court\u2019s holding penalizes Chapman for violating unstated and unspecified \u201cconditions\u201d of his release from the treatment center, where there is no reason to believe Chapman had any reason to know of the harsh consequences his \u201crefusal\u201d to participate in the treatment would trigger. Under the court\u2019s holding, a prisoner released on probation from incarceration, after a determination that he is <em>not </em>sexually dangerous, may (if he is later incarcerated) be made subject to a new petition that he <em>is </em>sexually dangerous solely because of evidence that in the intervening probationary period he did not <em>voluntarily </em>engage in sex offender treatment, even without a showing that he had reason to know that he would be well advised to participate in such treatment, much less that his participation was a required condition of his release. In short, the court allows the Commonwealth to posit, with no notice to a defendant, post hoc, novel terms of release, and then to penalize the defendant for fading to comply with those conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">None of the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d evidence is probative of Chapman\u2019s sexual dangerousness. The motion judge correctly, in my view, concluded that the Commonwealth\u2019s 2004 petition is based \u201conly\u201d on factors that were present in 1991, and correctly concluded that the Commonwealth had not met its burden required by G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(b).</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">I well recognize that the 1991 judicial determination concem-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>ing Chapman\u2019s sexual dangerousness resulted in his return to prison from the treatment center, while the same determination today would release Chapman to the public at large. We have rejected a claim of significant distinction between the former and current definitions of sexual dangerousness as provided in G. L. c. 123A. <em>Dutil, petitioner, </em>437 Mass. 9, 14-15 (2002).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Here the court could have considered that the different <em>effect </em>of a determination of Chapman\u2019s lack of sexual dangerousness today, as compared to in 1991, justifies today\u2019s decision. Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Carmony, 99 </em>Cal. App. 4th 317, 322-323 (2002) (California statute allowing commitment of \u201csexually violent predator[sj\u201d sufficiently dissimilar from earlier statute allowing commitment of \u201cmentally disordered sex offenders\u201d that defendant could not invoke collateral estoppel). But, if <em>Travis </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>and <em>Bruno </em>are to have continued vitality, as both the Federal and State Constitutions command, I would reject the Commonwealth\u2019s effort to relitigate the 1991 determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Chapman\u2019s crimes were multiple and serious. It may be tempting to keep him incarcerated, rather than place any child at any conceivable risk if he is released. But Chapman did not receive a life sentence. He has served the full, lengthy sentence imposed on him. It may be that a longer criminal sentence was warranted in his case. \u201cThe point, however, is not how long [Chapman] and others like him should serve a criminal sentence. With his criminal record, after all, a life term may well have been the only sentence appropriate to protect society and vindicate the wrong. The concern instead is whether it is the criminal system or the civil system which should make the decision in the first place.\u201d <em>Kansas </em>v. <em>Hendricks, </em>521 U.S. 346, 372-373 (1997) (Kennedy, J., concurring).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b41-9\">The Massachusetts Constitution provides similar protection. See art. 1 of the Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 106 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b41-10\">In 1991, G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 9, as amended through St. 1989, c. 555, provided that persons detained at the treatment center could \u201cfile a petition for examination and discharge once in every twelve months. . . . Unless the court finds that such person remains a sexually dangerous person, it shall order such person to be discharged from the treatment center. Discharge from the center shall not operate to terminate the sentence given concurrently with the commitment, or any other unexpired sentence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The Commonwealth apparently did not appeal from the decision. See <em>Hill, petitioner, </em>422 Mass. 147, 155, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 867 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b43-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass. 489, 504-506 (2000), we also held that the Commonwealth was not barred by res judicata or collateral estoppel from filing a G. L. c. 123A petition in the absence of an earlier judicial finding that the defendant was not sexually dangerous. In that case, the Commonwealth had sought to commit Bruno pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, but had ceased pursuing that objective before a final judicial determination. Our ruling to that effect has clear analogues in criminal law. A dismissal without prejudice for lack of evidence may enter in a criminal case after the Commonwealth has lawfully detained a suspected criminal pursuant to an indictment. Double jeopardy does not attach, of course, until the trial itself has begun. See <em>Crist </em>v. <em>Bretz, </em>437 U.S. 28 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeFuria, </em>400 Mass. 485, 487 (1987) (at bench trial, jeopardy attaches when first witness sworn); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dascalakis, </em>246 Mass. 12, 18-19 (1923) (jeopardy attaches when jury empaneled).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b43-8\">The report of the Commonwealth\u2019s expert, Dr. Joss, is replete with statements that cannot be interpreted as anything other than an attack on the 1991 determination.

Chapman was convicted for crimes of pedophilia, but there were certainly opportunities for sexual misconduct while Chapman was incarcerated. The former medical director of the treatment center where Chapman was committed for thirteen years has stated that rape in prison, especially of young-looking male prisoners, is alarmingly common. See Fried, Reflections on Crime and Punishment, 30 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 681, 685-687 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Due to the perverse disincentives of treatment the Commonwealth has established, many attorneys apparently routinely advise their clients not to engage voluntarily in sex offender treatment.

See Bernstein, A Question of Commitment, Commonwealth (Winter 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">The Commonwealth\u2019s policy in this regard is especially disturbing in light of the consensus among experts that sex offenders benefit from prompt treatment during their term of incarceration.
