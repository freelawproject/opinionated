The complainant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>his younger daughter, thirteen years of age at the time of the incident. The defendant appealed, claiming that a judge in the Superior Court who ruled on certain pretrial motions erroneously had barred him access to potentially exculpatory evidence. He also claims that the judge who presided at his trial erroneously prevented him from presenting evidence tending to show his innocence. We granted the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We reverse the judgments, set aside the defendant\u2019s convictions and remand the case to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">1. <em>Background. </em>We first summarize the evidence at trial, leaving for later discussion particular facts concerning the defendant\u2019s appellate claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The defendant is a divorced father of four children. He lived with his parents (the children\u2019s grandparents) and his older daughter, Alison,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who was twenty years of age at the time of trial. The defendant\u2019s three other children, Benjamin, seventeen years old at the time of the alleged incident, and Eric and Ellen, twins, thirteen years old at the time of the alleged incident, lived primarily with their mother, but stayed with the defendant and their grandparents every other weekend.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">On Saturday, March 3, 2001, the defendant and his four children attended a party to celebrate the grandparents\u2019 fiftieth wedding anniversary. On returning home, the defendant, Benjamin, Eric, and Ellen all went upstairs. Approximately one-half hour later, Ellen came downstairs, telling her grandparents that the defendant had \u201ctried to rape\u201d her, but that she had \u201cpunched him in the eye\u201d and run away. The grandfather went upstairs to confront the defendant with the child\u2019s accusation.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">Ellen testified that the defendant had found her lying fully clothed on Alison\u2019s bed, in a bedroom where Ellen often slept. She testified that the defendant \u201cunzipped his pants[,] moved [her] underwear over,\u201d and placed the tip of his penis into her vagina. She then \u201cflipped him over onto his back,\u201d she said, punched him in the eye, and ran downstairs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">The defendant testified to a quite different set of events. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>said that he was in the bathroom at the time of the alleged assault and emerged only to have Ellen punch him in the eye for no apparent reason.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> No witness could corroborate either account of what transpired on the night of March 3. However, there was testimony by her siblings and her grandmother tending to contradict certain of Ellen\u2019s claims. The next morning the defendant informed the police of Ellen\u2019s accusations against him, and he consistently has denied any inappropriate behavior toward Ellen that evening, or at any other time.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">There was testimony from several witnesses that Ellen was a very emotional child who had difficulty interacting with other members of her family. Her grandmother attempted to take Ellen to a hospital emergency room immediately after her accusation of rape; Ellen refused to go. Shortly thereafter, Ellen returned to her mother\u2019s home. The following morning, her mother took Ellen to a hospital, where Ellen repeated her accusation against her father and was examined by a doctor and a nurse. The examination uncovered no physical evidence connected to the defendant, but during a pelvic examination, the nurse noticed that Ellen\u2019s vaginal wall was \u201credder than the normal,\u201d a condition known as erythema. Ellen\u2019s statements to her mother and the nurse were admitted as fresh complaint evidence. These were largely consistent with Ellen\u2019s own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">A gynecologist called as an expert for the defense testified that erythema of the type observed by the nurse was a \u201ccommon\u201d condition not \u201cspecific to a trauma of the vagina.\u201d On cross-examination, the doctor did testify that erythema, while a \u201cnon-specific finding,\u201d \u201ccould\u201d result from sexual assault. In closing argument, the prosecutor characterized the nurse\u2019s observation as \u201cabnormal findings of [Ellen\u2019s] vagina . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>abnormal redness of the vagina,\u201d and argued that the finding of erythema in her vagina \u201ccan\u201d mean \u201ctrauma from a sexual assault\u201d and was \u201ccorroboration for what [Ellen] told you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>On appeal, the defendant does not challenge the evidence admitted at trial. Rather, he contends that the jury were not permitted to consider other admissible evidence that pointed to his innocence. We consider each of his claims in turn, and conclude that they are meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">a. <em>Pretrial discovery. </em>The defendant\u2019s first claim concerns a matter of pretrial discovery. Shortly after the defendant was indicted, defense counsel learned that the Commonwealth intended to introduce evidence gleaned from the complainant\u2019s March 4, 2001, pelvic examination. Defense counsel later learned that Ellen had undergone a previous pelvic examination less than six weeks earlier, on January 22, 2001, also following an allegation that she had been sexually assaulted, this time while at school.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant moved for \u201cthe production of the medical records pertaining to a pelvic examination of [Ellen] on January 22, 2001.\u201d Counsel did not know any specifics concerning the examination. In a separate written motion, he requested an order \u201cdirecting] the Commonwealth to obtain and provide the name and address of [the] doctor who conducted a pelvic exam on [Ellen] on January 22, 2001 [,] as a result of an alleged sexual assault at her school.\u201d A Superior Court judge held a nonevidentiary hearing on the motions, during which defense counsel stated that he sought the results of the January examination in order to allow a defense expert to assess the probative value of Ellen\u2019s erythema identified during her second pelvic examination on March 4, and could be \u201cimportant in terms of any physical feature, characteristic, or condition of the alleged victim . . . .\u201d The judge denied the motions, ruling that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>defense counsel had failed to demonstrate a sufficient basis to require production.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The defendant and the Commonwealth both recognize that the defendant\u2019s motion for \u201cthe production of the medical records\u201d was a motion for a summons for records from a third party, governed by Mass. R. Crim. P. 17 (a) (2), 378 Mass. 885 (1979). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lampron, </em>441 Mass. 265, 268 (2004) (\u201cRegardless of how a defendant styles his request, pursuit of documents and records in the possession of a non-party must be considered and analyzed under rule 17 [a] [2] . . .\u201d). For reasons we now explain, we conclude that the defendant made a sufficient showing for the issuance of a summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">A party moving to subpoena (summons) documents to be produced before trial \u201cmust establish good cause, satisfied by a showing \u2018(1) that the documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the party cannot properly prepare for trial without such production and inspection in advance of trial and that the failure to obtain such inspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial; and (4) that the application [was] made in good faith and [was] not intended as a general \u201cfishing expedition.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lampron, supra </em>at 269, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nixon, </em>418 U.S. 683, 699-700 (1974). In this case the Commonwealth challenges in substantial measure only whether the defendant has satisfied the first of the four prongs. Our inquiry therefore is whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>defendant has shown that records pertaining to the complainant\u2019s January pelvic examination are \u201clikely to be admissible at hearing or at trial,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lampron, supra, </em>citing <em>Bowman Dairy Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>341 U.S. 214 (1951), and have a \u201crational tendency to prove [or disprove] an issue in the case,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lampron, supra </em>at 269-270, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fayerweather, </em>406 Mass. 178, 183 (1989). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lam, ante </em>224, 230 (2005), and cases cited. The Commonwealth does not question the admissibility of medical records but argues that defendant failed to show that the records meet the threshold of relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Here, the records-of Ellen\u2019s January pelvic examination bore on a critical fact in the defendant\u2019s case: whether the erythema described by the nurse in March was corroborative of Ellen\u2019s allegations against her father. If Ellen\u2019s earlier pelvic examination had revealed erythema similar to (or more serious than) the erythema noted by the nurse in March, the Commonwealth\u2019s theory that the March results were probative of sexual assault may have been significantly undercut. The prosecutor, for example, might not have been able to argue that Ellen\u2019s vaginal condition on the morning after the alleged rape was \u201cabnormal\u201d for Ellen.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A defendant is not required to state with certainty the precise maimer in which a medical record would be employed at trial. When a party cannot know for certain the contents of a requested document, it is appropriate for a court to order the issuance of a summons pursuant to rule 17 (a) (2) on a showing of the relevance of what the document is likely to contain. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nixon, supra </em>at 700.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The January records likely would have given the jury a more comprehensive and fairer picture as to the significance of the March records to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>introduced by the Commonwealth. A summons was appropriate. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mitchell, ante </em>786, 795 (2005) (\u201cA defendant has an unquestioned right ... to obtain relevant evidence that bears on the question of his guilt or innocence or which otherwise will help his defense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">b. <em>Evidence excluded at trial. </em>The defendant next challenges an evidentiary ruling at trial. During its case-in-chief, the Commonwealth elicited testimony from a police officer that shortly after Ellen accused her father, her grandfather went upstairs to confront the defendant. The grounds for admission of this evidence are unclear, but no objection was made. Later in the trial, defense counsel called the grandfather as a witness and he testified to similar effect that, on hearing Ellen\u2019s accusations, he went upstairs to confront his son and found the defendant \u201cin the bathroom checking his eye.\u201d He then testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-5\">\u201cI banged on the door and I told him I wanted to talk to him. And I went into my bedroom. And he came out, and he came in, and I told him what [Ellen] had said and the look on his face was complete bewilderment. ... He didn\u2019t realize what I was saying until I had to repeat myself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">If permitted, the grandfather would have testified further that the defendant promptly and strongly denied Ellen\u2019s accusations. The judge, however, on the Commonwealth\u2019s objection, excluded the testimony, pointing to the hearsay rule. Defense counsel challenged the ruling on the ground that the defendant\u2019s statement qualified as a spontaneous utterance, which the judge rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">On appeal the defendant now contends that his denial should have been admitted through the doctrine of \u201ccurative admissibility.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruffen, </em>399 Mass. 811, 812-814 (1987). In the alternative, he argues that the judge abused her discretion in ruling that his denial to his father did not qualify as a spontaneous utterance. As we shall explain, we cannot conclude that the judge abused her discretion on the spontaneous utterance claim, but we agree with the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>that the defendant\u2019s denial should have been admitted under the doctrine of curative admissibility. Because the admission of the grandfather\u2019s testimony was not sought on this basis, we review the judge\u2019s decision to determine whether it created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">We consider first the applicability of the doctrine of curative admissibility to this case. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruffen, supra, </em>a judge erroneously, although without apparent objection, admitted in evidence the complainant\u2019s face-to-face accusation of the defendant, which was made in the presence of a police officer. The judge then precluded the defendant from asking the police officer to testify concerning the defendant\u2019s prompt denial of the accusation when confronted. <em>Id. </em>at 812. We held that, because the \u201cjury heard the officer testify that the victim made an accusation by relating her story in front of the defendant ... the defendant should have been allowed, under the doctrine of curative admissibility, to present testimony that he denied the accusations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">The circumstances are the same here. Evidence of the grandfather\u2019s out-of-court accusation of the defendant made in his presence should not have been admitted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruffen, supra </em>at 813; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>373 Mass. 676, 691 (1977) (\u201caccusatory questions followed by unequivocal denials are to be excluded from evidence\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>335 Mass. 106, 115 (1956) (\u201cIt is settled that extrajudicial accusatory statements made in the presence of a defendant are not admissible as evidence against him where the defendant has denied the accusations\u201d). We do not fault the judge on that point, because the defendant did not object to or move to strike the testimony. But once the jury heard the police officer\u2019s testimony that the grandfather had accused the defendant, the judge should have allowed in evidence the defendant\u2019s unequivocal denial, minimizing, as much as possible, the prejudice to the defendant of the earlier testimony. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruffen, supra </em>at 813-814.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruffen, supra, </em>we noted that the doctrine of curative admissibility may only be invoked \u201cif the original evidence created significant prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 814. The Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>monwealth argues that this is not such a case. The clear import of the <em>Ruffen </em>case, however, is that a defendant almost always suffers significant prejudice when he is unable to counter evidence of an out-of-court accusation made in his presence with evidence from a third party that the defendant promptly and completely denied the accusation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, supra </em>at 692. This case provides no exception to the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">Other evidence elicited by the Commonwealth that, on the night of the incident, the defendant could be seen crying himself to sleep compounded the error. Without any information from the grandfather that the defendant had immediately denied his daughter\u2019s accusations, the jury could well have concluded that the defendant was showing remorse after having been caught in the commission of a crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keyes, </em>11 Gray 323, 324 (1858) (\u201cwhenever the statements, declarations or admissions of a party are made subjects of proof, all that was said by him at the same time and upon the same subject is admissible in his favor\u201d). It was not sufficient for the judge to allow, as she did, the defendant himself to testify that he had denied the grandfather\u2019s accusatory statement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britland, </em>300 Mass. 492, 496 (1938) (\u201cEvidence of statements favorable to the defendant . . . coming from the defendant alone . . . might be viewed with the suspicion that they were of later invention\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Because we conclude that the testimony should have been admitted under the doctrine of curative admissibility, we comment only briefly on the judge\u2019s ruling on the spontaneous utterance exception to the hearsay rule. The test for admissibility under that exception has two prongs, both of which must be met for a statement to be admitted. First, a judge must determine whether the statement was triggered by an \u201cevent \u2018sufficiently startling to render inoperative the normal reflective thought processes of the observer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>437 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>Mass. 620, 623 (2002), quoting 2 McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 272, at 204 (5th ed. 1999). Second, a judge must consider whether the statement was a \u201cspontaneous reaction to the . . . event\u201d or more likely \u201cthe result of reflective thought.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, supra. </em>Here, there was evidence sufficient to create a question under both prongs. The judge was warranted in asking, based on the facts presented, whether the grandfather\u2019s accusation \u201c render [ed] inoperative\u201d the defendant\u2019s capacity for reflective thought. Similarly, the judge may have questioned whether the defendant\u2019s opportunity to deliberate while the grandfather repeated Ellen\u2019s accusation (for a duration not ascertainable from the record) supported a finding that the defendant had \u201ctime to contrive and misrepresent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>364 Mass. 211, 223 (1973), quoting J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1750 (3d ed. 1940). On the record at the time of her ruling, the judge would have been warranted in concluding that the questions defense counsel asked of the grandfather did not provide sufficient facts for her to conclude that both prongs of the test had been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">We consider now the effect of the judge\u2019s ruling on the verdicts. We are not confronted in this case solely by the effect of the ruling concerning the grandfather\u2019s excluded testimony. Rather, there were two separate errors that in combination, we conclude, deprived the defendant of the opportunity to develop his defense fully. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, </em>376 Mass. 90, 94 (1978), <em>S.C., </em>385 Mass. 733 (1982). On a review of the entire transcript, we are left with substantial concerns whether there has been a miscarriage of justice. A new trial is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Accordingly, the judgments are reversed, the verdicts set aside, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b820-9\">We identify each of the children by a pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b820-10\">At trial, Ellen also testified that the defendant began to behave inappropriately toward her when she was between ten and twelve years old, when, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>according to her testimony, she would often sleep in his bedroom, along with her two brothers. At first, she testified, the defendant touched her breasts and rubbed his clothed groin against hers. Later, she said, the defendant rubbed her genitals with his hand. Ellen alleged that shortly before the date of the alleged rape, the defendant digitally raped her on two or three separate occasions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b821-8\">There was testimony that, on returning home from the fiftieth wedding anniversary party, Ellen became very angry and upset when her grandmother refused to let her use the computer because it was too late in the evening.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Defense counsel learned of the previous examination while reading a file compiled by the Department of Social Services. The examination had taken place some ten or more days after Ellen had alleged that she had been sexually assaulted at school. The file produced to the defendant and reproduced in the record provides no information as to the circumstances of the alleged sexual assault at school. It contains only the social worker\u2019s report of her investigation into the reason for the mother\u2019s delay in taking Ellen to see a doctor after Ellen had complained of being sexually assaulted at school.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b823-7\">It is unclear from the record whether at the time of the hearing the Commonwealth knew the name of the doctor who had examined Ellen in January, 2001. The record does not provide sufficient details for us to determine whether the defendant\u2019s second motion should have been allowed under a narrow exception to the general rule that a defendant may not require a prosecutor to pose questions to government witnesses on behalf of the defense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beal, </em>429 Mass. 530, 534-535 &amp; n.4 (1999) (prosecutor\u2019s intentional avoidance of potentially exculpatory evidence constitutes \u201ca serious breach of professional ethics\u201d). We need not address the point because, as the defendant notes on appeal, an inquiry or, if necessary, a summons pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 17 (a) (2), 378 Mass. 885 (1979), to the Department of Social Services could have produced records containing the name of the doctor who examined Ellen in January, 2001. The department\u2019s file included a notation by the social worker that she had contacted the doctor with whom the mother had scheduled the January pelvic examination for Ellen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b824-6\">We cannot ascertain from the record whether Ellen\u2019s earlier accusations of a sexual assault at school led to a prosecution and whether her claims were truthful. A complainant\u2019s previous false allegations of sexual assault may in certain cases be admissible when the veracity of a complainant\u2019s later allegation of sexual assault is questioned. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>423 Mass. 216, 226 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sperrazza, </em>379 Mass. 166, 169 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, </em>376 Mass. 90, 94-96 (1978), <em>S.C., </em>385 Mass. 733 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b824-7\">Neither defense counsel nor the motion judge had the benefit of our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lampron, </em>441 Mass. 265 (2004).
