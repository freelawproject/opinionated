L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, to correct the docket entries recording the dispositions of complaints brought against a juvenile and Francisco Romero. The juvenile had admitted to facts sufficient for a finding of delinquency, after which a judge in the Juvenile Court placed him on \u201cpretrial probation\u201d for six months. The docket reflects the tender and acceptance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>admission and a disposition of \u201cpretrial probation.\u201d Similarly, a judge in the District Court placed Romero on \u201cpretrial probation\u201d for 364 days after he admitted to facts sufficient for a guilty finding on a complaint of assault and battery. The docket identifies \u201cpretrial probation\u201d as the disposition and appears to indicate that Romero admitted to sufficient facts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In each case, the judge indicated an intention to dismiss the complaint if the defendant completed his probationary period without incident. The Commonwealth objected to the dispositions and filed motions to correct the dockets to reflect that the dispositions were in fact \u201ccontinuances without a finding,\u201d after an \u201cadmission to sufficient facts.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that there is no legally cognizable disposition of \u201cpretrial probation\u201d after an \u201cadmission to sufficient facts\u201d distinct from a \u201ccontinu[once] without a finding\u201d conditioned on probation, a disposition authorized by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18. Consequently, the dispositions imposed were not in conformance with the law. Insofar as the denial of the Commonwealth\u2019s petition was based on the single justice\u2019s conclusion that \u201cpretrial probation and dismissal\u201d is a disposition permitted under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, it was in error. The cases are to be remanded to their respective trial courts with direction that the defendants be given the option to withdraw their admissions. If they choose not to do so, the dockets are to be corrected to reflect the lawful sentences of \u201ccontinuance without a finding\u201d conditioned on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>The juvenile. </em>In December, 2002, a delinquency complaint was issued against the juvenile for wilful and malicious destruction of property exceeding $250 in value, in violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 127. The Commonwealth requested that the case be continued without a finding for six months and that the juvenile pay restitution. On March 3, 2003, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>a judge in the Boston Juvenile Court placed the juvenile on pretrial probation for six months, over the Commonwealth\u2019s objection, and without requiring either a guilty plea or an admission. After a subsequent review of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tim T., </em>437 Mass. 592 (2002), the judge determined \u201cthat a disposition of pre-trial probation, over the objections of the Commonwealth, cannot enter without an admission to sufficient facts made by the defendant.\u201d Consequently, at a hearing on April 2, the juvenile waived his rights to a trial and admitted to sufficient facts for a finding of delinquency. The disposition of \u201cpretrial probation\u201d remained in place. At the Commonwealth\u2019s request, the judge issued written findings and rulings on August 7, 2003. The judge determined that G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, permitted her to impose pretrial probation after an admission to sufficient facts and to dismiss the charge after the successful completion of the probationary period.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She concluded that this disposition was \u201cessentially the same as continuing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>case without a finding [of delinquency]\u201d but that it was in \u201cthe interests of public justice\u201d to impose \u201cpretrial probation\u201d instead, because the juvenile would lose his job with the State parole board, \u201chis sole mechanism for paying restitution,\u201d if the court continued the case a without a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">On August 20, the Commonwealth filed a motion to correct the court docket. Five days later, pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 42, 378 Mass. 919 (1979), the Commonwealth filed an amended motion to correct the docket, asserting that the court should have recorded a disposition of \u201ccontinuance without a finding,\u201d rather than \u201cpretrial probation.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The motions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">b. <em>Romero. </em>On June 11, 2003, Romero was charged with assault and battery, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A. In August, Romero filed a motion in the Chelsea District Court seeking pretrial probation on an admission to facts sufficient for a finding of assault and battery. He specifically requested that the court \u201cneither enter a disposition of guilty nor a continuance without a finding on the docket, but rather order the docket to read that after an admission to sufficient facts, the defendant is placed on pre-trial probation pursuant to G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 87.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On August 26, the judge allowed the motion over the objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>of the Commonwealth, accepted Romero\u2019s admission to sufficient facts, and imposed a disposition of pretrial probation for 364 days following Romero\u2019s admission. The Commonwealth moved to correct the docket. On September 24, after a hearing, the judge denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">c. <em>Commonwealth\u2019s petition for relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. </em>In September, 2003, the Commonwealth filed a petition, pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, requesting that the single justice order the dockets corrected.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The petition was predicated on the theory that the dispositions imposed were not legally cognizable. A single justice denied the Commonwealth\u2019s request for relief, and this timely appeal followed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 18, permits a criminal defendant, \u201cwith whom the commonwealth cannot reach agreement for a recommended disposition,\u201d \u201cto tender a plea of guilty together with a request for a specific disposition.\u201d Under the statute, \u201can admission of facts sufficient for finding of guilt\u201d (admission) constitutes \u201ca tender of a plea of guilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On pleading guilty, a defendant may request any disposition within the court\u2019s jurisdiction, \u201cincluding, unless otherwise prohibited by law, <em>a dispositional request </em>that a guilty finding not be entered, but rather the case be continued without a finding to a specific date thereupon to be dismissed, such continuance conditioned upon compliance with specific terms and conditions or that the defendant be placed on probation pursuant to the provisions of [G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 87]\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>General Laws c. 276, \u00a7 87 (probation statute), does not use the words \u201cpretrial probation,\u201d but permits trial judges to place on probation any person charged with an offense, \u201cwith the defendant\u2019s consent, <em>before </em>trial and <em>before </em>a plea of guilty\u201d (commonly referred to as \u201cpretrial probation\u201d), \u201cor in any case <em>after </em>a finding or verdict of guilty\u201d (emphasis added). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>statute makes no provision for the imposition of probation <em>after </em>a plea of guilty, but before a finding or verdict of guilty is entered. Such a disposition is only authorized by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, as part of \u201ca dispositional request.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The defendants contend that when construed together, G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, and the probation statute permit a judge to place a defendant on \u201cpretrial probation.\u201d In essence, they read G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, as authorizing a judge to accept a guilty plea, not enter a finding, and place a defendant on any form of probation available under the probation statute. Since \u201cpretrial probation\u201d is a form of probation permitted by the probation statute, it therefore can be imposed as a disposition under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18. The Commonwealth, on the other hand, contends that if a judge chooses not to enter a finding of guilt after a plea or an admission, the judge must dispose of the case by \u201ccontinu[ing] [it] without a finding to a specific date thereupon to be dismissed,\u201d a condition of which can be, among other things, probation under the probation statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Viewed from one perspective, this debate appears to be more about semantics than substance. Under either scenario, an admission is made, no finding is entered, the case is continued to a date certain to be dismissed, and probation conditions are imposed for the period of the continuance. But the Commonwealth correctly points out that the precise wording of the \u201cdispositional request\u201d authorized by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, is significant, and there is every reason to conclude that the Legislature chose the words \u201ccontinued without a finding\u201d with care. Evidence of this can be gleaned from the Legislature\u2019s explicit prohibition against imposing a \u201ccontinued without a finding\u201d disposition in a wide range of specific crimes.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It would be extraordinary indeed for us to conclude that in spite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>of the statutory prohibitions on the use of this disposition, the Legislature in fact intended to create an alternative nearly identical disposition under a different label (pretrial probation).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Moreover, the reason this dispute arises is because it is apparent that in the practical world there is, at least for the moment, a difference in how these differently worded dispositions might be considered by other judicial departments and State and Federal law enforcement agencies, and under various regulatory schemes that have now incorporated the \u201ccontinued without a finding\u201d disposition into their lexicon, but which may not yet understand (or may misunderstand) the meaning of a \u201cpretrial probation\u201d disposition.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In this regard, we agree with the Commonwealth that uniformity, accuracy, and consistency in the description of dispositions is of systemic importance. To permit the use of the same terminology (pretrial probation) to describe both a pretrial condition of release and a postadmission disposition will, eventually, lead to a lack of certainty and a lack of credibility in official records on which important decisions depend each day.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This, in our view, would be contrary to the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, by which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>codified, regularized, and placed limits on a disposition practice that had previously been one of judicial creation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rotonda, </em>434 Mass. 211, 217 (2001) (G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, codified continuance without finding practice with new statutory procedures); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brandano, </em>359 Mass. 332 (1971) (judicially creating practice and procedure for dismissing criminal charges after continuance).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">In addition, the language of the statute does not support the defendants\u2019 position. The \u201cdispositional request\u201d authorized by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, is not made available to a defendant in the absence of a guilty plea. Once such a plea or admission is accepted, guilt has been established, there will never be a trial, and the case has moved to the dispositional phase of the proceeding. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Villalobos, </em>437 Mass. 797, 801 (2002) (\u201cadmission to sufficient facts may lead to ... an immediate conviction and sentence . . . during the continuance period in the event of a violation of the continuance terms\u201d). See commentary to Rule 9 of the District Court Rules for Probation Violation Proceedings (2005) (addressing violation of conditions of probation imposed with continuance without finding). Consequently, the probation statute\u2019s provision permitting the imposition of probation <em>\u201cbefore </em>trial or <em>before </em>a guilty plea\u201d is plainly inapplicable (emphasis added). Simply put, if probation is imposed as a disposition under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, it is not \u201cpretrial\u201d probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The defendants point out that G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, is not a model of clarity, and rely on its awkward wording further to support their position. They urge that we parse and tweak the relevant portion of the statute so that it creates two different forms of disposition by permitting a defendant who has tendered a plea of guilty to request \u201cthat a guilty finding not be entered, but rather [that] [1] the case be continued without a finding to a specific date thereupon to be dismissed, such continuance conditioned upon compliance with specific terms and conditions [,] or [2] that the defendant be placed on probation pursuant to the provisions of [the probation statute].\u201d Even under this construction, however, a disposition of \u201cpretrial probation\u201d would not be authorized. General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 18, speaks of \u201cprobation,\u201d not \u201cpretrial probation.\u201d And, as noted above, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>probation imposed under the probation statute after a guilty plea has been tendered and accepted by the court is not \u201cpretrial\u201d probation. At best, the defendants\u2019 reading would permit a judge to impose a period of \u201cprobation,\u201d after a guilty plea or an admission, without entering a finding of guilt on the record. But this is the equivalent in every respect of a \u201ccontinuance without a finding\u201d conditioned on probation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The statute speaks in the singular of \u201ca dispositional request\u201d in which a \u201cguilty finding [is] not . . . entered, but rather the case [is] continued without a finding.\u201d This, combined with our view of the Legislature\u2019s intent with respect to the codification and use of the \u201ccontinuance without a finding\u201d disposition when it enacted G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, leads us to conclude that it did not intend to create two alternatives, identical in substance and distinguished in name only. We therefore construe the statute to permit a judge to impose on a defendant who has tendered a plea of guilty a disposition \u201cthat a guilty finding not be entered, but rather the case be continued without a finding to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>a specific date thereupon to be dismissed, such continuance conditioned upon compliance with specific terms and conditions or . . . the defendant be[ing] placed on probation pursuant to the provisions of [the probation statute].\u201d This is consistent with our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rotonda, supra </em>at 217, where, in examining a related aspect of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, we stated that a disposition of a continuance without a finding \u201c[is] to be conditioned <em>either </em>on compliance with specific terms and conditions set by the District Court <em>or, </em>in the alternative, by placing the defendant on probation during the period of the continuance pursuant to the provisions of G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 87.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ab-dedup-0\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>Because no statute authorizes a disposition of \u201cpretrial probation\u201d after an admission to sufficient facts, the dispositions imposed by the Juvenile Court judge and the District Court judge were unlawful. We thus remand this case to the county court for entry of a judgment remanding the cases to their respective Juvenile and District Courts for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The box on the criminal docket describing the \u201cDisposition Method\u201d as \u201cGuilty Plea or Admission to Sufficient Facts\u201d is not checked, but the \u201cAdmission to Sufficient Facts\u201d description is underlined.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b323-8\">On appeal, the Commonwealth also contends that the records of the criminal history systems board (probation records) are inaccurate.

L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, permits a judge to order \u201cpretrial\u201d probation as a disposition after an admission to facts sufficient for a finding of guilt. In that case, the issue was \u201cwhether art. 30 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution permit[ted] a judge (prior to verdict, finding, or plea) to dismiss a legally adequate criminal indictment in the \u2018interests of public justice\u2019 over the Commonwealth\u2019s objection.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cheney, supra </em>at 568. We held that it does not. <em>Id. </em>In dicta, we also stated \u201cthat G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18, only permitted the use of pretrial probation and dismissal as a disposition after the tender of a guilty plea or an admission to sufficient facts, and, in any event, would not have permitted such a disposition to be imposed in a case involving an indictment under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, where a continuance without a finding is \u2018otherwise prohibited by law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cheney, supra </em>at 571, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tim T., </em>437 Mass. 592, 595 &amp; n.2 (2002). While the use of the word \u201cpretrial\u201d might seem to support the defendants\u2019 contention, the import of this passage does not. In essence the language suggests that the imposition of probation (referred to as \u201cpretrial\u201d probation) after an admission to sufficient facts in fact constitutes a \u201ccontinuance without a finding\u201d (subject to probation) for purposes of the operation of the statute. To the extent that our use of the word \u201cpretrial\" might have been relied on to support the dispositions here, we note that its use in both <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tim T., supra, </em>and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cheney, supra, </em>was technically inaccurate. As explained in the present opinion, probation imposed after a guilty plea or an admission is not \u201cpretrial\u201d probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b331-6\">A sentencing judge is, of course, also permitted to place a defendant on probation after entering a finding of guilt to the extent that it is otherwise \u201cwithin the court\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d to do so. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 18.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
