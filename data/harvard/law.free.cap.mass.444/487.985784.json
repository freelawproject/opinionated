Baker, an adopted child, is a beneficiary of two trusts created pursuant to her great-grandmother\u2019s will for the benefit of the testator\u2019s granddaughters and their \u201clawful issue.\u201d The statutory rule of construction at the time of the testator\u2019s 1936 death included as \u201cissue\u201d an adopted great-granddaughter only if \u201cit plainly appears to have been the intention\u201d of the testator to do so. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 210, \u00a7 8. St. 1876, c. 213, \u00a7 9. Because the intent is not plainly apparent here, we conclude that Baker is not a beneficiary of the trusts. We also reject Baker\u2019s constitutional challenge to the statute at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\"><em>Background. </em>We first recite the facts as found by a judge in the Probate and Family Court and agreed to by the parties, before turning to the procedural history of this case. On January 16, 1934, Ella E. Williams, a maternal great-grandmother of Baker, executed the will that is the subject of this litigation. Williams was represented by an attorney in the preparation and execution of the will. She executed a subsequent codicil on February 12, 1936, that deleted two cash legacies but otherwise ratified and confirmed her will. Williams\u2019s will was allowed by the Probate and Family Court on May 4, 1936, following her death on February 28, 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">The will established two trusts. The terms of the trusts provide that the income from the trusts was to be paid in equal shares to Williams\u2019s two granddaughters, Frances T. Carpenter (Baker\u2019s mother) (Carpenter) and Ruth Taylor Carver (Carver), until the first of them died. After the death of one granddaughter, the deceased granddaughter\u2019s share of the trust income was to be paid to her \u201clawful issue\u201d then living by right of representation during the life of the surviving granddaughter, who would continue to receive her share of the income from the trusts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>After the surviving granddaughter died, the trusts were to terminate. Pursuant to the terms of one trust, one-half of the property in the trust was to be distributed to the \u201cissue\u201d of Carpenter by right of representation and the other half to the \u201clawful issue\u201d of Carver by right of representation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Pursuant to the terms of the other trust, one-half of the property in the trust was to be distributed to the \u201clawful issue\u201d of Carpenter and the other half to the \u201clawful issue\u201d of Carver, both by right of representation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">Carpenter and her husband, William T. Carpenter, had two biological sons. The older, William (William Jr.), was bom on December 8, 1929. The younger, Jere, was bom on April 15, 1932, and died (without issue) on February 2, 1945. Baker, who was bom on October 25, 1940, began living in the Carpenters\u2019 home in 1946, when she was five years old. The Carpenters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>adopted her when she was six years old. Frances Carpenter died on January 20, 1996, survived by William Jr.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Baker. The income from the share of the trusts formerly paid to Carpenter was paid only to her son, William Jr., and not to Baker.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Williams\u2019s second granddaughter, Carver, died on August 10, 2001, survived by a daughter, Pauline C. Watson, a trustee of the trusts, and three grandchildren bom to a second daughter who predeceased Carver, each of whom was named an interested party in this case. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>As a result of the deaths of Carpenter and Carver, the trustees must distribute the remaining property of the trusts in accordance with the tmst terms. See notes 4, 5, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Both before and after Carver\u2019s death, Baker, through counsel, notified the trustees of her belief that she is a beneficiary of the trusts. Accordingly, in July, 2002, before making a final distribution of the trust assets pursuant to G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, the trustees<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> filed a complaint in the Probate and Family Court for Essex County, which had probated Williams\u2019s will and continued to oversee the administration of the trusts. The complaint sought declaratory judgment pursuant to G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6, that Baker is not a beneficiary of the tmsts because she is adopted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Baker filed an answer in September, 2002, asserting that Williams\u2019s repeated use of the word \u201clawful\u201d before \u201cissue\u201d in the will requires Baker\u2019s inclusion as a beneficiary. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>also challenged the constitutionality of the applicable statutory rule of construction, asserting that it violates the equal protection rights of adopted children. In November, 2002, the trustees moved for judgment on the pleadings. William Jr., in his role as an interested party, filed an answer in April, 2003, also seeking a declaration that Baker is not a beneficiary. In March, 2004, after conducting limited discovery, Baker filed a request for a hearing and filed a cross motion for summary judgment. In her motion for summary judgment, which the interested parties opposed, Baker sought a declaration that she is a beneficiary of the trusts and entitled to receive one-half of the remainder of the trusts allocated to her mother\u2019s lawful issue, and one-half of the net income of the trusts allocated to her mother\u2019s lawful issue that accrued after her mother\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">In May, 2004, after the briefing of the cross motions was completed, Baker requested that the Probate and Family Court reserve decision and report the case to the Appeals Court, see G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 13, and Mass. R. Civ. P. 64, as amended, 423 Mass. 1410 (1996), which a Probate and Family Court judge allowed. She also issued findings of fact that were agreed on by the trustees, Baker, and Judith Carpenter. We granted Baker\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>We first address Baker\u2019s contention that her great-grandmother\u2019s will, properly construed, includes her as a beneficiary of the trusts because she is \u201clawful issue\u201d of Frances Carpenter. \u201cIt is fundamental that a trust instrument must be construed to give effect to the intention of the donor as ascertained from the language of the whole instrument considered in the light of circumstances known to the donor at the time of its execution.\u201d <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>399 Mass. 650, 653 (1987), quoting <em>Groden </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>382 Mass. 333, 335 (1981). \u201cWhen a will is drafted by a person familiar with the accurate use of legal terms, it is presumed that the legal terms were used correctly and with the intent that they be interpreted in conformity with the law.\u201d <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Wilbur, </em>431 Mass. 429, 436 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The version of G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 8, that existed at Williams\u2019s death was enacted in 1876. St. 1876, c. 213, \u00a7 9. See note 8, <em>supra. </em>It was likely that the Legislature passed the statute as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>consequence of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Sewall </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>115 Mass. 262 (1874), which construed a predecessor statute to provide that a child adopted in 1865 by the settlor of an irrevocable trust established in 1825 took as a child or issue of the settlor. See <em>Wyeth </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>144 Mass. 441, 442-444 (1887) (describing circumstances leading to enactment of 1876 statute). The 1876 statute established a rule of construction that resolved whether the word \u201cchild\u201d or its equivalent when used in a will or other specified instruments included an adopted child. The rule included children adopted by the testator, and excluded children not adopted by the testator, unless it \u201cplainly appears\u201d that the testator had a contrary intent. The matter was settled until 1958, when the Legislature reversed the rule\u2019s presumption to reflect changing societal attitudes toward adopted children. See St. 1958, c. 121, \u00a7 1. Ever since, the term \u201cchild\u201d or its equivalent in a testator\u2019s will has included an adopted child, absent a clearly stated contrary intent, regardless of who adopted the child.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u201cGeneral Laws c. 210, \u00a7 8 (and its predecessors), as it (and they) read before the 1958 amendment, was applied with uniformity to prevent a child, adopted by someone not the testator or settlor, from taking as \u2018issue\u2019 an interest under a trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>instrument.\u201d <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>361 Mass. 172, 178, appeal dismissed, 409 U.S. 813 (1972), and cases cited. We have held that \u201cwe would follow the earlier cases\u201d despite \u201cthe enactment of the 1958 amendment, with respect to instruments executed before the effective date of the amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>New England Merchants Nat'l Bank </em>v. <em>Groswold, </em>387 Mass. 822, 827 (1983) (\u201cthe law in effect at the time of the testator\u2019s death is the applicable law\u201d). Baker challenges the continuing constitutionality of these rulings, a contention we address below. Baker also argues that the use by Williams of the phrase \u201clawful issue\u201d in place of the single word \u201cissue\u201d manifests Williams\u2019s intent to include adoptees as beneficiaries, and thereby distinguishes this case from those in which this court has prevented \u201ca child, adopted by someone not the testator or settlor, from taking as \u2018issue\u2019 an interest under a trust instrument.\u201d <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Fleming, supra. </em>We disagree. \u201cMerely being able to raise a rational inference on the basis of textual interpretation is not sufficient to meet the \u2018plainly appears\u2019 standard of G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 210, \u00a7 8.\u201d <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 509, 514 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">It does not plainly appear from the language of Williams\u2019s will and codicil, \u201cconsidered in the light of circumstances known to [Williams] at the time of its execution,\u201d <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, supra </em>at 653, that she intended to include any adopted issue of her granddaughters in the class of beneficiaries created by the trusts. Williams had no adopted issue when she executed her will or the codicil, or at the time of her death. Furthermore, she could not have intended specifically to include Baker because Baker had not yet been bom, let alone adopted, when Williams died. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Hannam, </em>369 Mass. 26, 31-32 (1975); <em>Hutchins </em>v. <em>Browne, </em>253 Mass. 55, 58-59 (1925); Restatement of Property \u00a7 287(2)(b) &amp; comments d, g, and h, at 1522-1527 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">It is unclear precisely what Williams intended by using the phrase \u201clawful issue\u201d rather than the single word \u201cissue\u201d in the tmst instmment. Of particular concern here is that Williams used \u201cissue\u201d once in the provisions for one of the trusts even though she used \u201clawful issue\u201d in all other relevant provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>of both trusts. Compare note 4, <em>supra, </em>with note 5, <em>supra. </em>We disagree with Baker\u2019s assertion that this was nothing more than a drafting error. The terms \u201cissue\u201d and \u201clawful issue\u201d appear throughout the will and it is equally, if not more, likely that Williams used the terms \u201cissue\u201d and \u201clawful issue\u201d interchangeably.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Even if Williams did intend \u201clawful issue\u201d to mean something different from \u201cissue,\u201d her use of the adjective \u201clawful\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> was unnecessary if Williams meant thereby to exclude nonmarital children, because it was well settled that \u201cissue\u201d did not include children bom outside of marriage. See <em>Fiduciary Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Mishou, </em>321 Mass. 615, 634 (1947), overruled by <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, supra </em>at 661-662 (\u201cby the common law of a few generations ago such words as issue, ... in the absence of anything indicating a contrary intent, meant only persons of the class who were bom in lawful wedlock\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We agree with Baker insofar as Williams <em>may </em>have used the adjective in an effort to include individuals who became issue by legal processes, including children bom into a marriage, or acknowledged non-marital children, or nonmarital children whose parents later married, or even adopted children.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>131 S.W.3d 524, 535 (Tex. Ct. App. 2004); <em>Penland </em>v. <em>Agnich, </em>940 S.W.2d 324, 327 (Tex. Ct. App. 1997). In the complete absence of other evidence probative of Williams\u2019s feelings toward adop-tees, \u201c[sjuch a plausible interpretive analysis,\u201d however, does not \u201cyield the sort of obvious and unequivocal manifestation\u201d of Williams\u2019s intent necessary to overcome the presumption that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>adopted great-grandchildren are excluded from the class of \u201clawful issue.\u201d <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Evans, supra </em>at 514. See G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 210, \u00a7 8. Contrast <em>Penland </em>v. <em>Agnich, supra </em>(fact that testator bequeathed majority of estate to family members not related to him by blood disclosed his intent that \u201clawful issue\u201d include adoptees).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">Williams executed her will \u201cwith assistance of counsel, and it would not be unreasonable to assume that the testator was familiar with the law governing adopted issue, which had been in effect since 1876, and that if [Williams] had wished to include adopted issue [she] would have done so in accordance with the law.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Hannam, supra </em>at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">We turn now to Baker\u2019s contention that application of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 210, \u00a7 8, in the circumstances of this case, violates the equal protection rights of adoptees. \u201cThe guarantees of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment are directed solely to limiting the actions of government.\u201d <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, supra </em>at 654. In <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, supra, </em>we held that \u201cState action is not involved, nor is the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment [to the United States Constitution] implicated, when courts apply rules of construction to wills or trust instruments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 656. Although the rule of construction we considered in that case was created judicially, the same logic applies to rules of construction created by the Legislature, including G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 210, \u00a7 8. When words are \u201cused in a legal instrument, with or without explication, it is the donors and testators who act, not this court nor any other arm of the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655. Because application of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 210, \u00a7 8, involves no State action, and does not bar an adopted person from taking under the terms of a will or trust, there can be no equal protection violation. Contrast <em>Trimble </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>430 U.S. 762, 775 n.16 (1977) (finding State action in statute barring nonmarital child from inheriting from intestate father, because \u201cintestate succession laws are acts of States, not of individuals\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Here, Williams was free to express her intent using any words she wished. Had Williams intended to benefit adopted great-grandchildren, she could have done so by choosing words that would not have invoked the rule of construction here at issue. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>She could have refrained from using words \u201cwhose meaning . . . would remain ambiguous\u201d without resort to the rule of construction. <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, supra. </em>Instead, Williams chose to use a word, \u201cissue,\u201d whose meaning is supplied by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 210, \u00a7 8, as discussed above, despite the presumption that she knew the effect of the rule of construction. Accordingly, it was Williams, and not the State, who deprived Baker of her potential status as a beneficiary of the trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the above reasons, we remand the case to the Probate and Family Court for entry of a judgment declaring that Ruth W. Baker is not a beneficiary of the trusts. Accordingly, she is entitled neither to share in the distribution of the trust assets nor to any of the income of the trusts that was distributed to William T. Carpenter, Jr., following the death of Frances T. Carpenter.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b505-5\">In Article First of her will, Williams funded this trust with $50,000.

L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 210, \u00a7 8, and that the rule of construction therefore does not apply to Williams\u2019s will.
