L. c. 265, \u00a7 43A, based on a series of homophobic statements she made over the course of more than one and one-half years to and about the complaining witnesses, Stephen Robichau and Frank Brienza.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Appeals Court affirmed the defendant\u2019s convictions in an unpublished memorandum and order pursuant to its rule 1:28. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 1008 (2004). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review. She contends that (1) there was insufficient evidence to support her convictions under the criminal harassment statute; (2) the criminal harassment statute is unconstitutionally overbroad on its face because it criminalizes speech protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and art. 16 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; and (3) the statute, as applied to her, violates her rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments and art. 16. Because we conclude that the defendant\u2019s conduct does not satisfy the elements of the statute, we reverse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\"><em>Factual background. </em>In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we consider the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sandler, </em>368 Mass. 729, 740 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">During the relevant period, the complainants Stephen Robichau <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>and Frank Brienza lived together in an apartment on the third floor of a twelve-unit apartment building in Lynn, almost directly across the hall from the defendant. At the time of the incidents, Robichau and Brienza had been in an intimate relationship for over twenty years. At various times before (and possibly during) the alleged harassment, the defendant, Robichau, and Brienza enjoyed a friendly relationship, and the defendant was particularly social with Robichau. During the spring of 1999, the relationship became contentious when one of the men suspected the defendant of stealing jewelry from him. Shortly thereafter, the defendant made the first of a series of hateful and bigoted comments at or about Robichau and Brienza based on their sexual orientation. These comments (there is_ evidence of seven incidents in the record)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> formed the basis of two criminal complaints filed in Lynn District Court. One complaint alleged the criminal harassment of Brienza, and a second complaint alleged the criminal harassment of Robichau.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We set forth the facts of the seven incidents in chronological order, noting that the first three incidents took place prior to the effective date of the criminal harassment statute, October 30, 2000. See note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">The first incident occurred on May 31, 1999. While at home, Robichau and Brienza heard loud noises outside. The defendant, her former boy friend, and two other tenants were sitting in front of the apartment building drinking beer and conversing loudly. Robichau and Brienza stepped out onto their balcony and asked the group to quiet down and not to block the stairs. According to Brienza, the defendant called the plaintiffs \u201cfag-gots\u201d and \u201cqueers,\u201d and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back in the house, you fucking queers?\u201d Robichau testified that the defendant said to him, \u201cShut up, you fucking fag.\u201d The two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>men telephoned the police, who came to the apartment and spoke to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">The second incident was on the following Saturday, again while both men were home. The defendant and her friend stood outside the apartment building, underneath Robichau and Brien-za\u2019s bedroom window, looking up at them and yelling homophobic comments for about thirty minutes to one hour.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Brienza testified that the defendant called him and Robichau \u201cfaggots,\u201d \u201cqueers,\u201d and \u201ccock suckers,\u201d and yelled, \u201cWe\u2019ll get you,\u201d and \u201cYou will pay for this.\u201d Robichau recalled the defendant yelling \u201cwe hate queers.\u201d Again, the two men contacted the police, who apparently arrived after the defendant had stopped yelling.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The third incident occurred a few months later at the end of October, 1999. When Brienza returned home from work and got out of his car in the parking lot beside the apartment building, the defendant yelled from her open window on the third floor, \u201cThe queer is home now, the fucking queer is home now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">In a fourth encounter in December, 2000 (the first incident to occur after the harassment statute became effective), the defendant was talking loudly with a gentleman in the hallway outside Robichau and Brienza\u2019s apartment. Robichau poked his head out his apartment door and asked the defendant to quiet down. The defendant turned to the gentleman and said, \u201cOh, yeah, he\u2019s a fucking fag. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">The fifth incident, on January 24, 2001, occurred when both Robichau and Brienza were home. The men overheard two or more women talking in a \u201cnormal\u201d tone outside the building below their window, mentioning \u201cthe queers up on the third floor.\u201d Brienza heard the defendant say, \u201cWe\u2019ll get their ass. It\u2019s about time. We have to get rid of these fucking queers.\u201d Robichau heard one of the individuals (not the defendant) state, \u201cYeah, we\u2019ll get him. We\u2019ll fuck him up. We\u2019ll get rid of him.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>In response, the defendant stated, \u201cI\u2019m on board,\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll get rid of him.\u201d During the conversation, the defendant also used the slurs \u201cfag,\u201d \u201cqueer,\u201d and \u201ccock sucker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">During the sixth incident on January 26, 2001, Robichau was in his bedroom. He discovered the defendant outside, once again below his bedroom window, looking up at the window and screaming, \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault you like to take it up the ass.\u201d Ro-bichau telephoned the police, who spoke to both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">In the seventh and final incident, which, the parties suggest, occurred the next day, Robichau was in his apartment when he heard the defendant yelling, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. They\u2019re just fags. We can deal with them. I know people. I\u2019ll deal with them.\u201d The defendant was in her own apartment at the time she made these statements but was yelling loudly enough that Robichau thought she was \u201cright outside [his] door.\u201d Robichau once again contacted the police.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Robichau testified that the sum of the incidents made him \u201cfearful,\u201d that he \u201cis [ajgoraphobic,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he end result of this was it became nearly impossible for [him] to leave [his] apartment. . . .\u201d The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motions for required findings of not guilty as to the harassment charges at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and again at the close of all the evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\"><em>Discussion. </em>This court has not had the opportunity to consider the elements of the new criminal harassment statute, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43A. We first consider the nature and scope of the \u201cpattern of conduct or series of acts\u201d that constitutes criminal harassment. <em>Id. </em>We then consider the meaning of the statutory requirement that such conduct be \u201cdirected at a specific person,\u201d and whether harassing conduct that occurred prior to the effective date of the statute may be punishable. We apply the statute, as construed, to the defendant\u2019s conduct in the present case and conclude that there is insufficient evidence to convict. Finally, because the issue was thoroughly briefed and future application of the statute is likely to give rise to similar concerns, we discuss whether the statute, as interpreted today, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>consonant with our Federal and State constitutional guarantees of free speech. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilfedder, </em>321 Mass. 335, 338 (1947). See also <em>School Comm. of Springfield </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>366 Mass. 315 (1974), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 947 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">1. <em>Statutory construction. </em>We first consider whether hateful words, such as those employed by the defendant in this case, are criminalized by \u00a7 43A. We apply the general rule of statutory construction that a statute is to be interpreted \u201caccording to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>388 Mass. 326, 328 (1983), quoting <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513 (1975). Our starting point is therefore the plain language of the statute, see, e.g., <em>Simon </em>v. <em>State Examiners of Electricians, </em>395 Mass. 238, 242 (1985), but we also seek guidance from its legislative history, see <em>Oxford </em>v. <em>Oxford Water Co., </em>391 Mass. 581, 587-588 (1984), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welosky, </em>276 Mass. 398, 401-402 (1931), cert. denied, 284 U.S. 684 (1932), the language and construction of related statutes, see, e.g., <em>Boswell </em>v. <em>Zephyr Lines, Inc., </em>414 Mass. 241, 247 (1993), and the law of other jurisdictions, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melton, </em>436 Mass. 291, 296-297 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>395 Mass. 20, 29-30 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">A. <em>Harassing \u201cconduct\u201d or \u201cacts.\u201d </em>By its terms, the criminal harassment statute is applicable to a \u201cknowing pattern of conduct or series of acts.\u201d However, the statute provides no definition of the terms \u201cconduct\u201d or \u201cacts,\u201d nor does it indicate expressly whether such \u201cconduct\u201d or \u201cacts\u201d may include speech or statements, the \u201cconduct\u201d employed by the defendant in this case. \u201cWhen a statute does not define its words we give them their usual and accepted meanings, as long as these meanings are consistent with the statutory purpose. . . . We derive the words\u2019 usual and accepted meanings from sources presumably known to the statute\u2019s enactors, such as their use in other legal contexts and dictionary definitions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>442 Mass. 118, 124 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 366, 369 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>The nouns \u201cconduct\u201d and \u201cact\u201d are defined as involving intentional human behavior, and while neither word excludes the act of speaking, neither expressly embraces it. See Webster\u2019s Third New IntT Dictionary 20 (1993) (defining \u201cact\u201d as, in part, \u201ca sequence of human behavior . . . regulated by standards of conduct\u201d and \u201csomething done by a person pursuant to his volition\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 473 (\u201cconduct\u201d is, in part, \u201cthe act, manner, or process of carrying out. . . [and] a mode or standard of personal behavior especially] as based on moral principles\u201d). The definitions of \u201cspeech\u201d and \u201cstatement\u201d do not resolve the ambiguity. See <em>id. </em>at 2189 (\u201cspeech\u201d is, in part, \u201cthe act of speaking: communication or expression of thoughts in spoken words [and] a form or method of . . . communication\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 2229 (\u201cstatement\u201d is, in part, \u201cthe act or process of stating, reciting, or presenting orally\u201d). While it is often possible to distinguish between speech and conduct, courts have recognized that the two concepts frequently overlap and may be incapable of precise differentiation. See, e.g., <em>Texas </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>491 U.S. 397, 406 (1989) (States may not proscribe certain conduct because it contains expressive elements protected by First Amendment); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robicheau, </em>421 Mass. 176, 182-183 (1995) (speech that places victim in reasonable apprehension of imminent serious physical harm is conduct equivalent to crime of assault and is unprotected by First Amendment); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oakes, </em>407 Mass. 92, 95-96 (1990) (taking nude photographs of teenager neither \u201cpure speech\u201d nor \u201cmerely conduct,\u201d but \u201cmixed speech and conduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">This apparent ambiguity in the statutory language is resolved by reference to the remaining portions of the statute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Auth., </em>352 Mass. 617, 618 (1967), quoting <em>Bolster </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>319 Mass. 81, 84-85 (1946) (\u201cNone of the words of a statute is to be regarded as superfluous ... so that the enactment considered as a whole shall constitute a consistent and harmonious statutory provision capable of effectuating the presumed intention of the Legislature\u201d). See also <em>Kargman </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>389 Mass. 784, 788 (1983) (\u201cstatutes should be interpreted as a whole to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>constitute a consistent and harmonious provision\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>389 Mass. 265, 273 (1983) (following \u201cbasic principle of statutory construction that a statute must be read as a whole\u201d). The second (and only other) sentence in this paragraph of the criminal harassment statute reads: \u201cSuch conduct or acts described in this paragraph <em>shall include, but not be limited to, </em>conduct or acts conducted by mail or by use of a telephonic or telecommunication device including, but not limited to, electronic mail, internet communications or facsimile communications\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43A <em>(a). </em>This sentence appears to demonstrate a legislative intent to encompass speech within the definition of harassing conduct or acts. It clarifies that harassing \u201cconduct or series of acts,\u201d which otherwise meet the statutory elements, will not be exempt from punishment simply because they are conducted through certain methods of communication. <em>Id. </em>Given that the Legislature expressly articulated its intent to punish harassing words communicated through the mail and certain technological means, it follows that it contemplated that harassment could be in the form of speech. That the list of prohibited methods of communication in the statute is not exclusive further suggests that the Legislature did not intend to exempt oral communication from the statute\u2019s reach. To construe the criminal harassment statute as excluding harassing speech would ignore the impact of this second sentence and violate our principles of statutory construction. See <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Gormally, </em>440 Mass. 699, 704 (2004), quoting <em>Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>427 Mass. 136, 140 (1998) (\u201cbasic tenet of statutory construction requires that a statute \u2018be construed . . . \u201cso that no part will be inoperative or superfluous\u201d \u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Our determination that the criminal harassment statute was intended to proscribe harassing conduct encompassing \u201cspeech\u201d or \u201cstatements\u201d gains support from the language and construction of related statutes. See <em>Boswell </em>v. <em>Zephyr Lines, Inc., supra </em>(\u201cwe must attempt to construe [a statute] in harmony with other related statutes and rules so as to give rise to a consistent body of law\u201d). Particularly instructive to our analysis is the closely related criminal stalking statute, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43. The criminal harassment law was passed in response to a perceived loophole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>in the stalking statute. The stalking statute expressly included within its reach \u201cthreatening\u201d conduct or acts, but left without remedy those victims plagued by harassment that, although potentially dangerous, did not include an overt \u201cthreat\u201d and thus was not actionable under existing law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In drafting the harassment statute, the Legislature employed language nearly identical to that of the stalking statute but eliminated the threat requirement. See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43 (a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The criminal stalking statute prohibits conduct or acts that include threatening speech. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robicheau, supra </em>at 182-183 (upholding stalking conviction based in part on verbally threatening victim). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Matsos, </em>421 Mass. 391, 394-395 (1995), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>407 Mass. 340, 349 (1990) (in determining whether \u201cthreat\u201d element of stalking violation satisfied, \u201ccourt will look to the actions and <em>words </em>of the defendant in light of the attendant circumstances\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Also helpful is the definition of the term \u201charassment\u201d as used in the context of sexual harassment law. It was well established at the time of this statute\u2019s passage that sexual harassment encompasses harassing speech. See, e.g., G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25 (defining \u201csexual harassment\u201d in unemployment compensation statute as including \u201cverbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature\u201d); <em>Melnychenko </em>v. <em>84 Lumber Co., </em>424 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>285, 290 (1997), quoting G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (18) (\u201cVerbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, even if it does not include \u2018sexual advances\u2019 or \u2018requests for sexual favors,\u2019 comes within the statutory definition of sexual harassment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">Finally, other jurisdictions have construed similar statutes that proscribe harassing \u201cconduct\u201d as encompassing speech. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Cropley, </em>544 A.2d 302, 304 (Me. 1988) (harassment statute prohibits harassing speech unprotected by Constitution); <em>State </em>v. <em>Machholz, </em>574 N.W.2d 415, 420 (Minn. 1998) (harassing conduct proscribed by statute includes expressive conduct and speech); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>239 Pa. Super. 539, 543 (1976) (speech may constitute course of conduct within meaning of harassment statute). Given the second sentence in the criminal harassment statute, as well as the meaning of harassing conduct in related contexts, we conclude that the Legislature intended to include some harassing speech within the scope of the criminal harassment statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">B. <em>\u201cPattern\u201d or \u201cseries.\u201d </em>Our analysis regarding the scope of the \u201cconduct\u201d or \u201cacts\u201d that fall within the statute\u2019s reach does not end our inquiry. We have not had an occasion to consider the meaning of the words \u201cpattern\u201d and \u201cseries\u201d as used in the criminal harassment statute. We determine today that the phrase \u201cpattern of conduct or series of acts\u201d requires the Commonwealth to prove three or more incidents of harassment for the following reasons. First, the dictionary definition of \u201cseries\u201d is \u201ca group of <em>usu[ally] three or more things or events </em>standing or succeeding in order and having a like relationship to each other\u201d (emphasis added). Webster\u2019s Third New IntT Dictionary 2072 (1993). See <em>Commonwealth v. Bell, </em>442 Mass. 118, 124 (2004) (deriving meaning of statutory terms in part from dictionary definitions). Second, under the closely related criminal stalking statute, see discussion <em>supra, </em>we have required the Commonwealth to prove more than two incidents of harassment or stalking to support a conviction. See <em>Commonwealth v. Kwiatkowski, </em>418 Mass. 543, 548 (1994) (\u201cA pattern or series in the context of [stalking by harassment] would involve more than two incidents\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth v. Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 15 (1999). We can safely assume that when the Legislature enacted the criminal harassment statute it manifested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>an intent that a conviction under the statute requires proof of three or more incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">C. <em>Conduct \u201cdirected at a specific person.\u2019\u2019\u2019\u2019 </em>The statute further requires that the \u201cpattern of conduct or series of acts\u201d be \u201cdirected at a specific person.\u201d G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43A <em>(a). </em>Moreover, the statute clarifies that the \u201cspecific person\u201d referred to is the victim \u2014 the person who is \u201cseriously alarm[ed]\u201d by the harassment. <em>Id. </em>In short, this provision, by its plain terms, requires the Commonwealth to establish, at the very least, that the defendant intended to target the victim with the harassing conduct on at least three occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">D. <em>Prestatutory incidents. </em>Next we must determine whether the incidents that occurred in this case prior to the effective date of the statute, October 30, 2000, but which otherwise might meet the statutory requirements for harassing \u201cconduct\u201d or \u201cacts\u201d under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43A, may be considered among the three or more harassing incidents necessary to support a conviction. Our Federal and State Constitutions protect defendants against the application of ex post facto laws. See art. 1, \u00a7 10, of the United States Constitution; art. 24 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights (\u201cLaws made to punish for actions done before the existence of such laws, and which have not been declared crimes by preceding laws, are unjust, oppressive, and inconsistent with the fundamental principles of a free government\u201d). An ex post facto law is one that \u201cmakes an action done before the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal; and punishes such action.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>423 Mass. 1201, 1224 (1996), quoting <em>Calder </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 386, 390 (1798). See also <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Youngblood, </em>497 U.S. 37, 42 (1990). The Commonwealth asserts that a defendant may be convicted of criminal harassment without violating the law against ex post facto punishment where the last of three or more incidents occurred after the effective date of the statute. However, to consider prestatutory incidents of harassment, separated in time and circumstance from poststatutory incidents, when determining whether a person committed three or more offensive acts, would impermissibly make criminal those incidents that were lawful when committed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Catalina, </em>407 Mass. 779, 783 (1990) (\u201cA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>defendant cannot be prosecuted for an act which was not a crime when it was performed . . .\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corbett, </em>422 Mass. 391, 394 (1996) (no ex post facto problem where defendant convicted as third-time offender based on prior convictions before effective date of statute, because defendant was punished for third crime, not prior offenses, which \u201crelated only to the punishment he received for the current offense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">Even if a consideration of prestatutory incidents would not violate the ex post facto clauses of our Federal and State Constitutions, we do not read retroactivity into criminal harassment statutes where the Legislature has indicated no intent to do so. \u201cAbsent clear language to the contrary it is presumed that legislation is not intended to operate retroactively.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>421 Mass. 400, 407-408 (1995). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>380 Mass. 1, 16 (1980) (court \u201cdoes well to tread lightly\u201d in applying statutory amendments retroactively if doing so might implicate ex post facto provisions in a Federal or State Constitution). Therefore, we do not consider prestatu-tory incidents among the three or more incidents of harassing conduct necessary to make up the crime of harassment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">2. <em>Application to present case. </em>We now apply the statute, as construed, to the defendant\u2019s allegedly harassing conduct. In considering whether there was sufficient evidence to support a conviction under the criminal harassment statute as limited above, we must decide \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979), quoting <em>Jackson </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number><em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979). In particular, we must determine whether the judge, who did not have the benefit of our statutory construction, could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant engaged in at least three incidents of harassing conduct (here, speech) \u201cdirected at\u201d Robichau and Brienza, that occurred after the effective date of the statute.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43A <em>(a). </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, supra. </em>The judge determined that there were \u201cclose to a half a dozen episodes\u201d of harassment, and thus she concluded that there was sufficient evidence to meet the statutory requirement of a \u201cpattern\u201d of harassment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Of the seven incidents described in the record, the first three occurred before October 30, 2000, the effective date of the criminal statute, and may not be considered evidence of a \u201cpattern\u201d of harassing conduct. See discussion, <em>supra. </em>We consider only those four incidents that occurred after the effective date of the statute. We begin with an analysis of the January 24 and January 27, 2001 incidents (fifth and seventh, discussed <em>supra). </em>The January 24, 2001, incident involved the defendant speaking in a \u201cnormal\u201d tone to a third party outside the building below the complaining witnesses\u2019 window, and the January 27, 2001, incident consisted of the defendant\u2019s yelling while in her own apartment. Although the utterance of offensive language during these two incidents could meet the \u201cconduct\u201d or \u201cacts\u201d requirement of the statute, there was insufficient evidence that these incidents were \u201cdirected at\u201d Robichau or Brienza. The defendant (for unknown reasons) concedes that the January 24, 2001, incident meets the statutory requirements. However, as we have made clear, to be consistent with the constitutional requirements, any speech prohibited by the criminal harassment statute must be directed at a specific person. See discussion, <em>supra. </em>While the Commonwealth established that the offensive language was indeed overheard by the complaining witnesses, the record does not establish that the defendant intended the statements to be heard by Robichau or Brienza, nor that she should have known that the statements would be heard by them. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>The January 24 and January 27, 2001, incidents (incidents five and seven) are beyond the reach of the criminal harassment statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">This leaves only two poststatutory incidents as a possible basis for a conviction under the harassment statute (incidents four and six), an insufficient number to meet the \u201cpattern\u201d or \u201cseries\u201d requirement necessary to support a conviction. See discussion, <em>supra. </em>We therefore need not decide whether those two incidents meet the statutory elements for criminal harassment, and hold that the defendant\u2019s actions in this case, however offensive and hurtful to Robichau and Brienza, did not constitute criminal harassment within the meaning of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43A.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">3. <em>Constitutional concerns. </em>We do not generally consider constitutional questions unless their resolution is necessary to the disposition of the controversy before us. See, e.g., <em>Bynum </em>v. Commonwealth, 429 Mass. 705, 710 (1999). In this case, having determined that the defendant\u2019s conduct did not meet the requisite elements of the criminal harassment statute, our inquiry may end. However, in certain limited circumstances, we have exercised our judicial discretion to consider questions of constitutional dimension even where not necessary to the outcome of a case. See, e.g., <em>School Comm. of Springfield </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>366 Mass. 315 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilfedder, </em>321 Mass. 335, 338 (1947). Several factors motivate us to address the criminal harassment statute\u2019s constitutionality in this case. The parties have fully briefed them. More importantly, the statute, as we construe it, implicates important concerns of free speech and future application of this statute will likely give rise to challenges concerning its scope. \u201c[A] statute . . . which makes criminal a form of pure speech, must be interpreted with the commands of the First Amendment clearly in mind.\u201d <em>Watts </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 705, 707 (1969). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilfedder, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">We begin by canvassing the leading cases that have considered the constitutional limits on the criminalization of speech. Mindful of the constitutional limitations recognized by the United States Supreme Court, we analyze the criminal harassment statute, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43 <em>(a), </em>and conclude that it is not constitutionally infirm. We are guided in our analysis not only by decisions of the United States Supreme Court, but also by the canons of statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>construction that require us to construe statutes, where appropriate, to avoid rendering them unconstitutional. See, e.g., <em>School Comm. of Greenfield </em>v. <em>Greenfield Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>385 Mass. 70, 79 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balthazar, </em>366 Mass. 298, 301-302 &amp; n.2 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Although not an absolute rule, the Supreme Court has held that States generally may not proscribe speech based on its content. See <em>R.A.V. </em>v. <em>St. Paul, </em>505 U.S. 377, 387 (1992). At the same time, the Court has consistently recognized \u201ccertain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech\u201d that, precisely because of their content, may be constitutionally prohibited. <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 571 (1942). \u201cThe First Amendment permits \u2018restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas, which are \u201cof such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Virginia </em>v. <em>Black, </em>538 U.S. 343, 358-359 (2003), quoting <em>R.A.V. </em>v. <em>St. Paul, supra </em>at 382-383. \u201cThese include the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or \u2018fighting\u2019 words,\u201d <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, supra, </em>words \u201cdirected to inciting or producing imminent lawless action [that are] likely to incite or produce such action,\u201d <em>Brandenburg </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>395 U.S. 444, 447 (1969), and \u201ctrue \u2018threat[s].\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Watts </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 708. \u201cFighting words\u201d have been described by the Supreme Court as words \u201cwhich by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace\u201d and words \u201cplainly likely to cause a breach of the peace by the addressee.\u201d <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, supra </em>at 572, 573. The Court has also described \u201cfighting words\u201d as \u201cthose personally abusive epithets which, when addressed to the ordinary citizen, are, as a matter of common knowledge, inherently likely to provoke violent reaction.\u201d <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>California, </em>403 U.S. 15, 20 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Although the United States Supreme Court has never considered the constitutionality of a criminal statute that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>prohibits harassing speech, the Court has held unconstitutional several other laws aimed at proscribing conduct that might include speech, where those laws were not limited to \u201cfighting words\u201d or other forms of unprotected speech. See, e.g., <em>Madsen </em>v. <em>Women\u2019s Health Ctr., </em>512 U.S. 753, 773-774 (1994) (provision of injunction creating health clinic buffer zone that prohibited petitioners from physically approaching persons seeking services \u201cunless such person indicates a desire to communicate,\u201d unconstitutional as limiting speech beyond \u201cfighting words\u201d or threats; some other provisions upheld); <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>482 U.S. 451, 462-463, cert. denied, 483 U.S. 1001 (1987) (municipal ordinance that made it unlawful to interrupt a police officer in the performance of his or her duties overbroad because not limited to \u201cfighting words\u201d); <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>New Orleans, </em>415 U.S. 130, 131-132 (1974) (overturning city ordinance that proscribed \u201cwantonly . . . curs[ing,] revil[ing,] or us[ing] obscene or opprobrious language ... to any member of the city police\u201d); <em>Gooding </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>405 U.S. 518, 519, 528 (1972) (striking down statute that forbade use \u201cof opprobrious words or abusive language, tending to cause a breach of the peace\u201d because not sufficiently narrowed by State courts and not limited to \u201cfighting words\u201d). Likewise, this court has recognized, after reviewing the teachings of the Supreme Court concerning the regulation of \u201cabusive, offensive, profane or opprobrious language,\u201d that \u201ca statute seeking to regulate what we have broadly termed offensive speech will stand only if that statute ... is so narrowly drawn as to be limited to \u2018fighting words.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>368 Mass. 580, 589 (1975), quoting <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, supra </em>at 571-572. This remains true today, although we note that \u201cfighting words\u201d are not the only category of unprotected speech that may be regulated consonant with the First Amendment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robicheau, </em>421 Mass. 176, 182 (1995) (\u201c \u2018Fighting words\u2019 \u201d... are not the only type of expression for which the protections of the First Amendment do not extend\u201d). See also <em>Brandenburg </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra; Watts </em>v. <em>United States, supra; Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Guided by Federal case law, some State courts have held unconstitutional statutes outlawing harassing conduct or speech <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>precisely because those statutes proscribe behavior that does not rise to the level of \u201cfighting words\u201d or \u201ctrue threats.\u201d For example, the Supreme Court of Washington in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>144 Wash. 2d 197, 208-209 (2001), found constitutional defects in a criminal harassment statute that included threats \u201cto do any other act which is intended to substantially harm the person threatened . . . with respect to his or her . . . mental health or safety\u201d because it was not limited to \u201ctrue threats\u201d or \u201cfighting words.\u201d The court ultimately struck the term \u201cmental\u201d from the statute in order to save it. <em>Id. </em>at 212-213. Similarly, the Supreme Court of Minnesota, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Machholz, </em>574 N.W.2d 415, 417-418 (Minn. 1998), overturned a harassment statute that proscribed \u201cintentional conduct\u201d that causes \u201ca reasonable person ... to feel oppressed, persecuted, or intimidated,\u201d including \u201charassing conduct that interferes with another person or intrudes on the person\u2019s privacy or liberty.\u201d The court determined that the statute could not be construed as applying only to \u201cfighting words.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 420. The Supreme Court of Iowa, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Fratzke, </em>446 N.W.2d 781, 784 (Iowa 1989), noted that \u201cin order to uphold the constitutionality of a state statute that attempts to criminalize the use of opprobrious words or abusive language the statute must, by its own terms or as construed by the state\u2019s courts, be limited in its application to \u2018fighting words\u2019 and must not be susceptible of application to speech that is protected by the [F]irst and [Fourteenth [A]mendments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(reversing conviction for harassment based on insufficient evidence). Statutes that employ broad terms such as \u201calarming\u201d or \u201cannoying\u201d to define harassing conduct or speech have been of particular concern to many State courts. See, e.g., <em>Bolles </em>v. <em>People, </em>189 Colo. 394, 397-398 (1975) (harassment statute unconstitutionally overbroad because it requires intent to \u201charass, annoy, or alarm another person,\u201d which extends beyond fighting words and other unprotected categories of speech); <em>Long </em>v. <em>State, </em>931 S.W.2d 285, 289, 297 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996) (stalking statute that prohibits communication by telephone or in writing in coarse and offensive manner with intent to \u201cannoy[] or alarmQ\u201d is unconstitutionally vague); <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>37 Wash. App. 862, 864-866 (1984) (city ordinance criminalizing harassment overbroad and vague <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>in large part due to its prohibition of speech which \u201calarms or seriously annoys\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Other States, however, have construed their statutes that proscribe harassing conduct or speech as constitutionally permissible. Most commonly, statutes have been upheld that contain some combination of the following limiting characteristics: a \u201cwillful,\u201d \u201cmalicious,\u201d or specific intent element; a requirement that the conduct be \u201cdirected at\u201d an individual; a reasonable person standard; a statutory limitation that the conduct have \u201cno legitimate purpose\u201d; and a savings clause excluding from the statute\u2019s reach constitutionally protected activity or communication. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>207 Ariz. 231, 233, 235 (Ct. App. 2004) (harassment statute upheld that includes verbal communication \u201cdirected at a specific person which would cause a reasonable person to be seriously alarmed, annoyed or harassed and the conduct in fact seriously alarms, annoys or harasses the person\u201d and excludes \u201cotherwise lawful demonstration, assembly or picketing\u201d); <em>Bouters </em>v. <em>State, </em>659 So. 2d 235, 236-237 (Fla. 1995) (stalking statute constitutional where it defined \u201charasses\u201d as engaging in a course of conduct which is directed at a person, is wilful and malicious, causes substantial emotional distress, serves no legitimate purpose, and does not include constitutionally protected activity); <em>State </em>v. <em>Button, </em>622 N.W.2d 480, 482, 485 (Iowa 2001) (harassment statute that includes \u201coral communication\u201d \u201cinten[ded] to threaten, intimidate, or alarm\u201d upheld due to \u201cconstitutional safety valve\u201d that harassing conduct be done \u201cwithout legitimate purpose\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Asmussen, </em>668 N.W.2d 725, 729-731 (S.D. 2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 907 (2004) (stalking statute constitutional even though it expressly included \u201cverbal . . . communication\u201d where statute required behavior be wilful, malicious, directed at a particular person, and serve no legitimate purpose); <em>Luplow </em>v. <em>State, </em>897 P.2d 463, 465, 467-468 (Wyo. 1995) (statute constitutional that includes verbal communication but is limited to conduct directed at a person; that would cause a reasonable person substantial emotional distress; does cause serious alarm; and does not include lawful demonstration, assembly, or picketing). The inclusion of broad \u201csavings clauses\u201d that except constitutionally protected speech <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>from punishment have been of particular significance to many State courts in upholding these statutes. See, e.g., <em>Staley </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>239 F.3d 769, 782-783, 793 (6th Cir. 2001) (upholding conviction based on Michigan stalking statute that excluded from definition of \u201charassment\u201d any \u201cconstitutionally protected activity or conduct that serves a legitimate purpose\u201d); <em>People </em>v. <em>Shack, </em>86 N.Y.2d 529, 535 (1995) (upholding aggravated harassment statute that criminalizes only those telephone calls made \u201cwith no purpose of legitimate communication\u201d); <em>Bouters </em>v. <em>State, supra </em>at 236 (harassing conduct must \u201cserve[] no legitimate purpose\u201d and excludes \u201cconstitutionally protected activity\u201d); <em>Luplow </em>v. <em>State, supra </em>at 465, 467 (statutory exception for \u201can otherwise lawful demonstration, assembly or picketing\u201d \u201cdisposes of any contention that the statute affects constitutionally protected conduct\u201d). But see <em>State </em>v. <em>Machholz, supra </em>at 421 n.4 (savings clause stating that criminal harassment statute excluded harassing conduct that is constitutionally protected was insufficient); <em>Long </em>v. <em>State, supra </em>at 295 (statutory clause stating that stalking statute does not apply to constitutionally protected activity did not save otherwise invalid statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Considering these constitutional restrictions and benefiting from the law of other jurisdictions, we now consider the constitutionality of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43A, as interpreted today. It goes without saying that the criminal harassment statute cannot be applied to punish constitutionally protected speech. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>368 Mass. 580, 585 (1975). However, in crafting the criminal harassment statute, the Legislature appears to have had these constitutional limitations in mind. Rather than imposing an unduly broad prohibition on all annoying or offensive speech, the Legislature more narrowly drafted the criminal harassment statute. By its terms, the statute applies only to harassment that is (1) \u201cwillful[]\u201d and \u201cmaliciously\u2019; (2) a \u201cpattern\u201d or \u201cseries\u201d (which we construe to mean at least three acts); (3) \u201cdirected at a specific person\u201d; (4) causes \u201cserious[] alarm [to] that person\u201d; and (5) \u201cwould cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress.\u201d G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43A (a). To the extent the statute implicates harassing speech, it appears intended to reach primarily what would be considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>\u201cfighting words.\u201d For example, the requirement that the harassment must be \u201cdirected at specific persons\u201d comports with the rule that where words are not \u201cdirected to the person of the hearer\u201d and \u201c[n]o individual actually or likely to be present could reasonably . . . regardf] the words . . . as a direct personal insult,\u201d even offensive words are not \u201cfighting words.\u201d <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>California, </em>403 U.S. 15, 20 (1971), quoting <em>Cantwell </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>310 U.S. 296, 309 (1940). This court has similarly recognized that \u201c[i]n order to be personally abusive [i.e., \u201cfighting words,\u201d] the words must be \u2018directed to the person of the hearer\u2019 in the sense that they are a face to face personal insult.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, supra </em>at 591, quoting <em>Cantwell </em>v. <em>Connecticut, supra. </em>Thus, \u201c[v]ulgar, profane, offensive or abusive speech is not, without more, subject to criminal sanction . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, supra </em>at 589. Likewise, the \u201cserious[] alarm[]\u201d and \u201csubstantial emotional distress\u201d requirements are closely tailored to punishing only \u201cfighting words,\u201d which are words that \u201cby their very utterance inflict injury.\u201d <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 572 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"aa-dedup-0\">The elements set forth in \u00a7 43A are very similar to those that have led courts in other jurisdictions to uphold their statutes. See discussion, <em>supra. </em>By contrast, however, the Massachusetts criminal harassment statute lacks a savings clause or other provision that restricts punishable conduct to that which is constitutionally unprotected. Similarly, it contains no express limitation to fighting words. Nonetheless, we believe the Legislature, in carefully crafting the statute, intended the statute be applied solely to constitutionally unprotected speech. Any attempt to punish an individual for speech not encompassed within the \u201cfighting words\u201d doctrine (or within any other constitutionally unprotected category of speech) would of course offend our Federal and State Constitutions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We decline to narrow the statute by engrafting onto it a savings clause or other limiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>construction at this time. Should the Commonwealth attempt to prosecute an individual for speech that is constitutionally protected, we would have no hesitation in reading into the statute such a narrowing construction to ensure its application only to speech that is accorded no constitutional protection.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">In upholding the statute\u2019s constitutionality, we effectuate the legislative intent, consistent with both the statutory language and its greater purpose. Our decision also comports with our canons of statutory interpretation that require we presume statutes to be constitutional, see, e.g., <em>Leibovich </em>v. <em>Antonellis, </em>410 Mass. 568, 576 (1991), and construe statutes narrowly against the Commonwealth. <em>Weld for Governor </em>v. <em>Director of the Office of Campaign &amp; Political Fin., </em>407 Mass. 761, 766 (1990), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>389 Mass. 641, 646-647 (1983). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>395 Mass. 20, 29 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marrone, </em>387 Mass. 702, 707 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">The Legislature drafted the criminal harassment statute to extend protections to victims of harassment, providing a remedy to victims before \u201cnonthreatening\u201d harassment escalates into life-threatening assault. Our statutory interpretation today effectuates this intent by protecting victims from harassment that may begin with words, but tragically end with violence. See Kirkman, Every Breath You Take: Massachusetts Steps up its Efforts to Stop Stalkers, 85 Mass. L. Rev. 174, 181, 183 (2001) (\u201cstalkers who become lethal move from non-threatening behavior to direct threats and property destruction\u201d and \u201ccriminal harassment law establishes a continuum along which law enforcement may confront stalking behaviors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number><em>Conclusion. </em>Without question, the defendant\u2019s statements in the present case were hateful, bigoted, and highly offensive. Moreover, that Robichau and Brienza suffered anguish and distress as a result is understandable. The Legislature carefully crafted the harassment statute so as to criminalize only three or more incidents of harassment \u201cdirected at a specific person.\u201d G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43A (a). The Legislature, however, acted after some of the offensive conduct in this case had occurred. We cannot punish behavior where the Commonwealth has failed to prove it meets all of the statutory elements. Accordingly, we reverse the defendant\u2019s convictions and order the complaints dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-8\">The criminal harassment statute, G.

Such conduct or acts described in this paragraph shall include, but not be limited to, conduct or acts conducted by mail or by use of a telephonic or telecommunication device including, but not limited to, electronic mail, internet communications or facsimile communications.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-10\">We deny the defendant\u2019s motion to expand the record to include a supplemental appendix.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b98-5\">It is unclear precisely how many episodes of alleged harassment the judge credited, as the judge\u2019s findings note \u201cclose to a half a dozen episodes.\u201d The testimony of the complaining witnesses, which served as the basis for the findings, indicates seven in total.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b98-6\">A third complaint alleged a civil rights violation under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 37 (\u201cNo person . . . shall by force or threat of force, willfully injure, intimidate or interfere with . . . any other person in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege\u201d secured by Federal or State law). This complaint also alleges one count of malicious destruction of property in violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 127. The defendant was acquitted of these charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Robichau\u2019s testimony places this incident on May 31, 1999, the date of the first incident, but the difference in time is of no import to the present appeal and evidently did not diminish the witnesses\u2019 credibility in the eyes of the judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b99-9\">The trial transcript does not indicate what action, if any, the police took on arrival.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b100-10\">The transcript does not indicate if the police responded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b100-11\">The defendant testified, denying the comments and presenting a different version of the seven incidents. The defense also called two other witnesses. The judge did not credit the defense testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b104-6\">See, e.g., Comments of Senator Linda Melconian, Senate Session, Jan. 27, 2000 (\u201cNow is the time to close some loopholes . . . . It is criminal behavior to make a person live in terror and it should not matter whether or not the victim has actually received an overt threat .... That\u2019s why this bill is needed to create the crime of criminal harassment\u201d); Comments of Representative Stephen Tobin, House Session, July 12, 2000 (\u201cThe thing is up to now, the stalking provision hasn\u2019t covered conduct that doesn\u2019t threaten bodily injury or harm. ... So what we\u2019re doing today is we\u2019re creating a new provision in the general laws that would cover that\u201d). See also Senate to Vote Today on Bill to Boost Protection of Stalking Victims, Boston Globe, Jan. 27, 2000, at B7 (harassment legislation drafted in response to high-profile victims of stalking, and considered just days after Everett woman was killed by stalker who harassed her but had not threatened her).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b104-7\">There are other differences between the harassment statute and the stalking statute. For example, the stalking statute requires the victim be \u201cseriously alarm[ed] or annoy[ed],\u201d while the harassment statute requires only that the victim be \u201cseriously alarm[ed].\u201d The stalking statute also carries a longer maximum sentence. Compare G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43 (stalking statute) with G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43A <em>(a) </em>(harassment statute).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The Commonwealth cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Bast\u00edan, </em>981 P.2d 203, 205 (Colo. Ct. App. 1998), for the proposition that consideration of harassing incidents that straddle the effective date of a statute do not violate the ex post facto clause. Our cases suggest the contrary. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Catalina, </em>407 Mass. 779, 783 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Although they may not comprise part of the pattern or series of acts, prestatutory incidents may be considered in determining whether poststatutory incidents meet the statutory elements of harassing conduct or acts (such as causing a reasonable person severe emotional distress and causing serious alarm in the victim). Prestatutory incidents may also be admitted to show intent or motive. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 224 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b108-11\">The defendant was not convicted of any conduct or acts other than speech, and there is no indication in the record that the defendant engaged in other conduct encompassed by the criminal harassment statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The \u201ctrac threats\u201d exception is not applicable to the criminal harassment statute because the statute was enacted to criminalize those acts of harassment that do not rise to the level of threats. Contrast G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43 (criminal stalking statute).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"A5\">We do not suggest that incidents of harassment that consist of more than pure speech should be exempted from punishment merely because they are accompanied by protected speech. See <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 559, 563 (1965), quoting <em>Giboney </em>v. <em>Empire Storage &amp; Ice Co., </em>336 U.S. 490, 502 (1949) (\u201cit has never been deemed an abridgment of freedom of speech or press to make a course of conduct illegal merely because the conduct was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>part initiated, evidenced, or carried out by means of language, either spoken, written, or printed\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b116-21\">This court has narrowly construed statutory language in the past to avoid constitutional problems. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Templeman, </em>376 Mass. 533, 538 (1978) (limiting \u201clewd, wanton and lascivious persons\u201d provision of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, to exclude application to \u201cspeech or expressive conduct or to activities which involve lawful exercise of a First Amendment right\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balthazar, </em>366 Mass. 298, 302 (1974) (narrowing \u201cunnatural and lascivious act\u201d provision of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 35, to avoid unconstitutionality).
