(HSLI), in Granby. In 2003, the board of health of Granby (board), acting on a favorable report of the Department of Environmental Protection (department), allowed HSLI to deposit two million cubic yards of solid waste on top of the then-existing landfill. The plaintiffs contend that the board\u2019s decision contravened its obligations under the solid waste management siting provisions of G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 150A and 150A V2, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. A judge in the Superior Court disagreed and on cross motions for judgment on the pleadings granted judgment for the defendants. We granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application for direct appellate review and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">1. <em>Background. </em>The landfill has accepted waste since 1972. When the events at issue here began, HSLI had last received permission to expand the landfill in 1996, pursuant to an application process begun in 1993. The 1996 expansion had required a permit, see 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 19.030 (1994), a \u201csite suitability report\u201d from the department, see 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 16.13 (2001), and a \u201csite assignment\u201d from the board.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 150A. HSLI made representations in its 1993 application as to the expected volume of waste that the landfill would accept, and the 1996 permit the department issued for the landfill specified a maximum volume of ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>proximately 1.5 million cubic yards. The 1995 site assignment issued by the board, however, contained no limitation on the height or volume of the landfill. In 2000, HSLI proposed to add new waste on top of thirty-two acres of the existing ninety-acre landfill (vertical addition), without expanding the geographic \u201cfootprint\u201d provided for by the 1995 site assignment. Unsure whether the vertical addition would require a new site assignment, HSLI requested guidance from the department in a July, 2002, letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">The department\u2019s response to HSLI, and the developments subsequent to that response, involve details of the statutory and regulatory scheme for solid waste landfills, which we summarize below.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">General Laws c. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 150A and 150A <em>1/2, </em>provide the \u201cprocess for obtaining a facility site assignment\u201d for a solid waste landfill, a process we discussed at length in <em>TBI, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of N. Andover, </em>431 Mass. 9, 11-12 (2000). Section 150A requires a site assignment \u201cfor a new facility or the expansion of an existing facility\u201d as a landfill. However, \u00a7 150A does not define the terms \u201cnew facility or the expansion of an existing facility,\u201d a task the parties agree the Legislature delegated to the department. Pursuant to its authority, the department has defined \u201c[e]xpand a [s]ite\u201d to mean \u201cto move a solid waste facility\u2019s operation to a previously unassigned site that is contiguous to the original site or to modify a solid waste facility\u2019s operation causing it to exceed any capacity or total volume limit <em>stated in its current site </em>assignment\u201d (emphasis added). 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 16.02 (2001). The plaintiffs do not contend that the department\u2019s interpretation of the statute is in this regard erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">As the regulation makes clear, the department does not consider every change (including an increase in capacity) to a landfill to constitute an \u201cexpansion.\u201d Here, HSLI did not propose to \u201cexpand a site,\u201d as \u201cexpansion\u201d is defined under the regulation. 310 Code Mass Regs. \u00a7 16.02. Its plans involved neither moving the landfill\u2019s \u201coperation to a previously unassigned site\u201d nor exceeding \u201cany capacity or total volume limit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>stated in its current site assignment.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>However, in addition to promulgating procedures for \u201ca new facility or the expansion of an existing facility,\u201d the department has established a procedure for the \u201cmajor modification\u201d of an existing landfill, a term not found in the statutes. Included among the projects deemed \u201cmajor modifications\u201d are \u201cvertical expansions beyond the limits of an approved plan.\u201d 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 16.22(2). The regulations, in practical effect, provide different approval processes for \u201cexpansions\u201d and for \u201cmajor modifications.\u201d Pursuant to \u00a7 150A, no site assignment for \u201ca new facility or [an] expansion\u201d may issue until it is clear \u201cthat the [seventeen] siting criteria of [\u00a7 150A V2] have been met by the proposed site.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, pursuant to the regulations, an application for \u201ca major modification\u201d need not involve a full evaluation of all seventeen \u00a7 150A V2 criteria but, rather, at the department\u2019s discretion, may be required to satisfy an abbreviated review \u201cthat addresses all criteria affected by the modification, as determined by the [department in writing.\u201d 310 Code Mass. Regs \u00a7 16.22(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Returning to the events of 2002, in response to HSLI\u2019s inquiry, the department notified HSLI in a letter dated September 9, 2002, that the vertical addition would constitute a \u201cmajor modification\u201d of the landfill. The department informed HSLI that the criteria \u201caffected\u201d by the proposed vertical addition were (1) traffic and access to the site; (2) potential for the creation of nuisances; (3) consideration of other sources of contamination or pollution; and (4) \u201cany additional site suitability criteria . . . requested in writing by the [board].\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Absent from the criteria selected by the department was any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>reference to G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 150A <em>xh </em>(6), which calls for landfill site assignments to take into account a site\u2019s proximity to residential areas. The statute itself does not specify any \u201crestricted area\u201d or \u201csetback\u201d from residential property, but the department regulations do. Prior to June, 2001, 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 16.40(3)(a)(15) established as a \u201crestricted area,\u201d deemed unsuitable for landfill siting, those lands within 500 feet of a residential dwelling. In 2001, the department increased this \u201csetback\u201d to 1,000 feet. Nearly all of the plaintiffs own or reside in property between 500 and 1,000 feet from the landfill, and as we discuss below, the department\u2019s and board\u2019s refusals to consider the 1,000 foot setback is central to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">In December, 2002, HSLI submitted to the department an \u201cApplication to Modify the Existing Site Assignments for the Granby Sanitary Landfill.\u201d The department issued a favorable site suitability report and forwarded it to the board. In May, 2003, the board, conducting its own independent review, see G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 150A, held two days of hearings. There, the plaintiffs asserted that the proposed vertical addition constituted an \u201cexpansion\u201d and asked the board to require compliance with all of the siting requirements of the department regulations or, at a minimum, to determine that the 1,000 foot residential setback was among the criteria \u201caffected\u201d by HSLI\u2019s plans.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The board rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 suggestions and determined that HSLI\u2019s compliance with the siting criteria identified by the department would \u201cfully protectQ the public health, safety and the environment, and that no further meaningful protection would be achieved by applying any of the other siting criteria.\u201d In July, 2003, the board granted HSLI\u2019s application. The plaintiffs petitioned for relief in the Superior Court, pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The plaintiffs raise several challenges to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>board\u2019s approval of the vertical addition. Reduced to their principal points, these are (a) the statute forbids \u201cthe truncated site assignment inquiry [the department] allows\u201d for vertical additions; (b) the department regulations themselves do not allow for the action the department undertook in abbreviating the site review process; (c) the board had an independent duty to evaluate the 2003 site assignment using the full panoply of statutory \u201csiting criteria\u201d; and (d) the decisions of the department and the board not to require compliance with the new 1,000 foot residential setback regulation were erroneous as a matter of law. We discuss each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">(a) <em>Legality of the regulatory scheme under the statutes. </em>The plaintiffs\u2019 central contention is that the only site assignment process for HSLI\u2019s 2000 proposal that satisfies the statutes is one that considers all of the factors enumerated in G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 150A V2, including the proximity requirement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The statutes require no such reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">In assessing the legality of an administrative agency\u2019s properly promulgated regulations,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we employ sequentially two well-defined principles. First, we determine, using conventional tools of statutory interpretation, whether the Legislature has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>spoken with certainty on the topic in question, and if we conclude that the statute is unambiguous, we give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transitional Assistance, </em>431 Mass. 638, 646 (2000) (\u201cAn agency regulation that is contrary to the plain language of the statute and its underlying purpose may be rejected by the courts\u201d); <em>Massachusetts Hosp. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Department of Med. Sec., </em>412 Mass. 340, 346 (1992). Second, if the Legislature has not addressed directly the pertinent issue, we determine whether the agency\u2019s resolution of that issue may \u201cbe reconciled with the governing legislation.\u201d <em>Nuclear Metals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Low-Level Radioactive Waste Mgt. Bd., </em>421 Mass. 196, 211 (1995). See <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. </em>v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-843 (1984) (describing two-part test used in Federal courts to ascertain validity of challenged agency regulations). The second stage of our analysis requires \u201csubstantial deference\u201d to the expertise and statutory \u201cinterpretation of [the] agency charged with primary responsibility\u201d for administering a statute. See <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>429 Mass. 241, 253 (1999), citing <em>Berrios </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>411 Mass. 587, 595 (1992). At the second stage, regulations \u201care not to be declared void unless their provisions cannot by any reasonable construction be interpreted in harmony with the legislative mandate.\u201d <em>Berrios </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, supra </em>at 595-596. As a result, a \u201c[S]tote administrative agency in Massachusetts has considerable leeway in interpreting a statute it is charged with enforcing,\u201d unless a statute unambiguously bars the agency\u2019s approach. <em>Id., </em>quoting A. Celia, Administrative Law and Practice \u00a7 747 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Frequently, administrative agencies are charged, implicitly or explicitly, with the task of crafting regulations that are more detailed than statutes and tailored to more situations than the legislation specifies. See <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. </em>v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, supra </em>at 843-844. In examining the regulatory response to statutory silence or ambiguity, it is unimportant whether we would have come to the same interpretation of the statute as the agency. See <em>Massachusetts Nurses Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Nursing, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 380, 388-389 (1986). That the Legislature, in drafting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>G. L. c. 111, \u00a7\u00a7 150A and 150A 1/2, did not anticipate the exact factual scenario presented here does not make the administrative regulations and rulings that did anticipate such situations invalid. See <em>Bottomley </em>v. <em>Division of Admin. Law Appeals, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 652, 655 (1986). Statutory silence, like statutory ambiguity, often requires that an agency give clarity to an issue necessarily implicated by the statute but either not addressed by the Legislature or delegated to the superior expertise of agency administrators. See 1 R.J. Pierce, Jr., Administrative Law \u00a7 3.4 (4th ed. 2002). Administrative agencies are more suited to the task of clarifying the Legislature\u2019s plan through specific rules, and more able to provide for \u201cconsistency and coherence,\u201d than are courts. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3.4, at 150. Our deference is especially appropriate where, as here, the statutes in question involve an explicit, broad grant of rule-making authority. See <em>Dowell </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transitional Assistance, </em>424 Mass. 610, 613-614 (1997) (court must consider \u201cbroad authority granted the department\u201d). See also <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. </em>v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, supra </em>at 844 (regulations promulgated under explicit grant of authority \u201care given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">We turn now to the merits. As to the first stage of our analysis, the plaintiffs claim that because the statutory scheme provides no guidance for defining major modifications to existing landfills that are not \u201cexpansion[sj\u201d and because the Legislature has enumerated multiple criteria in \u00a7 150A V2 for evaluating \u201ca new facility or the expansion of an existing facility,\u201d G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 150A, the statute requires that all of those criteria be used to assess the suitability of every increase in capacity of a solid waste landfill. We disagree. The solid waste facility statutes explicitly grant broad leeway for the department to promulgate regulations governing solid waste management. See G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 150A <em>1/2.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The plaintiffs can point to no statutory provision that explicitly bars the department\u2019s action: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>the statutes do not define \u201cexpansion.\u201d Section 150A <em>xk </em>requires only that the \u201crules and regulations\u201d of the department \u201cshall include but not be limited to\u201d the enumerated \u201ccriteria,\u201d and does not prohibit the rule making at issue here. Similarly, \u00a7 150A covers the procedure for assigning sites only for new facilities or statutory expansions, based on review of the siting criteria listed in \u00a7 150A Va. The statutes do not prohibit the department from instituting specialized procedures for changes to a landfill that are not \u201cexpansions.\u201d The department has not sought to assert its authority beyond the subject matter delegated to it. Nor has the department attempted to take action that the statutory language bars. Because the statute neither explicitly forbids nor expressly allows the regulation in question, we must proceed to the second stage of our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">The plaintiffs would have us conclude that, in addressing the statute\u2019s silence, the department deviated from the Legislature\u2019s purpose. The plaintiffs have not carried their burden of proving that the department\u2019s general rule making authority over landfills may not be used to differentiate between \u201cexpansions\u201d and \u201cmajor modifications\u201d that are not \u201cexpansions,\u201d and to provide an abbreviated approval procedure for the latter. It is well within the scope of the department\u2019s administrative discretion to differentiate between changes that do not increase an existing landfill\u2019s footprint or site assignment mandated limit on capacity, 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 16.02, and expansions that do. It is surely also within the scope of the department\u2019s expertise and authority to determine how best to avoid duplica-tive or nonproductive reviews. The plaintiffs\u2019 argument reduces to the proposition that, had they been charged with enforcing the statute, they would have chosen a different regulatory approach that would have required a fuller evaluation of the proposed vertical addition. Even if we might have preferred the plaintiffs\u2019 approach (a matter on which we express no view), it is the department\u2019s reasonable resolution of the statute\u2019s silence, not ours, that must govern. See <em>Massachusetts Nurses Ass\u2019n </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number><em>Board of Registration in Nursing, supra </em>at 388-389. We conclude that the plaintiffs have not met their burden of showing that the department\u2019s regulations constitute an unreasonable interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">(b) <em>The department\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations. </em>The plaintiffs also contend that the department regulations themselves, in part because they contain no separate rule for vertical additions,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> required consideration of all of the \u00a7 150A Va criteria in evaluating HSLI\u2019s proposal. We reject this claim on two grounds. First, we agree with the board that the regulations speak with sufficient clarity to authorize the truncated site assignment process for vertical additions. Second, we accord special deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation and \u201conly disturb\u201d the agency\u2019s interpretation if it is \u201cpatently wrong, unreasonable, arbitrary, whimsical, or capricious.\u201d <em>TBI, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of N. Andover, </em>431 Mass. 9, 17 (2000), quoting <em>Brookline </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Quality Eng\u2019g, </em>398 Mass. 404, 414 (1986). Cf. <em>Christensen </em>v. <em>Harris County, </em>529 U.S. 576, 588 (2000) (deference to agency interpretation not appropriate where meaning of regulation unambiguous). From the department\u2019s September 9, 2002, letter to HSLI, we can conclude that the department interpreted its regulations to allow a truncated site assignment process for vertical additions that are not statutory \u201cexpansions.\u201d Even if the regulations did leave some ambiguity as to the process required for various modifications to existing landfills<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> in circumstances not present here, we see nothing \u201cpatently wrong, unreasonable, arbitrary, whimsical, or capri-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>clous\u201d in the department\u2019s interpretation of its regulations for \u201cmajor modifications\u201d in regard to the vertical addition intended for the landfill. <em>TBI, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of N. Andover, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">(c) <em>The board\u2019s responsibilities. </em>The plaintiffs next assert that, even presuming the legitimacy of the department\u2019s actions, the board violated its independent duty to apply all of the \u00a7 150A <em>1h </em>criteria in evaluating HSLI\u2019s application. We conclude that the board was justified in following the department\u2019s regulations and the department\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations in evaluating the application. On this point, <em>TBI, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of N. Andover, supra, </em>is instructive. In that case, we reviewed a town board\u2019s reliance on the department\u2019s interpretation of these very statutes and regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 16-17. We held that the board was not required to conduct an investigation more extensive than the department\u2019s and that the board properly could rely on the department\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations. <em>Id. </em>There is no question that the board thoroughly exercised its plenary review of the facts underlying the department\u2019s determination. See <em>id. </em>at 11-12. The statute neither requires nor contemplates that the board evaluate the reasonableness of the department regulations or second-guess the department\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations. The plaintiffs cite no authority to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">(d) <em>The 1,000foot setback. </em>Finally, the plaintiffs contend that, even if the department and the board acted properly to authorize an abbreviated site assignment process for the vertical addition, both entities acted erroneously in concluding that the vertical addition did not constitute a statutory \u201cexpansion,\u201d and that the residential setback referenced in 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 16.40(3)(a)(15) was not among those \u201ccriteria affected by the modification.\u201d This last point requires us to consider whether the department and the board applied the regulations permissibly in the case at bar. Having done so, we find no merit in the plaintiffs\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">Again, longstanding principles limit our review. As we have determined that the regulations themselves are appropriate, the plaintiffs must prove that the factual determinations and adjudicative order appealed from are \u201cunsupported by substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>tial evidence, unwarranted by facts found on the record as submitted, arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d <em>MCI WorldCom Communications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Telecommunications &amp; Energy, </em>442 Mass. 103, 112 (2004), quoting <em>Massachusetts Inst. of Tech. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>425 Mass. 856, 867-868 (1997). See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. Our review does not turn on whether, faced with the same set of facts, we would have drawn the same conclusion as an agency or local board, but only \u201cwhether a contrary conclusion is not merely a possible but a necessary inference.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Houghton Mifflin Co., </em>423 Mass. 42, 43 (1996), quoting <em>First Data Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>371 Mass. 444, 446 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">In this case, the department had sufficient evidence to determine that the proposed vertical addition constituted a major modification of the 1995 site assignment, rather than a statutory \u201cexpansion.\u201d As HSLI\u2019s proposal would bring the existing landfill no closer to any residential property, it was not arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise unreasonable for the department to conclude that the proposed vertical addition did not \u201caffect\u201d the landfill\u2019s <em>proximity </em>to residential structures in the manner contemplated by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">For similar reasons, we cannot conclude that the board acted erroneously when it explicitly rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 proposal to add the 1,000 foot residential setback to the criteria applied to its review of the proposed vertical addition. The board heard substantial evidence, including the objections of the plaintiffs. After weighing the evidence, the board found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">\u201c[Bjecause ... the vertical expansion will not cause a nuisance to any nearby property owners, it does not matter whether the landfill is located at least 1,000 feet from the nearest residence (the setback standard for a new landfill), or at least 500 feet from the nearest residence (the setback standard that existed when this landfill received its most current site assignment). Using either standard, there will be no harm to the residents, and no violation of the underlying statutory requirement that the landfill pose no danger to public health, safety, or the environment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The findings were supported by substantial expert testimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>and no direct evidence to the contrary was presented by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs seek to demonstrate the irrationality of the board\u2019s action, and to discredit the evidence on which that action was based, by asking that we interpret the 1,000 foot setback regulation in effect since 2001 as a \u201cbright-line rule\u201d that landfills within 1,000 feet of a residential dwelling constitute a health hazard. According to the plaintiffs, such a \u201cbright-line rule\u201d would discredit any expert testimony attesting to the safety of a landfill less than 1,000 feet removed from the nearest residential structure. We disagree with the plaintiffs that the 2001 regulations established a bright-line rule, applicable to \u201cmajor modifications,\u201d from which the department could not depart. Nothing in the regulation compels such an interpretation. It was neither irrational nor arbitrary for the department to conclude that the 1,000 foot setback was inapplicable where HSLI had a reasonable expectation that the 500 foot rule would continue to pertain so long as the footprint of the landfill remained constant, the facility did not violate the conditions of its site assignment, and the company was otherwise complying with the department\u2019s regulations. Furthermore, the argument that we should direct the department to apply the 1,000 foot setback as a bright-line rule in every case \u201cessentially asks us to make policy judgments which lie within the province of the Legislature\u201d and the department. <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Personnel Adm\u2019r of the Dep\u2019t of Personnel Admin., </em>406 Mass. 818, 825-826 n.8 (1990).
