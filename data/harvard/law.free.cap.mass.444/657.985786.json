Rasmusen, broke into an apartment in Yarmouth, seeking revenge against another group <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>of young men with whom they had fought at a party earlier in the evening. Rasmusen was armed with a large kitchen knife. Shawn Kimball, a guest in the apartment, was beaten and stabbed several times. Spencer MacLeod, who had not been involved with the earlier fight and was sleeping upstairs when Rasmusen\u2019s group forced its way in, joined the fracas and attempted to pull several attackers away from Kimball. He was stabbed in the heart and died. Rasmusen was arrested the next day and later indicted. His principal defense at trial was insanity. A jury convicted him of felony-murder in the first degree for the killing of MacLeod, home invasion, armed burglary, and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon for the attack on Kimball. Rasmusen appealed, and we have carefully reviewed the entire record, as is our responsibility under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. Both Rasmusen and the Commonwealth agree that we should reverse Rasmusen\u2019s conviction for the felony that underlies the felony-murder conviction as duplicative, and we therefore reverse Rasmusen\u2019s conviction for armed burglary. In all other respects, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">1. <em>Background. </em>The evidence at trial included the following. The altercation that resulted in the death of MacLeod had its origins in the violent feuding of two groups of young men, all of whom lived in the vicinity of Yarmouth and knew each other. On the evening of January 25, 2002, Rasmusen and several friends attended a party at a large summer home near the beach in West Dennis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Earlier, before Rasmusen\u2019s arrival, another group, including Germaine Conceptione, had been denied admission to the party. Insults had flown back and forth and a fight had broken out between this group and Rasmusen\u2019s friends.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The fight was apparently short lived, and Concep-tione\u2019s group left to assess their injuries and plot strategy at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>apartment of a friend on Alewife Circle in Yarmouth, where Shawn Kimball joined them.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The group, now including Kimball, decided to return to the party in West Dennis and get revenge. They arrived back at the home after midnight, unarmed, and entered through the open garage door. A fight ensued, this time including Rasmusen. During the fight, Conceptione put Rasmusen in a headlock, nearly asphyxiating him. Conceptione eventually released Rasmusen and, with the rest of his group, ran to their vehicles and returned to the Alewife Circle apartment. Rasmusen, wielding a knife he had grabbed from a drawer in the home\u2019s kitchen, attempted to pursue Conceptione, slashing the tires of one of the fleeing vehicles. Shortly thereafter, he collapsed on the lawn and vomited violently, apparently from the effects of the headlock.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">After recovering, Rasmusen telephoned his girl friend, who picked him up from the party in her Chevrolet Suburban sport utility vehicle. When he got into the Suburban, Rasmusen was carrying a long-bladed kitchen knife. They drove to another home, where Rasmusen\u2019s friends reconvened and plotted their own revenge, particularly against Conceptione. A witness to this meeting testified that when one of the participants said, \u201cLet\u2019s go fuck them up,\u201d Rasmusen responded, \u201cI\u2019m not fucking anyone up. I\u2019m going to kill someone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Rasmusen\u2019s group proceeded to gather garden tools (to be used as weapons) and loaded them into the Suburban. They then drove to the homes of other friends, picking up two pit bull dogs at one, and a baseball bat, a golf club, and a crowbar at another. Fully armed, they headed to the Alewife Circle area to look for Conceptione and his friends. As they drove through the neighborhood, someone spotted Kimball through the window of one of the apartments. Rasmusen and five companions got out of the Suburban, armed themselves with the weapons they had brought, and headed for the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Kimball saw the group approaching and tried to lock the door. Someone threw a brick through the kitchen window, and four of the group, including Rasmusen, stormed the apartment, breaking through the locked door with such force that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>destroyed the door frame.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The four men immediately attacked Kimball with their weapons; one member of the group struck him with a golf club, another struck him with a wooden stick, and another with a crowbar. Wielding the knife, Rasmusen stabbed Kimball four times. During these attacks, Kimball eventually fell to the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Conceptione was not in the apartment timing the assault, having left before Rasmusen\u2019s group arrived. Upstairs, however, two women were feeding the baby of the apartment owner, who was not at home. MacLeod, the boy friend of one of the women, was asleep in another room. Awakened by the fighting, Mac-Leod came down the stairs and attempted to pull the four men off of Kimball. Those men turned their attention from Kimball to MacLeod. Kimball saw Rasmusen stab MacLeod twice in the chest. Rasmusen and his companions then fled the scene in the waiting Suburban. When his girl friend asked what had happened, Rasmusen responded, \u201cI stabbed someone.\u201d He also expressed regret that Conceptione had not been at the apartment and said that he \u201cfucked [Kimball] up\u201d and then \u201cfucked [Mac-Leod] up.\u201d Sitting in the front passenger seat, Rasmusen cleaned the blood-soiled knife with a T-shirt and directed his girl friend to drive to a nearby pond where he threw the knife into the water.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Meanwhile, those who remained at the Alewife Circle apartment telephoned 911. Shortly after 3 a.m., paramedics arrived and attended to the badly wounded Kimball and MacLeod. MacLeod had a heart rhythm but no pulse or blood pressure. After MacLeod was transported to a local hospital, the emergency room physician discovered that the stab wound had fatally punctured MacLeod\u2019s heart; the physician pronounced him dead. When the police arrived at the apartment, Kimball was screaming, naming the men involved in the attack, including Rasmusen. Kimball was transported to the hospital in a second ambulance. He recovered from his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The next day, Rasmusen was arrested and brought to the police station. After he was booked, advised of his Miranda rights, and detained in a holding cell, Rasmusen asked to speak <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>with a detective investigating the stabbings, Charles Peterson of the Yarmouth police department. During the interview, which lasted nearly two hours, Rasmusen described the previous night\u2019s events. He said that his group had gone to the Alewife Circle apartment \u201cto get\u201d Conceptione, and that he had brought a knife with him for that purpose. He admitted stabbing Kim-ball, but denied knowingly stabbing MacLeod, offering that it was possible he had stabbed MacLeod when MacLeod had tried to break up the fight.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">Rasmusen\u2019s trial was severed from that of the others charged in the Alewife Circle attack. In his defense, Rasmusen offered the testimony of his mother and a forensic psychiatrist about his long history of psychiatric problems to demonstrate that he lacked criminal responsibility for his conduct on the evening of the attack. Rasmusen\u2019s mother described his troubled childhood, which involved witnessing her being beaten by an alcoholic husband from the time he was a toddler, and a violent home invasion and assault when he was twelve years old. After the home invasion, Rasmusen began drinking and using drugs, and he was often violent when intoxicated. His mother testified that when she saw him on the morning after the stabbings, he appeared to be drunk or high. The psychiatrist, who examined Rasmusen, his medical records, and court records, testified that Rasmusen suffered from four (previously undiagnosed) psychological disorders \u2014 posttraumatic stress disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, substance induced mood disorder, and a nonspecific learning disorder. The psychiatrist opined that as a result of these disorders, at the time of the stabbings at the Alewife Circle apartment, Rasmusen was experiencing an uncontrolled pathological rage precipitated by Concep-tione choking him at the West Dennis party. Therefore, the psychiatrist testified, Rasmusen was unable to appreciate the criminality of his actions and lacked the capacity to conform his behavior to the requirements of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">2. <em>Criminal responsibility. </em>At trial, Rasmusen did not dispute that he was involved in the attack at the Alewife Circle apartment. As exemplified in defense counsel\u2019s closing, Ras-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>musen argued that (1) there was reasonable doubt whether Ras-musen was the one that stabbed MacLeod during the altercation<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; (2) if the Commonwealth had demonstrated that he stabbed MacLeod, he should be found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity; and (3) if the Commonwealth had demonstrated that he was not insane, he should be found guilty of a lesser degree of homicide than murder in the first degree as a result of his impaired mental condition. On appeal, Rasmusen claims that the Commonwealth failed to prove Rasmusen\u2019s sanity beyond a reasonable doubt because it neither offered any expert evidence of sanity to rebut the defense expert\u2019s testimony nor requested an instruction on the \u201cpresumption of sanity.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We find no merit in Rasmusen\u2019s argument because the evidence warranted the jury\u2019s finding that he was criminally responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">\u201cA person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality [wrongfulness] of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHoul, </em>352 Mass. 544, 546-547 (1967). \u201cWhen a defendant claims that he is not criminally responsible for his acts, the Commonwealth bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is sane.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kappler, </em>416 Mass. 574, 578 (1993). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>We have repeatedly said that the Commonwealth may meet its burden to prove the defendant\u2019s sanity without calling an expert, notwithstanding testimony by defense experts to the contrary. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelley, </em>381 Mass. 340, 347 (1980) (\u201cThe jury need not accept uncontradicted expert testimony that the defendant was insane at the time of the murder\u201d). See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>431 Mass. 506, 509 n.1 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kappler, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lunde, </em>390 Mass. 42, 47 (1983). The jury may \u201cinfer sanity from the \u2018facts underlying the crime and evidence of [the defendant\u2019s] actions before and after the crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kappler, supra </em>at 579, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cullen, </em>395 Mass. 225, 229 (1985). Given the paramount role of the jury in assessing the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility, it is unsurprising that \u201cwe are aware of no case in which we have ordered the entry of a judgment of not guilty by reason of the defendant\u2019s lack of criminal responsibility after a jury has rejected such a defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernandes, </em>436 Mass. 671, 676 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"AF0\">In this case, the jury had before them expert testimony offered by the defendant that suggested that the defendant lacked criminal responsibility for his conduct. Relying on this testimony, defense counsel argued in closing that the jury should find Rasmusen not guilty by reason of insanity. The Commonwealth made a vigorous challenge to the expert\u2019s conclusions and credibility on cross-examination and, pointing to the facts of the underlying crime, argued strenuously in its closing that Rasmusen was criminally responsible. In their role as fact finder, the jury plainly rejected Rasmusen\u2019s insanity defense, and had an ample basis on which to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"aqk-dedup-0\">The evidence of Rasmusen\u2019s sanity at the time of the attacks was compelling. Angered and humiliated by the earlier fight at the house in West Dennis, Rasmusen and his group of friends discussed, planned, and executed the raid on the Alewife Circle apartment. As described by Kimball, Rasmusen\u2019s conduct during the attacks was consistent with deliberate combat. After the raid was over, Rasmusen cleaned and disposed of the knife, and Rasmusen\u2019s subsequent interview with the police revealed that he had a clear memory of his involvement in and the purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>the attack.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The jury were warranted in inferring Rasmusen\u2019s sanity from this evidence and therefore could have rationally rejected the opinion of Rasmusen\u2019s one expert witness, who concluded that Rasmusen was insane at the time of the attacks by describing all of Rasmusen\u2019s conduct as consistent with four previously undiagnosed mental disorders. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kappler, supra </em>at 579 (\u201cThe question of what inferences to draw from this evidence is for the jurors, not the trial judge and not this court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">That the Commonwealth did not request and the judge did not provide a jury instruction on the \u201cpresumption of sanity\u201d does not undermine the soundness of the jury\u2019s finding that Rasmusen was sane at the time of the attacks. The judge provided extensive instructions to the jury to guide their deliberations on whether the Commonwealth had met its burden to prove criminal responsibility and the absence of mental impairment. Although we said in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keita, </em>429 Mass. 843, 846 (1999), that a \u201cjury instruction concerning the presumption of sanity should be given in every case in which the question of the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility is raised,\u201d we have never held that the failure to give such an instruction should be grounds for a new trial or presents a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. Indeed, the instruction is for the benefit of the Commonwealth, not the defendant. It would be paradoxical for the absence of the instruction to constitute such a grave error when the \u201cpresumption\u201d merely reflects our recognition that jurors should be permitted to infer or presume the defendant\u2019s sanity from their \u201ccommon knowledge that a great majority of people are sane, and the probability that any particular person is sane.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brennan, </em>399 Mass. 358, 364 (1987). That the Commonwealth secured the convictions without the benefit of a \u201cpresumption of sanity\u201d instruction suggests the strength, not weakness, of the Commonwealth\u2019s proof of criminal responsibility. The Commonwealth chose not to rely on the \u201cpresumption,\u201d instead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>presenting \u201cevidence of the defendant\u2019s conduct before, during, and after the crime, which the \u2018jury are permitted to weigh in reaching their conclusions on the insanity issue,\u2019 and from which they had the right to infer the defendant\u2019s mental competency.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lunde, supra </em>at 48, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Walker, 370 Mass. 548, 581, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 943 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"A9g\">In a related argument, Rasmusen claims that the convictions are illogical and should be reversed pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, as against the weight of the evidence. This argument is premised on the theory that the jury must have accepted Ras-musen\u2019s evidence of insanity because it found Rasmusen not guilty of murder in the first degree by reason of deliberate premeditation and by reason of extreme atrocity or cruelty, despite \u201cfairly overwhelming\u201d evidence suggesting Rasmusen\u2019s guilt on those theories. Consequently, Rasmusen contends the jury must have misunderstood how to apply their finding of insanity to the remainder of the charges. We do not agree. There are many possible explanations for the jury\u2019s verdicts and no reason to conclude that the instructions were either misunderstood or misapplied to the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqq\">First, MacLeod had had no involvement in the prior alterca-tian, and the jury could well have found that he was not the target of Rasmusen\u2019s planned revenge, that his presence at the scene was an unforeseen circumstance, and that his death was unpremeditated and unintended.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The jury could also have found that MacLeod\u2019s injuries, insofar as they were suffered in the course of breaking up a violent and heated altercation, were not the product of extreme atrocity or cruelty. Such conclusions would not be inconsistent with the jury\u2019s finding that Rasmusen was criminally responsible for his conduct during the incident, including planning and executing the vicious assault on Kimball and the predicate felonies of armed burglary and home invasion.</p>\n<p id=\"Aux\">Just as likely, the evidence of Rasmusen\u2019s impaired mental capacity may have created doubt in the minds of the jury on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>element of premeditation in the killing of MacLeod, and on whether the Commonwealth had sustained its burden of proving that Rasmusen had acted with extreme cruelty or atrocity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It would have been perfectly consistent with that doubt for the jury to conclude that Rasmusen nevertheless had the mental capacity to intend an armed break-in for the purpose of gaining revenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">In this case, the issues of criminal responsibility and diminished capacity were \u201cfully and fairly before the jury,\u201d and \u201cjustice does not require that their verdict be disturbed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lunde, </em>390 Mass. 42, 50 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">3. <em>Felony underlying felony-murder conviction. </em>In addition to his conviction for felony-murder, Rasmusen was convicted of the two underlying felonies \u2014 home invasion and armed burglary. The Commonwealth argued and the jury were instructed by the judge that they could consider both felonies as the predicates for felony-murder. Rasmusen argues that the felony conviction underlying the murder conviction should be vacated as duplicative of his conviction of murder in the first degree. \u201cWhen a murder conviction is based on a felony-murder theory, the underlying felony, whatever it may be, is always a lesser included offense and the conviction for that felony, in addition to the conviction of murder, is duplicative.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gunter, 427 </em>Mass. 259, 276 (1998). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lucien, </em>440 Mass. 658, 673 (2004), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>425 Mass. 685, 692 (1997). The Commonwealth concedes that one of the two predicate felonies should be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-25\">Either offense could serve as the underlying felony for the felony-murder conviction. The home invasion conviction depended on the Commonwealth\u2019s proof that Rasmusen knew Kimball was present in the apartment at the time Rasmusen and his friends forced their way inside, and so may properly be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>considered an independent crime in these circumstances.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The armed burglary conviction, lacking such a link to Kimball, has broader application to Rasmusen\u2019s conduct toward MacLeod and is therefore better suited to serve as the predicate felony for the felony-murder conviction. Consequently, we vacate Rasmusen\u2019s conviction and sentence for armed burglary as duplicative of his felony-murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">4. <em>Review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>We have reviewed the record as a whole. Rasmusen was represented by able counsel, and there was no error at trial that presents a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. Because we \u201cdecline to substitute our view for the decision reached by the jury\u201d regarding Rasmusen\u2019s sanity, we see no reason to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to reduce the verdict or order a new trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernandes, </em>436 Mass. 671, 676 (2002). The convictions are affirmed, except for the conviction on indictment numbered 02-025-03, alleging armed burglary, which is hereby vacated. That indictment is remanded to the Superior Court for dismissal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lucien, supra </em>at 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The defendant, Zane A. Rasmusen, and his friends had been drinking beer that evening. Rasmusen himself admitted to consuming one six-pack of beer and one shot of hard liquor. Others attending the West Dennis party were also drinking beer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Germaine Conceptione testified at trial that one of Rasmusen\u2019s friends told his group that they were \u201cnot welcome\u201d at the West Dennis party and said, \u201cThis is a million dollar house, and you people need to go back to the village where you came from.\u201d The comment apparently referred to Swan Pond Village, also known as Alewife Circle, the housing development where Conceptione\u2019s group could often be found.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Two members of the group remained outside, struggling with the two pit bulls and eventually getting back inside the Suburban.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Rasmusen was interviewed a second time the following day, but statements made during that interview were suppressed prior to trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b678-5\">One of the defense theories was that another of the attackers might have stabbed Spencer MacLeod, that Shawn Kimball could not really have seen what was happening because he was wounded and on the floor, and that one of the members of the Rasmusen group who testified for the Commonwealth was lying about incriminating statements Rasmusen made to the group right after the event. There was, however, no evidence that anyone other than Rasmusen was armed with a knife, and MacLeod\u2019s wounds were deep and consistent with the knife Rasmusen admittedly brought to the apartment and used to stab Kimball.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Rasmusen frames his argument as if we were reviewing the denial of his request for a required finding of not guilty, despite acknowledging that such a finding is not appropriate where the defense is lack of criminal responsibility. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keita, </em>429 Mass. 843, 845 (1999) (\u201c[W]e have never taken away from a trier of fact the determination whether a defendant was criminally responsible when the evidence raised the issue\u201d). We therefore review this argument as a part of our obligation under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to determine whether the jury\u2019s verdict is \u201cconsonant with justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lake, </em>410 Mass. 47, 51 (1991), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahnke, </em>368 Mass. 662, 701 (1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 959 (1976).
