Because we find no merit in the defendant\u2019s claims of error and conclude there is no basis to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>exercise our power under G.

In the late evening of June 5, 2000, the defendant, along with Eric Miller<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Wilson Pasteur,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> both members of a gang called \u201cFolk\u201d or \u201cDisciples\u201d and known to wear blue, went to Lowell Street in East Lynn in search of members of a rival gang called the \u201cBloods.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant, a member of the \u201cAK\u2019s,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> wanted revenge for injuries he suffered in a recent attack at a 7-Eleven store by members of the \u201cOB\u2019s.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Earlier in the evening, the defendant had shown Miller a stolen .357 caliber handgun (.357)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that he had hidden in an abandoned car in his backyard and spoke about the possibility of getting revenge for the 7-Eleven attack. At the defendant\u2019s request, Miller had arranged for Pasteur to join them and the three spoke about \u201cgoing and getting Bloods.\u201d When Pasteur questioned why they should all go if there was only one gun, the defendant said that he had another gun at a friend\u2019s house,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but that if they got it, they had \u201cbetter do something with it.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>On their way to retrieve the second gun, the three continued to discuss \u201clooking for some Bloods.\u201d When the defendant retrieved the second gun from Voeuth Van,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> he said that he was going to \u201ctake care of some fools\u201d in East Lynn. The defendant loaded the gun, a .44 caliber handgun (.44), and handed it to Pasteur, who asked if he \u201cjust had to cock it back once and keep on shooting,\u201d to which the defendant responded, \u201cYeah.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">With the defendant carrying the .357<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and Pasteur carrying the .44,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the three men went to Lowell Street, a place where Bloods \u201chung out.\u201d As they walked down Lowell Street, the defendant said, \u201cThere they are right there.\u201d Without incident, the three men walked past a white car, whose occupants were members of the Young Bloods and were wearing red. When they reached the end of the street, the defendant instructed Miller and Pasteur to circle around the block and come back up Lowell Street. The defendant said he was going to \u201ccount to thirty-seven\u201d and then start walking back toward the white car. The plan was that the defendant and Pasteur would shoot from both sides of the car to kill the Bloods inside.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Pasteur and Miller circled around and starting walking up Lowell Street, but when they did not see the defendant, they continued walking past the white car. Pasteur \u201cthrew\u201d a derogatory gang sign to the occupants of the vehicle, who responded by getting out of the car and yelling at Pasteur and Miller. While they exchanged insults, the defendant was kneeling near a white van also located on the street. At some point during the exchange, Pasteur stepped into the street and fired one shot from the .44 \u201cstraight forward\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> at the Young Bloods, who began running. The defendant then started shooting the .357 at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>the Young Bloods. He fired four or five times very quickly before running down the street and turning right. The victim was lying on the street near the van. Pasteur was still in the street \u201cplaying with the gun\u201d when Miller yelled for him to leave. The two ran down the street and turned left.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Miller and Pasteur went to Pasteur\u2019s home, where they discussed the incident and Pasteur telephoned the defendant asking what he wanted him to do with the .44. The defendant instructed him to \u201chold onto it for a little while.\u201d The .44 was never recovered. The day after the shooting, the defendant enlisted Van\u2019s help in hiding the .357 at Browns Pond, where it was later retrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">An autopsy confirmed that the victim died from a single gunshot wound to the face. The bullet recovered from the victim\u2019s body was fired by the .357 handgun carried and hidden by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Although the defendant neither testified at trial nor called any witnesses, his statements to police were admitted in evidence during the Commonwealth\u2019s case. In one of his statements to police, the defendant said, \u201cI know for a fact [Pasteur] had a .44.\u201d His defense, made clear from his statements to police, through cross-examination, and from opening and closing statements, was that Pasteur fired the fatal shot and that the defendant neither had a gun nor expected that a gun would be fired. The defense focused on the fact that the only person who claimed to see the defendant shoot the victim was Miller, who agreed to plead guilty to manslaughter in exchange for his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Admission of codefendant\u2019s hearsay statements. </em>Before the defendant\u2019s first trial, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>defense counsel filed a motion in limine requesting that the judge order the prosecutor to advise Miller that he could not answer questions based on what he was told by Pasteur. The judge allowed the motion but then ruled that if there was a good-faith basis for asking a question, \u201cthen, obviously, [the prosecutor] may ask <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>the question, and . . . may solicit the response, and [the judge] will rule upon it.\u201d Defense counsel renewed each of the motions in limine before the second trial. The judge considered the motions as being refiled and stated his rulings were the same. The defendant then filed a motion in limine to preclude the prosecutor from mentioning joint venture during the opening statement because it was clear the Commonwealth\u2019s theory was that the defendant was the principal, not a joint venturer, and thus Pasteur\u2019s statements were inadmissible hearsay. The judge denied this motion and told the prosecutor, \u201cYou can definitely talk about what \u2014 you have a good faith basis to talk about the statements made by others such as Mr. Pasteur.\u201d Accordingly, at trial, Miller testified that after the shooting when they were at Pasteur\u2019s apartment, Pasteur had hidden the gun under his mattress, and called the defendant to ask what he wanted him to do with the gun. Additionally, the defendant had yet to dispose of the .357 and instructed Pasteur to \u201chold on\u201d to the .44 for awhile. Moreover, Pasteur \u201csaid he only shot one shot and he showed [Miller] the empty bullet that he had. He said he only could shoot one shot because after he shot the first shot, the gun jammed. ... He said he was trying to cock the gun back again because he thought the person that he shot was still moving.\u201d Miller further testified that \u201c[Pasteur] didn\u2019t know for sure [whether he shot anyone], but he thought he did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The defendant argues that admission of these statements violated his right to confront and cross-examine his accusers. We conclude there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">\u201cIt is well settled that out-of-court statements by joint criminal venturers are admissible against the others if the statements are made \u2018both during the pendency of the cooperative effort and in furtherance of its goal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, </em>408 Mass. 533, 543 (1990), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>370 Mass. 703, 708-709 (1976). Although this exception to the hearsay rule \u201cdoes not apply [to statements made] after the criminal enterprise has ended, . . . [it] does apply where the joint venturers are acting to conceal the crime that formed the basis of the enterprise.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Angiulo, </em>415 Mass. 502, 519 (1993), and cases cited. The defendant, however, argues that the statements were not made in an effort to conceal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>the crime or in furtherance of the cooperative effort and, therefore, are not covered by the joint venturer exception to the hearsay rule. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">\u201cA joint venturer is \u2018one who aids, commands, counsels, or encourages commission of a crime while sharing with the principal the mental state required for the crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daughtry, </em>417 Mass. 136, 138 (1994), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. 461, 470, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 881 (1979). Regardless of whether the defendant was the one who shot the victim, the evidence makes clear that he was in a joint venture with Miller and Pasteur, as the three agreed to look for \u201csome Bloods\u201d and planned to shoot them. Here, Pasteur made the statements about the gun and whether he shot the victim shortly after the shooting occurred, when he, Miller, and the defendant \u201cwere attempting actively to conceal evidence of the shooting and to avoid detection and detention.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, supra </em>at 545. At this point, no one knew who actually shot the victim, and the men were sharing information \u2014 deepening their relationship. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raposa, </em>440 Mass. 684, 690 (2004). Accordingly, we conclude that there was a joint venture and the statements were made in furtherance of that venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The defendant further argues that the admission of Pastern\u2019s statement violated the doctrine established in <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123 (1968), and could not be cured by a jury instruction. This argument is without merit. As the judge correctly ruled that there was adequate evidence to conclude that the statements were made in furtherance of a joint venture, he properly instructed the jury that they could consider the joint venturer statements only if they had found that the Commonwealth had proved that Pasteur and the defendant were engaged in a joint venture, and that the statements were made in order to further the joint venture or to avoid detection. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>418 Mass. 207, 219 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">2. <em>Witness\u2019s prior consistent statement. </em>During cross-examination, Miller conceded that he \u201clied about almost everything\u201d and did not tell \u201cthe whole truth\u201d in his statements to the police on June 7 and 8, 2000. Defense counsel then highlighted specific lies in Miller\u2019s previous statements. At one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>point, defense counsel recounted a portion of Miller\u2019s statement on June 7 and asked Miller whether it was true or false.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">On redirect examination, Miller testified, \u201cEverything wasn\u2019t true. Some of the stuff was though,\u201d with regard to his June 7 and 8 statements. The prosecutor then explored Miller\u2019s statements in detail, seeking to clarify what Miller had lied about by leading Miller through each statement paragraph by paragraph and asking him whether it was true.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> For each paragraph, Miller testified to what was true in his statements to the police and what was false.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Although he did not object to this line of questioning, the defendant now argues that by doing this the prosecutor improperly bolstered Miller\u2019s testimony by introducing prior consistent statements and by asking Miller whether those statements were true. While the defendant correctly concedes that there are instances where it is permissible to demonstrate that a witness\u2019s prior statements are consistent with trial testimony, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoffer, </em>375 Mass. 369, 375-376 (1978), he argues that a party may not elicit testimony that those prior statements are true. Because the defendant did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s questions, we review the alleged improprieties to determine whether they created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>430 Mass. 91, 99 (1999), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vinnie, </em>428 Mass. 161, 163, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1007 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Generally, a witness\u2019s prior statement that is consistent with his trial testimony is inadmissible. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>425 Mass. 382, 396 (1997). If, however, the witness\u2019s trial testimony is impeached by a claim of recent contrivance or inducement, a prior statement made before the witness had incentive to fabricate testimony is admissible to rebut the claim of recent fabrication, but not to prove the truth of the matter. <em>Id., </em>and cases cited. During cross-examination, the defendant was clearly trying to show that Miller\u2019s trial testimony was contrived in order to protect Pasteur and to receive a favorable disposition of his own case. However, the defendant argues that this exception does not apply because Miller had an incentive to fabricate when he spoke to the police. We reject this suggestion. At the time Miller made his statements to the police on June 7 and 8, 2000, he had not entered into any agreement with the Commonwealth. Moreover, at the time he made the statements, he did not know who had shot the victim and denied personal responsibility for the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">\u201cThe purpose of redirect examination is to explain or rebut adverse testimony or inferences developed during cross-examination.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoffer, supra </em>at 375, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>329 Mass. <em>477, </em>479-481 (1952). It is well established that the prosecutor may ask a witness to explain inconsistencies between prior and present statements. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>394 Mass. 702, 706 (1985), and cases cited. Moreover, \u201c[tjhe introduction of parts of statements on cross-examination generally allows detailed examination of the entire statements on redirect\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoffer, supra </em>at 376 (\u201cWhere, as here, portions of prior statements are the subject of cross-examination and the prior consistent testimony sought to be introduced is itself contained in the prior statements and places the cross-examination concerning the prior statements in context, it is not error to admit the consistent testimony\u201d). Miller\u2019s testimony that almost everything in his statement to the police was false was inaccurate. Rather, much of his June 8 version of events was reasonably consistent with his trial testimony, and it demonstrated that his trial testimony was not recently contrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">However, \u201c[i]t is a fundamental principle that \u2018a witness cannot be asked to assess the credibility of his testimony or that of other witnesses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Triplett, </em>398 Mass. 561, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>567 (1986), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickinson, supra </em>at 706. Here, unlike in the <em>Triplett </em>case where the defendant was questioned about the credibility of his mother, Miller was not asked to assess the credibility of another witness, but was asked whether portions of his own prior statements were true. Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s questions \u201cdid not create an issue of credibility between the defendant and other witnesses.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 18 (1999), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richenburg, </em>401 Mass. 663, 674 (1988). Essentially, the prosecutor was asking whether the events mentioned in Miller\u2019s prior statements actually occurred, which we have previously found was not prejudicial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 687 (1992) (\u201c[The prosecutor] could have asked the defendant, point by point, about the truth of each fact asserted in the statement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">While the prosecutor should not have asked Miller to comment on the truthfulness of his previous statements, this does not require reversal. We are convinced from our review of the record that the prosecutor\u2019s questioning was more likely designed to clarify Miller\u2019s testimony that he \u201clied about almost everything\u201d in his previous statements to the police and to rebut the defendant\u2019s claim of recent contrivance, than to bolster Miller\u2019s testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, supra </em>at 17-20. In view of the overwhelming evidence against the defendant, and the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> we conclude that any error did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">3. <em>keview under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>Pursuant to our duty under\\G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we have reviewed the entire record. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>As there was overwhelming evidence that the defendant was a participant in the joint venture to kill members of a rival gang regardless of whether he was the person to shoot the victim, we find no reason to exercise our power to disturb the jury\u2019s verdict, either by reducing the verdict or by granting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Because we find no merit in the defendant\u2019s claims of error, and we decline to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-12\">This was the defendant\u2019s second trial.
