R. Crim. P. 25 (b) (2), 378 Mass. 896 (1979), seeking reduction of the verdict. The trial judge reduced the verdict to involuntary manslaughter, which the Appeals Court upheld on appeal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 1103 (2004). The Commonwealth appeals from the judge\u2019s order reducing the verdict. The defendant appeals from his conviction and now asks this court to order a new trial, raising a number of errors, but waives them if we should uphold the judge\u2019s reduction of the verdict from murder to involuntary manslaughter. We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review. Because we conclude that the judge abused her discretion in reducing the verdict to manslaughter and that there is no merit in the defendant\u2019s allegations of error, we affirm the conviction of murder in the second degree and vacate the order reducing the degree of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">\n<em>Facts.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">On the afternoon of June 28, 1998, the victim, a two week old infant boy, was rushed to Good Samaritan Hospital and was then \u201cmed flighted\u201d to New England Medical Center in Boston, where he died as a result of \u201csevere cerebral edema and sub-dural hematomas due to shaking.\u201d The victim had bruises on his upper back muscles just below the neck on both sides. His body showed all the signs of shaken baby syndrome, which \u201cessentially destroyed his brain.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant, an approximately five foot, eight inch tall man weighing between 275 and 300 pounds, admitted to holding the victim\u2019s body with his hands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>underneath the victim\u2019s armpits and shaking him with enough force to shake a 215 pound man.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Given the severity of the victim\u2019s injuries, he would have lost consciousness and become unresponsive \u201c[njearly instantaneously or within a very few seconds.\u201d The defendant admitted shaking the victim, but claimed that he did so in a panic to revive him. The crux of his defense was that he had acted without legal malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">\n<em>Discussion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">1. <em>The Commonwealth\u2019s appeal. </em>\u201cPursuant to rule 25 (b) (2), a trial judge has the authority to reduce a verdict, despite the presence of evidence sufficient to support the jury\u2019s original verdict.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Rolon, 438 Mass. 808, 820 (2003), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>427 Mass. 659, 666-667 (1998), and cases cited. This authority is similar to our power to review capital cases under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, and a trial judge\u2019s decision on a rule 25 (b) (2) motion \u201cshould be guided by the same considerations.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaulden, </em>383 Mass. 543, 555 (1981). The purpose of such postconviction powers is \u201cto ensure that the result in every criminal case is consonant with justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woodward, supra </em>at 666. In exercising this power, the judge is required \u201cto consider the whole case broadly to determine whether there was any miscarriage of justice\u201d (quotations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>366 Mass. 805, 807 (1975), and cases cited. As we have previously cautioned, \u201cjudge[sj should use this power sparingly,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 667, and not sit as a \u201csecond jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keough, </em>385 Mass. 314, 321 (1982). However, we will disturb a judge\u2019s order reducing a verdict only where the judge abused his discretion or committed an error of law. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woodward, supra </em>at 668, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millyan, </em>399 Mass. 171, 188 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">A judge\u2019s discretion to reduce a verdict is appropriately exercised where the weight of the evidence in the case points to a lesser crime even though it is technically sufficient to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rolon, supra </em>at 821. Accordingly, to justify a reduction in the verdict, there must be some weakness in the critical evidence, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ghee, </em>414 Mass. 313, 322 (1993) (verdict reduction appropriate where evidence of premeditation \u201cslim\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millyan, supra </em>at 188-189 (verdict reduction appropriate where evidence of intoxication undermined theory of deliberate premeditation); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaulden, supra </em>at 557-558 (verdict reduction appropriate where evidence showed victim was first aggressor and defendant\u2019s conduct likely was influenced by alcohol); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, supra </em>at 808 (verdict reduction appropriate where evidence of intoxication and sudden combat negated malice element), or some weakness in the evidence coupled with trial error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woodward, supra </em>at 671 (although evidence suggested defendant did not act with malice, jury not instructed on manslaughter); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millyan, supra </em>(although there was evidence of intoxication, jury not instructed on issue of impairment due to intoxication). However, a judge is not justified in reducing \u201cto a lesser verdict that would be inconsistent with the weight of the evidence,\u201d nor in basing reduction \u201csolely on factors irrelevant to the level of the offense proved.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Rolon, <em>supra </em>at 822, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Therefore, we look to determine whether there was some weakness in the evidence that the defendant committed murder in the second degree, or evidence suggesting that he more likely committed involuntary manslaughter. If, as we conclude, the weight of the evidence is entirely consistent with murder in the second degree based on third prong malice, it was an abuse of discretion to reduce the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Here, the judge provided a written memorandum of decision outlining her reasons for reducing the verdict to involuntary manslaughter. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaulden, supra </em>at 556 (judge should state reasons for reducing verdict). Those reasons were a lack of any evidence that the defendant had inflicted prior abuse or injuries on any of his children, especially the victim; the defendant\u2019s culpable conduct consisted of one violent shaking lasting \u201conly a few seconds,\u201d while under the sway of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>painful memories of his other son\u2019s death<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; the defendant was not a vicious man but one who succumbed to the frailty of the human condition and committed a momentary act of \u201cextraordinarily poor judgment\u201d; and the defendant was a steady worker with no prior criminal record. These reasons do not provide an adequate basis for reducing the verdict from murder in the second degree to involuntary manslaughter. Moreover, the judge outlined the evidence that would tend to comport more with murder than manslaughter, but failed to mention how the evidence supporting manslaughter made a manslaughter verdict more consonant with justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">A fine line distinguishes murder in the second degree based on third prong malice from the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Skinner, </em>408 Mass. 88, 93 (1990), and cases cited. \u201cWithout malice, an unlawful killing can be no more than manslaughter.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Judge, 420 </em>Mass. 433, 437 (1995), and cases cited. \u201cThe difference between the elements of the third prong of malice and . . . involuntary manslaughter lies in the degree of risk of physical harm that a reasonable person would recognize was created by particular conduct, based on what the defendant knew. The risk for the purposes of third prong malice is that there was a plain and strong likelihood of death. . . . The risk that will satisfy the standard for . . . involuntary manslaughter \u2018involves a high degree of likelihood that substantial harm will result to another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>413 Mass. 292, 303-304 n.14 (1992), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass. 383, 399 (1944). In this case, the jury received instructions on both murder in the second degree based on third prong malice and involuntary manslaughter. As the jury convicted the defendant of murder in the second degree, they must have found that in the circumstances known to the defendant, a reasonably prudent person would have known that, according to common experience, there was a plain and strong likelihood that the victim\u2019s death would follow the defendant\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The judge\u2019s emphasis on the lack of evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>defendant had previously abused or injured any of his other children was misplaced \u2014 that the defendant ostensibly did not abuse the other children is irrelevant to the nature of the risk posed by his abuse of the victim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge also relied on the fact that the defendant had not abused the victim previously. The victim was only fourteen days old when he was killed, and this was the first time that the defendant had been alone with the victim. Thus, we do not find solace, as did the judge, in the fact that the defendant did not previously abuse the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">That the episode was brief does not create a weakness in the evidence of third prong malice. Although even evidence of repeated blows does not necessarily require a finding of malice, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vizcarrondo, </em>427 Mass. 392, 397-398 (1998), <em>S.C., </em>431 Mass. 360 (2000), evidence of a single blow to a young child may be sufficient to support a jury\u2019s finding of malice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Starling, </em>382 Mass. 423, 426 (1981). This case is unlike the <em>Woodward </em>case, where the victim lived for five days after the injury was inflicted, the defendant denied shaking the victim, both the medical evidence and the cause of injury were controverted, and of particular importance, the jury had not even been given the option of convicting on the lesser included offense of manslaughter (an error which, by itself, would have required a new trial). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woodward, supra </em>at 660, 670-671. Here, the defendant admits that he shook the victim hard enough to shake a 215 pound man and that he knew that shaking a child could cause harm. There was a plain and strong likelihood of death in a 300 pound man shaking a two week old, seven and one-half pound infant with that degree of force. Additionally, unlike <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woodward, supra, </em>there is no concern that the jury\u2019s finding of third prong malice has been tainted by any error in instruction \u2014 this jury was given the option of convicting the defendant of the lesser included offense of manslaughter, and was properly instructed on the difference between murder and manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Furthermore, the judge\u2019s conclusion that the culpable conduct consisted only of one violent shaking that lasted only a few seconds misstates the evidence. The judge stated that it <em>\u201cwas </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>clear\u201d that the victim \u201cwas shaken violently for approximately three to five seconds\u201d and then referred to the shaking as lasting \u201conly a few seconds.\u201d The only testimony regarding how long the shaking occurred was from the defendant and an expert on shaken baby syndrome. The defendant claimed that he shook the victim for five to fifteen minutes. However, the expert testified that it would be physically impossible for anyone to sustain that forceful a shaking for more than twenty seconds. Rather, the expert stated that such vigorous shaking would likely occur from three to twenty seconds. As the expert could not pinpoint the exact time of shaking, it was error for the judge simply to pick the lower amount of time suggested by the expert, particularly when the defendant testified that the shaking occurred for much longer. Thus, the evidence readily supports the conclusion that this shaking continued for a period of time closer to twenty seconds. Coupled with the expert testimony that the victim would have lost consciousness \u201c[n]early instantaneously,\u201d the evidence suggests that the shaking of the victim continued well past the point in time when his injury was manifest \u2014 the forceful shaking of an infant who is already so severely injured is conduct that raises a plain and strong likelihood of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Additionally, the judge noted that the defendant\u2019s culpable conduct may have resulted from painful memories of the death of another son. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>The judge could find this only by crediting the defendant\u2019s testimony. While a \u201cjudge is not foreclosed from considering the defendant\u2019s testimony . . . and, if he believes it, relying on it,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keough, </em>385 Mass. 314, 321 (1982), it is not clear from the judge\u2019s memorandum that she did in fact believe the defendant\u2019s testimony. The judge noted that the defendant gave \u201cseveral conflicting and implausible accounts\u201d of what occurred.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the trial, the defendant maintained that he shook the victim because the victim appeared to be in distress after hitting his head in the tub when the defendant was giving him a bath. Specifically, the defendant claimed that the victim was having difficulty breathing and his eyes were either dilated or half open. However, the uncontroverted medical testimony establishes that such a fall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>would not produce the symptoms described by the defendant. Additionally, there was no sign of injury to the back of the victim\u2019s head. Indeed, the only external injury found on the victim was an abrasion on his forehead without bruising. Finally, there was no evidence, other than the defendant\u2019s testimony, that he in fact gave the victim a bath; rather, the police officer who responded to the scene testified that the bathtub was dry. Where there is uncontroverted testimony discrediting the defendant\u2019s account and the judge acknowledges that the defendant gave \u201cimplausible\u201d accounts, we conclude that the judge could not rely on the defendant\u2019s testimony as a ground to reduce the verdict. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millyan, </em>399 Mass. 171, 189 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The judge\u2019s reliance on her finding that the defendant was not a vicious man but one who succumbed to the frailty of the human condition and committed a momentary act of \u201cextraordinarily poor judgment\u201d was irrelevant to the consideration of third prong malice. The only consideration was what the defendant knew the circumstances to be, and it is uncontro-verted that the defendant knew he was vigorously shaking the victim. Based on the defendant\u2019s knowledge, there was a plain and strong likelihood that the victim would die from the shaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The other factors relied on by the judge \u2014 the defendant\u2019s being a steady worker with no prior criminal record who enjoyed the support of his wife, the victim\u2019s mother \u2014 are insufficient to justify reduction of the verdict. Although a defendant\u2019s personal circumstances may be considered in conjunction with evidence that points to a lesser degree of guilt, personal circumstances alone do not justify reduction of a verdict. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>438 Mass. 808, 825 (2003), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The judge also noted that the jury may have been unduly affected by the image of a 300 pound adult man shaking a vulnerable seven pound baby. We disagree. Both the defendant\u2019s size and the victim\u2019s age and size were relevant to show that the victim was especially frail and susceptible to death at the hands of an adult. Moreover, the size of both could properly suggest that the injuries inflicted by the defendant, when viewed in light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>of the victim\u2019s tender age and size, were life threatening in an objective sense, which is relevant to the third prong malice issue. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vizcarrondo, </em>431 Mass. 360, 363 (2000). The vast discrepancy in size and strength is what makes it evident that the defendant\u2019s conduct posed a plain and strong likelihood of death. That it tended to prove the Commonwealth\u2019s case does not make it prejudicial, or provide a basis for reducing the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">As there was no error of law or substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice in the jury\u2019s verdict, the judge abused her discretion in reducing the verdict to involuntary manslaughter where the weight of the evidence clearly supported a verdict of murder in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">2. <em>The defendant\u2019s appeal. </em>Because we reverse the judge\u2019s order reducing the verdict to involuntary manslaughter and reinstate the verdict of murder in the second degree, we address the defendant\u2019s appeal from his conviction. The defendant argues that the judge erred by (1) admitting three photographs depicting the victim after surgical alteration of his body where the cause of death was not a contested issue at trial; (2) failing to instruct the jury that malice requires proof that the defendant was aware of the life-endangering risk posed by his conduct; and (3) sustaining the prosecution\u2019s objection to the introduction of the death certificate of the defendant\u2019s son Andrew. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">a. <em>Admission of autopsy photographs. </em>At trial, the Commonwealth introduced three autopsy photographs of the victim over the defendant\u2019s objections. The defendant now argues that the judge abused her discretion in admitting the photographs where the cause of death was not contested and the photographs did not depict the victim\u2019s injuries.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">As we have previously stated, \u201cwhether the inflammatory quality of a photograph outweighs its probative value and precludes its admission is determined in the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeSouza, </em>428 Mass. 667, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>670 (1999), and cases cited. Generally, this is true even where the defendant agrees to stipulate to the facts that the photograph tends to prove. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nadworny, </em>396 Mass. 342, 367 (1985), cert. denied, 477 U.S. 904 (1986). However, if apt to be inflammatory or otherwise prejudicial, autopsy photographs showing the body as altered during the autopsy should be admitted only if relevant to the resolution of a contested issue. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bastarache, </em>382 Mass. 86, 106 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The judge admitted the photographs only after the Commonwealth had laid a foundation indicating that the photographs were relevant to establishing the severity of the victim\u2019s injuries. The defendant argues that this was an abuse of discretion because the nature, extent, and cause of the fatal injuries were not issues before the jury. While we agree with the defendant that the photographs were disturbing, we do not agree that they lacked relevance. A critical issue in the case was the amount of force used to shake the victim. As the nature of the injuries supported an inference concerning the amount of force used to inflict the injuries, the photographs were relevant to that issue. Additionally, the final photograph admitted, showing no injury to the back of the victim\u2019s head, was relevant to contradict the defendant\u2019s testimony that the victim hit his head in the bathtub. Furthermore, the judge appropriately mitigated any potential prejudice by cautioning the jury not to be affected by the nature of the photographs, and by instructing them that the photographs were to be used only to draw attention to a clinical medical status or the nature and extent of the victim\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u201cIn order to find an abuse of discretion, \u2018it is necessary to decide that no conscientious judge, acting intelligently, could honestly have taken the view expressed by [her].\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jaime, </em>433 Mass. 575, 579 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Medeiros, </em>395 Mass. 336, 351 (1985). This is a heavy burden that the defendant has failed to meet in this case. The judge\u2019s decision to admit three autopsy photographs in this case was not an abuse of discretion, but instead a reasonable ruling that allowed the Commonwealth to explain the significance of the autopsy findings. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boateng, </em>438 Mass. 498, 507 (2003). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Urrea, </em>443 Mass. 530, 545 (2005), and cases cited (no abuse of discretion admit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>ting photograph depicting victim with suturing across chest and intubation tube in place where relevant to issue of extreme atrocity or cruelty).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">b. <em>Third prong malice instruction. </em>The defendant argues that the judge erred in failing to instruct that subjective awareness of the risk of death is required for a murder conviction. This argument is without merit, as a murder conviction based on third prong malice requires only that \u201cin the circumstances known to the defendant, a reasonably prudent person would have known that, according to common experience, there was a plain and strong likelihood that death would follow the contemplated act.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>427 Mass. 659, 669 n.14 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sneed, </em>413 Mass. 387, 388 n.1 (1992). Thus, it is not required that the defendant subjectively know that his actions would create a substantial risk of death. It is enough that based on what the defendant knew, a reasonable person would objectively realize the risk of death. We have repeatedly rejected similar arguments, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>433 Mass. 266, 273 (2001) (rejecting claim that third prong malice did not sufficiently require morally culpable state of mind); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Starling, </em>382 Mass. 423, 427-429 (1981) (rejecting argument that third prong malice should require actual subjective foresight by defendant), and affirmed that the primary distinction between third prong malice and involuntary manslaughter is the degree of risk that was apparent from the defendant\u2019s conduct. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Azar, </em>435 Mass. 675, 681-684 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vizcarrondo, </em>427 Mass. 392, 394-397 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanna, </em>424 Mass. 92, 105 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>413 Mass. 292, 303-304 n.14 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">c. <em>Exclusion of death certificate. </em>Last, the defendant argues that the judge erred in excluding the death certificate of the defendant\u2019s other son, Andrew. At trial, the defendant attempted to admit the death certificate, which stated the cause of death as myocarditis. The judge sustained the Commonwealth\u2019s objection, finding it a collateral issue, but offered to instruct the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>that Andrew\u2019s death was not an issue in the case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant, however, argues that the offered limiting instruction was not an acceptable alternative and could not compensate for the lack of extrinsic evidence that Andrew died of natural causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u201cWhere there is a risk of confusing the jury, the judge must weigh the probative value of any proffered evidence against such danger.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>432 Mass. 746, 758 (2000), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>422 Mass. 18, 25 (1996). Here, the judge did not abuse her discretion. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s claim, there was no insinuation that the defendant had anything to do with Andrew\u2019s death. Rather, the jury heard uncontroverted testimony that Andrew\u2019s cause of death was myocarditis, and the judge offered to instruct the jury that there was no issue regarding his cause of death. The prosecutor\u2019s comments regarding Andrew\u2019s death were proper and did not, as the defendant alleges, \u201cimpl[y] that dark forces may have been at work in Andrew\u2019s death.\u201d As the defendant relied on the memory of Andrew\u2019s death as ostensibly causing him to panic and shake the victim, it was proper and necessary for the prosecutor to comment on this defense. However, at no time did the prosecutor imply or state that Andrew died from anything other than natural causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u201c[W]e give broad discretion to trial judges who have valid concerns about trying a case within a case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellis, supra </em>at 758-759, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>366 Mass. 284, 289 (1974). By permitting inquiry into the wholly unrelated matter of the cause, of Andrew\u2019s death, the judge risked distracting the jury. Accordingly, the judge\u2019s refusal to admit the death certificate was well within her discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\n<em>Conclusion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Because we conclude that the judge abused her discretion in reducing the verdict to involuntary manslaughter where the weight of the evidence clearly supported murder in the second degree, and the defendant\u2019s claims of error lack merit, we vacate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>the order reducing the verdict and affirm the conviction of murder in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b306-10\">There was bleeding on the surface of the victim\u2019s brain and inside the brain itself. The victim\u2019s brain was soft and swollen. Additionally, there was injury to the nerves in the victim\u2019s brain.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b307-11\">Although the defendant claimed that the shaking went on for five to fifteen minutes, an expert on shaken baby syndrome testified that there was no way a perpetrator could sustain the type of necessary vigorous shaking for longer than twenty seconds at most. To inflict such injury, typically, the shaking would have to go on from three to twenty seconds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b309-7\">The defendant had a son, Andrew, who died of natural causes when he was approximately one year old.

R. Crim. P. 25 (b) (2), 378 Mass. 896 (1979)].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>399 Mass. 191, 192 (1987). Consequently, our consideration of a judge\u2019s decision to reduce a verdict is limited to \u201cwhether the judge abused his discretion or committed an error of law.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaulden, </em>383 Mass. 543, 557 (1981). The court concludes that the judge abused her discretion in reducing the verdict from murder in the second degree to involuntary manslaughter. In my view, it reaches this conclusion by simply substituting its judgment for that of the judge who saw and heard the evidence. While we might not have decided the matter as the trial judge did, that is not a proper application of the deferential standard that we profess to apply to such decisions. Because I perceive nothing other than a conscientious judge acting to ensure that justice was more nearly achieved by intelligently and honestly assessing both the weight of the evidence on a determinative element of the crime, and whether the verdict was disproportionate, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">As we noted in <em>Woodward, supra </em>at 670, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>413 Mass. 292, 303-304 n.14 (1992), the difference between the elements of third prong malice (murder in the second degree) and manslaughter \u201clies in the degree of risk of physical harm that a reasonable person would recognize was created by particular conduct, based on what the defendant knew. The risk for the purposes of the third prong of malice is that there was a plain and strong likelihood of death. . . . The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>risk that will satisfy the standard for . . . involuntary manslaughter \u2018involves a high degree of likelihood that substantial harm will result to another.\u2019 \u201d This is a very fine line, and the judge weighed the evidence with that in mind. She found that its weight was more consistent with wilful and wanton conduct (involuntary manslaughter) than with third prong malice. She did so by considering all the evidence, taken together, including that of the Commonwealth\u2019s experts and of the defendant, which she was fully entitled to do. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keough, </em>385 Mass. 314, 321 (1982) (defendant\u2019s testimony can be considered, and if believed, relied on by judge in reducing verdict). See <em>Woodward, supra </em>at 668-669.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She found that the defendant\u2019s conduct likely consisted of a single shaking lasting a few seconds, possibly \u201cunder the sway of the painful memories\u201d of the death of another of his children.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She also considered her knowledge of other murder and manslaughter verdicts in the Commonwealth involving fatal batteries on children, and the familiar pattern of repeated prior injuries or caretaker abuse found in those cases but not in this one.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">In the end, she concluded that \u201c[tjhis was a tragic case of an overwhelmed father and husband who, alone and unaccustomed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>to the difficult task of caring for a newborn infant, reacted to a stressful situation with lamentable panic and confusion,\u201d and that the defendant \u201csuccumbed to the frailty of the human condition, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bearse, </em>358 Mass. 481, 487 (1970), and committed a momentary act of \u2018extraordinarily poor judgment,\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>361 Mass. 709, 713 (1972); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>346 Mass. 107, 118 (1963).\u201d All of these conclusions find support in the evidence, and not just in the defendant\u2019s testimony. And all bear on the weight of the case on the question of malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The court weighs the evidence differently from the trial judge, concluding that it \u201cclearly supported a verdict of murder in the second degree.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 297. This is not our role. While there is little doubt that the evidence supported the jury\u2019s verdict of murder in the second degree, that is neither the test nor the standard under rule 25 (b) (2). See <em>Woodward, supra </em>at 666 (\u201cthe responsibility [under rule 25 (b) (2)] may be exercised by the trial judge, even if the evidence warrants the jury\u2019s verdict\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaulden, supra </em>at 555 (rule 25 [b] [2] \u201cempowers] a judge ... to \u2018order the entry of a finding of guilty of any offense included in the offense charged in the indictment,\u2019 without regard to the fact that the evidence warranted the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty of the greater offense\u201d). In our constrained assessment of a verdict reduction under that rule, we are not to reweigh the evidence and second guess the trial judge\u2019s assessment of it. \u201cRule 25 (b) (2) places the matter in the hands of the judge who heard the witnesses, and we should not undertake to substitute our judgment for [hers].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">We have consistently followed this admonition until now. Since 1979, when the Legislature amended G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11 (now embodied in rule 25 [b] [2]), to grant trial judges the power to enter a finding of guilty of any lesser included offense in criminal cases, appellate courts have reversed verdict reductions on only three occasions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On each occasion, the judge was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>reversed because the reason for reducing the verdict was not germane to the weight of the evidence on the charged offense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>438 Mass. 808, 822-825 (2003) (reversing order reducing verdict from felony-murder in first degree to murder in second degree where judge invoked irrelevant theory of provocation and improperly rejected doctrine of joint venture); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sabetti, </em>411 Mass. 770, 780-781 (1992) (reversing order reducing verdict from trafficking in cocaine to possession of cocaine with intent to distribute where judge found that defendant did not know that he possessed over twenty-eight grams of cocaine, fact irrelevant to crime for which he was convicted); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burr, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 637, 639-643 (1992) (reversing order reducing verdicts from trafficking in cocaine to possession of cocaine with intent to distribute based on trial judge\u2019s apparent disagreement with harshness of mandatory minimum sentence required by trafficking conviction, and where weight of cocaine was undisputed at trial). This is not such a case. On no occasion has an appellate court decided to reweigh evidence that it never heard in the first instance, and to reverse a judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>carefully articulated decision on that basis.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The court notes that the authority given trial judges by rule 25 (b) (2) is \u201csimilar to our power to review capital cases under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, and a trial judge\u2019s decision on [such a motion] \u2018should be guided by the same considerations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 291, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaulden, supra </em>at 555. While this is a fair enough statement of the law, the court seems to have forgotten an observation made a long time ago: \u201c[U]nder \u00a7 33E review, this court has proceeded . . . with the disadvantage of not seeing and hearing the witnesses.... A trial judge does not have that disadvantage\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaulden, supra </em>at 554. Even with that disadvantage, the court, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>361 Mass. 709, 713 (1972), saw its way clear to reduce two convictions of murder in the second degree (where the weapon used was a handgun) to involuntary manslaughter, when it concluded that the weight of the evidence was \u201cthat [the defendant] was confused and frightened rather than enraged.\u201d It is hard to say that the judge here was not \u201cguided by the same considerations,\u201d having the further advantage of actually seeing and hearing the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Although the evidence was sufficient to warrant the jury\u2019s verdict as a matter of law, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaulden, supra </em>at 553-555, there was no abuse of discretion in the judge\u2019s decision that justice would be more nearly achieved if the verdict was reduced from murder in the second degree to involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The court finds that the judge could not rely on Lyons\u2019s testimony as a ground to reduce the verdict because uncontroverted testimony at trial discredited Lyons\u2019s account of the events of June 28, 1998, and because the judge acknowledged Lyons\u2019s \u201cimplausible\u201d accounts to the police and paramedics. <em>Ante </em>at 295-296. Nothing in our case law, however, suggests that a judge is not permitted to credit some, but not all, of a defendant\u2019s testimony, in deciding on a motion under Mass. R. Grim. R 25 (b) (2), 378 Mass. 896 (1979), just as any factfinder is entitled to do when evaluating the testimony of any other witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The court cites <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Starling, </em>382 Mass. 423, 426 (1981), for the proposition that \u201cevidence of a single blow to a young child may be sufficient to support a jury\u2019s finding of malice.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 294. The victim\u2019s death in that case, however, was caused not by shaking, but rather by \u201cone or more \u2018very severe\u2019 blows to the chest or abdomen with a blunt instrument such as a fist, a foot, or a board.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Starling, supra </em>at 425.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b318-8\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>427 Mass. 659, 670 (1998) <em>(Woodward), </em>we held that the judge did not abuse his discretion in concluding that the jury verdict of murder in the second degree was not proportionate with convictions in similar cases, where there was no evidence of repeated caretaker abuse in that case. Here, similarly, the judge reasonably relied on \u201cthe lack of any evidence that the defendant had inflicted any prior abuse or injuries on any of his children, especially [the victim].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The power to reduce verdicts is sparingly exercised by trial judges. In the past twenty-six years, the Commonwealth has appealed from such reductions in only thirteen cases: <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>438 Mass. 808 (2003) (order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>reducing verdict from felony-murder in first degree to murder in second degree reversed); <em>Woodward, supra </em>(order reducing verdict from murder in the second degree to involuntary manslaughter affirmed); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ghee, </em>414 Mass. 313 (1993) (order reducing verdict from murder in first degree to murder in second degree affirmed); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sabetti, </em>411 Mass. 770 (1992) (order reducing verdict from trafficking in cocaine to possession with intent to distribute reversed); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aguiar, </em>400 Mass. 508 (1987) (issue of verdict reduction not decided where defendant\u2019s conviction of murder in first degree reversed on other grounds); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>399 Mass. 191 (1987) (order reducing verdict from murder in second degree to manslaughter affirmed); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millyan, </em>399 Mass. 171 (1987) (order reducing verdict from murder in first degree to murder in second degree affirmed); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keough, supra </em>(order reducing verdict from murder in second degree to manslaughter affirmed); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaulden, </em>383 Mass. 543 (1981) (order reducing verdict from murder in second degree to manslaughter affirmed); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamar L., </em>61 Mass.
