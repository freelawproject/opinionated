As a result, the Department of Commerce published countervailing duty (\u201cCVD\u201d) orders on CoRe steel from France and Korea and antidump-ing duty (\u201cADD\u201d) orders on CoRe steel from Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and Korea. <em>See </em>2007 Sunset Review Information at OVERVIEW-3 (P.R. 941).</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-3\">In 2000, the ITC conducted its first five-year sunset reviews of these orders. In this first sunset review, <em>inter alia, </em>the ITC exercised its discretion to cumulate all subject imports together. <em>See Certain Carbon Steel Products from Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, Mexico, The Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, and The United Kingdom, </em>USITC Pub. 3364, Inv.

The ITC also found that revocation of the ADD/CVD orders would result in the continuation or recurrence of material injury. <em>Id. </em>at 58. Consequently, the ADD and CVD orders continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-4\">On November 1, 2005, the ITC instituted a second five-year sunset review of these orders. <em>See Certain Carbon Steel Products From Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, and United Kingdom, </em>70 Fed.

All parties engaged in this lawsuit actively participated in all stages of these reviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-6\">On December 14, 2006, the Commission voted, and by a vote of four to two (4 to 2) determined that revocation of the: orders on CoRe steel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1383\">*1383</page-number>from Australia, Canada, France and Japan would not be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury to the domestic industry (i.e., a negative determination). 2007 Commission Views at 1 (P.R. 940). The ITC unanimously decided, however, that revocation of the orders on CoRe steel from Germany and Korea would be likely to lead to a continuation or recurrence of material injury to the domestic industry (i.e., an affirmative determination.) <em>Id. </em>The ITC also decided on a subsidiary preliminary issue, by a vote of four to two (4 to 2), to cumulate the subject imports into two groups: (i) Australia, France and Japan; and (ii) Germany and Korea. <em>Id. </em>at 106. With respect to Canada, the ITC decided not to cumulate Canadian CoRe steel imports with any of the subject imports from the other countries. <em>Id. </em>These final determinations were published in the <em>Federal Register </em>on January 31, 2007. <em>Certain Carbon Steel Products From Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Poland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom, </em>72 Fed.

Case No. 07-00071) on September 7, 2007, challenging, <em>inter alia, </em>the following agency determinations: (1) the ITC\u2019s decision to cumulate the subject imports into two separate groups \u2014 Australia/France/ Japan and Germany/Korea; (2) its negative determination with respect to CoRe steel from Australia, France &amp; Japan; (3) its negative determination with respect to CoRe steel from Canada, particularly its determination that the volume of Canadian imports would not be significant if the orders were revoked; (4) the ITC\u2019s decision to cumu-late German CoRe steel imports with Korean CoRe steel imports; (5) the ITC\u2019s affirmative determination with respect to imports of CoRe steel from Germany and Korea; and finally (6) whether the ITC was required to apply an analysis pursuant to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\u2019s (\u201cCAFC\u201d) opinion in <em>Bratsk Aluminum Smelter v.

'</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1403-7\">The court is required to uphold a sunset review determination by the ITC unless it is \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1384\">*1384</page-number>record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(i) (2000). A party \u201cchallenging the ITC\u2019s determination under the substantial evidence standard \u2018has chosen a course with a high barrier to reversal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nippon Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>458 F.3d 1345, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (internal citations omitted). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla,\u201d it is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Consol. Edison Co. v. </em>N.L.R.B., 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938) (citing <em>Appalachian Elec. Power Co. v. N.L.R.B., </em>93 F.2d 985, 989 (4th Cir. 1938)). There must be \u201c[a] rational connection between the facts found and the choice made\u201d in an agency determination if it is to be characterized as supported by substantial evidence and otherwise in accordance with law. <em>Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1404-4\">In determining the existence of substantial evidence, a reviewing court must consider \u201cthe record as a whole, including evidence that supports as well as evidence that \u2018fairly detracts from the substanti-ality of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Huaiyin Foreign Trade Corp. v.

Moreover, the court must not \u201cdisplace the [agency\u2019s] choice between two fairly conflicting views, even though the court would justifiably have made' a different choice had the matter been before it de novo.\u201d <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. N.L.R.B., </em>340 U.S. 474, 488 (1951). \u201c[I]t is not the province of the Court to reweigh the evidence before the agency.\u201d <em>Comm. for Fair Beam Imports v. United States, </em>31 CIT _, _, 477 F. Supp.2d 1313, 1326 (2007), <em>aff\u2019d </em>260 Fed. Appx. 302 (Fed. Cir. Jan. 11, 2008). That said, \u201cthe agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019 \u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of United States v. State Farm Auto Ins. Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) <em>(quoting Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)). However, the ITC is \u201cpresumed to have considered all of the evidence on the record\u201d and \u201cis not required to explicitly address every piece of evidence presented by the parties.\u201d <em>Nucor Corp. v. United States, </em>28 CIT 188, 234, 318 F. Supp.2d 1207, 1247 (2004) (citation omitted), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>414 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2005). The ITC need not \u201cmake an explicit response to every argument made by a party, but [current law] instead requires that issues material to the agency\u2019s determination be discussed so that the \u2018path of the agency may reasonably be discerned\u2019 by a reviewing court.\u201d <em>Timkin U.S. Corp. v. United States, </em>421 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2005) <em>(iquoting </em>Uruguay Round Agreements Act (\u201cURAA\u201d), Statement of Administration Action (\u201cSAA\u201d), accompanying H:R.

Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416 (1971) (The standard is \u201cwhether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-5\">On questions of law, the Court is guided by U.S. Supreme Court precedent holding that, unless contrary to the \u201cunambiguously expressed intent of Congress,\u201d the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute it administers must be upheld if that interpretation is \u201cpermissible.\u201d <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984). Consequently, a degree of deference is owed to the agency when it interprets the statute it administers and \u201c[w]hether we would come to the same conclusion, were we to analyze [it] anew, is not the issue.\u201d <em>Suramerica de Aleaciones Laminadas, C.A. v. United States, </em>966 F.2d 660, 665 (Fed. Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-7\">I. <em>The ITC\u2019s Cumulation Determination Is Supported by Substantial Evidence on the Record and Is Otherwise in Accordance with Law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1405-10\">A. Cumulation - Statutory Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b1405-11\">The ITC is required to conduct a sunset review every five years after publication of an antidumping duty order, a countervailing duty order, or a prior sunset review. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(c)(1). In a five year sunset review the ITC decides, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cwhether revocation of an order... would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury within a reasonably foreseeable time.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(l) (2000). The ITC must evaluate \u201cthe likely volume, price effect, and impact of imports of the subject merchandise on the industry if the order is revoked....\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(l). In making this material injury determination, the ITC, in its discretion,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1405-12\"><em>may </em>cumulatively assess the volume and effect of imports of the subject merchandise from all countries with respect to which reviews under section 1675(b) or (c) of this title were initiated on the same day, if such imports would be likely to compete with each other and with domestic like products in the United States market.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1405-13\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(7) (2000) (emphasis added); <em>see Nippon Steel Corp. v.

In addressing this query, the ITC\u2019s first question is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1406-5\">whether the imports are likely to have any such impact. If not, the ITC is precluded from cumulating. If yes, then the question remains whether that impact is also adverse. If affirmative, the agency is permitted to cumulate; if negative, cumulation is not permissible since any impact is not both discernible and adverse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1406-6\"><em>Neenah Foundry Co. v.

United States, </em>776 F.2d 1029, 1032 (Fed. Cir. 1985). In summary, where the ITC exercises its discretion to cumulate subject imports it may do so, only if, the sunset review was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1387\">*1387</page-number>[(1)] initiated on the same day, [and (2)] if such imports would be likely to compete with each other and with domestic like products in the United States market.

The ITC\u2019s Cumulation Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-6\">In this second sunset review the ITC majority decided<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to exercise its discretion to cumulate the subject imports from certain countries. 2007 Commission Views at 108 (C.R. 831). The ITC considered the following enumerated issues in deciding whether or not to cumulate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1407-7\">(1) whether imports from any of the subject countries are precluded from cumulation because they are likely to have no discernible adverse impact on the domestic industry; (2) whether imports of corrosion-resistant steel from the subject countries are likely to compete with each other and with the domestic like product according to the traditional four-factor test; and (3) other considerations, such as similarities and differences in the conditions of competition of the subject countries with regard to their participation in the U.S. market.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1407-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 106-107. Following an analysis, the ITC determined that it would cumulate subject goods into the following country groups: (1) Australia, France and Japan; (2) Germany and Korea; and (3) Canada, set off by itself, not cumulated. <em>Id. </em>at 108. The ITC\u2019s initial determination was based on its finding that all subject imports would have a discernible adverse impact on the U.S. industry, and that there was a reasonable overlap in competition among imports from all six countries and the U.S. industry. <em>Id. </em>at 108, 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b1407-9\">Specifically, the ITC found that subject goods from Canada would likely compete under different conditions of competition than those of the other countries and thus declined to cumulate Canadian subject imports with the other subject countries. <em>Id. </em>at 108. With respect to Germany and Korea, the ITC found that the conditions of competition were similar to each other, but also different from the other countries and therefore it exercised its discretion to cumulate German and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1388\">*1388</page-number>Korean subject imports separately from the other four countries. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the ITC decided to exercise its discretion to cumulate Australian, French and Japanese subject imports with each other as they face similar conditions of competition. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1408-4\">C.

Joint Plaintiffs and USS argue that the ITC erred by (1) failing to exercise its discretion to cumulate in a manner consistent with the statute and congressional intent; (2) failing to apply the correct \u201cconditions of competition\u201d analysis in its cumulation decision and failing to apply it on a coun-terfactual basis; and (3) failing to cumulate subject imports from Australia, France and Japan together with Canada, Germany and Korea.

They argue that 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(7) sets out the sole factors that the ITC may consider in the exercise of its discretion of whether to cumulate subject imports. (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 17-18; USS Br. at 11-12.) Specifically, two of the four ITC commissioners comprising the majority \u2014 Chairman Pearson and Commissioner Okun \u2014 \u201cdisregarded the prescribed statutory requirements for making a cumulation determination in favor of a test that is not in the statute, i.e., considering only the \u2018conditions of competition.\u2019 \u201d (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 19; <em>see also </em>USS Br. 14-18.) Further, Joint Plaintiffs &amp; USS argue that when Chairman Pearson\u2019s and Commissioner Okun\u2019s \u201cextra-statutory analysis\u201d excluded a country from cumula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1389\">*1389</page-number>tion, they then failed to consider the actual statutory factors \u2014 no discernible adverse impact and the likelihood of a reasonable overlap of competition. (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 20; <em>see also </em>USS Br. at 15-16.) Joint Plaintiffs note that though the ITC has in the past \u201cconsidered additional elements...as part of [its] exercise of discretion, such consideration has been part of or ancillary to the statutory criteria.\u201d (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 20.) Joint Plaintiffs conclude that because the ITC disregarded the statute, the Commission\u2019s analysis was incomplete. (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 22.) Moreover, USS contends that the extra statutory factors that these <em>refusenik </em>Commissioners employed \u201cdo <em>not </em>go to the question of whether imports from the countries at issue will contribute to the hammering effect\u201d but instead represent a \u201cmisunderstand[ing of] the meaning of the Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Allegheny Ludlum</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>...treating it as giving the Commission <em>carte blanche </em>to do anything that they want in addressing cumulation issues in five year reviews.\u201d (USS Br. 14-15 (emphasis in original).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-4\">\n<em>b. Joint Plaintiffs &amp; USS argue that the ITC\u2019s \u201cconditions of competition\u201d analysis was flawed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1409-5\">Joint Plaintiffs also contend that in spite of the ITC\u2019s \u201cextrastatu-tory analysis,\u201d its application of the \u201cconditions of competition\u201d analysis was nevertheless flawed because it considered the conditions of competition impacting the <em>foreign </em>industry or <em>foreign </em>producers, and not the <em>domestic </em>industry as the statute requires. (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 22.) Both Joint Plaintiffs and USS cite the first sunset review as precedent where the ITC \u201ccorrectly employed the \u2018conditions of competition\u2019 analysis\u201d and cumulated all subject countries together. (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 22-23 <em>(citing </em>2000 Sunset Determinations at 16, 49-51 (P.R. 124)); <em>see also </em>USS Br. at 12-13.) In the second sunset review, Joint Plaintiffs and USS argue that the ITC inexplicably \u201cdeparted from the [conditions of competition] analysis used in the first [sunset] review,\u201d which was a sharp departure from its previous practice and was therefore <em>\u201cultra vires </em>of the [cumulation] statute.\u201d (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 23-24; <em>see also </em>USS Br. at 12-13.) Specifically, they argue, the ITC \u201cerroneously focused on differences ...in which foreign producers competed in the U.S. market and failed to consider any conditions of competition with respect to the domestic industry.\u201d (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 24 <em>(citing </em>2007 Commission Views at 8-9, 111-117 (P.R. 940)).) These extra-statutory considerations employed by the ITC, Joint Plaintiffs argue, are irrelevant to the Commission\u2019s cumulation analysis, i.e., they have \u201cno bearing on what effect subject imports will have on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1390\">*1390</page-number>conditions of competition in the U.S. market.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1410-4\">Grounding its argument in the cumulation statute\u2019s legislative history, USS contends that the use of the ITC\u2019s discretion must be \u201cguided, first and foremost, by a consideration of the reasons <em>why </em>cumulation is provided for by the statute.\u201d (USS Br. at 12-13 (emphasis in original).) USS then compares the legislative history for the mandatory cumulation statute for injury investigations (see 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7)(G)) with the legislative history for the cumulation statute at issue here, to argue that (i) \u201cCongress regards cumulation as a \u2018critical component\u2019 of the antidumping and countervailing duty laws\u201d; and (ii) that the ITC must relegate its focus to specific factors in order to assess whether imports from a particular country are likely to contribute to the \u201chammering effect\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of imports from multiple sources. (USS Br. at 13-14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-5\">USS also attacks the fact that both Chairman Pearson and Commissioner Okun \u201cnever considered whether imports from all five countries [Australia, France, Japan, Germany and Korea] were likely to compete with each other and with the domestic like product, and never examined whether imports from each of these countries were likely to have a discernible adverse impact on the domestic industry.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 15-16.) Consequently, USS argues, neither of these commissioners followed section 1675a(a)(7), nor cited any authority to justify their departure,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> nor were concerned with the hammering effects of imports, and thus \u201cplainly violated the intent of Congress.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 15-17 n.4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1410-6\">USS additionally challenges the Commission majority\u2019s<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> findings as the factual basis for declining total cumulation. The \u201calleged\u201d differences in the conditions of competition, which USS argues were significant to the Commission, \u201care wholly irrelevant to the purpose of cumulation, internally inconsistent, or both.\u201d (USS Br. at 18.)

(Joint Pi\u2019s Br. at 35-36; USS Br. at 23-25.) First, they argue that the ITC rejected a similar affiliation argument made by Japan during the first sunset review. Second, USS proffers that the record contains no direct evidence regarding the behavior of French producers with U.S. affiliates, since the only such relationship, the Arcelor/Mittal merger, was scheduled to take effect in early 2007, after the ITC\u2019s vote on the second review. <em>(Id. </em>at 24 <em>(citing </em>2007 Determinations at 128-29 (P.R. 940)).) Finally, USS cites to the Final Staff Reports pointing out that the Japanese producers actually reduced their U.S. presence due to the acquisition of National Steel by U.S. Steel during the current POR. <em>(Id. </em>at 24-25 <em>(citing </em>Final Staff Report at CORE-III-2 (P.R. 652)).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1411-5\">2. <em>Defendant ITC</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1411-6\">Defendant maintains that the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion to cumulate imports into three separate groups is supported by substantial evidence on the record and is otherwise in accordance with law.

Additionally, the ITC contends that CIT precedent recognizes that the \u201cCommission \u2018has wide latitude in selecting the types of factors it considers relevant\u2019 for that purpose.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 16 <em>(quoting Allegheny Ludlum, </em>475 F.

(Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 28-34; Reply Br. of AK Steel at 2-9.) AK Steel contends that contrary to the ITC\u2019s finding \u2014 that Canadian producers compete in the U.S. market under substantially similar conditions of competition as faced by Australia, France, Japan, Germany, and Korea \u2014 \u201cthere is no basis not to cumu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1393\">*1393</page-number>late imports from Canada with imports from other countries.\u201d (Joint PL\u2019s Br. at 28-29.) Because CoRe steel in the U.S. competes on the basis of price, AK Steel argues, the ITC\u2019s analysis that a [\u00b6] ]] Canadian producer\u2019s increased exports to the U.S. during the POR \u201cwere not due to price competition with U.S. suppliers\u201d is contradictory. <em>(Id. </em>at 29 <em>(citing </em>2007 Commission Views at 115 (C.R. 831)).) AK Steel cites to the questionnaire responses of Auto Producers as support for this argument \u2014 that price is an important factor in the U.S. CoRe steel market \u2014 and proffers that Canadian CoRe is equally competitive in the U.S. on price. <em>(Id. </em>at 29-31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1413-5\">AK Steel also contends that the \u201cperception\u201d by certain Auto Producers that U.S. and Canada are \u201ca unified market for production and sourcing decisions\u201d is \u201clegally irrelevant\u201d to whether the ITC properly decided not to cumulate Canada\u2019s CoRe steel imports with the other countries. <em>(Id. </em>at 31.)

Thus, the ITC failed to consider the possible effects of an order revocation and whether Canadian imports would increase in the non-automotive sector as well. <em>(Id.) </em>AK Steel cites the ITC Final Staff Report, which notes that during the POR \u201cthe majority of Canadian mills shipments of CoRe steel is [sic] for solid non-automotive applications.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>(referring to Final Staff Report CORE-IV-30 (C.R. 742).))

The Commission found that, among the subject countries, the Canadian industry was char<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1394\">*1394</page-number>acterized by a condition of competition that was unique \u201cbecause auto producers and auto parts suppliers considered the United States and Canada as a unified market for production and sourcing decisions.\u201d (ITC Resp.

Such factors, the ITC argues, included the unified nature of the U.S./ Canadian CoRe auto market, Canada\u2019s consistent supply of imports to the U.S. for non-price reasons, Canada\u2019s status as a net importer of CoRe steel (mostly from the U.S.), and the proportion of imports from Canada that were specialty automotive products. <em>(Id. </em>at 35-36 <em>(citing </em>2007 Commission Views at 114-116, 140 (C.R. 831)).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-7\">Finally, the ITC argues that the record contains ample evidence in support of its finding that Auto Producers treat Canada and the U.S. as a unified market. <em>(Id. </em>at 36 <em>(citing </em>2007 Commission Views at 114, n.665, 126, n.762 (C.R. 831))) This evidence is consistent with the ITC\u2019s findings, it argues, that there is a growing global trend toward consolidations and mergers in steel producers that have enabled producers to serve their customers\u2019 interest in obtaining CoRe steel locally or regionally. <em>(Id.

(Resp. Br. of Nucor Corp. and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (\u201cNucor/SDI Resp. Br.\u201d) at 6-42.) However, Nucor/SDI do raise a few additional arguments that warrant separate presentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-13\">First, Nucor/SDI contend that German Pl.\u2019s assertion that the E.U. - is essentially its \u201chome market\u201d is flawed and has previously been rejected by the ITC. (Nucor/SDI Resp. Br. at 16-18 <em>(citing inter alia Usinor v.

Arguing that these are two separate analyses, Nucor/SDI contend that German Plaintiffs\u2019 insistence that it is illogical for the ITC to find the domestic CoRe steel industry no longer vulnerable, on the one hand, but find that \u201cthe domestic industry is likely to bear a material negative impact\u201d from German/Korean imports, on the other hand, is a false choice. <em>(Id. </em>at 23-25.) Moreover, Nucor/SDI contend that, notwithstanding German Plaintiffs\u2019 conflated arguments, the ITC\u2019s vulnerability determination was not supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise not in accordance with law. <em>(Id. </em>at 25-27.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-5\">Finally, Nucor/SDI argue that the Commission\u2019s determination \u201cto segregate\u201d German and Korean producers from Australian, French and Japanese producers is unsupported by substantial evidence and is otherwise not in accordance with law. <em>(Id. </em>at 28-32.) This is because the ITC failed to appreciate the \u201cminor distinctions between Korean and German producers,\u201d dismissing them as \u201cirrelevant,\u201d whereas the very same distinctions were used to segregate Germany and Korea from Australia, France and Japan. <em>(Id. </em>at 29.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-6\">F. Analysis ~ The Commissions\u2019 Cumulation Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-7\">The statute is clear; in order for the ITC to exercise its discretion and cumulatively assess the volume and effect of imports in a sunset review, the Commission must have (1) initiated all the reviews to be cumulated on the same day; (2) find that the subject imports to be cumulated would be likely to compete with each other and with domestic like products in the U.S. market; and (3) determine that the subject imports to be cumulated are each likely to have a \u201cdiscernible adverse impact\u201d on the U.S. industry. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-8\">As drafted by Congress, the use of the cumulation statute in a sunset review is discretionary. <em>Id. </em>Notwithstanding, even if the statutory predicates are met, there is an express prohibition on cumulation where the ITC \u201cdetermines that [subject] imports are likely to have no discernible adverse impact on the domestic industry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This exercise of discretion by the ITC, however, must be \u201cpredicated upon a judgment anchored in the language and spirit of the relevant statutes and regulations.\u201d <em>Freeport Minerals Co. v. United States, </em>776 F.2d 1029, 1032 (Fed.

The Court then turns to the remaining statutory requirements/prohibitions: (1) that there is likely no discernible adverse impact on the domestic industry from the subject imports; and (2) that the subject imports are likely to compete both with each other and with the domestic like product in the U.S. marketplace. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-4\">1. <em>Likelihood of No Discernible Adverse Impact</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1420-5\">The ITC initially did not find applicable the \u201cno discernible adverse impact\u201d exception to cumulation to any of the subject countries, which would have prevented the exercise of its discretion to cumulate. <em>See </em>2007 Commission Views at 108, 119 (C.R. 831)).) The ITC made specific findings with respect to the subject countries<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> in order to ascertain whether the subject imports from them were likely to have a discernible adverse impact (or not) upon the domestic industry. The ITC found that with regard to Australia,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> France,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Japan,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1401\">*1401</page-number>Germany,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and Korea,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201cthe information on the record indicate [d] that the [CoRe steel] industry in each of these subject countries has significant production capacity and has increased its capacity since the original period of investigation.\u201d 2007 Commission Views at 111 (C.R. 831). In addition, the ITC found that the subject producers in each country have \u201cunused capacity,\u201d maintained some level of exports to the U.S. market, and \u201cundersold U.S. producers\u201d periodically during the original investigation, and in some cases, during the POR as well. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1421-4\">This Court now addresses Joint Plaintiffs\u2019 and USS\u2019s argument that two of the four commissioners in the majority \u2014 Chairman Pearson and Commissioner Okun \u2014 \u201cignor[ed] the statutory factors\u201d and \u201cdisregarded the prescribed statutory requirements\u201d for cumulation, and finds them to be without merit. <em>(See </em>Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 19; USS Br. at 16.) A review of the record demonstrates to the Court that both Chairman Pearson and Commissioner Okun exercised their discretion well-within the bounds of the statute. Chiefly, Chairman Pearson and Commissioner Okun both explicitly stated'that they were joining the \u201cno discernible adverse impact\u201d analysis of their fellow commissioners in the majority. <em>See </em>2007 Commission Views at 107 n.612 (C.R. 831) (Chairman Pearson and Commissioner Okun \u201cjoin Vice Chairman Aranoff and Commissioner Hillman\u2019s discussion of the [cumulation] issues...and reach the same conclusion.\u201d). The perspec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1402\">*1402</page-number>tive of Joint Plaintiffs and USS requires an overly narrow reading of the cumulation statute contrary to the plain text of section 1675a(a)(7). Stripped bare, Joint Plaintiffs\u2019 and USS\u2019s argument is that Chairman Pearson and Commissioner Okun chose to conduct their cumulation analysis <em>in a different order </em>than Vice Chairman Aranoff and Commissioner Hillman. However, nothing in the language of the cumulation statute requires the ITC to conduct its analysis in a particular order. When this Court examines section 1675a(a)(7), it finds that the statute does not mandate any particular sequence of analysis. Neither have Joint Plaintiffs nor USS pointed to any authority that would require such a sequence; nor does the Court find any such suggestion in its review of the legislative history. <em>Cf. Nippon Steel Corp. v. United States, 25 </em>CIT 1415, 1421 n.12, 182 F. Supp.2d 1330, 1337 n.12 (2001) (\u201cneither the governing statute nor its legislative history requires adoption of any particular analysis\u201d) (internal citation and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-4\">The Court recognizes that the ITC is vested with statutory authority to exercise discretion when it comes to cumulation in a sunset review. <em>See Allegheny Ludlum Corp., </em>475 F. Supp.2d at 1380-81 (The ITC \u201chas wide latitude in selecting the types of factors it considers relevant\u201d in its cumulation analysis.). The Commission is clearly authorized to cumulate subject imports from several countries if they are likely to have a \u201cdiscernible adverse impact\u201d and if they are \u201clikely to compete with each other and with domestic like products in the [U.S.] market.\u201d <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(7). The language is unambiguous: though the cumulation requirements may be met, the Commission may nevertheless decline to cumulate as a proper exercise of its power of agency discretion. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(7) (\u201cthe Commission <em>may </em>cumulatively assess...\u201d); SAAat 887 (\u201c[n]ew section 752(a)(7) grants the Commission <em>discretion </em>to engage in a cumulative analysis\u201d in sunset reviews) (emphasis added); <em>see also Ugine-Savoie Imphy v. United States, </em>26 CIT 851, 852, 248 F.Supp.2d 1208, 1210-11 (2002) (\u201cWhile the above limitations prevent cumulation in certain circumstances, in all other instances cumulation is discretionary, not mandatory.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-5\">Notwithstanding the ITC\u2019s considerable discretion with respect to cumulation in the first instance, the statutes\u2019 \u201cno discernible adverse impact\u201d element serves as an \u201cexpress limitation on [its] discretion to <em>cumulate.\u201d Neenah Foundry Co., </em>25 CIT at 705, 155 F. Supp.2d at 769. Logically, however, this express limitation applies only if the Commission decides to exercise its discretion to cumulate the relevant subject countries in the first instance. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(7) (\u201c[t]he Commission shall not...\u201d). Therefore, if the ITC declines to cumulate \u2014 as it declined to cumulate Canada with the other subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1403\">*1403</page-number>countries and declined to cumulate Australia, France, Japan, Germany, and Korea all together \u2014 then this statutory prohibition does not come into play. <em>Cf.

Supp.2d 1303, 1306 (2002) (upholding ITC\u2019s determination not to consider all the statutory factors where a single factor was dispositive of cumulation); <em>see also U.S. Steel Group, </em>96 F.3d at 1362 (\u201cSo long as the Commission\u2019s analysis does not violate any statute and is not otherwise arbitrary and capricious, the Commission may perform its duties in the way it believes most suitable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-4\">Individual Commissioners, therefore, are not required to apply identical analytical methodologies when the statute requires no such result.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>See U.S. Steel Group v.

Both Chairman Pearson and Commissioner Okun clearly joined Vice Chairman Aranoff\u2019s and Commissioner Hillman\u2019s discussion of no discernible adverse impact, reasonable overlap of competition, and other conditions of competition. <em>See </em>2007 Commission Views at 107 n.612 (C.R. 831).

Joint Plaintiffs and USS complain that the ITC erred when it based this analysis on the market conditions when the orders were in place (as opposed to beforehand) and \u201cunlawfully failed to evaluate the likely behavior of imports if the orders were revoked.\u201d (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 24-25; <em>see also </em>USS Br. at 19-20.) The ITC, Joint Plaintiffs allege, \u201cerroneously relied upon the subject producers\u2019 behavior during the period of [the second] review while the discipline of the orders was in place.\u201d (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-5\">This Court finds in the record that the Commission assessed both current and likely conditions to determine whether imports from the several countries would likely compete under different conditions of competition upon revocation. <em>See </em>2007 Commission Views at 8-9, 114 (C.R. 831); <em>see also </em>SAA at 884 (The ITC may consider \u201crelevant factors such as current...shipment levels and...prices\u201d in its sunset analysis.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-6\">USS argued that the ITC \u201cpaid no attention to what occurred during the period of the original investigation\u201d prior to the ADD and CVD orders. (USS Br. at 19.) Relying on legislative history, Joint Plaintiffs and USS argue that a lawful analysis by the ITC should have considered data on import behavior from the original investigation (prior to when the orders were instituted) in order to assess the likely import volume from the subject countries if the orders were revoked. (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 24-25; USS Br. at 19-20.) This is simply not true. The Court rejects this argument because the ITC clearly cited to specific evidence in the administrative record where it discussed evidence from its cumulation findings in the original CoRe investigations and the first reviews. <em>See </em>2007 Commission Views at 108-112, nn.624, 627, 636, 639, and 645. (C.R. 831). Moreover the Commission specifically noted that the statute \u201cdirects [it] to take into account its prior injury determinations.\u201d 2007 Commission Views at 23 (C.R. 831). In any case, findings and evidence from prior periods are not dispositive of the Commission\u2019s cumulation analysis. <em>See Neenah Foundry Co., </em>25 CIT at 709; <em>Usinor, </em>28 CIT at 1135 (\u201cthere is limited precedential value to previous reviews because the Commission is not required to make identical determinations in each, and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1407\">*1407</page-number>must consider each subject import and the circumstances of each investigation sui generis\u201d). Case in point, the ITC noted that certain significant changes had taken place during this second review that distinguished it from similarities that existed in the conditions of competition from the first review. <em>See </em>ITC Resp. Br. at 22-23. Given the developments that transpired between the first and second reviews, it was reasonable for the ITC to decide not to follow its cumu-lation decision from the first POR. <em>See Usinor, </em>28 CIT at 1135.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-4\">Accordingly, this Court holds that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the ITC\u2019s finding of a reasonable overlap in competition among the subject imports, and such determination is otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"Arn\">3. <em>Other Considerations </em>~ <em>The \u201cConditions Of Competition\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1427-6\">Having met the statutory elements for cumulation, the Commission went a step further and considered some additional factors in order to assess whether \u201cother significant conditions of competition...are likely to prevail if the orders under review are terminated.\u201d 2007 Commission Views at 21, 113-119 (C.R. 831). The Commission explained that these other significant \u201cconditions of competition\u201d would indicate whether or not it should exercise its discretion to cumulate certain countries together. <em>See id. </em>at 113. These \u201cother factors\u201d included the \u201clikely differing conditions of competition for the subject imports, likely differences in price or volume trends, or transnational ownership of facilities producing the subject product.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1427-7\">Joint Plaintiffs and USS challenged, these \u201cother considerations\u201d and argue that the ITC erred in its findings and, instead, should have cumulated the subject imports all together. (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 17-38; USS Br. at 10-25.) They challenge the ITC\u2019s determination here on two broad fronts, first, that the Commission applied an \u201cincorrect\u201d conditions of competition analysis in contravention of the statute <em>(see </em>Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 22-26; USS Br. at 12-25) and second, the Commission\u2019s determination was not supported by substantial evidence (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 26-38; USS Br. at 10-25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-8\">\n<em>a. The ITC\u2019s conditions of competition analysis was proper.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-9\">Joint Plaintiffs\u2019 and USS\u2019s first point is that it was wrong for the ITC to consider the \u201cextra-statutory analysis of \u2018conditions of competition\u2019 without consideration\u201d of the elements of section 1675a(a)(7). Joint Plaintiffs\u2019 and USS\u2019s arguments appear to center on the ITC\u2019s alleged failure to focus on the existence of differing conditions of competition, rather than the Commission\u2019s traditional four-factor test. (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 19-22; USS Br. at 12-18; <em>see also </em>ITC Resp. Br. at 18.) The Court finds these arguments unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1408\">*1408</page-number>The cumulation statute does not require that the Commission consider any particular factors (i.e., the \u201cfour factor\u201d test) in determining whether it will exercise its discretion to cumulate. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(7); <em>Allegheny Ludlum Corp., </em>475 F. Supp.2d at 1377-78, 1379-81 (The ITC \u201chas wide latitude in selecting the types of factors it considers relevant\u201d in its cumulation analysis.). Moreover, precedent affirms that the ITC \u201chas wide latitude in selecting the types of factors it considers relevant in undertaking its cumulation analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1380;.see <em>Neenah Foundry Co., </em>25 CIT at 709 (individual sunset review determinations do not bind ITC to use those same factors in other determinations).</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-4\">Both Joint Plaintiffs and USS also contend that the ITC\u2019s conditions of competition analysis violated the \u201clanguage and spirit of the relevant statute and regulations.\u201d (USS Br. at 12; <em>see also </em>Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 22-24.) Citing both to the legislative history of the mandatory cumulation statute for ITC investigations (which is not at issue in this lawsuit) and the discretionary sunset review cumulation statute, Joint Plaintiffs and USS seek to impress upon the court Congress\u2019s regard for cumulation as a \u201ccritical component of the antidumping and countervailing duty law.\u201d (USS Br. at 13 <em>(citing </em>S.A.A., H. Rep. No. 103-316 at 847 (1994), <em>reprinted in </em>1994 U.S.C.A.A.N. 4040, 4181).) Indeed, in devising the cumulation statutes, Congress endeavored to ensure that the domestic industry could not be harmed by a \u201chammering effect\u201d of unfairly traded imports from multiple countries \u2014 a consequence that could arise where subject imports are reviewed on a country-by-country basis. <em>See Cogne Acciai Speciali S.P.A. v. United States, </em>29 CIT 1168, 1171-72 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-5\">Joint Plaintiffs and USS argue that the cumulation analyses (or lack thereof) conducted by Chairman Pearson and Commissioner Okun undermine this Congressional intent vis-\u00e1-vis the \u201chammering effect.\u201d (USS Br. at 14-15; Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 19-22.) This argument too, is unpersuasive. Chairman Pearson and Commissioner Okun explicitly state in their determination that they join the discussion of their colleagues in the majority \u2014 Vice Chairman Aranoff and Commissioner Hillman \u2014 and reach the same conclusion. 2007 Commission Views at 107 n.612 (C.R. 831). Chairman Pearson and Commissioner Okun need state no more. Neither is there a statutory command that the ITC respond to every piece of evidence presented, <em>Granges Metallverken AB, </em>716 F. Supp. at 24, nor a rule that the ITC proscribe to a particular cumulation methodology, <em>see Allegheny Ludlum Corp., </em>475 F. Supp.2d at 1378,1379-81. More to the point, this Court cannot void the ITC\u2019s exercise of discretion based on an alleged failure to explain a piece of evidence, especially where the challenged point is clearly part of the record. <em>Compare </em>USS Br. 13-15 <em>with </em>2007 Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1409\">*1409</page-number>mission Views at 107 n.612 <em>and </em>112 n.647 (C.R. 831). Chairman Pearson and Commissioner Okun therefore are presumed to have considered these points.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1429-4\">Moreover, Joint Plaintiffs\u2019 argument is based on what it characterizes as precedent: the ITC \u201ccorrectly employed the \u2018conditions of competition\u2019 analysis in the <em>first </em>sunset review,\u201d which by statute, they argue, requires the Commission to consider the \u201cconditions of competition impacting the <em>domestic </em>industry \u2014 not the conditions affecting <em>foreign </em>producers.\u201d (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 22 <em>(citing </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1675a(a)(4) and 1677(7)(C)(iii)) (emphasis added).) Joint Plaintiffs maintain that the Commission \u201cdeparted\u201d from the analysis conducted in the first review without explanation and is therefore arbitrary and <em>ultra vires </em>of the statute. <em>(Id. </em>at 23n.5 <em>(citing Citrosuco Paulista, S.A. v. United States, </em>12 CIT 1196, 1209, 704 F. Supp. 1075, 1088 (1998) (\u201can agency must either conform itself to its prior decisions or explain the reasons for its departure\u201d)).) This argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-5\">First, the ITC <em>did </em>take the cumulation findings from the original investigation and first sunset review into consideration. (ITC Resp. Br. at 22; 2007 Commission Views at 23, 108-112 nn.622, 624, 627, 636, 639 &amp; 645 (C.R. 831).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-6\">Second, this Court does not find that the ITC has established an agency practice from, which it has deviated. Precedent instructs that an agency practice is established when a uniform procedure exists that would lead a party to reasonably expect that the agency would adhere to the procedure. <em>See Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Found. v. United States, </em>23 CIT 861, 884-85, 74 F.Supp.2d 1353, 1374 (1999). The Court is not convinced that a uniform \u201cconditions of competition\u201d practice was established simply by the first review. Additionally, the ITC\u2019s conditions of competition analysis has previously been met with approval by this Court. <em>See, e.g. Allegheny Ludlum Corp., </em>475 F. Supp.2d at 1377-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-7\">Third, the ITC is not bound by prior determinations if new arguments or facts support an alternative conclusion. <em>See Citrosuco Paulista, </em>12 CIT at 1209. Indeed, \u201ca particular circumstance in a prior investigation cannot be regarded by the Commission as disposi-tive of the determination in a later investigation.\u201d <em>USEC, Inc. v. United States, </em>25 CIT 49, 64, 132 F.Supp.2d 1, 14 (2001). The record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1410\">*1410</page-number>here demonstrates that the economic facts and market conditions established during the second POR are vastly different from those of the first POR.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-4\">Finally, the ITC\u2019s \u201cconditions of competition\u201d analysis is not <em>ultra vires </em>of the cumulation statute. Joint Plaintiffs incorrectly ascribe as binding authority, the irrelevant statutes concerning the likely impact of the subject imports on the domestic industry <em>(see </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1675a(a)(4) and 1677(7)(C)(iii)) instead of the relevant cumulation statute (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(7)) under analysis here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-5\">\n<em>b. Joint Plaintiffs and USS have failed to establish that the ITC\u2019s exercise of discretion was clearly erroneous.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-6\">Joint Plaintiffs and USS contend is that the ITC must analyze the \u201clikely\u201d effects on the domestic industry, in the reasonably foreseeable future, should the ADD/CVD orders be revoked. <em>(Id.) </em>Premised on a reading of the legislative history interpreting the \u201clikelihood standard,\u201d they argue that the ITC is supposed to analyze a hypothetical domestic market upon revocation of an ADD/CVD order prospectively and not as it exists presently. <em>Id. </em>(\u201c[UJnder the likelihood standard, the Commission will engage in a counter factual analysis: it must decide the likely impact in the reasonably foreseeable future of an important change in the status quo \u2014 the revocation or termination of a proceeding and the elimination of its restraining effects on volumes and prices of imports.\u201d). <em>See also </em>SAA at 883-884. On this basis, USS calls upon this Court to reject the ITC\u2019s analysis because it \u201cerroneously relied upon the subject producers\u2019 behavior during the period of review while the discipline of the orders was in place.\u201d (USS Br. at 25.) The ITC should have looked to pre-order data <em>(i.e. </em>data from the CoRe steel market prior to 1993), Joint Plaintiffs and USS argue, which is the most recent period where the subject imports competed with the domestic products without the \u201cdiscipline\u201d of the ADD/CVD orders. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1430-7\">While Plaintiffs are correct that the ADD/CVD statutes require the ITC to consider its prior injury determinations during a sunset review, such findings from the original investigation are not themselves dispositive. See <em>Timkin Co. v. United States, </em>27 CIT 605, 612, 264 F. Supp.2d 1264, 1274 (2003) <em>(citing </em>SAA at 886). A review of the record demonstrates that the ITC did in fact examine the past, current, and likely market conditions. <em>See, e.g. </em>2007 Commission Views at 23, 108-112 nn. 622, 624, 627, 636, 639 &amp; 645, 120-149 (C.R. 831). Moreover, the ITC is permitted to consider current conditions as part of its analysis. <em>See </em>SAA at 884 (ITC may consider \u201crelevant factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1411\">*1411</page-number>such as <em>current . . </em>. depressed shipment levels and...prices\u201d in its sunset analysis.). It is, therefore, this Court\u2019s determination that Plaintiffs have not established that the ITC\u2019s exercise of discretion was clearly erroneous. <em>See Overton Park, </em>401 U.S. at 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-4\">Joint Plaintiffs and USS also allege errors in the ITC\u2019s cumulation analysis claiming it was \u201cinconsistent.\u201d (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 27-28, 35.) This court disagrees, however. The ITC responds, and this Court agrees, that though the four-factor test indicated to the ITC that the subject producer\u2019s CoRe steel was fungible, shipped to substantially similar end users, and exhibited simultaneous presence and geographic overlap during the POR, the evidence pertaining to the other conditions \u201ctold the Commission that certain countries did not have an interest in supplying the U.S. market for the reasonably foreseeable future, while other countries did.\u201d (ITC Resp. Br. at 28-29 <em>(citing </em>2007 Commission Views at 112-13, 117-19 (C.R. 831).) The ITC reasonably focused its analysis on the incentives that the subject CoRe producers had to export to the U.S. market in the reasonably foreseeable future. <em>Usinor Industeel, S.A., </em>26 CIT at 1409-11. This Court finds that it was reasonable for the ITC to consider import data on the levels of CoRe from the subject countries in order to deduce which countries would likely be interested in the U.S. market for a significant share of their exports. 2007 Commission Views at 112-113 (C.R. 831).</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-5\">The Court also rejects Joint Plaintiffs\u2019 and UCC\u2019s argument that the French and Japanese producers\u2019 affiliations with U.S. producers does not support a finding of no interest in the U.S. market. (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 35-36; USS Br. at 23-25.) The record supports the ITC\u2019s contention that during the second review, the multinational affiliations were part of a growing domestic and global trend toward mergers among CoRe steel producers, which in turn enable the producers to better serve their customers\u2019 interests in sourcing CoRe steel from sources locally and regionally. 2007 Commission Views at 119, 122, 123, 126, 132 n.814 (C.R. 831). Unlike the first POR where the Asian financial crisis had plagued the worldwide market, severely limiting demand for CoRe, the Asian market had recovered by the second POR. This difference was significant for the ITC. <em>Id. </em>In sum, Joint Plaintiffs and USS have failed to show that the ITC unreasonably exercised its discretion to cumulate subject imports. Therefore, having found that there is a \u201creasonable overlap\u201d of competition among the CoRe steel imports and domestic product, the ITC\u2019s decision to cumulate in groups is consistent with the statute, precedent, and is therefore in accordance with law. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(7); <em>see Wetland Werke, AG, </em>13 CIT at 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1412\">*1412</page-number>c. <em>The ITC\u2019s cumulation determination was supported by substantial evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1432-4\">Joint Plaintiffs/USS/German Plaintiffs also attack the Commission\u2019s determination arguing that it was not supported by substantial evidence. (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 26-38; USS Br. at 18-25; German Pi\u2019s Br. at 9-32.)<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The ITC in response suggests that Plaintiffs\u2019 protests \u201cmerely reflect disagreements with how the Commission weighed the evidence.\u201d (ITC Resp. Br. at 25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-5\">In reviewing the record, this Court finds the Commission\u2019s cumu-lation determination was amply based on substantial evidence. The ITC predicated its determination on \u201csignificant differences between the three groups of countries that were considered separately and important similarities among the countries that were cumulated.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>The ITC found that CoRe steel imports from these three countries had dropped to \u201cvery low levels\u201d since the initial investigation period. <em>Id. </em>For example, from 2000 to 2005, CoRe steel imports dropped 92.6% from Australia, 50.7% from France, and 39.1% from Japan. (ITC Resp. Br. at 25 (referencing 2007 Sunset Review Information at Table C-7 (P.R. 941)).) Instead, the subject producers were significantly focused on their own home and regional markets.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> 2007 Commission Views at 119 (C.R. 831). Additionally, the ITC determined that French and Japanese subject producers were \u201caffiliated with major U.S. producers,\u201d which they conclude made it \u201cmore likely that they would supply the U.S. market from their affiliates\u2019 U.S. production.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 117-119. Such evidence allowed the ITC to conclude that subject imports from Australia, France and Japan should be considered on a cumulated basis. <em>Id. </em>at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-6\">With respect to Germany and Korea, the ITC found that, unlike Australia, France and Japan, CoRe steel from both countries had \u201can increasing presence in the U.S. market\u201d during the POR. <em>Id. </em>at 116. The ITC noted that subject imports from Korea rose to substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1413\">*1413</page-number>higher rates towards the end of the second POR, and were higher than the highest level achieved during the original investigation of 193,513 short tons. <em>Id. (citing </em>Table CORE-I-1.) CoRe steel imports from Germany were also noticeably higher in 2005 than at any time during either the first or second POR, though lower than in the original investigation. <em>Id. </em>German producers also exhibited an interest in the North American market as evidenced by their shipments of non-subject micro-alloy CoRe steel, which [\u00b6] ]] during the entire POR, suggesting by itself an interest in having a \u201csubstantial presence\u201d in the U.S. market. <em>Id. </em>at 116 n.680 <em>(citing </em>Table CORE-IV-43). The ITC also determined that coupled with an interest in the North American market, German and Korean CoRe suppliers did not have \u201csufficient presence to supply the U.S. market\u201d from within the U.S. or regionally.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>ThyssenKrupp, which does not have a U.S. production affiliate, the ITC noted, made up [\u00b6] ]]% of German production and [\u00b6] ]] German exports of CoRe imports to the U.S. since 2000.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 117 n.684. Moreover, neither Salzgitter nor Corns, which comprise [\u00b6] <em>]]% </em>of German production, have a U.S. production facility. Id. at 117 n.686 <em>(citing </em>Table CORE-IV-35). The ITC found these characteristics contrasted sharply with the French and Japanese producers, who also exhibited some interest in the U.S. markets, but unlike them, the German and Korean producers could not exercise that interest through domestic affiliates. More to the point, the ITC notes that though Korean producer POSCO indicated plans to build a production facility in Mexico and ThyssenKrupp expressed a desire to establish a North American production facility, \u201cthe record does not indicate that it is more likely than not that this will happen in the reasonably foreseeable future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 118 nn. 694, 695, 696. Evidence of this sort led the ITC to conclude that, despite some natural and expected differences between German and Korean producers, the significant similarities warranted cumulating them together, but separately from the other subject countries. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1433-7\">With Canada, the ITC determined that Canadian subject producers faced unique conditions of competition as compared to all the other subject producers warranting its separate consideration from the other cumulated nations. Dofasco, the [\u00b6] ]] exporter from Canada shipped approximately [\u00b6] ]]% of its CoRe steel exports to the U.S., during the POR, to the automotive sector. <em>Id. </em>at 114 n.663. The automotive sector \u201cdominated\u201d the U.S. market accounting for 47.6% <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1414\">*1414</page-number>of U.S. market shipments in 2005. <em>Id. </em>at 114 n.664. Indeed, auto producers and parts suppliers \u201cperceive\u201d the U.S. and Canada \u201cas a unified market for production and sourcing decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114 n.665. Consequently, steel mills located in Canada and the U.S. \u201care significantly better positioned than the other subject country producers to economically satisfy the just-in-time delivery requirements\u201d of the auto industry. <em>Id. </em>The ITC found that, in part due to these unique circumstances, Canada is a \u201cnet importer\u201d of CoRe steel, globally and vis-a-vis the U.S. As a net importer<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> during the POR, U.S. exports to Canada exceeded imports from Canada. <em>Id. </em>at 114-15 n.668. The ITC found th\u00e1t this \u201ctwo-way nature of the market\u201d corroborated the Canadian respondents\u2019 arguments that the auto producers conduct their business as if there is \u201can integrated North American market.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115. Despite evidence that Dofasco, representing [\u00b6] ]]% of total Canadian production, increased its exports to the U.S. during the POR, the ITC found that they were present as a result of other factors [\u00b6] ]], and not \u201cdue to price competition with U.S. suppliers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115 <em>(citing </em>CORE-IV-29). The ITC concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1434-5\">[t]he way in which shipments from Canada compete in the U.S. market distinguishes them from other subject imports ....[and though]... there is and will be some price competition between Canadian and U.S. producers, Canadian producers do not compete for sales in much of the market, and their dedicated sales into the auto segment are generally based more on demand for a specific auto part than on price.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1434-6\"><em>Id. </em>Such evidence, \u201c[o]n balance,\u201d led the ITC to conclude that the conditions of competition faced by Canadian subject imports are \u201csufficiently different\u201d as to provide a \u201creasonable basis\u201d to not exercise its discretion to cumulate subject imports with those of the other subject countries. <em>Id. </em>at 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-7\">It seems to the Court that Joint Plaintiffs/USS/German Plaintiffs clearly take pains to point out instances in the ITC\u2019s determination where, they argue, the Commission drew an incorrect conclusion regarding its cumulation decision. (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 26-38; USS Br. at 18-25; German Pi\u2019s Br. at 9-32.) This Court finds these arguments are more accurately described as challenges to the weight of the evidence as ascribed by the ITC in its sunset review findings. It is well-established that it is an agency\u2019s domain to weigh the evidence; therefore this Court must not upset the ITC\u2019s reasonable conclusions supported by substantial evidence and replace them with conclusions preferred by the Plaintiffs. <em>See Torrington Co. v. United States, </em>16 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1415\">*1415</page-number>CIT 220, 225, 790 F. Supp. 1161, 1169 (1992), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>991 F.2d 809 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <em>see also Timkin Co. v. United States, </em>27 CIT 605, 616, 264 F. Supp.2d 1264, 1274-75 (2003); <em>Mukand Ltd. v. United States, </em>20 CIT 903, 906, 937 F. Supp. 910, 914 (1996) (\u201c[T]he Commission, as the trier of fact, has considerable discretion in weighing the probative value and relevance of evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-3\">Moreover, this Court also rejects the species of argument that claim the ITC \u201cfailed to consider\u201d certain evidence with regard to making its cumulation determination. In practically each instance, contrary to Joint Plaintiffs\u2019 and USS\u2019s assertions, the Commission explicitly considered each point contested by Joint Plaintiffs/USS/German Plaintiffs. For example, Joint Plaintiffs and USS argue that the ITC failed to consider the excess capacity for each country in its cumulation analysis. <em>See </em>2007 Commission Views at 109-111 (C.R. 831). The Court, however, finds reasonable, the Commission\u2019s conclusion that although the excess capacity among the subject countries might have favored cumulation, on balance, important differences in other conditions of competition warranted not cumulating subject imports from Australia, France and Japan with subject imports from Germany and Korea. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1435-4\">Finally, the Court rejects Joint Plaintiffs\u2019 and USS\u2019s argument that the ITC allegedly failed to consider that Australia, France, Japan, Germany and Korea all shipped similar proportions of their total shipments to their home markets and thus were similarly export oriented. (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 37; USS Br. at 21-22.) The ITC argues that the Joint Plaintiffs and USS merely are seeking to re-weigh evidence in their favor and this Court agrees. The ITC contends, and this Court agrees, that not only did the Commission consider the export orientation of the subject countries (or lack thereof), but it also found other factors \u2014 such as interest in the U.S. market, growth in exports to the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and lack of affiliation with important U.S. producers \u2014 were apparently significant enough to warrant not cumu-lating the subject imports from all five countries. <em>See </em>2007 Commission Views at 118-119 (C.R. 831).</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-5\">Of Joint Plaintiffs\u2019, USS\u2019s, and German Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments in opposition to the cumulation determination, it is not the role of this Court to substitute its judgment for that of the agency considering the agency\u2019s analysis was undertaken in accordance with the plain language of the statute and adequately supported by the facts in the record. <em>See Universal Camera Corp., </em>340 U.S. at 488. Therefore, this Court holds that the ITC\u2019s exercising of its discretion to cumulate the subject imports into separate groups \u2014 (1) Australia, France and Japan; (2) Germany and Korea; and (3) to not cumulate Canada \u2014 is supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1416\">*1416</page-number>II. <em>The ITC\u2019s Final Negative Determination, With Respect to Australia, France, Japan, &amp; Canada, and Its Final Affirmative Determination, With Respect to Germany &amp; Korea Is Supported by Substantial Evidence on the Record and Is Otherwise in Accordance With Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1436-4\">Having found that the ITC\u2019s cumulation decision is supported by substantial evidence on the record, the Court will now discuss the ITC\u2019s finding that revocation of the antidumping and countervailing duty orders are not likely to lead to a continuation or recurrence of material injury to the domestic CoRe steel industry within a reasonably foreseeable period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-5\">A. Statutory Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-6\">In the course of a five-year review, the ITC will revoke an anti-dumping duty or countervailing duty order unless it determines that such revocation is likely to lead to a: (1) continuance or recurrence of dumping; and (2) continuation or recurrence of material injury within a reasonably foreseeable period of time. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(d)(2)(A) &amp; (B) (2000). In order to conduct this evaluation, the ITC must consider whether the \u201clikely volume, price effect, and impact of imports of the subject merchandise on the industry\u201d will be \u201csignificant\u201d upon the revocation of the ADD/CVD order. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a) (1) \u2014 (4) (2000). In this context, \u201clikely\u201d means \u201cprobable\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and \u201csignificant\u201d means \u201cimportant, weighty, [or] notable.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1436-7\">B. Likely Volume</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-8\">We now turn to the ITC\u2019s volume analysis. In evaluating the likely volume of imports upon the revocation of an ADD/CVD order, the ITC must consider \u201cwhether the likely volume of imports of the subject merchandise would be significant...either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the United States.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(2). In conducting the volume analysis, the ITC shall</p>\n<p id=\"AbR\">consider all relevant economic factors, including\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1436-10\">(A) any likely increase in production capacity or existing unused production capacity in the exporting country,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1417\">*1417</page-number>(B) existing inventories of the subject merchandise, or likely increases in inventories,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1437-4\">(C) the existence of barriers to the importation of such merchandise into countries other than the United States, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1437-5\">(D) the potential for product-shifting if production facilities in the foreign country, which can be used to produce the subject merchandise, are currently being used to produce other products.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1437-6\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(2) (2000). Therefore, \u201cin order to find sufficient volume for there to be injury, the ITC must identify substantial evidence from the record demonstrating that, should the orders be revoked, it is likely that the volume of the subject imports entering the U.S. market will be significant.\u201d <em>Nippon Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>29 CIT 695, 712, 391 F.Supp.2d 1258, 1275 (2005), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>494 F.3d 1371 (2007). Further, the ITC must consider whether the likely volume would be \u201csignificant\u201d in absolute terms, or relative to production or consumption in the United States. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7X0(1) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-7\">For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that the Commission\u2019s findings relating to the volume of cumulated imports are supported by substantial evidence on the record and in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-8\">1. <em>Australia, France &amp; Japan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1437-9\">The ITC found that in the absence of the ADD/CVD orders, the likely volume of CoRe steel imports from Australia, France and Japan would not be significant; indeed these countries \u201ccurrently supply the least amount\u201d of CoRe steel to the U.S. market. 2007 Commission Views at 9,128-129 (C.R. 831). In 2005, for example, cumulated CoRe steel imports from these three countries were 18,556 short tons, or 0.1% of apparent U.S. consumption and production. <em>Id. </em>at 128. At its highest level, during this POR, CoRe steel imports from Australia, France and Japan accounted for 40,332 short tons in 2002, or 0.2% of apparent U.S. consumption and production. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1437-10\">The ITC also found that the CoRe steel producers from Australia, France and Japan operated at \u201crelatively high capacity utilization rates\u201d and were focused primarily on their home and regional markets. <em>Id. </em>at 129. In addition, quantities of CoRe steel held in inventory \u201cdo not appear to represent significant volumes that could be diverted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1418\">*1418</page-number>readily to the U.S. market upon revocation of the orders.\u201d <em>Id,.</em><footnotemark><em>31</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Moreover, during the POR, producers from these countries were focused primarily on their home and regional markets and have not demonstrated a particular interest in the North American market. <em>Id. </em>The ITC concluded that the evidence showed that this trend does not appear likely to change in the reasonably foreseeable future. <em>Id. (See </em>Tables CORE IV-10, 12, 27, 28, 29, 45, 46 &amp; 47.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-3\">\n<em>a. Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-4\">Joint Plaintiffs argue that the ITC\u2019s volume analysis is premised on a \u201cmistaken notion that \u2018other\u2019 factors will prevent subject imports from Australia, France, and Japan from re-entering the market upon revocation\u201d of the ADD/CVD orders. (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br at 45.) This \u201cmistaken notion\u201d of the ITC, they argue, is characterized by the Commission\u2019s technique of \u201csegregating the subject countries into groups and then examining isolated record evidence...to justify its determination.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Joint Plaintiffs attack the Commission\u2019s likely volume determination on three grounds. First, Joint Plaintiffs argue that the ITC \u201cadmits\u201d that Australian, French and Japanese producers have \u201csignificant excess capacity\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> \u2014[[ ]] million short tons in 2005. <em>(Id. </em>at 46 <em>(citing </em>2007 Commission Views at 129 (C.R. 831)).) The ITC failed even to consider \u201cthe magnitude of such a significant amount of excess capacity and the potential effects an increase in volume of that size would have on the domestic industry.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>The combined excess capacity from this sunset review is [\u00b6] ]] as the total import volume from all subject countries (1.9 million short tons) at their peak in 1992 during the original investigation. <em>(Id.) </em>Moreover, Joint Plaintiffs argue, the ITC also ignored evidence of a growing trend in the cumulative inventories of the subject producers. <em>(Id. </em>at 47-48.) Additionally, Joint Plaintiffs argue that the ITC ignored the \u201cvery real possibility that subject producers can shift significant amounts of production from non-subject to subject merchandise.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 48.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-7\">Second, Joint Plaintiffs argue that the ITC\u2019s finding that CoRe steel producers from Australia, France and Japan are not export-oriented and have little incentive to ship outside their respective regions is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>(Id. </em>at 49-61.) Joint Plaintiffs contend that \u201c [substantial evidence... does not exist that any of these three countries was not likely to shift their exports to the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1419\">*1419</page-number>States upon revocation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 49.) Joint Plaintiffs proffer record evidence and note that \u201cthe rapid expansion of Chinese CoRe production capacity presents a significant barrier to all subject countries in the reasonably foreseeable future,\u201d and contend the ITC analyzes this very large Asian consumer \u201chalf-heartedly.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 50, 50-56.) The fact is, Joint Plaintiffs contend, \u201c[t]he continued and growing capacity increases by the Chinese will likely cause greater instability in the Asian CoRe steel markets. [This causes greater] competition, [which makes] these markets...less attractive to...[Australian, French and Japanese producers], ultimately forcing them to find alternative export markets.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 52.) Joint Plaintiffs also challenge the ITC\u2019s finding, contrary to its findings in the first sunset review, that certain mergers between French or Japanese CoRe producers with U.S.based affiliates remove the incentive to resume shipments to the U.S. since any such domestic orders could be filled from the domestic U.S. affiliate. <em>(Id. </em>at 57-61.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-4\">Third, Joint Plaintiffs argue that the ITC failed to properly conduct a counterfactual analysis as mandated by the SAA and \u201cmerely pays lip service\u201d to the post-revocation market conditions in the U.S. <em>(Id. </em>at 61-62.) Citing the relatively high ADD/CVD margins imposed on Australian, French and Japanese CoRe steel products, it was \u201cno surprise\u201d that CoRe steel from these three countries dramatically declined. <em>(Id. </em>at 62.) The Commission ignored the SAA\u2019s presumption, they argue, that such a trend, highlighted above, means that the subject producers cannot trade fairly without the discipline of ADD/ CVD orders. <em>(Id.) </em>Joint Plaintiffs conclude that the ITC\u2019s assertion that the subject countries no longer have an incentive to ship to the U.S. is not supported by record evidence. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1439-5\">Joint Plaintiffs and USS also argue that the ITC ignored the significance of the quantities of French and Japanese exports of CoRe steel to Canada and Mexico during the POR. (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 55-56; USS. Br. at 34-35, 42.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-6\">USS separately argues two major points. One, that the ITC failed to conduct its likely volume analysis on a cumulated basis, as required once it decided to cumulate Australia, France and Japan together, and instead made separate findings. (USS Br. at 25-28.) USS suggests that the ITC \u201cfailed to meet [its] responsibility\u201d and \u201cexplain [ed] away\u201d its country-specific discussions when it \u201cincluded some discussion of each of the countries individually, because certain facts are specific only to a particular country.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 26 <em>(citing </em>2007 Commission Views at 126 n.779 (P.R. 940).) Two, USS contends, that the ITC\u2019s separate country findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the record and, in fact, support maintaining the ADD/ CVD orders. <em>(Id. </em>at 28-45.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1420\">*1420</page-number>\n<em>b. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-4\">The ITC defends its conclusion, that the likely volume of subject imports would not be significant, as supported by substantial evidence and otherwise in accordance with law. (ITC Resp. Br. at 44-56.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-5\">First, the ITC disagrees with Plaintiffs that it ignored crucial evidence and counters that it \u201cappropriately considered combined data for the three cumulated countries.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at 45.) The ITC posits that its \u201ccountry-specific analysis of certain data\u201d was a reasonable method to assess the relative economic incentives of the subject producers to ship significant volumes of CoRe steel to the U.S. absent the ADD/CVD orders. <em>{Id.) </em>The Court is satisfied with the ITC\u2019s reasonable analysis and explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-6\">Next, the ITC argues that it explicitly addressed the issue of shifting production from non-subject merchandise to subject merchandise. The ITC stated that it relied on record evidence to explain that there is not substantial incentive to make such a switch, since non-subject products like micro-alloy, alloy, and stainless steel products have higher margins. (ITC Resp. Br. at 54.); <em>see citing </em>2007 Commission Views at 129 n.784 (C.R. 831). Here, the Court again is satisfied with the ITC\u2019s reasonable analysis and explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-7\">The Commission defended its analysis with respect to China\u2019s role in the Asian market and pointed to record evidence to conclude \u201cChina would remain a net importer of corrosion-resistant steel for the foreseeable future but would import at a slower rate due to its increased capacity.\u201d (ITC Resp. Br. at 52.) Thus the ITC reasonably concluded that subject producers would continue their trend of exporting CoRe steel regionally and would not be displaced by Chinese production in the foreseeable future. <em>See </em>2007 Commission Views at 130 (C.R. 831).</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-8\">The ITC also answered Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge that it ignored inventory evidence for Australia, France and Japan. <em>{Id. </em>at 53-54.) The Commission in fact addressed this issue, noting that the likely volume of CoRe steel inventories held by these three countries, would not be significant upon revocation of the ADD/CVD orders because most CoRe steel was \u201cmade to order and already committed to specific customers.\u201d <em>{Id. {citing </em>2007 Commission Views at 129 n.784 (C.R. 831)).) Moreover, Defendant-Intervenors JFE Steel Corp. argue that Plaintiffs are, in effect, petitioning this court to \u201creweigh the evidence\u201d but point out that there is no basis to do so under the law. (Def.-Interv. JFE Steel Br. at 25.) On this point, the Court agrees with Defendant-Intervenors. <em>See Coallition for the Pres, of Am. Brake Drum &amp; Rotor Aftermarket Mfrs. v. United States, </em>22 CIT 520, 530, 15 F. Supp.2d 918, 927 (1998) (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s argument, in essence, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1421\">*1421</page-number>cerns the weight the Commission assigned to [one factor], which is within its discretion. The Court\u2019s duty is not to reweigh the evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-4\">The ITC also rebutted Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the subject producers from Australia, France and Japan could shift \u201csignificant amounts of production from non-subject to subject merchandise.\u201d (Joint PL Br. at 48.) The ITC pointed to record evidence demonstrating that there was \u201cnot much incentive [among these subject producers] to switch\u201d production lines [\u00b6] ]] (ITC Resp. Br. at 54-55 (citing 2007 Commission Views at 124 (C.R. 831)).) Here too, the Court is satisfied with the ITC\u2019s reasonable analysis and explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-5\">Finally, the ITC disagrees that it ignored the significance of the quantities of French and Japanese exports of CoRe steel to Canada and Mexico during the POR. (ITC Resp. Br. at 55-56.) The Commission responds that it relied on record evidence indicating that France and Japan\u2019s exports to Canada remained small even after Canada lifted its own ADD/CVD orders. <em>(Id. </em>at 55.); <em>see </em>2007 Commission Views at 131,133 (C.R. 831). Additionally, the ITC discounted Japan\u2019s 2005 exports to Mexico since they were contractually committed to make those sales. <em>Id. </em>at 131, 133. France\u2019s exports to Mexico were small to begin with and showed a decline. Importantly, the ITC stressed that having the local U.S. affiliates of French and Japanese producers was the more significant market factor, rather than any possible interest these producers may have in the Canadian and Mexican markets. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1441-6\">This Court agrees with Defendant ITC and Defendant-Intervenors, that merely because Plaintiffs can offer evidence or marshal arguments contrary to the Commission\u2019s findings and conclusions is not sufficient grounds to upset the Commission\u2019s determination. <em>See NMB Sing., Ltd. v. United States, </em>27 CIT 1325, 288 F. Supp.2d 1306 (2003). It is the ITC\u2019s \u201ctask to evaluate the evidence it collects during its investigation\u201d and to determine \u201cthe weight to be assigned a particular piece of evidence.\u201d <em>United States Steel Group v. United States, </em>96 F.3d 1352, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Accordingly, the evidence provided by the ITC is sufficient to support the conclusion that there would not likely be a significant volume of imports into the U.S. upon revocation of the ADD/CVD orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-7\">2. <em>Canada</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1441-8\">The ITC found that in the absence of the ADD/CVD orders, the likely volume of CoRe steel imports from Canada would not be significant due to \u201cthe projected continued strength of the Canadian market, Canadian producers\u2019 limited excess capacity, and their long-term volume commitments to a stable customer base that could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1422\">*1422</page-number>readily diverted to supply new customers.\u201d 2007 Commission Views at 141 (C.R. 831). Additionally, the ITC noted that Canadian CoRe steel has remained in the U.S. market at consistent levels and has not displaced U.S. sales. <em>(Id. </em>at 139-141.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-4\">During the POR, Canadian producers shipped a very high percentage of CoRe steel to its home market, and most of the remaining balance to the U.S. market. <em>(Id. </em>at 140.) Notwithstanding the order, Canadian CoRe steel has remained in the U.S. market at rather consistent levels. <em>(Id.) </em>Dofasco, a Canadian producer/exporter, shipped a substantial percent of its U.S. exports pursuant to long-term contracts with the automotive sector. <em>(Id.) </em>The ITC found that the auto producers consider the North American market as a unified market for production and sourcing decisions. <em>(Id.) </em>The ITC also found that any increases of CoRe steel exports from Canada to the U.S. were not made on the basis of \u201cprice competition\u201d with the U.S. industry. <em>(Id.) </em>Moreover, any increase in Canadian imports over the POR did not generally displace U.S. production or represent sales lost to Canadian product on price basis but rather reflected increased U.S. demand or demand that U.S. producers could not supply. <em>(Id.) </em>The ITC determined that Canadian producer\u2019s capacity utilization was \u201chigh\u201d and its excess capacity was not \u201csignificant.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Additionally, inventories of Canadian product appeared modest and would not likely contribute to a significant increase in U.S. imports since much of this product is generally made to order and is otherwise already committed to customers. <em>(Id. </em>at 140-41.) The ITC also found that Canada is a \u201cnet importer\u201d of CoRe steel globally. <em>(Id. </em>at 141). Additionally, during the POR, Canadian prices were comparable to U.S. prices. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1442-5\">\n<em>a. Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-6\">Plaintiff AK Steel<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> criticizes the ITC\u2019s likely volume analysis as based on \u201cisolated facts,\u201d which are \u201ccontradicted by the weight of the record evidence\u201d such that the record evidence in total does not support the Commission\u2019s conclusions. (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 62.) AK Steel argues that the ITC\u2019s analysis suffers from \u201cseveral flaws.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>First, AK Steel disputes the ITC\u2019s finding that the Canadian producers\u2019 excess capacity was \u201cnot significant.\u201d (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 62-63 <em>(citing </em>2007 Commission Views at 140 (C.R. 831)); <em>see also </em>AK Steel Reply Br at 11-14.) AK Steel contends that the record evidence that the ITC points to in support of its conclusion was analyzed \u201cin isolation.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1423\">*1423</page-number>(Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 63.) \u201cHowever, taken together, Canadian producers could increase exports of subject merchandise to the United States by a total of [\u00b6] ]] short tons.\u201d <em>(Id. (citing </em>Final Staff Report at Table CORE-I-17 and IV-20 (C.R. 743)).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-5\">AK Steel also faults the ITC\u2019s analysis for relying on data submitted by Dofasco, [\u00b6] ]], which \u201cpurported non-price reason[s]\u201d to explain the [\u00b6] ]] of some [\u00b6] ]] tons of Canadian exports out of approximately [\u00b6] ]] total tons. <em>(Id. </em>at 63.) AK Steel argues that evidence in the record [\u00b6] ]], belies this conclusion. <em>(Id.) </em>[\u00b6] ]] average unit values (\u201cAUV\u201d) for exports to the U.S. [\u00b6] ]] for net sales in every year from 2000 to the first half of 2006. <em>(Id. </em>at 64.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-10\">AK Steel also points to a \u201cmarket reality\u201d ignored by the ITC in that \u201cthe shift in auto and auto part production away from the upper-Midwest in the United States and Canada toward the Southern United States will encourage Dofasco to seek to further expand its shipments into the United States with even more aggressive pricing upon revocation of the orders.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 65 <em>(citing </em>Nucor/SDI Prehear-ing Br. at Ex. 11 (C.R. 553)).) AK Steel proffers that the ITC ignored \u201cthe deteriorating state of the North American auto industry \u2014 the largest consumer of CoRe steel,\u201d which undermines the Commission conclusion that Canadian demand is forecast to remain strong in the near future. <em>(Id. </em>at 66.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-11\">AK Steel also challenges the Commission\u2019s conclusion that Canadian exports of CoRe steel to the U.S. will not likely increase significantly upon revocation of the order due to a forecast that production and demand will remain strong in Canada. AK Steel argues that this conclusion is erroneous and based upon \u201ca misinterpretation of [\u00b6] ]] business plan and its assertion that exports to the United States will decline.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 65.) AK Steel offers that the business plan actually shows that [\u00b6] ]]. <em>(Id. </em>at 66.) Thus according to AK steel, this demonstrates that the [\u00b6] ]] business plan supports the opposite conclusion \u2014 that [\u00b6] ]]. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1443-15\">Finally, AK Steel argues that \u201cCanada\u2019s status as a net importer of CoRe steel simply increases the likelihood that Canadian producers, facing lost sales at home, will seek to dump steel abroad.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 67.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-16\">Defendant-Intervenor Dofasco argued in support of the ITC\u2019s likely volume analysis with respect to Canada. (Dofasco Resp. Br. at 43-47.) The Court finds Dofasco\u2019s arguments are substantially similar to those presented by the ITC and therefore, the Court will not recount them one by one in this opinion, although they have been fully considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1424\">*1424</page-number>\n<em>b. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-4\">The ITC defends its determination and argues that it did in fact consider the Canadian industry\u2019s excess capacity in 2005, but also notes that its capacity utilization rate was rather high at [\u00b6] <em>11% </em>at that same time. (ITC Resp. Br. at 65.) Additionally, the ITC noted that Canadian CoRe steel remained in the U.S. market at rather consistent levels during the POR. <em>(Id.) </em>This Court agrees with Defendant and Dofacso that AK Steel\u2019s arguments here are by and large attempts to re-weigh the evidence. For example, AK Steel\u2019s challenge to the ITC\u2019s conclusion that the Canadian producers\u2019 excess capacity was \u201cnot significant\u201d is baseless. AK Steel \u201ccites the raw tonnage ...[but] ignores the percentage capacity utilization figure for Canada, which was nearly [\u00b6] <em>]]% </em>at the end of the POR.\u201d (Dofasco Resp. Br. at 43.) Moreover, it was reasonable for the ITC to conclude that the end-of-period inventories were not likely to contribute to significant increase in imports since it had determined that CoRe steel \u201cinventories typically represent supply that has been made to order and already committed to a customer.\u201d 2007 Commission Views at 141 (C.R. 831).</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-7\">Next, the Court considers AK Steel\u2019s challenge that the record does not support that there were non-price reasons for Canadian shipments of CoRe to the U.S. during the POR. AK Steel cites to average unit value (\u201cAUV\u201d) data to support its assertion that [\u00b6] ]] AUV for its exports to the U.S. may be lower than those for [\u00b6] ]] and thus certain Canadian CoRe steel was being offered to [\u00b6] ]]. (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 64.) First, this Court agrees with the ITC that AUV data is not dispositive proof of underselling because this data is only reliable if the product mix is constant over time. <em>See Ugine-Savoie Imphy v. United States, </em>26 CIT 851, 861, 248 F.Supp.2d 1208, 1218 (2002) (ITC acted reasonably in disregarding AUV data because of variance in product mix); <em>Allegheny Ludlum Corp. v. United States, </em>287 F.3d 1365, 1373-74 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (describing narrow circumstances where the ITC may use AUV data as indicators of price trends). Second, in any case, the ITC is required by statute to make its determination based on the industry as a whole. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a. Finally, the ITC points to record evidence disputing the charge that [\u00b6] ]] undersold [\u00b6] ]]. The record shows that [\u00b6] ]] reported in its questionnaire that [\u00b6] ]]. (Conf. Appendix, Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at Tab 8.) Additionally, the record shows that there are non-price factors that [\u00b6] ]] questionnaire response indicated were significant in purchasing decisions, such as ability to meet quality and delivery requirements. (ITC Resp. Br. at 66.) Consequently, AK <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1425\">*1425</page-number>Steel\u2019s argument here too must fail, as the Court is satisfied with the ITC\u2019s reasonable analysis and explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-4\">The Court also finds meritless AK Steel\u2019s argument that the ITC failed to consider the \u201cdeteriorating state of the North American auto industry.\u201d (Joint PI. Br. at 66.) As Amici Curiae point out, the ITC specifically considered that \u201c [production and demand in the Canadian automotive [industry] are forecast to remain strong through 2008, and thus to continue as the major outlet for Canadian corrosion-resistant steel production.\u201d (Amici Curiae Br. at 27 <em>(citing </em>2007 Commission Views at 138 (P.R. 940).) Moreover, AK Steel points to no record evidence concerning the \u201ctiming or magnitude\u201d of its argument that, as the auto industry shifts to the Southern U.S., Dofasco will seek to expand therein with aggressive pricing. Such speculation is undoubtedly beyond the \u201creasonably foreseeable time\u201d frame that the ITC is required to consider. <em>See Nucor Corp. v. United States, </em>28 CIT 188, 233, 318 F.Supp.2d 1207, 1247 (2004) (Absent a showing to the contrary, the ITC is presumed to have considered all of the evidence in the record, and is not required to explicitly address every piece presented by the parties.) Accordingly, the Court is satisfied with the ITC\u2019s reasonable analysis and explanation and finds that it is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-5\">The ITC refutes AK Steel\u2019s argument challenging its finding that demand in the Canadian market would remain strong because of evidence presented in Dofasco\u2019s business plan about its plan to supply a new Toyota plant in Ontario near Dofasco\u2019s mill. (ITC Resp. Br. at 66.) The ITC notes that AK Steel\u2019s dispute with this evidence is that it \u201cwould not be fully realized until 2008.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>However, this time frame is well-within the ambit of \u201creasonably foreseeable future,\u201d <em>see </em>2007 Commission Views at 120 (C.R. 831), and the ITC could weigh this evidence in a reasonable manner. The Court is satisfied with the ITC\u2019s reasonable analysis and explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-6\">3. <em>Germany &amp; Korea</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1445-7\">With respect to Germany &amp; Korea, the Commission found that the likely volume of cumulated CoRe steel imports would be significant if the orders were revoked. 2007 Commission Views at 146 (C.R. 831). The ITC found that German and Korean producers nearly doubled their combined production capacity since 1992 and increased their production of CoRe steel from [\u00b6] ]] short tons in 1992 to [\u00b6] ]] short tons in 2005. <em>(Id. </em>at 143.) Together, the countries had a combined excess capacity of [\u00b6] ]] short tons in 2005, equivalent to [\u00b6] <em>]]% </em>of apparent U.S. consumption. <em>(Id.) </em>In addition, both Germany and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1426\">*1426</page-number>Korea were found by the ITC to be \u201cexport-oriented.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 143.) Moreover, the ITC determined that German producer ThyssenKrupp was affiliated with a significant distributer in the U.S., and Korean producers had significant relationships with U.S. customers. <em>(Id. </em>at 144.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-4\">ThyssenKrupp indicated plans to establish a production facility in North America, but the ITC found that the record supported a conclusion that this was not likely in the foreseeable future. <em>(Id. </em>at 145.) Korean producer POSCO indicated plans to build a production facility in Mexico, but the record too supported a conclusion that this was not likely in the foreseeable future. <em>(Id. </em>at 145; <em>see also supra </em>note 24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-5\">The ITC also concluded, supported by record evidence, that Korean CoRe steel producers would have price motivation to increase shipments to the U.S. market, given that U.S. prices for CoRe steel were typically higher than in many Asian markets and a significant portion of its exports were not supplied under long-term contracts. <em>(Id </em>at 145-146.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-6\">Thus the ITC concluded that record evidence indicates that German and Korean producers would be able to ship significant volumes of CoRe steel to the U.S. market if the ADD/CVD orders were revoked, due to their combined substantial capacity and production, excess capacity, general export-orientation, the substantial and increasing level of their exports to the United States during the POR, and well-established U.S. based relationships or distribution channels. <em>(Id. </em>at 146.) The ITC also found that generally higher prices in the U.S. than in other Asian markets gave both German and Korean producers incentive to redirect volumes currently exported to Asia to the U.S. market. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1446-7\">\n<em>a. Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-8\">German Plaintiffs challenge the ITC\u2019s affirmative determination in its likely volume analysis for Germany &amp; Korea as not supported by substantial evidence or not otherwise in accordance with law. (German Pl.\u2019s Br. at 37-39.) German Plaintiffs argue that the ITC ignored the fact that German and Korean CoRe steel imports have \u201cremained relatively steady\u201d throughout the life of the orders despite changes in factors such as price, capacity utilization, production costs, etc. <em>(Id. </em>at 38.) They contend that the conclusion to draw from this data is that \u201cimport patterns are unlikely to change and have any resultant effect on the domestic industry upon revocation.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>German Plaintiffs note that, by comparison to the other subject countries, Germany and Korea \u201chave shipped relatively steady volumes without dramatic or unreasonable fluctuations.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 39.) The others have ceased shipments (Australia and France between the original investigation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1427\">*1427</page-number>the first sunset review), experienced dramatic increases in exports (Canada), or decreases in market share (Japan went from a \u201csubstantial\u201d market share in the U.S. to a \u201cminimal\u201d one). <em>(Id. </em>at 39 n.38.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-4\">German Plaintiffs, in short, contend that the ITC \u201crelied on isolated data points, misconstrued facts and performed partial analyses to support its determination. Such methodology does not rise to the level of substantial evidence.\u201d (German Pl.\u2019s Reply Br. at 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-5\">\n<em>b. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-6\">The Court disagrees with German Plaintiffs. First, German Plaintiffs appear to challenge the ITC\u2019s interpretation of the record data and the relative weight accorded by the Commission to certain factors or not at all. This, however, is not the proper forum for such complaints. <em>See Siderca S.A.I.C. v. United States, </em>29 CIT 1030, 1048, 391 F.Supp.2d 1353, 1369 (2005) (the role of the Court is not to \u201credecide the question before the agency\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-7\">Next, though German Plaintiffs cite to the record to show that German and Korean imports remained \u201crelatively steady\u201d during the period that the orders were in effect, the Court is not persuaded that this is a legally significant fact. The test is \u201cin order to find sufficient volume for there to be injury, the ITC must identify substantial evidence from the record demonstrating that, should the orders be revoked, it is likely that the volume of the subject imports entering the U.S. market will be significant.\u201d <em>Nippon Steel Corp., </em>29 CIT at 712, 391 F.Supp.2d at 1275. Further, the ITC must also consider whether the likely volume would be \u201csignificant\u201d in absolute terms, or relative to production or consumption in the United States. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7)(C)(i). Looking to the ITC Staff Report, the cumulated volume of imports from Germany and Korea was 382,705 short tons in 1992, which increased to 406,799 short tons by 2005. 2007 Commission Views at 140 (P.R. 940); 2007 Sunset Review Information at Table CORE-I-1, 1-13 (P.R. 941). Additionally, German and Korean producers substantially increased capacity and production of CoRe steel from the initial investigation through the POR. 2007 Commission Views at 140-41 (P.R. 940); 2007 Commission Views at 143 (C.R. 831); Tables CORE-IV-36 and CORE-IV-54 (C.R. 743). In 2005, German and Korean producers had substantial combined excess capacity. 2007 Commission Views at 143 (C.R. Doc. 831); Tables CORE-IV-36 and CORE-IV-54 (C.R. Doc. 743). German and Korean CoRe industries are export oriented, with Korea exporting approximately 29% of total shipments in every year of the POR, 2007 Commission Views at 143-44 (CR Doc. 831); 2007 Sunset Review Information at Table CORE-IV-56 (P.R. Doc. 941), and Germany exporting over [\u00b6] ]]% of total shipments in every year of the POR. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1428\">*1428</page-number>2007 Commission Views at 143-44 (CR Doc. 831); Table CORE-IV-38 (CR Doc.743). German and Korean producers have shown a strong interest in exporting to the U.S., with aggregate exports increasing from [\u00b6] ]] short tons in 2000 to [\u00b6] ]] short tons in 2005, a [\u00b6] ]]% increase, despite the existence of the orders. 2007 Commission Views at 144 (C.R. Doc. 831); Tables CORE-IV-38 and CORE-IV-56 (C.R. Doc. 7 ). The interest of German and Korean producers in the U.S. market, combined with insufficient U.S. production facilities, indicates that they would likely deepen their participation in the U.S. market through exports from Germany and Korea. 2007 Commission Views at 144-45 (C.R. Doc. 831). The increased volume of cumulated subject imports would likely occur in both the construction and automotive end-use sectors for CoRe steel. 2007 Commission Views at 145 (C.R. 831). German and Korean producers would likely have economic incentives to increase or shift/redirect sales to the U.S. market due to generally higher U.S. prices. 2007 Commission Views at 145-46 (C.R. Doc. 831). German and Korean producers have strong relationships with U.S. distributors and/or customers that would facilitate increased exports to the U.S. 2007 Commission Views at 146 (C.R. Doc. 831).</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-5\">Given this record, the ITC could reasonably conclude that the cu-mulated volumes would be significant upon revocation and this Court finds that such determination was supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, this Court rejects the challenges by Plaintiffs, and holds that the ITC\u2019s likely volume determinations were reasonable exercises of its discretion, supported by substantial evidence and are otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-6\">C. Likely Price Effect</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-7\">Having discussed the ITC\u2019s treatment of the likely volume factor in its material injury determination, the Court will consider the second statutory factor: likely price effects of subject imports in the event of revocation. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1675a(a)(l) &amp; (3). The ITC is required by statute to consider two sub-factors in evaluating the likely price effects. These are (1) whether \u201cthere is likely to be significant price underselling by the imports of the subject merchandise as compared with domestic like products,\u201d and (2) whether the \u201cimports of the subject merchandise are likely to enter the United States at prices that otherwise would have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on the price of domestic like products.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-8\">1. <em>Australia, France &amp; Japan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1448-9\">The ITC determined that the cumulated subject imports from Australia, France and Japan will not likely have significant adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1429\">*1429</page-number>(depressing or suppressing) price effects if the ADD/CVD orders were revoked. 2007 Commission Views at 134-36 (C.R. 831). According to the Commission, the record showed that domestic prices were strong and, in fact, rose during the POR as a result of rapidly growing demand and outstripped sharp increases in raw materials and energy costs. <em>Id. </em>at 134-35. Additionally, the ITC found that the domestic industry had been able to lower its fixed costs as a result of industry-wide restructuring, which enabled it to manage output and maintain prices notwithstanding rising input costs. <em>Id. </em>at 135. Moreover, though some prices fell on certain products in mid-2006, several domestic producers announced price increases at the same time, while other domestic producers were able to negotiate higher contract prices for the second half of 2006 and 2007. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1449-4\">The ITC stated that there were no U.S. price comparisons on the record for sales of Australian and French CoRe steel during the POR and that Japanese CoRe steel oversold the U.S. product in 15 out of 20 comparisons. 2007 Commission Views at 132 (PR. 940) <em>(citing </em>Table CORE-V-17).</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-5\">Finally, notwithstanding the fact that certain auto producer executives (major purchasers of CoRe steel) testified before the Commission stating that the greater availability of subject imports would be useful as leverage in domestic supply price negotiations to obtain more favorable prices, the ITC found that Australian, French and Japanese producers had neither the capacity nor incentive to ship significant quantities of CoRe steel to the U.S. upon revocation.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> 2007 Commission Views at 135-36 (C.R. 831).</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-6\">\n<em>a. Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-7\">Plaintiffs contend, again on several grounds, that the ITC\u2019s likely price effects analysis is not supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise not in accordance with law. (USS Br. at 45-48; Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. 39-43.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-8\">First, USS argues that the ITC\u2019s finding that producers in Australia, France and Japan have no incentive to price aggressively in the U.S. market is unsupported by substantial evidence. (USS Br. at 48.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1430\">*1430</page-number>Suggesting that the ITC may have ignored detracting evidence demonstrating the significance of price in purchasing decisions, USS argues that because CoRe steel is \u201cgenerally substitutable, provided [that] suppliers meet qualification requirements,...price is an important factor in purchasing decisions.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 46 <em>(citing </em>2007 Commission Views at 132 (RR. 940)).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-4\">USS also contends that the ITC never explained \u201cwhy stronger U.S. prices would cause Australian, French and Japanese producers to have \u2018no incentive\u2019 to price aggressively in this market.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 46.) Indeed, USS argues, rising costs coupled with rising U.S. prices cut in favor of the likelihood that subject imports would have significant price effects. <em>(Id. </em>at 47.) More to the point, USS argues, the ITC decided exactly that with respect to its affirmative price analysis for Germany and Korea. <em>(Id. </em>at 47 <em>(citing </em>2007 Commission Views at 144-145 (P.R. 940) (ITC finding that higher prices in the U.S. compared with \u201ckey Asian markets\u201d would enable Korean producers, and to a lesser extent German producers, to obtain higher prices in the U.S. while still underselling U.S. producers.))) This contradiction, USS contends, demands a remand. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1450-5\">Next, USS and Joint Plaintiffs complain that the evidence supporting increases in U.S. CoRe steel prices were \u201cnot as significant as... suggested.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 48; Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 42-43.) USS points to the fact that contract sales to the auto producers lagged behind increases in the spot market. (USS Br. at 48.) Also, most supply contracts with the auto industry, though commanding higher prices in 2006-2007, were for shorter durations (1 year). <em>(Id.) </em>Consequently, the revocation of the orders would undoubtedly affect prices when the auto supply contracts would come up for renegotiation. <em>(Id.) </em>Plaintiffs contend that the failure of the ITC to address these arguments and evidence undermines its conclusion with regard to the auto contracts. (USS Br. at 48.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1450-6\">Both USS and Joint Plaintiffs argue that the ITC erroneously failed to credit certain ITC hearing statements made by the Amici Curiae Auto Producers as \u201cadmissions against interest.\u201d (USS Br. 55-59; Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 39-42.) Plaintiffs contend that the Amici Curiae Auto Producers were presented \u201cfront and center\u201d at the Commission hearings in opposition to the continuation of the ADD/CVD orders. (USS Br. at 55-56.) Plaintiffs point to the testimony of a few auto producer executives who explained that revocation of the ADD/CVD orders and the availability of more subject imports would be utilized to \u201cleverage down\u201d prices. (USS Br. 56; <em>see also </em>Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. 39) (Both <em>citing </em>Transcript (\u201cTr.\u201d) of U.S. Int\u2019l Trade Comm\u2019n Hearing (Oct. 17, 2006) at 422 (General Motors, Dr. G. Mustafa Mohatarem) and 455 (General Motors, Mr. Richard Cover) (P.R. 528).) USS posits that since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1431\">*1431</page-number>Auto Producers testified on behalf of Respondents, this crucial testimony was an \u201cadmission against interest\u201d by Respondents, which \u201cshould have, effectively ended [this case] right then and there.\u201d (USS Br. at 57.) Moreover, Plaintiffs are confounded by the ITC\u2019s negative determination regarding Germany and Korea, wherein the Commission found that their cumulated quantities of subject imports would serve as leverage on prices in negotiations between the Auto Producers and domestic CoRe steel producers. (USS Br. at 57-58.) The distinction drawn by the ITC between Germany and Korea, on the one hand, and the other subject countries, on the other, was \u201csimply made up out of whole cloth.\u201d (USS Br. at 59.) Additionally, Joint Plaintiffs characterized the ITC\u2019s failure to credit the admission by Auto Producers and instead provide a rationale for \u201cwhat the auto industry really intended to say,\u201d as \u201creversible error.\u201d (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 40.) Thus, Plaintiffs conclude, the ITC\u2019s evidentiary determination was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-4\">\n<em>b. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-5\">This Court finds, for the reasons noted below, that ITC\u2019s likely price effects determination is supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with law. First, Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge of the ITC\u2019s finding that producers in Australia, France and Japan have no incentive to price aggressively is untenable in the face of record evidence. <em>See Nucor Corp., </em>318 F. Supp.2d at 1247 (The ITC is \u201cpresumed to have considered all of the evidence on the record\u201d and is not \u201crequired to explicitly address every piece of evidence presented by the parties.\u201d). Additionally, this Court agrees with Defendant-Intervenor JFE Steel Corp. that the Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments on pricing are \u201cmerely another form of disagreement with the Commission\u2019s conclusion on volume.\u201d (Def.-Interv. JFE Steel Resp. Br. at 47.) The ITC found support in the record that showed that Australia, France and Japan lacked any incentive to aggressively price limited sales or offers post-revocation. 2007 Commission Views at 133-134 (P.R. 940). This Court finds that the ITC\u2019s determination in this regard was reasonable and supported by substantial record evidence. <em>Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938) (citations omitted) (The ITC has thus provided \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1451-6\">Next, the Court rejects USS\u2019s remand demand based on its claim that a \u201cdirect contradiction\u201d exists between the ITC\u2019s price effects analysis on Australia, France and Japan and that of German and Korea. (USS Br. at 46-47.) Plaintiffs\u2019 mischaracterization of the ITC findings cannot be sustained. The ITC based its price analysis of Germany and Korea on certain regional data published by MEPS and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1432\">*1432</page-number>[\u00b6] ]]. 2007 Commission Views at 145 (C.R. 831). The ITC\u2019s observation of the data for Korea in 2005 and 2006 showed that its pricing was generally lower than U.S. pricing, and pricing data for China and the Far East were also consistently lower. <em>Id. </em>The ITC concluded that this data demonstrated an incentive for Korea to shift some sales from Asia to the U.S. market to obtain higher prices. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the ITC found that a similar comparison would give German producers a similar incentive to redirect its Asian exports to the U.S. <em>Id. </em>at 145-46. These findings therefore are consistent with the ITC findings and conclusions with respect to Australia, France and Japan, namely that cumulated producers from these three countries have no incentive to price aggressively. Thus the Court finds that the ITC\u2019s determination here was reasonable and supported by substantial record evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-5\">The Court also rejects Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments focused on the revised, shorter-term auto contracts. The ITC defends its determination here, noting that it did evaluate and consider that auto contracts were generally shorter at the end of the POR. However, the record indicated the shortened life span of these contracts neither favored the CoRe producers nor the auto manufacturers. (ITC Resp. Br. at 57 <em>0citing </em>2007 Commission Views at 127 (C.R. 831)).) Notwithstanding, Plaintiffs ignore that some domestic producers managed to obtain [\u00b6] ]] price increases in their contracts in the second half of 2006 and in 2007. 2007 Commission Views at 135, n.844 (C.R. 831). Thus the Court finds that the ITC\u2019s determination was reasonable and supported by substantial record evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-7\">Finally, this Court addresses Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge that the ITC read a non-existent distinction into the Auto Producers\u2019 testimony and failed to weigh certain testimony in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor. The Court agrees that, based on the record evidence, it was reasonable for the ITC to find that though the Auto Producers could gain increased \u201cleverage\u201d in price negotiations derived from the threat of increased imports from Germany and Korea, such leverage might not exist with respect to Australia, France and Japan. 2007 Commission Views at 133, 145 (P.R. 940).</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-8\">Reviewing the testimony of the Auto Producer executives from General Motors at the ITC hearing, the Court observes that the testimony is riddled with generalities and is unspecific about which subject countries GM would solicit to \u201cobserve the level of interest and energy that those countries would put into winning [GM\u2019s] business.\u201d Hearing Tr. at 456 (General Motors, Mr. Richard Cover) (P.R. 528).</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-9\">Turning to Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge that Auto Producers\u2019 statements are \u201cstatements against interest,\u201d this Court rejects such arguments as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1433\">*1433</page-number>likely irrelevant. First, Plaintiffs cite no authority as to the efficacy of this evidentiary rule in a Commission proceeding. Second, it is doubtful that an exception to the hearsay rule, codified in Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2), governs in a case where \u201cthe ITC may, and indeed must, consider all evidence presented which comprises the record.\u201d <em>Wells Mfg. Co. v. United States, </em>11 CIT 911, 921, 677 F. Supp. 1239, 1247 (1987). Third, USS admits that \u201cUltimately... whether such testimony is treated as an admission against interest is a secondary matter.\u201d (USS Br. at 58.) Finally, under the standard of review in this case, it was not an error of law for the ITC to accept Auto Producers\u2019 testimony and not treat it as an admission against their interest. The Commission is required to consider \u201call evidence presented,\u201d <em>Wells Mfg. Co., </em>677 F. Supp. at 1247, and thus a supposed evidentiary ruling (or lack thereof) here ultimately goes to the <em>weight </em>of the evidence under consideration. This Court in turn reviews Commission determinations regarding the weight of evidence under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(i) (2000) (CIT will uphold a factual determination by the ITC unless it is \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law\u201d). Therefore, this Court holds that the ITC\u2019s determination was reasonable and supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-4\">2. <em>Canada</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1453-5\">The ITC found that CoRe steel from Canada will not likely have significant adverse price effects if the order is revoked. 2007 Commission Views at 142 (C.R. 831). This determination predicated on the consistent level of Canadian product in the U.S. market during a period where prices were strong relative to rising costs, and finding that the volume of Canadian CoRe steel is not likely to increase significantly if the order is revoked. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1453-6\">\n<em>a. Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-7\">AK Steel contends that the Commission\u2019s determination is faulty because it failed to consider current underselling by Canada. (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 43-45.) Additionally, AK Steel maintains that the ITC\u2019s price effects analysis for Canada was premised on its finding that volume of subject imports from Canada would not increase significantly. (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 43.) Supported by record evidence that there is \u201ccurrent and significant\u201d underselling (\u201c62 percent of the time despite the discipline of the orders\u201d) by Canadian subject imports, coupled with the importance of price in negotiations, Plaintiff AK Steel contends that it is \u201cillogical to conclude that Canadian producers will not attempt to gain a greater proportion of the market <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1434\">*1434</page-number>through aggressive pricing.\u201d (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 44-45.) Thus the ITC\u2019s finding is unsupported by substantial evidence and is not in accordance with law. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1454-4\">b. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1454-5\">The Court agrees with Defendant-Intervenor Dofasco that AK Steel\u2019s attacks here are yet another attempt to \u201cre-weigh the record evidence.\u201d (Def.-Interv. Dofasco Resp. Br. at 47.) Dofasco concedes that the ITC \u201cnote[d] a mixed pattern of underselling, with overall Canadian overselling in 19 of 50 comparisons and underselling in 31.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 48 <em>(citing </em>2007 Commission Views at 142 (C.R. 831)).) However, AK Steel\u2019s \u201cspin\u201d on the 62% underselling argument does not explain the full story. Dofasco explains that U.S. and Canadian contract prices were [\u00b6] ]]. <em>See </em>Final Staff Report at CORE-V-34 (C.R. 743) (emphasis in original)). As detailed in the ITC Staff Report, [\u00b6] ]]. <em>Id. </em>at CORE-V-36 n.26. This could explain why when U.S. spot sales [\u00b6] ]]. <em>Id. </em>at CORE-V-34 (Figure CORE-V-10). In light of the foregoing then, the Court is satisfied that the ITC\u2019s review of the administrative record and its characterization of the underselling/overselling pattern as \u201cmixed\u201d is supported by substantial evidence and is reasonable. Therefore AK Steel\u2019s arguments are untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-9\">3. <em>Germany &amp; Korea</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1454-10\">The ITC determined that the revocation of the orders on subject imports from Germany and Korea would likely result in significant adverse price effects. 2007 Commission Views at 148. (C.R. 831). The ITC\u2019s conclusion appears to be based on the expectation that the substantially larger volume of subject imports from Germany and Korea that are likely to enter the U.S. market upon revocation would either be priced aggressively to capture market share, or leveraged by purchasers to obtain more favorable domestic prices, depressing or suppressing domestic prices to a significant degree. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1454-11\">Additionally, the ITC based its price analysis of Germany and Korea on certain regional data published by MEPS and [\u00b6] ]]. 2007 Commission Views at 145 (C.R. 831). The ITC\u2019s observation of the MEPS data for Korea in 2005 and 2006 showed that that pricing was lower than U.S. pricing and [\u00b6] ]] data indicating that pricing for \u201cChina\u201d and \u201cFar East\u201d was also lower than U.S. pricing. <em>Id. </em>The ITC found that this data demonstrated an incentive for Korea to shift some sales from Asia to the U.S. market to obtain higher prices. <em>Id. </em>Further, the ITC found that the same comparison would give German producers the same incentive to redirect its Asian exports to the U.S. <em>Id. </em>at 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1435\">*1435</page-number>Finally, the Commission also found that German and Korean cu-mulated subject imports would serve as leverage on prices in negotiations between the Auto Producers and domestic CoRe steel producers. <em>Id. </em>at 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-4\">\n<em>a. Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-5\">German Plaintiffs contend that the record evidence \u201cconfirms\u201d that German and Korean CoRe imports are \u201csimply too small to be a price leader or have significant price effects.\u201d (German PI. Br. at 39-40.) German Plaintiffs argue that German and Korean CoRe steel producers are experiencing strong regional demand and (at least for Germany) home and regional prices are equal to or greater than U.S. prices, thus there is no incentive for the German producers to increase their U.S. import volumes and suppress/depress U.S. prices. <em>(Id. </em>at 40 <em>(citing </em>Final Staff Report at CORE-IV-103, COREIV-93, Table CORE-IV-68; and at CORE-IV-94, Table CORE-IV-69) (C.R. 743).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-6\">Second, German Plaintiffs\u2019 contend that there is no incentive for German or Korean CoRe steel producers \u201cto expand their sales to other U.S. automotive producers and engage in aggressive pricing.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>This is a result of German producers\u2019 U.S. sales being dedicated to a select group of long-term customers and Korean producers\u2019 automotive industry sales being targeted to long-standing relationships with \u201cKorean transplants establishing their facilities\u201d in the U.S. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1455-7\">German Plaintiff\u2019s conclude that the ITC based its likely price effects determination on \u201con pure speculation and conjecture.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 41.) The ITC should have considered \u201cthe consistent overselling of German CoRe throughout the life of the AD[D] order, [\u00b6] ]] of which was for automotive applications during the POR,\u201d and that Korean producers sell \u201cnegligible\u201d volumes to the auto industry. <em>(Id.) </em>Thus, German Plaintiffs argue the ITC\u2019s determination is devoid of substantial evidence or otherwise is not in accordance with law. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1455-9\">\n<em>b. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-10\">Notwithstanding the German Plaintiffs\u2019 contentions, the Court finds that there is extensive evidence on the record that supports the ITC\u2019s price effects analysis. First, there is ample evidence in the record that supports the ITC\u2019s conclusion that German and Korean imports would be used to leverage down domestic CoRe steel prices. <em>See </em>2007 Commission Views at 12, 146-48 (C.R. 831). Second, German Plaintiffs cite to the ITC investigations to show its imports were \u201ctoo small\u201d to have adverse price effects. (German Pl. Br. at 39-40 n.39; see, <em>e.g. Am. Bearing Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. United States, </em>350 F.Supp.2d 1100, 1126-27 (CIT 2004).) The cases cited by German Plaintiffs are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1436\">*1436</page-number>inapposite, however. During an investigation, the Commission evaluates trade behavior absent the discipline of the order. In a sunset review therefore, the ITC must conduct a prospective analysis and determine the likely volume and pricing behavior once the discipline of the order is removed. Resultantly, current data (i.e., during the POR) on volume and pricing behavior, are more probative in sunset reviews than data from investigations, so German\u2019s Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments in this regard too must fail. Finally, the balance of the German Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments appear to be pleas to this Court to reweigh evidence and remand to the ITC for an alternative conclusion. As has been oft repeated, this Court cannot countenance such a request. <em>See Usinor, </em>28 CIT at 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-3\">Accordingly, this Court rejects the challenges by Plaintiffs, and holds that the ITC\u2019s likely price effects determinations were reasonable exercises of its discretion, supported by substantial evidence and were otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-4\">D. Impact of Imports on Domestic Industry &amp; Vulnerability of Domestic Industry</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-5\">The third factor that the ITC is required to investigate concerns the likely impact of subject imports the on domestic industry in the event of revocation. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(4)(A)-(C). The ITC is required to consider \u201cwhether the industry is vulnerable to material injury if the order is revoked\u201d in the context of determining \u201cwhether revocation... would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury within a reasonably foreseeable time.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-6\">The SAA provides that in assessing the U.S. industry\u2019s vulnerability to injury if an order is revoked, the Commission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1456-7\">considers, in addition to imports, other factors that may be contributing <em>to </em>overall injury. While these factors, in some cases, may account for the injury to the domestic industry, they may also demonstrate that an industry is facing difficulties from a variety of sources and is vulnerable to dumped or subsidized imports.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1456-8\">SAA at 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-9\">1. <em>Australia, France, Japan &amp; Canada</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1456-10\">The ITC concluded that, upon the revocation of the orders, any CoRe steel imports from Australia, France, Japan &amp; Canada were not likely to have a significant adverse impact on the domestic industry within a reasonably foreseeable time. <em>See </em>2007 Commission Views at 10, 136-39, 142-43 (C.R. 831). Specifically, cumulated imports of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1437\">*1437</page-number>CoRe steel from Australia, France &amp; Japan and CoRe steel from Canada would not likely have significant adverse volume or negative price effects on the domestic industry. <em>(Id. </em>at 136-139 (Australia, France &amp; Japan) and 142-43 (Canada).) Additionally, the ITC found that, although the domestic CoRe steel industry \u201cdid benefit to some degree\u201d from the orders, during the second review, as a result of the restructuring and consolidation within the steel industry, it concluded that the domestic industry was not vulnerable, and indeed may be stronger and healthier than in previous periods of review. <em>Id. </em>at 136 n.849, 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-4\">\n<em>a. Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-5\">Joint Plaintiffs and USS first make a broadside challenge to the ITC\u2019s vulnerability finding and argue that the domestic industry is still vulnerable to injury from imports from Australia, France, Japan &amp; Canada.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 69, n.17; USS Br. at 49; <em>see also </em>AK Steel Reply Br. at 14-17.) Joint Plaintiffs and USS further contend that the ITC\u2019s impact and vulnerability determinations are flawed and unsupported by substantial evidence since they are based on \u201cinsignificant\u201d likely volume and price effects. (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 69-74; USS Br. at 49-55.) Essentially, Joint Plaintiffs argue that the ITC\u2019s conclusions \u2014 that the domestic industry is not vulnerable and that imports would not be likely to increase upon the revocation of the orders \u2014 are mistaken. (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 69-74.) Joint Plaintiffs argue that the ITC cannot rely on a conclusion that the foreign producers (i.e., producers from Australia, France, Japan and Canada) currently exhibit a \u201clack of interest\u201d in the market because the orders have imposed discipline on them. <em>(Id.) </em>Pointing to the foreign producers\u2019 aberrant behavior from <em>before </em>the orders were imposed (back in 1991-1992, where cumulated imports increased by 22%), Joint Plaintiffs aver that the foreign producers will flood the U.S. market with imports. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1457-6\">Joint Plaintiffs and USS also argue that the ITC ignores evidence showing that the great advances made by the domestic industry\u2014 i.e., restructurings and consolidations \u2014 during the POR \u201chave been steadily eroding as a result of rapidly increasing raw material and energy costs. <em>(Id. </em>at 70-71, n.18; USS Br. at 53-55.) Joint Plaintiffs evoke comparisons to the first review where the industry\u2019s operating margins had declined to 5.9% in 1999 (from 10.5% in 1997) to current <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1438\">*1438</page-number>trends where the \u201coperating margin[s] declined from 10.8 percent in 2004 to 4.9 percent in 2005, and from 7.6 percent in [the] first half [of] 2005 to 5.2 percent for [the] first half [of] 2006.\u201d (Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 71.) \u201cNowhere,\u201d Joint Plaintiffs contend, does the Commission \u201cexplain this apparent inconsistency.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1458-6\">Finally, Joint Plaintiffs and USS also argue that varying assertions in the ITC\u2019s determination regarding the impact of sales to the auto industry on prices \u2014 such as \u201cmajor U.S. suppliers to the auto industry were able to negotiate higher contract prices...a positive sign\u201d\u2014 are incorrect and, as expressed by AK Steel, \u201ccontrary to the clearly expressed desire of the [auto producers] to use revocation of relief to negotiate lower prices from the domestic CORE producers.\u201d (USS Br. at 51; AK Steel Reply Br. at 20; <em>see also </em>Joint Pl.\u2019s Br. at 73-74; USS Br. at 51-52; AK Steel Reply Br. at 14-20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-7\">\n<em>b. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-8\">This Court agrees with the ITC that the arguments by Nucor/SDI, USS, and AK Steel<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> amount to little more than an inappropriate attempt \u201cto persuade this Court to re-weigh the evidence on vulnerability.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> (ITC Resp. Br. at 60.) The Court finds that the Commission carefully evaluated the ample record evidence as a whole and reasonably concluded that the industry was no longer vulnerable. <em>See </em>2007 Commission Views at 136-39, 142-43 (C.R. 831). The various arguments proffered by Nucor/SDI, USS, and AK Steel that challenge the ITC\u2019s vulnerability determination, have been considered<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and are found to be meritless because none of the plaintiffs have demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1439\">*1439</page-number>strated that the ITC\u2019s impact and vulnerability determinations lacked \u201c[a] rational connection between the facts found and the choice <em>made.\u201d Burlington Truck Lines, Inc., </em>371 U.S. at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-4\">For example, USS argues that improvements to the domestic industry cited by the ITC as proof of its healthy state are to be expected with the discipline of the orders in place. (USS Br. at 50.) However, USS\u2019s contention here misses the point. The Commission found that, although the domestic industry benefitted from the orders, the domestic industry\u2019s improvements \u2014 restructuring and shedding legacy costs \u2014 indicated a more permanent change, <em>i.e., </em>\u201ca more efficient and cost effective industry,\u201d that would not be reversed absent the orders. 2007 Commission Views at 136 n.849 (C.R. 831).</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-5\">Regarding arguments directed towards the operating margins, the ITC found that overall, the industry was healthy. 2007 Commission Views at 123, 136-39 (C.R. 831). Moreover, the ITC pointed out that \u201c[t]he industry\u2019s operating margin improved from negative or flat during the beginning of the review period to 10.8 percent in 2004 and remained positive at 4.9 percent in 2005 and 5.2 percent in interim 2006.\u201d (ITC Resp. Br. at 61.) Joint Plaintiff\u2019s assertion that the ITC ignored evidence showing the \u201ceroding\u201d advances made by the domestic industry post-restructuring in declining operating margins, is inconsequential. First, the ITC is \u201cpresumed to have considered all of the evidence on the record\u201d and \u201cis not required to explicitly address every piece of evidence presented by the <em>parties Nucor Corp., </em>28 CIT at 234, 318 F. Supp.2d at 1247 (citation omitted). Next, having considered this evidence, as well as other economic data, the ITC nevertheless concluded that the domestic industry was not vulnerable. 2007 Commission Views at 136-39 (C.R. 831). As a result, this Court will not upset this determination at the urging of plaintiffs. <em>See Comm. for Fair Beam Imports, 477 </em>F. Supp.2d at 1326 (\u201c[I]t is not the province of the Court to reweigh the evidence before the agency.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-6\">Considering all the arguments made by Nucor/SDI, USS, and AK Steel with respect to Australia, France, Japan and Canada, this Court finds that plaintiffs/plaintiff-intervenors have failed to demonstrate that the ITC\u2019s impact analysis and vulnerability determination was not supported by substantial evidence or otherwise in accordance with law. Therefore, this Court affirms the ITC\u2019s impact analysis and vulnerability determination applicable to Australia, France, Japan and Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b1459-7\">2. <em>Germany &amp; Korea</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1459-8\">The ITC determined that the likely significant volumes of subject imports from Germany and Korea would have a significant negative impact on the domestic industry if the orders were revoked. 2007 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1440\">*1440</page-number>Commission Views at 148 (C.R. 831). The Commission found that though the domestic CoRe steel market \u201cis stronger and better able to handle the vicissitudes\u201d of the CoRe steel market, \u201cit is not impervious to the effects of significant quantities of aggressively priced import supplies.... The combined negative effect on the industry as a whole would be significant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1460-4\">The ITC also incorporated its earlier domestic industry vulnerability finding and found it applicable to its determinations on Germany and Korea. <em>Id. </em>Notwithstanding its impact determination, the ITC found that the domestic industry was not vulnerable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1460-5\">\n<em>a. Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-6\">German Plaintiffs attack the ITC\u2019s likely impact determination as unreasonable due to the finding that the domestic industry was not vulnerable. (German PI. Br. at 42-43 <em>(citing Calabrian Corp. v. U.S. Int\u2019l Trade Comm\u2019n, </em>16 CIT 342, 354-355, 794 F. Supp 377, 388-389 (1992) (\u201c[Hjolding that there was substantial evidence for the Commission\u2019s negative preliminary injury determination in light of the fact that a robust industry is less likely to become materially injured in the near future.\u201d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-7\">\n<em>b. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-8\">This Court finds German Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge unavailing. First, <em>Calabrian Corp. </em>is not binding on this Court nor applicable since it concerned an investigation rather than a sunset review. Second, this Court has held that a finding that the domestic industry is not currently vulnerable is not a dispositive determination and does not preclude the ITC from finding that the domestic industry would be negatively impacted upon the revocation of an order. <em>See, e.g., Nevinnomysskiy Azof v. United States, </em>31 CIT _, _, 2007 WL 2563571, at *16 n.22 (2007) (finding that where the domestic industry is not currently vulnerable \u201cdoes not preclude an affirmative determination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-11\">In accordance with 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(l)(c), the ITC properly considered the condition of the domestic industry in its impact analysis. <em>See </em>2007 Commission Views at 145-46 (PR. 940). Accordingly, this Court rejects the challenges by German Plaintiffs, and holds that the ITC\u2019s likely impact and vulnerability determinations were reasonable exercises of its discretion, supported by substantial evidence and are otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1441\">*1441</page-number>E. The ITC Was Not Required to Apply a Bratsk Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-4\">This Court now turns to one final issue: the propriety of an analysis pursuant to <em>Bratsk Aluminum Smelter </em>in the ITC\u2019s sunset review. <em>See Bratsk Aluminum Smelter v. United States, </em>444 F.3d 1369, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-5\">1.. <em>Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"APE5\">\n<em>a. German Plaintiffs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-6\">German Plaintiffs contend that the ITC\u2019s impact determination was unreasonable because the Commission failed to consider the potential adverse impact of non-subject imports on the CoRe steel market \u2014 an analysis that the CAFC required by way of its decision in <em>Bratsk Aluminum Smelter, </em>444 F.3d at 1373. (German Pl. Br. at 43-46.) Moreover, counsel for German Plaintiffs argue that this Court should follow the recent decision of this court holding that a <em>Bratsk </em>analysis must be considered as part of a sunset review when certain triggering factors are met. Oral Argument, Nov. 5, 2008; <em>see NSK Corp. v. United States, </em>32 CIT _, _, 577 F.Supp.2d 1322 (2008) (Barzilay, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-7\">German Plaintiffs argue that the CAFC requires the Commission to \u201c[u]ndertake additional vulnerability and causation analysis [sic] involving imports not subject to the order in issue when they (1) consist of commodity products and (2) are price competitive, having a significant presence in the U.S. market.\u201d (German Pl.\u2019s Br. at 43 (footnote omitted).) German Plaintiffs argue that these numerated elements are present in this case, variously referring them as \u201ctriggering factor [s] ,\u201d \u201ccomponent[s],\u201d and \u201cprong[s] .\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at 43-45.) Consequently, they argue that <em>Bratsk </em>requires the ITC to conduct a \u201creplacement/benefit test,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>determine whether non-subject imports, sold at lower prices, even if fairly traded, would replace subject imports when an antidumping duty order is in place. <em>(Id. </em>at 42-44 <em>(citing Bratsk, </em>444 F.3d at 1373, 1374-75).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-8\">German Plaintiffs concede that the <em>Bratsk </em>case itself involved a material injury investigation, which involves a different type of procedure than the sunset review in this case. Nevertheless, German Plaintiffs advocate for application of a <em>Bratsk </em>analysis, reasoning that the same issues \u201cconcerning the effect of subject imports versus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1442\">*1442</page-number>non-subject imports applies in sunset reviews.\u201d (German PL\u2019s Br. at 44.) Sunset reviews, they argue, require a causation analysis, much like injury investigations. <em>(Id.) </em>This causation analysis must determine \u201cwhether revocation of an order \u2018would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury\u2019 albeit within a prospective, counterfactual context.\u201d <em>(Id.(citing </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(l)) (emphasis omitted)) The German Plaintiffs stress that extending <em>Bratsk </em>would mean that the ITC may issue an affirmative determination in a sunset review only when the evidence shows that the subject imports \u2014 and not other non-subject imports \u2014 are likely to adversely affect the domestic industry in the reasonably foreseeable future. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1462-4\">German Plaintiffs contend that all of the <em>Bratsk </em>triggering factors are present in this sunset review. When the ITC decided to cumulate German and Korean subject imports, they argue, that determination swept up \u201ccommodity grades\u201d of CoRe steel, which triggered the first <em>Bratsk </em>factor. <em>(Id.) </em>German Plaintiffs also argue that the second <em>Bratsk </em>factor was implicated by the ITC\u2019s concession that price-competitive CoRe steel non-subject imports had a significant presence in the U.S. (See <em>id. </em>at 45 <em>(citing </em>2007 Commission Views at 126 (C.R. 831)).) Having met the qualifying <em>Bratsk </em>factors, German Plaintiffs <em>argue, </em>the ITC should have recognized the significance of record evidence indicating that the volume of non-subject CoRe steel during the POR exceeded the volume of subject CoRe steel imports. (Id.) Consequently, German Plaintiffs claim that the ITC erred due to its failure to account for the \u201csubstantial effect of non-subject imports\u201d in its conclusions on Germany and Korea. (Id. at 46 <em>(citing Nevinnomysskiy, </em>31 CIT at _, 2007 WL 2563571, at *14-15 (remand ordered in a sunset review where Commission failed to explain why subject imports would depress certain commodity prices when the non-subject imports had not done so)).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-7\">\n<em>b.

United States, </em>542 F.3d 867 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1443\">*1443</page-number>together, <em>Bratsk </em>and <em>Mittal Steel </em>explain how the ITC is to make its causation determination in final phase investigations of certain an-tidumping cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-4\">The Commission\u2019s statutory requirement during a final phase investigation includes an obligation to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1463-5\">make a final determination of whether \u2014 (A) an industry in the United States \u2014 (i) is materially injured, or (ii) is threatened with material injury...by reason of [dumped] imports.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADIs\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(b)(l) (2000). The CAFC has stated that <em>Bratsk </em>clarifies the ITC\u2019s statutory duty to determine whether injury to the domestic industry has occurred \u201cby reason of\u201d subject imports, in cases where certain triggering factors exist. <em>Mittal Steel, </em>542 F.3d at 876. In such cases, the Commission must consider whether the subject imports are the \u201cbut for\u201d cause of injury to the domestic industry. <em>Id. </em>The triggering factors are present \u201cwhere commodity products are at issue and fairly traded, price competitive, non-subject imports are in the market.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 878 <em>(quoting Bratsk, </em>444 F.3d at 1369). In establishing this rule, the CAFC was concerned that the Commission might incorrectly attribute the domestic producers\u2019 injury to the subject imports where in fact the injury is actually the result of highly similar non-subject imports. This is likely to happen when there are substantial quantities of competitively-priced, interchangeable, non-subject imports present in the domestic market. <em>Id. </em>at 878. The analytical framework of <em>Bratsk </em>/ <em>Mittal Steel </em>is designed to hedge against such misallocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-9\">By way of background, in <em>Gerald Metals, Inc. v. United States, </em>132 F.3d 720 (Fed. Cir. 1997), the predecessor case to Bratsk,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> the CAFC found that the Commission had made exactly this error in its final phase investigation \u2014 failing to appropriately consider the role of non-subject imports before issuing an affirmative injury determination. The CAFC there concluded that, not only was there an abundance of non-subject imports in the market, but the subject imports and non-subject (fairly traded) imports \u201cwere perfect substitutes for each other, if not the exact same product.\u201d <em>Gerald Metals, </em>132 F.3d at 720. Moreover, these non-subject imports \u201cundersold the domestic product almost as frequently as did LTFV imports.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 718. Under these circumstances, the CAFC held that the ITC had failed to consider an important aspect of the causation question, in that the Commission failed to even mention the fairly-traded non-subject imports in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1444\">*1444</page-number>injury analysis.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 723. On remand, the Commission reconsidered its decision in light of the instructions to consider directly the role of non-subject imports in injuring the domestic industry, and in so doing reached a negative injury determination, which was sustained by the CIT. <em>See Gerald Metals, Inc. v. United States, </em>22 CIT 1009, 27 F. Supp.2d 1351 (1998) (remand determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-4\">In <em>Bratsk, </em>the CAFC extended the requirement of <em>Gerald Metals. </em>This case also involved a large number of price-competitive, interchangeable non-subject imports. <em>Bratsk, </em>444 F.3d at 1371. In its injury analysis here, however, the Commission had given direct consideration to the role those non-subject imports played in injuring the domestic industry. While the ITC decided non-subject imports may have injured the domestic industry, it nevertheless concluded that the dumped merchandise had made its own \u201cmaterial adverse impact on the domestic industry,\u201d and proceeded to issue an affirmative injury determination. <em>Silicon Metal from Russia, </em>U.S. Int\u2019l Trade Comm\u2019n Pub. 3584, Inv. No. 731-TA-991 at 19 (March 2003) (Final); <em>see also Bratsk, </em>444 F.3d at 1372. When the CAFC decided <em>Bratsk, </em>it found, as it had in <em>Gerald Metals, </em>that the ITC still had not adequately considered the role of non-subject imports in causing injury. <em>Bratsk, </em>444 F.3d at 1372, 1375.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-5\"><em>Mittal Steel </em>has now clarified<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> that <em>Bratsk </em>explains how the ITC can satisfy the requirement to consider the impact of non-subject imports in those situations where these triggering factors exist.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> It does so by explaining what the Commission must do before it issues an affirmative injury determination in such cases. Namely, in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1445\">*1445</page-number>find that subject imports are the cause of injury to the domestic industry, the ITC must first conclude that they are the \u201cbut for\u201d cause of that injury. <em>Mittal Steel, </em>542 F.3d at 876. According to <em>Mittal Steel, </em>once the ITC determines that subject imports are the \u201cbut for\u201d cause of injury to the domestic industry, it may be confident that it has not committed the same error that was litigated in <em>Gerald Metals </em>and <em>Bratsk </em>\u2014 i.e., failing to sufficiently consider the role of abundant, interchangeable, price-competitive non-subject imports in causing injury to the domestic industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-4\"><em>Mittal Steel </em>also spells out how the Commission is to complete the \u201cbut for\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> causation analysis \u2014 by asking \u201cwhether non-subject or non-LTFV imports would have replaced LTFV subject imports during the period of investigation without a continuing benefit to the domestic industry.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 878. If the ITC finds that the domestic industry would not have been better off in the absence of the dumped goods, this would weigh against a finding that the domestic industry\u2019s injury is \u201cby reason of\u201d the LTFV goods. <em>See Bratsk, </em>444 F.3d at 1373; <em>Mittal Steel, </em>542 F.3d at 876. <em>Mittal Steel </em>acknowledges that such a determination is \u201cnot necessarily dispositive\u201d on the overall issue of causation under the antidumping laws, but is an indispensable component of the causation analysis when the triggering factors are met. <em>Mittal Steel, </em>542 F.3d at 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-5\">The Court now turns to the implications of <em>Bratsk /Mittal Steel </em>in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1446\">*1446</page-number>3. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1466-4\"><em>a. When is the </em>Bratsk <em>analysis required?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1466-5\">The <em>Bratsk </em>ruling was issued in a case reviewing the ITC\u2019s final phase investigation in an antidumping case. <em>Bratsk, </em>444 F.3d at 1371-72. Consequently, on its face, the ruling does not speak to the applicability of the analysis to any other type of Commission decision, such as preliminary phase investigations or five-year review (sunset) investigations. The specific question raised by the German Plaintiffs in this case is whether this Court should extend the requirements of <em>Bratsk </em>to include sunset reviews where the triggering factors are present. (German Pl.\u2019s Br. at 43-46; German Pl\u2019s Reply Br. at 20-24.) The answer is no. While there were some ambiguities in the <em>Bratsk </em>opinion that arguably suggested a far-reaching analysis, the CAFC in <em>Mittal Steel, </em>clearly narrowed its holding; <em>Bratsk </em>is a mere complement to the statute governing final phase investigations.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(b)(l); <em>Mittal Steel, </em>542 F.3d at 878-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-6\">The <em>Bratsk /Mittal Steel </em>analysis is designed to augment the Commission\u2019s determination in a final phase investigation. In a final phase investigation, the Commission is required to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1466-7\">make a final determination of whether \u2014 (A) an industry in the United States \u2014 (i) is materially injured, or (ii) is threatened with material injury...by reason of [dumped] imports.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1466-8\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(b)(l) (2000). Referring to this statutory command, the CAFC determined that a \u201cbut for\u201d causation analysis is \u201ca proper part of the Commission\u2019s responsibility to determine whether the injury to the domestic industry is \u2018by reason of\u2019 the subject imports.\u201d <em>Mittal Steel, </em>542 F.3d at 877 <em>(quoting </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(b)(l)). In other words, <em>Mittal Steel </em>explicitly links the <em>Bratsk </em>analysis with the final phase investigation statute, supporting a strong inference that the final phase investigation is the only context in which the <em>Bratsk /Mittal Steel </em>analysis should be applied.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1467-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1447\">*1447</page-number>\n<em>b. The Bratsk/Mittal Steel analysis is inapplicable to sunset reviews because of fundamental differences between sunset reviews and final phase investigations.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-4\">In order to complete a <em>Bratsk /Mittal Steel </em>analysis in a final phase dumping investigation, the Commission must have certain information at its disposal: specifically, data regarding the volume and price of subject and non-subject imports that were present in the market during the period of investigation, and data regarding the injury suffered by the domestic industry. <em>See id. </em>at 873-74. Once this information from the period of investigation is made part of the administrative record, it is readily available for the Commission to use in its injury analysis during a final phase investigation. Without such information, it would be impossible to complete the \u201cbut for\u201d causation analysis as it is envisioned by <em>Bratsk/Mittal Steel. Id. </em>at 876. The presence of this information in a final phase investigation represents a stark contrast with the scenario encountered by the Commission during a sunset review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-5\">In a sunset review, the Commission is required to determine,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1467-6\">whether revocation of the...antidumping duty order ... would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping...and of material injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1467-7\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(c)(1) (2000); <em>see also, </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(l) (2000). Here, the Commission is concerned with the consequences of revoking an antidumping duty order in the reasonably foreseeable future, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1448\">*1448</page-number>not with whether the subject imports were the \u201cbut for\u201d cause of injury already suffered by the domestic industry. If the Commission was required to apply the <em>Bratsk </em>analysis in a sunset review, it would necessarily have to do so counter-factually,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> i.e., without any data on the price, volume, and effect of subject and non-subject imports that would possibly re-enter the market upon revocation of the antidump-ing duty order. Attempting to complete a <em>Bratsk </em>analysis under such conditions would be predicated upon conjecture and speculation. It would therefore be untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-4\">Moreover, <em>Mittal Steel </em>unambiguously held that in a <em>Bratsk </em>analysis, \u201c[t]he focus of the inquiry is on the cause of injury in the past....\u201d <em>Mittal Steel, </em>542 F.3d at 876 (emphasis added). In other words, in keeping faith with 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(b), the <em>Bratsk/Mittal Steel </em>analysis requires a strictly retrospective assessment of what has happened during the period of investigation, prior to the imposition of an antidumping order. This Court concludes that this retrospective language is not incidental \u2014 i.e., a mere coincidence of the fact that both <em>Bratsk </em>and <em>Mittal Steel </em>were brought in the context of final phase investigations \u2014 but rather is essential to the character of the \u201cbut for\u201d analysis that this line of cases requires. <em>See </em>discussion <em>supra </em>Part II.E.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-5\">Even if there is, .arguably, an implied element of causation in a 'sunset review determination <em>(see supra </em>n.39), and even if, arguably, the Commission could overcome the void of information with which to conduct a \u201cbut for\u201d analysis in a sunset review, nothing in the sunset review statute suggests that a <em>Bratsk </em>type review is required. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(c)(1) (2000); <em>see also </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(l) (2000). The <em>Bratsk </em>type analysis has no role in the prospective (i.e., \u201ccounter-factual\u201d) determination of the sunset review. Accordingly, in light of the foregoing analysis, this Court holds that the extension of the <em>Bratsk </em>type analysis to sunset reviews, as German Plaintiffs advocate, is not appropriate. This Court further holds that a <em>Bratsk </em>type analysis was not required in this sunset review, and holds that the ITC\u2019s determination was reasonable, supported by substantial evidence on the record, and was otherwise in accordance with law. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(i) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-6\">c. <em>The Commission is not, by virtue of this holding, entitled to ignore the role of non-subject imports during a sunset review if such imports are \u201crelevant economic factors.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1468-7\">This Court declines to extend the requirements of a <em>Bratsk </em>type analysis to sunset reviews, because the specific analysis required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1449\">*1449</page-number><em>Bratsk </em>is limited to its stated purpose and scope \u2014 that is, to help ensure that the ITC has not overlooked injurious non-subject imports when reaching an affirmative injury determination in a final phase investigation. Nevertheless, this holding should not be read to provide the Commission license to unilaterally disregard data related to non-subject imports during a sunset review,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> if it finds that such imports are a \u201crelevant economic factor[ ]\u201d to its determination. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1675a(a)(2), (4) (2000). For instance, the Commission may be presented with data on non-subject imports that entered the market at some point prior to the sunset review, whether during the period of review, while the discipline of the order was in place, or during the period of investigation, before the order was imposed. To the extent that such data is a \u201crelevant economic factor\u201d to the ITC\u2019s sunset review determination, it may not be ignored. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1469-4\">This requirement to consider relevant economic factors is an essential portion of the sunset review statute. When \u201cevaluating the likely volume of imports of the subject merchandise if the order is revoked,\u201d the statute provides that \u201cthe Commission shall consider all relevant economic factors. \u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(2) (2000) (emphasis added). Similarly, \u201cin evaluating the likely impact of imports of the subject merchandise on the industry...the Commission shall consider all relevant economic factors which are likely to have a bearing on the state of the industry in the United States.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(4) (2000) (emphasis added). In light of these statutory requirements, this Court does not expect that its holding will permit the ITC to ignore any significant factors during a sunset review.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> To be sure, it would be an abuse of discretion for the ITC to ignore such important factors if they were relevant. <em>See Motor Vehicle Mfrs.
