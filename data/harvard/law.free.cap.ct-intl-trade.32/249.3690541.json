(collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d), domestic producers of stainless steel butt-weld pipe fittings, move for judgment upon the agency record and challenge the final results of a periodic annual review for the period of June 1, 2004 through May 31, 2005. <em>See Notice of Final Results and Final Rescission in Part of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review: Certain Stainless Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings From Taiwan, </em>71 Fed.

(\u201cTCI\u201d) (collectively \u201cTa Chen\u201d), participated in the underlying review and appear before the court as Defendant-Intervenor. Commerce issued its final determination on November 13, 2006, upholding the constructed export price (\u201cCEP\u201d) offset granted in the <em>Preliminary Results. </em>In finding that Ta Chen had cooperated in the review to the best of its ability, Commerce also declined to apply available adverse facts in its antidumping analysis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Administrative Review of Certain Stainless Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings From Taiwan; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review </em>(Dep\u2019t Commerce Nov. 13, 2006) <em>(\u201cDecision Memorandum\u201d), </em>Pub. R. Doc. (\u201cP.R. Doc.\u201d) 72 at 6, 8. The court finds that substantial evidence supports Commerce\u2019s negative affiliation findings, use of Ta Chen\u2019s financial statements, and award of a CEP offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">I. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">In 1993, Commerce issued an antidumping order on certain stainless steel butt-weld pipe fittings from Taiwan. <em>See Amended Final Determination and Antidumping Duty Order: Certain Welded Stainless Steel Butt-Weld Pipe and Tube Fittings from Taiwan, </em>58 Fed. Reg. 33,250 (Dep\u2019t Commerce June 16, 1993) (\u201cAD <em>Order\u201d). </em>Subsequent to Ta Chen\u2019s request in June 2005, Commerce initiated an administrative review for the period of June 1, 2004 through May 31, 2005. <em>Preliminary Results, </em>71 Fed. Reg. at 39,663; <em>see </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">In response to Commerce\u2019s antidumping questionnaire of August 1, 2005, Ta Chen reported that it was affiliated with twelve companies. <em>See </em>Confidential R. Doc. (\u201cC.R. Doc.\u201d) 1, Ex. 4 &amp; 4A; <em>Preliminary Results, </em>71 Fed. Reg. at 39,664. Plaintiffs, however, identified and alleged that Ta Chen was affiliated with thirty-seven additional companies. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1677(33), 1677a(b) &amp; 1677a(d)(l); Memorandum from Dep\u2019t of Commerce, <em>Stainless Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings from Taiwan: Petitioners\u2019 Allegations Regarding Ta Chen Stainless Pipe Co., Ltd. And Ta Chen International Corporation Affiliations </em>(Nov. 13, 2006) <em>(\u201cAllegations Memorandum\u201d), </em>C.R. Doc. 32 at 2-3. Of the thirty-seven alleged Ta Chen affiliates named in the <em>Allegations Memorandum, </em>Plaintiffs re-identified thirty companies from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>previous administrative review in which Commerce already had made negative affiliation determinations for all alleged affiliates. <em>See Allegations Memorandum, </em>at 2; Memorandum from Dep\u2019t of Commerce, <em>Stainless Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings from Taiwan: Petitioners\u2019 Allegations Regarding Ta Chen Affiliations </em>(June 30, 2005) <em>(\u2018Affiliations Memorandum\u201d), </em>C.R. Doc. 32. Commerce found that Plaintiffs had \u201cprovided no new compelling evidence\u201d that the thirty companies from the previous review were affiliated with Ta Chen, thereby rendering an affiliation analysis unnecessary. <em>Allegations Memorandum, </em>at 2. For the seven newly identified companies, Commerce found that they were not involved with the subject merchandise and thereforenot affiliated with Ta Chen for purposes of evaluating dumping margins. <em>Id. </em>at 3-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">Ta Chen also provided Commerce with its consolidated financial statements, as well as the financial statements and annual reports of its subsidiary, TCI. P.R. Doc. 7 at A-18. Ta Chen\u2019s 2004 consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) of the Republic of China, contained financial information from each of Ta Chen Taiwan\u2019s subsidiaries, including TCI, and identified ten related parties. C.R. Doc. 17 at Ex. A &amp; B; P.R. Doc. 7 at Ex. 11 &amp; 13. TCI\u2019s 2003 financial statements, prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, identified three related parties. C.R. Doc. 1 at Ex. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Plaintiffs challenged the accuracy of Ta Chen\u2019s submissions, claiming that TCI violated U.S. GAAP by failing to disclose all of its related parties and significant related-party transactions in its financial statements, and that by extension, Ta Chen\u2019s consolidated financial statements were an inaccurate and unreliable benchmark. PL Br. 8. Commerce ultimately found that TCI did not have to disclose as \u201crelated parties\u201d the companies that Plaintiffs identified, and consequently accepted TCI\u2019s financial statements as reliable benchmarks for Commerce\u2019s dumping calculations. <em>Decision Memorandum, </em>at 6-7. -</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">In the <em>Preliminary Results, </em>Commerce assigned an antidumping duty margin of 0.79% <em>ad valorem </em>on certain stainless steel butt-weld pipe fittings. <em>See Preliminary Results, </em>71 Fed. Reg. at 39,666. Following comments by the parties, Commerce published its <em>Final Results </em>and affirmed its assignment of a 0.79% <em>ad valorem </em>dumping margin. <em>See Final Results, </em>71 Fed. Reg. at 67,099. Commerce found that Ta Chen\u2019s home market sales were at a more advanced LOT than its U.S. sales, based on Ta Chen\u2019s narrative descriptions depicting its selling functions in its home and U.S. market, and thus granted Ta Chen a CEP offset to NV. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1677b(a)(7)(B); <em>Decision Memorandum, </em>at 10-11; Ta Chen Section A Resp. (September 21, 2005), C.R. Doc. 1 at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>A-13 to -14. In support of its conclusion, Commerce stated that Ta Chen: (1) \u201c[had] more market customers who purchase in smaller volumes than TCI and require more individual contacts\u201d; (2) had a \u201clarger sales staff devoted to home market sales\u201d; (3) \u201cassumes credit risk and provides technical services only for its home market sales\u201d; and (4) provided \u201cjust-in-time delivery requiring a higher level of inventory maintenance only for home market sales.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">A. Review of Determinations</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">This court must \u201csustain \u2018any determination, finding or conclusion found\u2019 by Commerce unless it is \u2018unsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u2019\u201d <em>Fujitsu Gen. Ltd. v. United States, </em>88 F.3d 1034, 1038 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (quoting 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)). Substantial evidence denotes \u201csuch relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support the conclusion.\u201d <em>Consolo v. Fed. Mar. Comm\u2019n, </em>383 U.S. 607, 619-20 (1966) (quotations &amp; citation omitted). Although \u201cthe possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence\u201d may exist, that possibility, in itself \u201cdoes not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s findings from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">B. Review of Statutory Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">In reviewing the lawfulness of an agency\u2019s construction of a statute, the court \u201cmust first carefully investigate the matter to determine whether Congress\u2019s purpose and intent on the question at issue is judicially ascertainable.\u201d <em>Timex V.I., Inc. v. United States, </em>157 F.3d 879, 881 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (citing <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43 &amp; n.9 (1984)). The court reaches the issue of <em>Chevron </em>deference only if it concludes, after its investigation, that \u201cCongress either had no intent on the matter, or that Congress\u2019s purpose and intent regarding the matter is ultimately unclear.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>The Federal Circuit has held that \u201cstatutory interpretations articulated by Commerce during its antidumping proceedings are entitled to judicial deference under <em>Chevron.\u201d Pesquera Mares Austales Ltda. v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1372, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2001). If <em>Chevron </em>deference is warranted, a court errs by substituting \u201cits own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by [Commerce].\u201d <em>IPSCO, Inc. v. United States, </em>965 F.2d 1056, 1061 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (quoting <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc., </em>467 U.S. at 844)). Moreover, \u201cdeference may vary with circumstances,\u201d and thus, when granting <em>Chevron </em>deference, the court looks to \u201cthe degree of the agency\u2019s care, its consistency, formality, and relative expertness, and to the persuasiveness of the agency\u2019s position.\u201d <em>Crawfish Processors Alliance v. United States, 477 </em>F.3d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"ADX\">A. Affiliated Party Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">In making a CEP and CEP offset determinations during an anti-dumping duty margin calculation, Commerce must take affiliated party transactions into account. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1677(33), 1677a(b) &amp; 1677a(d)(l). Section 1677(33) defines \u201caffiliated\u201d or \u201caffiliated persons\u201d as those who are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">(A) Members of a family, including brothers and sisters (whether by whole or half blood), spouse, ancestors, and lineal descendants;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">(B) Any officer or director of an organization and such organization;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">(C) Partners;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-9\">(D) Employer and employee;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-10\">(E) Any person directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding with power to vote, 5 percent or more of the outstanding voting stock or shares of any organization and such organization;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-11\">(F) Two or more persons directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, any person; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-12\">(G) Any person who controls any other person and such other person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number><em>Id. </em>In addition, \u201ca person shall be considered to control another person if the person is legally or operationally in a position to exercise restraint or direction over the other person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The regulations further provide that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-4\">in determining whether control over another person exists . . . , [Commerce] will consider the following factors, among others: corporate or family groupings; franchise or joint venture agreements; debt financing; and close supplier relationships. [Commerce] will not find that control exists on the basis of these factors unless the relationship has the potential to impact decisions concerning the production, pricing, or cost of the subject merchandise or foreign like product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-5\"><em>Ta Chen Stainless Steel Pipe Co. v. United States, </em>Slip Op. 07-87, 2007 WL 1573920, at *15 (May 30, 2007) (not reported in F. Supp.) <em>(\u201cTa Chen IF) </em>(quoting 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.102(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">1. Subject Merchandise Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Plaintiffs argue that Commerce must follow a \u201cthree step protocol\u201d to examine a respondent\u2019s affiliated parties, the first of which requires a respondent to \u201cdisclose all of its affiliated parties at the outset of the investigation or review, regardless of their level of involvement or not with the subject merchandise or foreign like product.\u201d PI. Br. 15. However, the Trade Act of 1930, as amended 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1671-1677n (2000 &amp; Supp. 2005) (\u201cthe Act\u201d), is silent with respect to the methods and procedures that Commerce must employ in obtaining information about potential affiliates and therefore does not require Commerce to undertake the \u201cthree step protocol\u201d suggested by Plaintiffs. Moreover, because the statute does not require specific methods and procedures, the court must defer to Commerce\u2019s methods for obtaining affiliated party information so long as they are consistent with a permissible construction of the statute. <em>See Chevron U.S.A., Inc., </em>467 U.S. at 843-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Furthermore, there is an inherent \u201csubject merchandise\u201d requirement throughout the antidumping statute and accompanying regulations that limits Commerce\u2019s affiliation determinations to only those companies that deal with, or have an effect on, the subject merchandise at issue in the antidumping investigation. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1673-1673(i) &amp; 1677(33); 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.102(b). For example, when determining injury, Commerce examines whether there is a reasonable indication that a domestic industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury \u201cby reason of imports of the <em>subject-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number><em>merchandise </em>1673b(a)(l) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Commerce must also limit its NV calculations to those transactions in which the foreign producer and its affiliates engaged in sales of the subject merchandise. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1677b. Indeed, the statute specifies the manner in which Commerce must calculate the \u201cnormal value of the <em>subject merchandise,\u201d </em>and requires that Commerce address whether the <em>\u201csubject merchandise </em>is being, or is likely to be, sold at less than fair value_\u201d \u00a7 1677b(a) &amp; (a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Similarly, the regulations applicable to \u00a7 1677(33) also require that an affiliated party deal in the subject merchandise at issue. Specifically, \u00a7 351.102(b) states that \u201c[t]he Secretary will not find that control exists on the basis of these factors unless the relationship has the potential to impact decisions concerning the production, pricing, or cost of the <em>subject merchandise or foreign like product.\u201d </em>\u00a7 351.102(b) (emphasis added). This Court has found that \u00a7 351.102(b) is a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">\u201creasonable [agency] interpretation\u201d of section 1677(33)\u2019s requirement that control exists only when a person considered to control another person be \u201clegally or operationally in a position to exercise restraint or direction over the other person\u201d whereby control over another exists only when \u201cthe relationship has the potential to impact decisions concerning the production, pricing, or cost of the subject merchandise or foreign like product.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-7\"><em>Ta Chen II, </em>Slip Op. 07-87, 2007 WL 1573920, at *16 (quoting <em>TIJID, Inc. v. United States, </em>29 CIT _, __, 366 F.Supp.2d 1286, 1298 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">As the language of the Act and the regulations restrict antidumping reviews to cases where the foreign producer or affiliated parties deal in the subject merchandise, Commerce need not make a finding of affiliation for each company that does not actually sell the subject merchandise.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">2. Commerce\u2019s Affiliation Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">Plaintiffs claim that Commerce erred by concluding that petitioners must first show an alleged affiliate\u2019s involvement with the subject merchandise prior to an affiliation determination. PI. Br. 17-18. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Based on the Act\u2019s subject merchandise requirement, the court finds that Commerce did not err in its application of \u00a7 1677(33).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">During the administrative review, Commerce reviewed and made determinations regarding the affiliation status of the thirty-seven companies which Plaintiffs alleged were Ta Chen affiliates. <em>See Allegations Memorandum, </em>at 2-3; <em>Affiliations Memorandum, </em>C.R. Doc. 32. Commerce found that the seven companies newly identified by Plaintiffs did not meet the criteria of an affiliated party as set forth in \u00a7 1677(33), and gave the following reasons for each finding of non-affiliation. First, South Star Real Estate and Nirosteel, LLC, which allegedly shared a corporate officer with AMS North Carolina, are not affiliated with Ta Chen because AMS North Carolina was not a Ta Chen affiliate. Second, Ta Chen Enterprises is not an affiliate because familial ties between the management of the two companies are \u201cunclear,\u201d and because there is no evidence that Ta Chen Enterprise\u2019s involvement in real estate development affected the pricing or cost of either the subject merchandise or foreign like product. Third, G.M.T.S. International Co., Ltd. had no involvement with the subject merchandise because the company had been suspended since 1983. Fourth, J.K. Industries WH., Inc. did not share an officer with TCI and therefore was not affiliated with Ta Chen. Fifth, QDII and QFII were not in fact companies, but rather classes of investors under Taiwanese law entitled to invest directly in Taiwanese securities. As these two classes hold less than five percent of Ta Chen\u2019s shares, they are not affiliates under the statute. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1677(33)(E); <em>Allegations Memorandum, </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Instead of reviewing the affiliation status of the remaining thirty companies, Commerce incorporated its previous conclusions by reference because Plaintiffs failed to provide new evidence that would require Commerce to change its previous determination. Specifically, Commerce found no affiliation because: (1) certain companies were inactive,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> defunct,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> dissolved,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or suspended<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> ; (2) Ta Chen\u2019s interest was divested before the period of review;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (3) there was a lack of familial relationship as specified in \u00a7 1677(33)(A);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (4) there was lack of any relationship specified under \u00a7 1677(33);<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and (5) Ta Chen\u2019s relationship with the companies lacked the potential to affect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>production pricing, or cost of the subject merchandise.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Affiliations Memorandum, </em>at 3-10, 12-16. Because substantial evidence supports the conclusion that the thirty-seven companies named by Plaintiffs are not affiliated with Ta Chen, the court must defer to Commerce\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">B. TCI\u2019s Financial Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">1. U.S. GAAP Related Party Disclosures</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Plaintiffs contend that Commerce incorrectly concluded that Ta Chen\u2019s consolidated financial statements were reliable benchmarks for use in the antidumping analysis. Furthermore, Plaintiffs argue that U.S. GAAP requires two disclosures: (a) all significant related-party transactions, and (b) all related parties, regardless of whether there have been any related-party transactions during the reporting period. PL Br. 22-23. Based on this interpretation of the disclosure requirements, Plaintiffs argue that Commerce \u201cwrongly took license and created new accounting standards for related-party disclosures\u201d by focusing on \u201cwhether the domestic industry demonstrated \u2018an indisputable control relationship\u2019 that \u2018clearly could have resulted in significantly different financial results of the companies.\u2019\u201d PI. Br. 23. The court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Pursuant to the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards explaining U.S. GAAP for related party disclosures (SFAS No. 57), \u201cfinancial statements shall include disclosure of material related party transactions.\u201d <em>See Related Party Disclosures, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 57 </em>\u00b6 2 (Fin. Accounting Standards Bd. 2006), P.R. Doc. 20 Ex. 1. SFAS No. 57 defines \u201crelated parties\u201d as those with which \u201cthe enterprise may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other\u201d; those which \u201csignificantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties\u201d; and those who have \u201can ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>app. B(f) (emphasis added). SFAS No. 57 also states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>If the reporting enterprise and one or more other enterprises are under common ownership or management <em>control and the existence of that control </em>could result in operating results or financial position of the reporting enterprise <em>significantly different </em>from those that would have been obtained if the enterprise were autonomous, the nature of the <em>control relationship </em>shall be disclosed even though there are no transactions between the enterprises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><em>Id. </em>\u00b6 4 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">2. Commerce\u2019s Related Party Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">In its November 13, 2006 Memorandum on Ta Chen\u2019s related parties, Commerce analyzed twelve parties which Plaintiffs had identified as alleged related parties. <em>See </em>Memorandum from Dep\u2019t of Commerce, <em>Stainless Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings from Taiwan: Petitioners\u2019 Allegations Regarding Ta Chen Stainless Pipe Co., Ltd., and Ta Chen International (CA) Corporation Related Parties </em>(Nov. 13, 2006) <em>(\u201cRelated Parties Memorandum\u201d), </em>P.R. Doc. 69. Commerce evaluated two companies in a narrative format and found that Plaintiffs had not demonstrated that \u201ca <em>control relationship </em>existed between the companies that could have resulted in <em>significantly different </em>financial results during the [period of review].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3 (emphasis added). Of the remaining ten companies, Commerce concluded that none satisfied the criteria of \u201crelated parties\u201d under U.S. GAAP. <em>Id. </em>at 5-7. For seven companies in particular, Commerce noted that \u201c[a]n indisputable <em>control relationship </em>has not been demonstrated to exist such that the existence of that control clearly could have resulted in <em>significantly different </em>financial results of the companies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4-7 (emphasis added). In using phrases like \u201csignificantly different\u201d and \u201ccontrol relationship,\u201d Commerce\u2019s memorandum closely parallels the language in SFAS No. 57, and as such, the court finds that Commerce did not create \u201cunauthorized new standards\u201d as Plaintiffs allege, but rather, that Commerce applied U.S. GAAP in its analysis of Ta Chen\u2019s related party disclosures. <em>Id.', see </em>SFAS No. 57 \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Plaintiffs also question Commerce\u2019s reliance upon the auditor\u2019s opinion, which concluded that TCI\u2019s financial statements properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>disclosed all related parties and all significant related party transactions. PI. Br. 28. In this case, independent auditors reviewed TCI\u2019s 2004 financial statements and issued an \u201cunqualified opinion\u201d that the financial statements \u201cpresent fairly in all material respects the financial position of TCI as of December 31, 2004, ... in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted by the United States of America.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Decision Memorandum, </em>at 6. Citing paragraphs one, four, and twenty-one, Commerce concluded that \u201cinherent in SFAS [No.] 57 is a judgment element and the company does not need to disclose every relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. Commerce also explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-4\">in the context of assessing disclosures of affiliated parties in a financial statement prepared in accordance with financial accounting standards, a judgement as to whether or not a relationship should have been disclosed does not depend upon a factual finding, but <em>rather opinions as to whether the auditors\u2019 decisions about disclosure were reasonable. </em>This factor alone requires that there be <em>very strong record evidence </em>for [Commerce] to overturn the independent auditor\u2019s opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Because the record did not provide \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d to \u201creject the independent auditors\u2019 opinion and discredit the financial statements,\u201d Commerce properly relied on TCI\u2019s financial statements. <em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">This Court \u201chas consistently upheld Commerce\u2019s reliance on a firm\u2019s expenses as recorded in the firm\u2019s financial statements, as long as those statements were prepared in accordance with the home country\u2019s GAAP and do not significantly distort the firm\u2019s actual costs.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Ta Chen II, </em>Slip Op. 07-87, 2007 WL 1573920, at *15 (citing <em>FAG U.K. Ltd. v. United States, </em>20 CIT 1277, 1290, 945 F. Supp. 260, 271 (1996)). Moreover, \u201cCommerce is generally given the benefit of wide latitude in the verification procedure it chooses to implement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations &amp; citation omitted). Accordingly, based, on the record evidence, the court defers to Commerce\u2019s determination and holds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>that TCI\u2019s financial statements were accurate and reliable benchmarks for use in the antidumping analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">C. The Constructed Export Price Offset</p>\n<p id=\"APWs\">1. Legal Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Commerce calculates an antidumping duty rate by comparing the NV, i.e., home market price, of the subject merchandise in the foreign market and the \u201cexport price\u201d (\u201cEP\u201d) or CEP. <em>See Mittal Steel Galled S.A. v. United States, </em>31 CIT _, _, 502 F.Supp.2d 1295, 1297 (2007); <em>Fla. Citrus Mut. v. United States, </em>31 CIT _, _, 515 F.Supp.2d 1324, 1327 (2007). To calculate NV Commerce uses \u201cthe exporting market price (i.e., the market where the goods are produced), an appropriate third country market price, or the cost of production of the goods.\u201d <em>Ta Chen Stainless Steel Pipe, Ltd. v. United States, </em>28 CIT 627, 630, 342 F.Supp.2d 1191, 1194 (2004) <em>(\u201cTa Chen F). </em>Commerce establishes a NV \u201cto the extent practicable, at the same level of trade as the [EP] or [CEP].\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(l)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">LOT are defined as \u201cmarketing stages (or their equivalent),\u201d 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.412(c)(2), whereas EP or CEP reflect \u201cthe price at which the subject merchandise is first sold, or agreed to be sold, in the United States ... to a purchaser not affiliated with the producer or exporter . . .\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(b); <em>see Fla. Citrus Mut., </em>31 CIT at _, 515 F.Supp.2d at 1327. Commerce may make a LOT adjustment if it determines that \u201csales in the two markets were not made at the same [LOT], and that the difference has an effect on the comparability of the prices.\u201d \u00a7 351.412(a); <em>see </em>\u00a7 1677b(a)(7)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">Where Commerce calculates NV at a different LOT from the LOT of EP or the CEP (whichever applies), it may adjust NV to compensate for the difference. <em>See </em>\u00a7 351.412(b); <em>see also Mittal Steel USA, Inc. v. United States, </em>Slip Op. 07-117, 2007 WL 2701369, at *7 n.12 (2007) (stating that the level of trade adjustment is designed to ensure the NV and U.S. price are being compared at the same marketing stage.). Furthermore, Commerce makes a LOT adjustment to the NV if the difference in LOTs \u201cinvolves the performance of different selling activities\u201d and \u201cis demonstrated to affect price comparability, based on a pattern of consistent price differences between sales at different levels of trade in the country in which normal value is determined.\u201d \u00a7 1677b(a)(7)(A); <em>Mittal Steel USA, Inc., </em>Slip Op. 07-117, 2007 WL 2701369, at *8.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">When Commerce compares the NV to the CEP, however, it must also adjust the CEP figure \u201cin accordance with the statutory provisions set out in \u00a7 19 U.S.C. 1677a(c)-(d) to achieve a fair \u2018apples-to-apples\u2019 comparison between U.S. price and foreign market value \u2018at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>similar point in the chain of commerce.\u2019\u201d <em>Fla. Citrus Mut., </em>31 CIT at _, 515 F.Supp.2d at 1328 (citing <em>Torrington Co. v. United States, </em>68 F.3d 1347,1352 (Fed. Cir. 1995)). Where the NY is at a more advanced LOT than the CEP, and the available data do not permit a determination on whether the difference affects price comparability, Commerce may also make a CEP offset using indirect selling expenses in the home market. <em>See </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.412(f). In such cases,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">normal value shall be reduced by the amount of indirect selling expenses incurred in the country in which normal value is determined on sales of the foreign like product but not more than the amount of such expenses for which a deduction is made under section 1766a(d)(l)(D) of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\u00a7 1677b(a)(7)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">2. Ta Chen\u2019s Selling Activities</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">In its <em>Decision Memorandum, </em>Commerce found that \u201cthe LOT of home market sales is different from the LOT for Ta Chen\u2019s CEP sales, and that on balance the LOT is more advanced in the home market.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Decision Memorandum, </em>at 10. Because Commerce was also unable to quantify the effect of the difference in LOT on prices, it ultimately decided to continue granting Ta Chen a CEP offset. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">Plaintiffs challenge Commerce\u2019s CEP analysis and argue that the underlying review showed Ta Chen \u201cdid <em>not actually perform </em>activities related to addressing customer complaints and providing assistance.\u201d PI. Br. 34 (emphasis in original). Plaintiffs, however, misinterpret the record evidence, as the very document cited states, that: \u201c[a]s to home market sales, Ta Chen Taiwan technical services include . . . reviewing customer complaints as to fittings, including testing of the particular fitting\u2019s performance characteristics.\u201d Ta Chen Section B and C Resp. (Sep. 26, 2005), P.R. Doc. at B27-B28. In addition, Ta Chen Taiwan specified that \u201c[its] employees themselves perform these technical service functions. No outside workers are used,\u201d and that it \u201cdoes not do these technical services for the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at B-28. Thus, the record evidence supports Commerce\u2019s finding that the LOT of home market sales is more advanced than the LOT of the CEP sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Alternatively, Plaintiffs claim that the CEP offset analysis must consider <em>all </em>selling activities performed for unaffiliated U.S. customers up to the time of U.S. entry, and thus Commerce failed to consider \u201cTaiwanese insurance, Taiwanese inventory carrying costs, Taiwanese brokerage, marine insurance, Taiwanese banking expenses and packaging.\u201d PI. Br. 33; <em>see </em>\u00a7 351.412(c)(l)(ii). Commerce however, explicitly states that it \u201cexamined the selling activities reported for each channel of distribution and organized the reported selling activities into the following four selling functions: sales process and marketing support, freight and delivery, inventory maintenance and warehousing, and warranty and technical services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\"><em>Preliminary Results, </em>71 Fed. Reg. at 39,666. Therefore, even if Commerce did not specifically mention each and every selling function it analyzed, the selling activities specifically detailed in the <em>Decision Memorandum </em>correspond to one of the four categories enumerated in its July 2006 memorandum and indicate that Commerce did consider all major types of selling functions in its CEP offset analysis. <em>See supra </em>note 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Next, Plaintiffs claim that Commerce improperly compared the number of home market customers and United States customers, and that Commerce \u201cshould have considered the selling activities that were provided by Ta Chen Taiwan to the first unaffiliated U.S. Customer - not to Ta Chen Taiwan\u2019s U.S. affiliate, TCI . . . .\u201d PI. Br. 35. Nevertheless, Plaintiff\u2019s own submission cites to \u00a7 1677a(d), which requires that Commerce disregard certain U.S. selling expenses, such as U.S. commissions, credit expenses, guarantees, warranties, and generally, all expenses incurred in the U.S. by selling the subject merchandise, i.e., TCI\u2019s selling activities. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1677a(d)(l). In calculating the LOT of the CEP, Commerce considers only the selling activities reflected in the adjusted CEP. Although the CEP generally represents the price at which the subject goods are sold to the first unaffiliated purchaser, Commerce may, as it did here, reduce the CEP in accordance with \u00a7 1677a(c)-(d) to ensure an \u201capples-to-apples comparison.\u201d <em>See Fla. Citrus Mut., </em>31 CIT at _, 515 F.Supp.2d at 1328. Section 1677a(d)(l) requires Commerce to reduce the CEP by the amount of any of various expenses \u201cincurred by or for the account of the producer or exporter, <em>or the affiliated seller </em>in the United States, in selling the subject merchandise.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 1677a(d)(l). As a result, the adjusted CEP does not reflect certain expenses and profit relating to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>sales to unaffiliated U.S. purchasers. Therefore, contrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 claim, the adjusted CEP cannot, and does not, include TCI\u2019s selling activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the court holds that substantial evidence supports the final results of Commerce\u2019s antidumping determination. Accordingly, Plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment upon the agency record is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-7\"> In the <em>Preliminary Results, </em>Commerce found that: (1) the evidence on the record did not warrant a finding that it should disregard Ta Chen\u2019s financial statements, and thus contradicted Plaintiff\u2019s allegation of undisclosed related parties; and, (2) the normal value (\u201cNV\u201d) is established at a level of trade (\u201cLOT\u201d) that is at a more advanced stage of distribution than the LOT of the CEP transactions. <em>Preliminary Results, </em>71 Fed. Reg. at 39,664, 39,666. Because Commerce was unable to quantify a LOT adjustment, it subsequently applied a CEP offset to the NV-CEP comparisons in accordance with 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(7)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b272-9\"> <em>Chevron </em>review consists of a two-part inquiry. <em>See NTN Bearing Corp. of Am. v.

Therefore, even if the court had concluded that Commerce diverged somewhat from the language in SFAS No. 57, such a finding would not automatically render Commerce\u2019s reliance on the financial statements erroneous. Rather, the court would weigh the record evidence and determine whether substantial evidence supported Commerce\u2019s reliance. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b279-7\"> Plaintiffs concede that \u201can auditor\u2019s responsibility is limited to issuing an opinion on a company\u2019s financial statements.\u201d PL Br. 27.
