For the reasons that follow, the court denies plaintiff\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Navneet is an exporter of CLPSS from India. Compl. \u00b6 3. The subject CLPSS</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">are used primarily for taking notes and typically sold as school supplies. CLPSS encompass three main products: hole-punched filler paper, spiral-bound or wireless notebooks (with or without pockets and/or dividers), and composition books. Typically, the paper is lined with blue and/or red ink, wide ruled or college ruled, and white in color. The color of notebook and composition book covers varies from plain to those that display fashion graphics.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Final Determination at 3 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">On September 9, 2005, the Association<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed petitions with both the United States Department of Commerce (\u201cCommerce\u201d) and the ITC. Final Determination at 3. Following its investigations, Commerce determined that imports into the United States of CLPSS from India were being sold in the United States at less than fair value (\u201cLTFV\u201d or \u201cdumped\u201d) and also found that imports were subsidized by the government of India. <em>See </em>Certain Lined Paper Products from India, 71 Fed. Reg. 45,012 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Aug. 8, 2006) (notice of final determination of sales at less than fair value and negative determination of critical circumstances); Certain Lined Paper Products from India, 71 Fed.

Reg. 45,012), and for the period from April 1, 2004 through March 31, 2005 for subsidization (71 Fed. Reg. 45,034). At the conclusion of this investigation the Commissioners determined that \u201can industry in the United States is materially injured by reason of subject imports of CLPSS from India and Indonesia that are found to be subsidized, and by reason of subject imports of CLPSS from China, India, and Indonesia that are found to be sold in the United States at LTFV.\u201d Final Determination at 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">When reviewing an agency\u2019s final determination, the court will hold unlawful agency determinations, findings, or conclusions that are \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record or otherwise not in accordance with law....\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(i). \u201cAs long as the agency\u2019s methodology and procedures are reasonable means of effectuating the statutory purpose, and there is substantial evidence in the record supporting the agency\u2019s conclusions, the court will not impose its own views as to the sufficiency of the agency\u2019s investigation or question the agency\u2019s methodology.\u201d <em>Ceramica Regiomontana, S.A. v. United States, </em>10 CIT 399, 404-5, 636 F. Supp. 961, 966 (1986), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>810 F.2d 1137 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">I. Legal Framework: The ITC\u2019s Negligibility Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Under the unfair trade laws, Commerce determines whether foreign imports into the United States are either being dumped or subsidized (or both). It is for the ITC to determine whether these dumped or subsidized imports are causing material injury to a domestic industry in the United States. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1673(1) &amp; (2), 1671(a)(1) &amp; (2). If the Commission determines that imports from a particular country are negligible, however, it terminates its investigation without reaching the injury question. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1673b(a)(l) (preliminary dumping determination), 1673d(b)(l) (final dumping determination), 1671b(a)(l) (preliminary subsidization determination), 1671d(b)(l) (final subsidization determination). It is plaintiff\u2019s claim that this is what should have happened here.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Negligibility is addressed in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(24)(A), which provides that \u201cimports from a country of merchandise corresponding to a domestic like product identified by the Commission are \u2018negligible\u2019 if such imports account for less than 3 percent of the volume of all such merchandise imported into the United States\u201d during a defined twelve-month period<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in an antidumping or countervailing duty investigation. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(24)(A)(i). Importantly, in countervailing duty investigations involving merchandise from \u201cdeveloping countries,\u201d such as India, the imports will be found to be negligible if they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>account for less than four percent of the volume of all such merchandise imported into the United States.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(24)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">In computing import volumes for purposes of determining whether imports are negligible, \u201cthe Commission may make reasonable estimates on the basis of available statistics.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(24)(C); see <em>also </em>Uruguay Round Agreements Act Statement of Administrative Action, accompanying H.R. Rep. No. 103-316 656 835 (1994), reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3773, 4188 (recognizing that the \u201cCommission may not have access to either complete questionnaire data or official import statistics conforming exactly to the Commission\u2019s like product(s) designations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">II. The ITC\u2019s Negligibility Determination With Respect to Imports of CLPSS from India</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">A. The ITC\u2019s Use of a Quantity-Based Measure of Volume</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">In this investigation, the ITC used a quantity-based measure to determine the volume of Indian CLPSS imports for purposes of determining negligibility. Specifically, the ITC measured volume by \u201cunits\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or pieces, rather than using a value-based measure of volume, i.e., dollar value of imports. Final Determination at 19 n. 144. In doing so, the ITC explained that it typically uses quantity-based measures \u201cbecause value-based measures can be skewed by changes of product mix and the fact that, for subject imports, the unit values are of merchandise sold at LTFV.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, using a value-based measure could be distortive because of differences in the value of similar merchandise. For example, using a value-based measure, if some nations exported a small number of high value items to the United States, and others, such as the Indian exporters, sent a large number of low cost items to the United States, the lower cost Indian merchandise would make up a small percentage of the total imports. As a result, the value measurement would fail to accurately measure the high percentage volume (in terms of page count) of the lower cost merchandise that was being imported into the United States. A further distortion would occur when merchandise is being sold at LTFV, because that merchandise would necessarily represent an artificially lower percentage of all CLPSS, if measured by import value. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>of the potential for distortion when using value-based measures, quantity-based measurement is the ITC\u2019s standard practice, as both plaintiff and defendant acknowledge. <em>See </em>ITC\u2019s Opp\u2019n 2; Tr. Conf. Oral Argument (Jan. 4, 2008) at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">The ITC states that it departs from its usual practice only where \u201cthere are such great variations among the products involved that reliance on a quantity-based measure of volume would be fundamentally distortive.\u201d ITC\u2019s Opp\u2019n 2. In its Final Determination, the Commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">Although the Commission has relied principally on value-based measurements in rare instances, those investigations involved scope and/or domestic like product that were much larger than those present here. In those instances, measuring volume by units was particularly problematic, because value variations for different articles could differ by factors of as much as 100.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Final Determination at 19 n. 144. Thus, Commerce has relied heavily on price variation among the imported articles of merchandise as the determining factor when abandoning its usual practice. Put another way, in those cases where it has used value-based measures, there has been a great variety of products, and the value of the merchandise had variations of \u201cfactors of as much as 100.\u201d Final Determination at 19 n. 144 (citing, <em>inter alia, </em>Ball Bearings from China, Inv. No. 731-TA-989 (Final), USITC Pub. 3593 at 11 (Apr. 2003); Outboard Engines from Japan, Inv. No. 731-TA-1069 (Final), USITC Pub. 3752 at 24-27 &amp; n. 175 (Feb. 2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Plaintiff, however, insists that it fits within the exceptions made in previous ITC investigations. For Navneet, the sheer variety of in-scope<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> products makes its case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">At the hearing, the Commission was presented with samples and testimony by counsel for Indonesian and Indian respondents of 150 sheet filler paper packs, 500 sheet filler paper packs, 70 page one subject spiral notebooks, and 250 sheet five subject notebooks, 100 sheet composition books and 160 sheet composition books as well as an 800 page composition book. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Obviously, this was but a small demonstration of the variety of types and dimensions of products included with the scope of the investigations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Pl.\u2019s Mem. 10-11. Navneet also argues that its merchandise showed a variation in price that necessitated a value-based measurement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">Indeed, filler paper alone ranges from 30-count to 500-count, which is a substantial difference in weight. In addition, Public [sic] testimony at the Hearing, which included demonstrations and submissions of samples to the Secretary of the Commission, indicates that price is associated with the cost of the paper, which is the overwhelmingly most significant raw material by weight. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that significant differences in unit value indeed exist....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Pl.\u2019s Mem. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">In its Final Determination, the ITC stated that it would employ its normal methodology: \u201cConsistent with our customary practice, we have relied on quantity-based measures of volume in this investigation.\u201d Final Determination at 19 n. 144. The ITC contrasted this case with other cases where there was a \u201cdemonstrably wide variation among products\u201d in volume or price. <em>See </em>ITC\u2019s Opp\u2019n 12. The ITC states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">For example, in <em>Ball Bearings from China, </em>the Commission noted that there was a \u201cvast and disparate grouping of items differing in size, configuration, application, and precision,\u201d and that \u201cit would present a distorted picture of the market to consider a commodity bearing costing less than one dollar as equivalent to a precision bearing costing hundreds or even thousands of dollars.\u201d In <em>Outboard Engines from Japan, </em>the Commission explained that it relied on value data to assess the volume of subject imports \u201cgiven the wide spectrum of engine sizes covered by the investigation and the wide variation in the unit value of engines of different sizes.\u201d It explained that the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail prices for outboard engines range from under $1,000 to about $20,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">ITC\u2019s Opp\u2019n 12 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">The court agrees with the ITC. In contrast to the cases where the ITC has used value-based measurements, Navneet has not shown that its products vary so widely in either variety or price so as to create a substantial distortion. While the scope used by Commerce in its investigation contained a variety of products, the Indian respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>dents\u2019 actual sales were concentrated in relatively few products: (1) 70 count single subject notebooks; (2) 150 count filler paper; and (3) 100 count composition books. CLPSS from China, India, and Indonesia, Staff Report to the Commission on Inv. Nos. 701-TA-442-443 and 731-TA-1095-1097 (Final) (Aug. 15, 2006)(\u201cStaff Report\u201d) at Tables V-l, V-2, and V-4. Other arguably in-scope items made up a relatively small amount of the volume of merchandise exported to the United States. <em>Id. </em>at Tables V-3 and V-6. Thus, with respect to what was actually imported, plaintiff has not shown a particularly wide variety of product.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Navneet also fails to show variety in terms of price. An examination of the record evidence reveals that, while there was some variation in price, it was within a relatively tight range.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That is, the data on pricing products showed little difference in price when adjusted for the product differences, i.e., size or page-count. <em>See </em>Staff Report at Tables V-l, V-3 &amp; V-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In addition, a value based measure would not give a true picture of the amount of Indian paper that was entering the United States. The record indicates that \u201cfashion\u201d notebooks, which typically have artwork and special covers, have a much greater value than a regular notebook having a similar page count. <em>See </em>Staff Report at Tables IV-5, V-l, V-2. Therefore, in a value based comparison, this difference in value among products with similar paper count would overstate the proportion of \u201cfashion\u201d notebooks while understating the proportion of plain notebooks, even though the number of units imported might be the same. <em>See </em>Final Determination at 19 n. 144 (\u201cWe typically rely on quantity-based measures of volume because value-based measures can be skewed by changes of product mix.\u201d). As previously noted, India exports to the United States relatively few higher priced \u201cfashion\u201d notebooks, and thus a value-based measure would tend to understate the amount of paper it introduces into the United States market. <em>See </em>Staff Report at Table V-6; Ass\u2019n.\u2019s Resp. 10.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>The Commission is charged with the responsibility to calculate import volumes for purposes of negligibility by making \u201creasonable estimates on the basis of available statistics.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(24)(C). Based on the foregoing, it cannot be said that the Commission\u2019s decision to use volume-rather than value-based measures was unreasonable or that plaintiff has demonstrated that valuation based on price would yield a more accurate result than the ITC\u2019s volume methodology. <em>See, e.g., Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd. v. United States, </em>31 CIT _, _, 516 F.Supp.2d 1323, 1341 (2007) (\u201cNTN did not satisfy its burden of showing that its allocation method did not cause inaccuracies or distortions.\u201d); <em>Shakeproof Assembly Components Div. of III. Tool Works, Inc. v. United States, </em>30 CIT _, _, Slip Op. 06-129 at 15-16 (2006) (not reported in the Federal Supplement) (\u201cDefendant-Intervenor offers no compelling reason for why such a constructed average would result in a more accurate valuation here than simply using information taken directly from the period of review.\u201d) (footnote omitted). The court sustains the Commission\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">B. The ITC\u2019s Use of a Conversion Factor</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">In conducting its investigation, the ITC found that one type of imported product did not easily conform to the volume-based (i.e., unit-based) methodology.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Filler paper is imported under a Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (\u201cHTSUS\u201d) subheading that measures imports by weight, not units. Thus, the Commission converted the data from HTSUS statistical reporting number 4811.90.9090<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> from kilograms to units using a conversion factor, i.e., weight to pages.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">Navneet challenges the ITC\u2019s use of the conversion factor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>There is no reasonable way to convert pieces to kilograms or kilograms to pieces because there is no information on this record other than speculation that would provide a basis to determine the exact nature of the [CLPSS] or their material components (and thus their weight) included in a \u201cunit\u201d or piece in the official statistics.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">PL\u2019s Mem. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The ITC converted the kilograms of paper under 4811.90.9090 to a unit basis, using a conversion factor based on the weight of 150-count filler paper, as provided by the Association in the petition.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Final Determination at 18 n. 139, IV-1 n. 6. No other party submitted a potential conversion factor during the investigation. <em>See </em>ITC\u2019s Opp\u2019n 19; Pl.\u2019s Reply Br. 9; Ass\u2019n.\u2019s Resp. 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Before the court, Navneet goes beyond questioning the use of a conversion factor by insisting that a different conversion factor be used. PL\u2019s Mem. 12-14, Exs. 1, 2. Specifically, Navneet argues that there is an \u201cindustry standard\u201d formula for converting kilograms into units of paper. PL\u2019s Mem. 12. Plaintiff argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">Since petitioners\u2019 conversion ratio does not correspond to the industry standard for school filler paper - or the Commission\u2019s definition derived therefrom, and since petitioners\u2019 conversion appears to inflate the quantity they used for the conversion even for the product they describe, the Court should strike their conversion ratio and remand on this basis alone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">PL\u2019s Mem. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s claims are unavailing. By translating the weight of the filler packs and loose paper into \u201cunits\u201d of the \u201cmost common filler paper package (150-count),\u201d the Commission made a \u201creasonable estimate on the basis of available statistics.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(24)(C). The conversion factor was not complex, but merely translated the weight of paper into units in order to get a common basis for measurement. Moreover, Navneet\u2019s claim that \u201c[t]he extensive choice and variety of in-scope retail products in these categories [HTSUS 4820.10.2050 and HTSUS 4811.90.9090] renders \u2018conversion\u2019 of each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>\u2018unit\u2019 into kilograms...a highly speculative exercise[,]\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> is unconvincing. Pl.\u2019s Mem. 11. The conversion factor was not applied to a variety of merchandise but only to filler paper. ITC\u2019s Opp\u2019n 19. (\u201c[0]nly filler paper packs and loose paper were subject to the kilograms-to-units conversion, [such that] application of the conversion factor would not have resulted in any distortion at all.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">There is nothing inherently unreasonable about determining the weight of 150 pages of filler paper and then converting that weight into units. While it is not impossible that the ITC improperly determined the weight-to-page count ratio, plaintiff failed to place any evidence on the record in the administrative proceeding indicating that the ITC\u2019s chosen conversion factor yielded an inaccurate result.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Moreover, during the investigation Navneet failed to present to the ITC any evidence regarding an alternative conversion factor. That is, Navneet never suggested to the ITC its own amount for the number of pages of filler paper per kilogram or that an industry standard existed. Navneet\u2019s sole reference to the conversion factor made in the administrative proceedings was in Navneet\u2019s post-hearing brief where it stated, \u201cthere is simply no reasonable way to convert...kilograms to pieces.\u201d Navneet\u2019s Post-Hearing Br. 4. This argument is, of course, undercut by plaintiff\u2019s claim before the court that there is an industry standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">As to plaintiff\u2019s insistence that there is an industry standard that the ITC should have used as a conversion factor, that matter cannot be reviewed by this court. Navneet had its opportunity to introduce its evidence of an industry standard during the proceedings before the ITC and failed to do so. The court\u2019s review of the Commission\u2019s determination must be based solely on the agency record. <em>See Titanium Metals Corp. v. United States, </em>25 CIT 648, 663 n. 12, 155 F.Supp.2d 750, 765 n. 12 (2001) (refusing to review two exhibits which were not part of administrative record); <em>Kerr-McGee Chem. Corp. v. United States, </em>21 CIT 1179, 1180-82, 985 F. Supp. 1162, 1163-64 (1997) (holding that evidence on arguments not presented to or obtained by Department of Commerce during course of administrative review were not properly part of the record for review). Plaintiff has therefore waived this argument. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp. v. United States, </em>16 CIT 1101, 1103 (1992) (finding plaintiff\u2019s arguments waived for failing to raise them before the agency). Therefore, the court finds the ITC\u2019s use of a conversion factor to be reasonable and Navneet\u2019s arguments and evidence regarding the accuracy of the conversion factor to be outside of the record and thus not reviewable by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>C. The ITC\u2019s Choice of Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Statistical Reporting Categories for Determining Volume</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">In order to measure the volume of CLPSS imports during the September 2004 to August 2005 period, the ITC chose the HTSUS statistical reporting numbers that were actually used to enter the merchandise by importers. Navneet contests this choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">In the investigation, the ITC found that there were problems with the data from questionnaire responses and with official import statistics. The ITC stated that \u201c[t]he questionnaire responses yielded a low percentage of import coverage, as the data submitted by responding importers for 2005 [was] equivalent to 39 percent of the value of total U.S. imports of CLPSS.\u201d Final Determination at 17 (footnote omitted). There is no dispute among the parties that there were problems with the questionnaire responses. Pl.\u2019s Mem. 9-10; see <em>also </em>Def.\u2019s Mem. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">As a result, the ITC concluded, \u201cIn light of the deficiencies in the questionnaire data, we rely on the official import statistics.\u201d Final Determination at 17. Having concluded that it would rely on official statistics, the ITC was required to decide \u201cunder which HTSUS statistical reporting numbers we should measure subject merchandise.\u201d Final Determination at 17. The ITC determined that, rather than rely on all of the HTSUS subheadings chosen by Commerce in its scope determination, it would use the two subheadings under which a large majority of merchandise was entered, i.e., HTSUS 4820.10.2050 and 4811.90.9000.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Specifically, the ITC stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">The record indicates that all but four of the 32 responding firms reported importing CLPSS under statistical reporting number 4820.10.2050 during the period of investigation. Seven firms reported importing CLPSS under number 4811.90.9090,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> while six firms reported importing CLPSS under reporting number 4820.10.2020.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Because statistical reporting number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>4820.10.2020, covering \u201cmemorandum pads, letter pads and similar articles,\u201d contains predominately non-subject note pads and letter pads and the majority of responding U.S. importers identified statistical reporting numbers 4811.90.9000 and 4820.10.2050 more frequently, we find on balance that the official import statistics provided under those two statistical reporting numbers (4820.10.2050 and 4811.90.9000) are a more comprehensive and accurate measure of import volume.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 18 (footnote omitted). In other words, while additional HTSUS subheadings were identified by Commerce as within the scope of its investigation, HTSUS numbers 4820.10.2050 and 4811.90.9000 were used by most importers to classify the subject merchandise upon actual importation during the period of investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The Indian respondents argued, as does plaintiff here, that the ITC should utilize all five statistical reporting numbers (or some combination thereof) used by Commerce in the scope of its investigation to analyze negligibility.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It can be presumed that the inclusion of these other subheadings would result in a ratio favoring plaintiff\u2019s negligibility claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The ITC states that it \u201cdoes not dispute that <em>some </em>subject merchandise might have been entered (whether through correct or incorrect tariff classification by importers) under the additional tariff subheading[s] listed in Commerce\u2019s scope.\u201d ITC\u2019s Opp\u2019n 25 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-7\">The fact that some within-scope products might occasionally be entered under a tariff subheading does not justify including all imports under that subheading in the computation of the volume of subject imports, where the evidence shows that the tariff subheading applies predominantly to out-of-scope products. Including all imports under such tariff category would have been inconsistent with the Commission\u2019s mandate to make \u201creasonable estimates on the basis of the available statistics.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-8\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>As the Commission notes, it is charged with making \u201creasonable estimates on the basis of the available statistics.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(24)(C). In addition, the statute indicates that the Commissioners are to make an independent determination as to what imports are to be considered.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(24)(A) (\u201c[Ijmports from a country of merchandise <em>corresponding to a domestic like product identified by the Commission </em>are \u2018negligible\u2019 if such imports account for less than 3 percent of the volume of all such merchandise imported into the United States in the most recent 12-month period for which data are available..,.\u201d)(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Moreover, the inclusion of some within-scope merchandise under a tariff subheading that predominantly applies to out-of-scope products does not undermine the reasonableness of the ITC\u2019s determination not to use those subheadings in its analysis. The ITC determined that, on balance, a more accurate estimate could be reached by excluding tariff subheadings that included mostly out-of-scope and only some in-scope products. The court cannot find that this was unreasonable. <em>See Nippon Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>458 F. 3d 1345, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (\u201c[The court] must affirm a Commission determination if it is reasonable and supported by the record as a whole, even if some evidence detracts from the Commission\u2019s conclusion.\u201d) (citations and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">D. The ITC\u2019s Decision Not to Make a Downward Adjustment to Official Import Statistics in Measuring the Volume of Indian Imports</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Finally, Navneet takes issue with the ITC\u2019s denial of its request that the official import statistics be adjusted downward \u201cto remove the volume of non-subject merchandise [exported from India] from the total volume reported\u201d under HTSUS subheadings 4820.10.2050 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>and 4811.90.9000. Final Determination at 18 (footnote omitted). According to plaintiff, the adjustment would provide a more accurate result.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s \u201cproposed reductions were based on an estimate in an email from an executive at \u2018American Scholar,\u2019 a U.S. producer of CLPSS that also has production operations in India.\u201d ITC\u2019s Opp\u2019n 26 (citing Hearing Transcript at 234).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The email stated that, based on the writer\u2019s experience with the subject merchandise, there was a percentage of in-scope products within the chosen tariff numbers that could be estimated fairly and accurately.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Navneet insists that the email provides the basis for determining the amount of out of scope merchandise in each HTSUS subheading. The email thus constituted a proposal by Navneet to reduce the import data under HTSUS statistical numbers 4820.10.2050 and 4811.90.9000 by the writer\u2019s estimated percentages of subject and non-subject merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The Commission received the proposal to reduce the volume under the two selected HTSUS reporting numbers on the day the record closed. Final Determination at 18-19.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> According to the ITC, because of the record closing, it was impossible for the ITC staff to verify the accuracy of the proposed reductions, which in any event were submitted without an explanation of the methodology employed. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the ITC stated that \u201csubject imports from India and Indonesia still are not negligible when the HTSUS statistical reporting numbers are reduced by the highest, middle, and lowest proposed percentages.\u201d Final Determination at 19 n. 142 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Plaintiff objects that the Commission unreasonably refused to \u201ctake into account record evidence clearly indicating that the HTSUS numbers under consideration were not composed exclusively of subject merchandise.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Mem. 23-24 (footnote omitted). Plaintiff further claims that the Commission itself \u201coften\u201d puts new information on the record at the close of an investigation. Pl.\u2019s Mem. 25. In support of its position that the other parties would not be prejudiced \u201ceven when critical information is placed on the record and disclosed to parties on the last day that the record was open,\u201d plaintiff cites to <em>Sichuan Changhong Elec. Co., Ltd. v. United States, </em>30 CIT_, 466 F.Supp.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>1323 (2006) <em>{\u201cSichuan\u201d), </em>stating that the case upheld the ITC\u2019s decision to put information on the record on the day it closed because respondents had the opportunity to provide final comments a few days later. Pl.\u2019s Mem. 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><em>Sichuan </em>is distinguishable from this case. As the Commission points out, in <em>Sichuan:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">the computations that were placed on the record shortly before its closing (the one-page digest of the domestic industry\u2019s financial information) were based on data that had been submitted earlier; and there was no suggestion that the data had been submitted without any explanation, or that the Commission staff had been unable to verify the accuracy of the data. In short, the circumstances were quite different from those surrounding the American Scholar emailin the CLPSS investigations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">ITC\u2019s Opp\u2019n 29 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The ITC has surely received new evidence late in other proceedings, but in this case it reasonably excluded the submission. <em>See Gen. Motors Corp. v. United States, </em>17 CIT 697, 702-03, 827 F. Supp. 774, 780-781 (1993) (\u201cGiven the lateness of the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, ITC\u2019s decision not to conduct a supplemental investigation was reasonable.\u201d). First, Navneet submitted its proposed reductions without any explanation or description of the methodology by which they were reached. As a result, in order to render the methodology useful, the Commission would have been required to reopen the record to verify the accuracy of the proposed reductions and provide the other parties the opportunity to submit any analysis or new factual information in response. The antidumping statute requires time for public comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS\">Information that is submitted on a timely basis to the administering authority or the Commission during the course of a proceeding under this subtitle shall be subject to comment by other parties to the proceeding within such reasonable time as the administering authority or the Commission shall provide. The administering authority and the Commission, before making a final determination... shall cease collecting information and shall provide the parties with a final opportunity to comment on the information obtained by the administering authority or the Commission (as the case maybe) upon which the parties have not previously had an opportunity to comment. Comments containing new factual information shall be disregarded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(g). Had the ITC accepted the proposal without offering time for the other parties to comment, it would have contravened the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Most tellingly, however, the subject imports would not be negligible even if the proposed percentages were used to reduce the reporting numbers. Final Determination at 19 n. 142. Therefore, the Commission\u2019s refusal to adjust the import data per Navneet\u2019s proposal was reasonable, supported by substantial evidence, and otherwise in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the court sustains the findings of the International Trade Commission. Plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment upon the agency record is denied. Judgment shall be entered accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-10\"> The Association is comprised of MeadWestvaco Corporation, Norcom, Inc., and Top Flight, Inc.
