The United States Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (\u201cCustoms\u201d) classified entries of \u201cdeodorizer distillate\u201d in Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (\u201cHTSUS\u201d) subheading 3824.90.28 at 7.9% <em>ad valorem. </em>Plaintiff challenges the classification and contends that a 2002 amendment to Heading 3824 renders deodorizer distillate classifiable in Heading 3807 at 0.1% <em>ad valorem, </em>or in the alternative, classifiable in the newly created duty-free provisions of subheadings 3825.61 or 3825.90. Plaintiff filed this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2632. The court has jurisdiction in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The subject merchandise is a substance commercially known as \u201cvegetable oil distillate\u201d or \u201cdeodorizer distillate\u201d (\u201cDOD\u201d) and categorized under Chemical Services Abstract (\u201cCAS\u201d) Number 68476-80-2. ADM\u2019s Interrogatory Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 9. DOD is a residue produced during the process of refining soybean oil whereby vacuum distillation is utilized to remove undesirable flavors and odors from an otherwise edible oil. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 3. The product is a chemical mixture composed of 70-80% free fatty acids but also contains sterols and tocopherols and can embody a number of other materials including tocotrienol, squalene and carotenoids. <em>Id. </em>\u00b68.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Deodorization is the process by which steam strips crude soybean oil from volatile materials under low atmospheric pressure and high temperature. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 10. Physically, DOD is a translucent material with a brown, red, or yellow hue, which is solid at room temperature. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 8. DOD is primarily used for the recovery of tocopherols and phy-tosterols, both of which are further used for the production of tocopherol-based vitamin E products, purified phytosterols, distilled methyl esters, vegetable distilled fatty acids, mixed vegetable fatty acids, and vegetable oil residue. <em>Id. </em>\u00b611.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">On July 23, 2003, Plaintiff entered DOD through the port of Chicago. Memorandum in Support of Plaintiff\u2019s Gross-Motion for Summary Judgment (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Response\u201d) at 1. Customs classified the merchandise in subheading 3824.90.28 as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\">Chemical products and preparations of the chemical or allied industries (including those consisting of mixtures of natural products), not elsewhere specified or included: mixtures containing 5 percent or more by weight of one or more aromatic or modified aromatic substances: other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">HTSUS 3824.90.28 (2002).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">Customs\u2019 classification was consistent with the decision of this court in <em>Cargill, Inc. v. United States, </em>318 F.Supp.2d 1279 (CIT 2004), although amendments had been made to Chapter 38 since the importation of the deodorizer distillate at issue in <em>Cargill. </em>Memorandum in Support of Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Motion\u201d) at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">In July 2004 Plaintiff filed a protest with an Application for Further Review contesting Customs\u2019 classification of DOD in subheading 3824.90.28. Prior to January 1, 2002, subheading 3824.90.28 covered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Prepared binders for foundry molds or cores; chemical products and preparations of the chemical or allied industries (including those consisting of mixtures of natural products), not elsewhere specified or included; residual products of the chemical or allied industries, not elsewhere specified or included: Other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">HTSUS 3824.90.28 (2001) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>Amended Complaint \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">In the amended tariff schedule that went into effect on January 1, 2002, the language \u201cresidual products of the chemical or allied industries, not elsewhere specified or included\u201d was deleted from the description for subheading 3824.90.28. Amended Complaint \u00b6 30. At the same time, Heading 3825 was created. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 33. Heading 3825 of the 2002 Harmonized Tariff Schedule provides for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">Residual products of the chemical or allied industries, not elsewhere specified or included; municipal waste; sewage sludge; other wastes specified in note 6 to this chapter:...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">HTSUS Heading 3825 (2002) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Plaintiff claimed that DOD would be properly classified in HTSUS 3825.61.00 which covers \u201c[ojther wastes from the chemical and allied industries: Mainly containing organic constituents.\u201d HTSUS 3825.61 (2002), <em>see also </em>Amended Complaint \u00b6 18, Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 1. In Plaintiff\u2019s Amended Complaint, it also argues for classification in Heading 3807 as \u201cvegetable pitch,\u201d and in the alternative classification in subheading 3825.90 as \u201cresidual products of the chemical or allied industries\u201d other than the wastes specified in Heading 3825. Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 28, 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">On March 10, 2005, Customs issued Ruling [\u00b6] 967288 in which it rejected Plaintiff\u2019s proposed classification based on a finding that Heading 3825 is reserved for \u201cenvironmentally sensitive\u201d or \u201chazardous\u201d substances and therefore does not apply to DOD. Customs Headquarters Ruling Letter No. 967288 (March 10, 2005) (\u201cHQ 967288\u201d); Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 19-21. Customs determined that DOD is clearly a \u201cby-product\u201d of the chemical and allied industries, but classifiable in Heading 3824 as a \u201cchemical preparation\u201d and not in Heading 3825 as a \u201cresidual product.\u201d [\u00b6] 967288 at 6. Customs noted that \u201cresidual products\u201d for purposes of Heading 3825 are \u201ctantamount to waste product\u201d and that DOD is not \u201cthe unadulterated \u2018leftovers\u2019 of a manufacturing process.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">In defining the scope of Headings 3824 and 3825, Customs stated that prior to 2002 there had not been a need to distinguish between \u201cchemical preparations\u201d and \u201cresidual products\u201d of the chemical and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>allied industries. [\u00b6] 967288 at 4. Customs acknowledged that neither term is defined in the HTSUS or the accompanying Explanatory Notes (\u201cENs\u201d) and therefore looked to the available legislative history for Heading 3825. <em>Id. </em>In the absence of House or Senate reports, Customs reviewed the papers and notes relating to the proposal of Heading 3825 at the 12th session of the Harmonized System Review Sub-Committee and its subsequent adoption by Presidential Proclamation. <em>Id. </em>(citing Presidential Proclamation 7515, 66 Fed. Reg. 66,549 (December 18, 2001)). Customs relied on the Sub-Committee\u2019s statements analogizing wastes to residual products of the chemical or allied industries. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, Customs stated that the SubCommittee, at the suggestion of the U.S., only intended to create subheadings for waste products that were \u201c(1) environmentally sensitive and whose transfrontier movement had to be monitored and (2) which were important in international trade.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. Based on this, and on the Sub-Committee\u2019s comment that \u201c \u2018residual products of the chemical and allied industries\u2019 were in fact so nearly similar to other wastes that they should be classified in this new heading,\u201d id., Customs concluded that \u201cresidual products\u201d for purposes of Heading 3825 refers only to products \u201cthat are environmentally sensitive wastes but can be remediated into a useful product.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, Customs noted that the examples listed in the ENs of products classifiable in Heading 3825, <em>see </em>n.4 <em>infra, </em>resemble hazardous waste products and that the ENs to Heading 3824 indicate that not all by-products were intended to be moved from Heading 3824.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">On November 29, 2005, Plaintiff timely commenced this action seeking reliquidation of entries of the merchandise in issue and calculation of duties in accordance with Plaintiff\u2019s proposed tariff headings. Complaint \u00b6 5. Plaintiff filed a Motion <em>for </em>Partial Summary Judgment seeking adjudication on the issue of whether Heading 3825 is limited to environmentally sensitive substances. Defendant cross-moved for summary judgment. Plaintiff responded and also submitted a cross-motion for summary judgment. In September 2006, Plaintiff filed a motion to amend its statement of material facts. Following an in-court conference, the court granted Plaintiff\u2019s motion and permitted Defendant to file a sur-reply relating to the amended version of Plaintiff\u2019s statement of material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">An entry of summary judgment is appropriate when there are \u201cno genuine issues as to any material fact and...the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d USCIT R. 56(c); <em>see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). In fact, on a motion for summary judgment, the court \u201cmay not resolve or try factual issues.\u201d <em>Phone-Mate, Inc. v. United States, </em>12 CIT 575, 577 (1988), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>867 F.2d 1404 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (citing <em>Yamaha Int\u2019l Corp. v. United States, </em>3 CIT 108, 109 (1982)). Further, while a presumption of correctness attaches to Customs\u2019 classification pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2639(a)(1), \u201cthis presumption \u2018is irrelevant where there is no factual dispute between the <em>parties.\u2019\u201dBousa, Inc. v. United States, 25 </em>CIT 386, 387 (2001) (citing <em>Rollerblade, Inc. v. United States, </em>112 F.3d 481, 484 (Fed Cir. 1997)). Here, both parties agree that there are no disputed issues of material fact, and therefore, the court will review, <em>de novo, </em>the scope and meaning of the tariff terms at issue, which are purely questions of law. <em>See Totes, Inc. v. United States, </em>69 F.3d 495, 497 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <em>see also Rollerblade, Inc., </em>112 F.3d at 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Nor is Customs\u2019 ruling entitled to deference within the parameters of <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S. Ct. 161, 89 L. Ed. 124 (1944). In <em>Skidmore, </em>the Supreme Court held that an agency\u2019s determination, while not controlling on the court, is entitled to deference given the \u201cspecialized experience and broader investigations and information\u201d available to the agency. <em>Id. </em>at 139; <em>see also United States v. Mead Corp., </em>533 U.S. 218, 234, 121 S. Ct. 2164, 150 L. Ed. 2d 292 (2001). The amount of respect afforded \u201cwill depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it the power to persuade, if lacking power to control.\u201d <em>Skidmore, </em>323 U.S. at 140. Here, Customs did not use any \u201cspecialized expertise\u201d to inform its finding in Ruling [\u00b6] 967288 and therefore needs not be afforded deference. Customs\u2019 ruling does not have any other characteristics or factors which would give it the power to persuade. Thus, the court has \u201cindependent responsibility to decide the legal issue regarding the proper meaning and scope of the HTSUS terms.\u201d <em>Franklin v. United States, </em>289 F.3d 753, 757 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The court employs a two-step analysis when deciding classification cases: \u201cthe first step concerns the proper meaning of the tariff provisions at hand....[T]he second step concerns whether the subject imports properly fall within the scope of the possible headings.\u201d <em>Universal Elecs. Inc. v. United States, </em>112 F.3d 488, 491 (Fed. Cir. 1997). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>General Rules of Interpretation (\u201cGRI\u201d) of the HTSUS and the Additional United States Rules of Interpretation guide the court\u2019s classification of goods imported into the United States. <em>JVC Co. of Am. v. United States, </em>234 F.3d 1348, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (citing <em>Carl Zeiss, Inc. v. United States, </em>195 F.3d 1375, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 1999)). Absent legislative intent to the contrary, HTSUS terms are construed according to their common and commercial meanings, which are presumed to be the same. <em>North Am. Processing Co. v. United States, </em>236 F.3d 695, 698 (Fed. Cir. 2001). In determining a tariff term\u2019s common meaning, the court may rely on its own understanding of the term and may \u201cconsult lexicographic and scientific authorities, dictionaries, and other reliable information sources.\u201d <em>Carl Zeiss, Inc., </em>195 F.3d at 1379. The court may also refer to the Explanatory Notes accompanying a tariff heading, which although not controlling, clarify the scope of the HTSUS subheadings and offer guidance in their interpretation. <em>Franklin, </em>289 F.3d at 758; <em>see also </em>H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 100-576, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 549 (1988), <em>reprinted in </em>1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1547, 1582.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The issue before the court is whether Customs properly classified deodorizer distillate under subheading 3824.90.28 notwithstanding the fact that the reference to \u201cresidual products\u201d of the chemical or allied industries was served from the heading. <em>See </em>HTSUS 3824.90.28 (2002). Plaintiff proposes that DOD is properly classified under Heading 3807 as \u201cvegetable pitch\u201d or, in the alternative, under Heading 3825 as \u201cother wastes of the chemical or allied industries mainly containing organic constituents\u201d (subheading 3825.61) or as \u201cresidual products\u201d of the chemical or allied industries (subheading 3825.90). <em>See </em>Plaintiff\u2019s Response at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">\n<em>Classification Under Heading 3807</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">Heading 3807 is an <em>eo </em>nomine<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provision which provides for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-10\">Wood tar; wood tar oils; wood creosote; wood naphtha; vegetable pitch; brewers\u2019 pitch and similar preparations based on rosin, resin acids or on vegetable pitch.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">HTSUS Heading 3807. (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">The Explanatory Notes accompanying Heading 3807 in pertinent part describe \u201cvegetable pitch\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>(C) Vegetable pitch</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-4\">These are residues of the distillation or other treatment of vegetable materials. They include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\">(1) Wood pitch (wood tar pitch), a residue of the distillation of wood tar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">(2) Rosin pitch, a residue of the preparation of rosin spirit and rosin oil by distillation of rosin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">(3) Sulphate pitch, a residue after the distillation of tall oil, etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">These pitches are usually blackish-brown, reddish-brown or yellowish-brown. They generally soften with the heat of the hand. They are used, according to their type, for caulking ships, waterproof-coating of woven fabrics, impregnating woods, preparing anti-rust coatings, as binding materials, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">EN 38.07(C) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">Plaintiff argues that the \u201ccommon and commercial meaning\u201d of vegetable pitch includes deodorizer distillate. Plaintiff\u2019s Response at 9. Plaintiff relies on the dictionary definition of \u201cpitch\u201d which states that \u201cpitch, in the chemical-process industries, is the black or brown residue obtained by distilling coal tar, wood tar, fats, fatty acids, or fatty oils.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>The New Encyclopedia Britannica </em>474 (15th ed. 2002)). Plaintiff analogizes the physical appearance of DOD and its uses to those of pitch and claims that the merchandise at issue falls within the \u201ccommercial understanding\u201d of vegetable pitch. <em>Id. </em>at 10. In addition, Plaintiff provides affidavits that attest that DOD mimics the physical description provided in the ENs which characterize vegetable pitch as \u201cblackish-brown, reddish-brown or yellowish-brown\u201d and a substance that \u201cgenerally soften with the heat of the hand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11 (citing Furcich Aff. \u00b6 11; Collins Aff. \u00b6 5; Hart Aff. \u00b67).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">Plaintiff also argues that the list of uses provided in the ENs is not exhaustive by the use of the term \u201cetc.,\u201d but that vegetable pitch has a \u201cnumber of modern industrial uses,\u201d and that DOD is used regularly as a substitute for \u201ctall oil pitch\u201d which is specifically covered by Heading 3807. <em>Id. </em>at 14. With respect to the uses listed in the ENs, Plaintiff argues that fatty acids, such as methyl esters, which are extracted from DOD are further refined and used in the preparation of anti-rust coatings, a use which is listed in the ENs. <em>Id. </em>at 15. Whereas DOD was previously classified under Heading 3824, Plaintiff argues that classification in Heading 3807 is proper because the court is required to classify the product in the tariff heading that either names the product or its specific use. <em>Id. </em>at 16 (citing GRI 3(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Defendant argues that DOD does not fall under Heading 3807 because \u201cpitch\u201d generally is defined as a dark sticky substance derived from various wood tars. Memorandum in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (\u201cDefendant\u2019s Cross-Motion\u201d) at 15-16. Defendant also asserts that while Heading 3807 is an eo <em>nomine </em>and not a \u201cuse\u201d provision, each of the definitions listed in the ENs describes various uses of pitch, and none of these correspond to the uses for DOD identified by Plaintiff in its interrogatory responses. <em>Id. </em>at 16. Defendant points out that the proposition that \u201cmerchandise must be classified in its condition as imported has been a basic tenet of customs law.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Reply to Plaintiff\u2019s Response to Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and Response to Plaintiff\u2019s Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (\u201cDefendant\u2019s Response\u201d) at 10 n.12. Moreover, Defendant contends that it does not appear from any of Defendant\u2019s research that DOD is ever referred to commercially as \u201cvegetable pitch.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Cross-Motion at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The \u201cCommon and Commercial\u201d Meaning of \u201cVegetable Pitch\u201d Does Not Encompass Deodorizer Distillate</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">An <em>eo nomine </em>provision describes goods according to their \u201ccommon and commercial meaning\u201d and includes, without terms of limitation, all forms of the article. <em>See, e.g., Chevron Chem. Co. v. United States, </em>23 CIT 500, 505 (1999). \u201cWhen a tariff term is not defined in either the HTSUS or its legislative history, the term\u2019s correct meaning is presumed to be its common meaning in the absence of evidence to the contrary.\u201d <em>Timber Prods. Co. v. United States, </em>417 F.3d 1198, 1201 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing <em>Rohm &amp; Haas Co. v. United States, </em>727 F.2d 1095, 1097 (Fed. Cir. 1984)). A party who argues that a tariff term should not be given its common meaning \u201cmust prove that \u2018there is a different commercial meaning in existence which is definite, uniform, and general throughout the trade.\u2019\u201d <em>Timber Prods. Co. v. United States, </em>515 F.3d 1213, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting <em>Moscahlades Bros. v. United States, </em>42 CCPA 78, 82 (1954)). To the extent that Plaintiff claims the commercial meaning of \u201cpitch\u201d is something other than the common meaning, the question for the court is whether ADM has overcome this presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">There is little judicial guidance on the \u201ccommon and commercial meaning\u201d of \u201cvegetable pitch\u201d for purposes of Heading 3807. Dictionaries do not define the term \u201cvegetable pitch,\u201d but give meaning to the term \u201cpitch.\u201d The dictionary definition of \u201cpitch\u201d is akin to the language found in the ENs to Heading 3807. For example, The American Heritage Dictionary defines pitch as \u201c[a]ny of various thick, dark, sticky substances obtained from the distillation residue of coal tar, wood tar, or petroleum and used for waterproofing, roofing, caulking, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>and paving.\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary </em>1380 (3rd ed. 1996). Other dictionaries contain similar descriptions, describing pitch as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aeh\">A tenacious resinous substance, of a black or dark brown colour, hard when cold, becoming a thick viscid semi-liquid when heated; obtained as a residuum from the boiling or distillation of tar, also from the distillation of turpentine; used to stop the seams of ships after caulking, to protect wood from moisture, and for other purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><em>The Oxford English Dictionary </em>915 (2d ed. 1989); or</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">[A] soft substance that is obtained by distilling fats, fatty oils, or fatty acids (as from the manufacture of soap or candles), contains polymers and decomposition products, and is used chiefly in varnishes and paints and in floor coverings - called also fatty acid pitch, stearin pitch.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-6\"><em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1724 (3rd ed. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">\u201cVegetable pitch,\u201d is simply \u201cpitch\u201d but derived from a vegetable base, such as soy, or as described in the ENs, substances that are \u201cresidues of the distillation or other treatment of vegetable materials.\u201d EN 38.07(C) (2002). The common uses for \u201cpitch\u201d are, both according to dictionary definitions and the Explanatory Notes, caulking, waterproofing and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">For purposes of classifying DOD, it is apparent that the substance also is a residue of the distillation of vegetable materials and that DOD shares certain characteristics with various pitches. For example, Plaintiff has furnished affidavits that attest to the physical characteristics of DOD as a yellowish-brown to reddish-brown substance which is viscous at room temperature or solid at lower temperatures and softens with the warmth of a hand, traits common to various pitches described both in dictionary definitions and in the ENs. <em>See </em>Hart Aff. \u00b6 7; Collins Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 13-14. While the Explanatory Notes are not exhaustive when listing examples of vegetable pitch, DOD is not wood pitch, rosin pitch or sulphate pitch, as listed in the ENs. <em>See </em>EN 38.07(C) (2002). In fact, there is little similarity between vegetable pitch and DOD other than the fact that both are sticky brown substances that derive from a distillation process.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">Moreover, the uses for \u201cpitch\u201d listed in dictionary definitions and in the Explanatory Notes do not comport with any of the applications for which Plaintiff uses DOD or for which DOD can be used. Plaintiff has submitted documentation to suggest that it primarily uses DOD for the recovery of tocopherols and phytosterols which are used in vitamin-E products in the pharmaceutical industry, in dietary supple-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>merits and as food additives. ADM Interrogatory Responses at \u00b6 11. Other uses include purified phytosterols, distilled methyl esters, mixed vegetable fatty acids and vegetable oil residue. <em>Id. </em>None of these uses resemble caulking, waterproofing, or other commonly described \u201cpitch\u201d uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">This fact, in conjunction with prevailing case law requiring that goods must be classified in the condition in which they are imported, contradict Plaintiff\u2019s proposed classification. <em>Worthington v. Robbins, </em>139 U.S. 337, 341, 11 S. Ct. 581, 35 L. Ed. 181 (1891) (\u201cThe dutiable classification of articles imported must be ascertained by an examination of the imported article itself, in the condition in which it is imported.\u201d); <em>see also Mita Copystar Am. v. United States, </em>21 F.3d 1079, 1082 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (citing <em>United States v. Citroen, </em>223 U.S. 407, 414-15, 56 L. Ed. 486, 32 S. Ct. 259 (1911)) (\u201cIt is well settled law that merchandise is classified according to its condition when imported.\u201d). While Plaintiff does not dispute that a product must be classified in its imported form, Plaintiff asserted at oral argument that there is little evidence of things specifically described as \u201cpitch\u201d in the Explanatory Notes being used to do anything in their imported form. Instead, Plaintiff attempts to establish a link between DOD usage and common \u201cpitch\u201d uses, stating that the production of fatty acids is used in the manufacture of printing ink, paints, and varnishes, which in turn are used in anti-rust coatings. <em>See, e.g., </em>Plaintiff\u2019s Response at 14-1,5; <em>see also </em>Hart Aff. \u00b6 18. Because products must be classified \u201cas imported,\u201d this link is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Furthermore, there is no indication from Plaintiff\u2019s submitted materials, dictionary definitions or any other readily available information that DOD is commercially or commonly known, sold or traded as \u201cvegetable pitch.\u201d In fact, in Plaintiff\u2019s own words, \u201cthe residue of deodorization is a complex mixture of chemicals known commercially as deodorizer distillate.\u201d Mayfield Aff. \u00b6 12; <em>see also </em>Collins Aff. \u00b6 5. Plaintiff has not successfully demonstrated that deodorizer distillate falls within the \u201ccommon or commercial\u201d meaning of vegetable pitch for purposes of HTSUS Heading 3807 or in the alternative, that a different commercial meaning of the substance exists which is \u201cdefinite, uniform, and general throughout the trade\u201d within the meaning of <em>Timber Prods.

Presidential Proclamation 7515, 66 Fed. Reg. 66,549 (December 18, 2001). The language of Heading 3825 provides for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Residual products of the chemical or allied industries, not elsewhere specified or included; municipal waste; sewage sludge; other wastes specified in note 6 to this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">HTSUS Heading 3825 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The two subheadings at issue, 3825.61 and 3825.90, refer respectively to \u201cOther wastes from the chemical or allied industries: Mainly containing organic constituents\u201d and \u201cResidual products. . .: Other.\u201d HTSUS 3825.61, 3825.90 (2002).

Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 1,12. Plaintiff contends that Heading 3825\u2019s applicability is not limited to environmentally sensitive products and that DOD qualifies as \u201cwaste\u201d because it is a residual product of the chemical or allied industries. <em>Id.) </em>Plaintiff\u2019s Response at 28. Plaintiff contends that the legislative history upon which Customs relied in its denial of Plaintiff\u2019s protest is flawed because record discussions and negotiations of the World Customs Organization (\u201cWCO\u201d) Sub-Committee may not be used for interpretative guidance of the HTSUS, and, that any such limitation would be arbitrary absent explicit guidance to importers. Plaintiff\u2019s Brief at 15. Indeed, Plaintiff points out that certain non-hazardous wastes, such as household and road wastes are included under the definition of \u201cmunicipal waste\u201d in Note 4 to Chapter 38, and certain toxic wastes are precluded by Note 6 to Chapter 38, negating the proposition that all items classified under Heading 3825 must be environmentally sensitive. <em>Id. </em>at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Defendant\u2019s argument parallels Customs\u2019 interpretation of the scope of the tariff term, and implies a limitation on the applicability of Heading 3825 to environmentally sensitive or hazardous substances. Defendant\u2019s Cross-Motion at 20 (citing Ex. E). While acknowledging that the legislative history in question is not legally binding, Defendant\u2019s argument relies exclusively on conclusions and recommendations formulated by the Harmonized System Review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Sub-Committee concerning the scope of Heading 3825. <em>Id. </em>Defendant argues the absence of any other legislative history and the express agreement by the Sub-Committee that the provision covers only environmentally sensitive waste products, is sufficient to support its position. <em>Id. </em>; Defendant\u2019s Response at 13. Defendant suggests that determining whether a substance is environmentally sensitive should be done on a case-by-case basis by an inquiry into whether its \u201cdisposal, treatment and transport is controlled to protect the environment.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Response at 13-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Heading 3825 is not Limited to \u201cEnvironmentally Sensitive\u201d or \u201cHazardous\u201d Substances</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">GRI 1 states that \u201cclassification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes...\u201d GRI 1. The language of Heading 3825 and the accompanying Explanatory Notes do not impose an express limitation on the heading to include environmentally sensitive or hazardous substances. Plaintiff Correctly states that the appropriate legislative history on which this court must rely for interpretive guidance does not impose an environmental limitation on Heading 3825. <em>See, e.g., </em>Plaintiffs Motion at 11; <em>see also EM Indus. v. United States, </em>22 CIT 156, 163 (1999) (noting that the WCO\u2019s official interpretation of the HTSUS are the Explanatory Notes); <em>Lonza, Inc. v. United States, </em>46 F.3d 1098, 1109 (Fed. Cir. 1995). In fact, the International Trade Commission (\u201cITC\u201d) is obligated by law to keep the HTSUS under continuous review and recommend modifications to the President on an ongoing basis. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005(a)-(c)). The ITC may take into account decisions issued by the WCO, the WCO\u2019s Harmonized System Committee, and U.S. Customs in making their recommendation. <em>See, e.g., </em>Proposed Modification to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, Investigation No. 1205-5 (Final), Pub. 3430 at 5 (June 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Here, neither the reports detailing the modification to Chapter 38 nor Presidential Proclamation 7515, contain explicit language that limits Heading 3825 to environmentally sensitive materials. <em>See </em>66 Fed. Reg. 66,549. Indeed, as Plaintiff points out, \u201csuch a major qualification\u201d would most likely warrant a notice and comment period ' pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005(b). <em>See </em>Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 12. Plaintiff cites to <em>Cummins, Inc. v. United States, </em>454 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2006) for the proposition that a WCO opinion may at most be entitled to \u201crespectful consideration,\u201d but the court, according to controlling case law, may consult any number of sources to inform its decision concerning the scope of a tariff term, absent unambiguous statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>language and legislative history to the contrary. <em>See, e.g., Carl Zeiss, Inc., </em>195 F.3d at 1379 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Accordingly, the court may look to interpretive guidance where found.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">In this instance, it seems clear from the available information that the intent of the Harmonized System Review Sub-committee to the Committee may have been to limit the applicability of Heading 3825 to environmentally sensitive products, or waste products. However, in the formulation and adoption of the provision by the U.S., any such qualification was not adopted. First, it would have been logical to include any such qualification in the statutory language of the HT-SUS or, at minimum, in the Explanatory Notes. Second, imposing such a limitation is likely to cause confusion for importers because no objective standards have been set concerning what for example, qualifies as an \u201cenvironmentally sensitive\u201d or \u201chazardous\u201d substance for purposes of Heading 3825. Third, no agency was designated to provide any such guidelines, nor is it obvious that all substances detailed in the Explanatory Notes are necessarily environmentally sensitive.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, in an attempt to define what constitutes \u201cenvironmentally sensitive materials,\u201d the government cites to a state sanitation code. Defendant\u2019s Response at 13. Such haphazard and varying definitions do not provide adequate guidance to commercial importers of goods seeking to classify chemically complex substances and waste products in Heading 3825, nor is it sufficient that individual substances in the ENs are already regulated the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d), when some are not.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Consequently the scope of Heading 3825 is not limited to substances and products that are environmentally sensitive or hazardous. Congress may wish to amend the provision if it was indeed intended to be limited in such a fashion. However, Federal courts, except in highly unusual circumstances, must decline \u201cto act where Congress has not.\u201d <em>Lynteq, Inc. v. United States, </em>976 F.2d 693, 697 (Fed.

It is not a court\u2019s role to read in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>legislative intent where none is found, or attribute meaning to HT-SUS provisions that would result in arbitrary and unpredictable results.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Deodorizer Distillate is Not Properly Classified in Subheading 3825.61 as \u201cWaste\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s chief argument for classifying DOD in subheading 3825.61 is that DOD qualifies as a \u201cwaste product\u201d under controlling case law. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 9 (citing <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1931-32, 2580 (3rd ed. 2002); Plaintiff\u2019s Response at 26-28. Absent a clear definition of \u201cwaste\u201d in the HTSUS or the ENs, Plaintiff relies on the court\u2019s definition of \u201cwaste\u201d in <em>E.T. Horn Co. V. United States, </em>945 F.2d 1540, 1543 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Plaintiff\u2019s Response at 26 (citing <em>E.T. Horn Co., </em>945 F.2d at 1543).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">There the court defined \u201cwaste\u201d as \u201cmanufactured articles which have become useless for their original purpose...and fit only for re-manufacture into something else.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Plaintiff also cites to <em>Precision Specialty Metals v. United States, </em>24 CIT 1016, 1037 (2000) to argue that the court defined waste by a threshold question of whether the merchandise was \u201cpurposely produced\u201d or required \u201cremanufacture\u201d prior to exportation. <em>Id. </em>at 27. Plaintiff notes that oil refineries are \u201cnot in business to produce deodorizer distillate for its tocopherol or any other content,\u201d and that its relative value, as compared to the primary products derived from soybeans (soybean meal and crude soybean oil), is insignificant. <em>Id. </em>at 5. In fact, Plaintiff characterizes its production of DOD \u201ca reasonable cost recovery effort, akin to recycling spent material.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Defendant argues that DOD cannot be considered \u201cwaste\u201d because it is a \u201cpurposely sought by-product\u201d of soybean oil production which is \u201cmanipulated to maximize the tocopherol level.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Cross-Motion at 24; <em>see also </em>Defendant\u2019s Response at 17. Defendant challenges Plaintiff\u2019s characterization of DOD under <em>E.T. Horn Co., </em>arguing that DOD is not a manufactured article, and that DOD, albeit a residue of soybean oil manufacturing, is a product in its own right which \u201chas an actual use and does not become \u2018useless\u2019 even if that use is not exploited.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Response at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">\u201cWaste\u201d is a broad term which is for example defined as \u201cdamaged, defective, or superfluous material produced during the or left over from a manufacturing process or industrial operation; material not usable for the ordinary and main purpose of manufacture.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>2580 (3rd ed. 2002). This comports with the court\u2019s definition of \u201cwaste\u201d in <em>E.T. Horn </em>as a \u201cuseless\u201d product. <em>E.T. Horn, </em>945 F.2d at 1543.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Applying <em>E. T. Horn </em>here, Plaintiff fails to demonstrate that DOD is \u201cmanufactured\u201d, and that despite the multiple applications for which DOD is used the product is \u201cuseless\u201d and has to undergo \u201cremanu-facturing\u201d in order to become usable. As the court said, \u201c[because] something is a residue of a process does not automatically render the substance waste, entitled to entry duty-free. Changes in technology or demand can and do render what was once waste matter which is sought for its own sake.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Whereas Plaintiff claims that DOD is of little fiscal value as compared with the main oil products it distills, the mere fact that Plaintiff continues to extract DOD for sale is indicative that it is purposely sought, and not merely a waste product \u201cuseless for [its] original purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, whether a substance is classifiable as \u201cwaste\u201d is not linked to the financial worth of the product. Although it is obvious that DOD is an invariable by-product of soybean distillation, the argument that DOD is not \u201cspecifically sought\u201d is refuted by Plaintiff\u2019s own admission that \u201c[t]he market demands for vitamin E and other by-products obtained from DOD determines whether ADM will purchase and import DOD from its overseas suppliers.\u201d (Hart Aff. \u00b6 12). This statement is indicative that Plaintiff not only \u201ccomes upon\u201d DOD as a residue of oil distillation, but that DOD is purchased and imported in its own right for a specific and unrelated purpose. Accordingly, the court rejects Plaintiff\u2019s proposed classification of DOD in subheading 3825.61.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Deodorizer Distillate is Not Properly Classified under Subheading 3825.90 as a \u201cResidual Product\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">In the alternative, Plaintiff argues that DOD is classifiable as a \u201cresidual product\u201d or \u201cby-product\u201d of the manufacture of soybean oil and that the substance is properly classified under subheading 3825.90. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 9 (citing <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1931-32, 2580 (3rd ed. 2002)); Plaintiff\u2019s Response at 28-29. Plaintiff concedes that the term \u201cresidual products\u201d is not defined in the HTSUS or the ENs to any relevant section, but advocates that the terms are best construed by their \u201cplain, unqualified meanings.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 12. In addition, Plaintiff asserts that DOD is properly classified in subheading 3825.90 because it is a \u201cbasket provision\u201d which was not intended to be limited to the substances listed in the ENs. Plaintiff\u2019s Response at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Defendant, argues that the Explanatory Notes limit the scope of subheading 3825.90 to encompass only the residual products listed and therefore precludes classification \u00f3f DOD in this provision. Defendant\u2019s Cross-Motion at 26-27; Defendant\u2019s Response at 23. Defendant contends that no language in the subheading indicates that the \u25a0 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>provision be interpreted as open-ended, and that the specific addition of another substance in 2007, illustrates this. Defendant\u2019s Cross-Motion at 26-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">The question is whether \u201cresidual products\u201d under Heading 3825 encompasses DOD. Dictionary definitions speak to \u201cresidual products\u201d as a type of \u201cby-products,\u201d which currently are also covered by Heading 3824. <em>See </em>EN 38.24(B); <em>see also </em>discussion Section IV(C) <em>infra. </em>In Customs\u2019 ruling, it held that \u201cresidual products\u201d for purposes of Heading 3825 are \u201ctantamount to waste products,\u201d and therefore not inclusive of DOD. [\u00b6] 967288 at 5. According to dictionary definitions and the court\u2019s articulation in <em>Cargill, </em>the terms \u201cresidual products\u201d and \u201cby-products\u201d are often used interchangeably. <em>See Cargill, </em>318 F.Supp.2d at 1290. Therefore classification of DOD in subheading 3825.90 does not turn on whether the court finds that DOD is a \u201cresidual product\u201d or a \u201cby-product.\u201d The proper inquiry is whether subheading 3825.90 is a basket provision, and whether the subheading is limited tot he substances listed in the accompanying Explanatory Notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The Explanatory Notes to subheading 3825.90 list four specific substances under \u201cresidual products of the chemical or allied industries,\u201d namely alkaline iron oxide, residues from the manufacture of antibiotics, ammoniacal gas liquors and spent oxide, to which a fifth was added in 2007. EN 38.25 (2007). While recognizing that the Explanatory Notes were only meant as a guide in defining HTSUS tariff terms, there is no indication that other residual products were meant to be included in this provision. <em>See Bausch &amp; Lomb, </em>21 CIT 166, 174, 957 F. Supp. 281, 288 (1997) (\u201c[the Explanatory Notes are] generally indicative of proper interpretation of the various provisions of the Convention....\u201d). Whereas subheading 3825.90 mimics the language of a \u201cbasket provision\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> by containing the language \u201cnot elsewhere specified or included\u201d and \u201cother,\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s argument that subheading 3825.90 is a basket provision is not persuasive in light of the limited nature of the language in the Explanatory Notes. The ENs do not contain any language indicating that other substances may be included, as is its function as a basket provision for the merchandise at issue largely negated by the existence of Heading 3824. Heading 3824 specifically provides for chemical mixtures akin to DOD and the ENs explicitly encompass by-products of an unspecified chemical composition. Indeed, the addition of a fifth substance in the 2007 version of the HTSUS, again without the use of terms such as \u201cetc.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>or other language indicative that the list is inclusive of other, unnamed substances, suggests that the subheading was intended to be limited only to the listed substances.

In <em>Cargill </em>the court did not need to distinguish between \u201cchemical products and preparations\u201d and \u201cresidual products of the chemical or allied industries,\u201d but held that classification in subheading 3824.90.28 was proper because \u201cdeodorizer distillate is undisputedly a by-product of a chemical or allied industry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1290. Recognizing that the <em>Cargill </em>court was not faced with the issue of whether DOD was best classified as a \u201cby-product\u201d or \u201cresidual\u201d product, Customs in its ruling found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>the merchandise is more aptly described as a \u201cchemical preparation\u201d in Heading 3824 than a \u201cresidual product\u201d in Heading 3825, although it conceded that neither were defined in the HTSUS or the accompanying ENs. [\u00b6] 967288 at 4. Customs found that eliminating \u201cresidual products\u201d from Heading 3824 did not indicate an intent to preclude by-products from classification in Heading 3824. <em>Id. </em>at 5. Indeed, Customs points to the ENs to Heading 3824 which specifically provide for \u201cchemical products... obtained as by-products from the manufacture of other substances,\u201d and the list provided in the Explanatory Notes in which napthenic acids are listed as \u201cbyproducts of the refining of certain petroleum oils and of certain oils obtained from bituminous minerals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing EN 38.24(B)(1) (2002)). Customs also offered the dictionary definition of the term \u201cpreparation\u201d as \u201ca substance... prepared for a specific purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary </em>1789 (3rd ed. 1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Plaintiff argues that DOD is not classifiable in Heading 3824, because it is better defined as a \u201cwaste\u201d or \u201cresidual product\u201d in Heading 3825. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion is 22. Plaintiff refutes Defendant\u2019s distinction between Heading 3824 and 3825 which implies that byproducts may be commercially valuable and residual products may not, citing examples of named substances in Heading 3825 that are both valuable and further manufactured substances. <em>Id. </em>at 22-23. Additionally, Plaintiff contends that DOD is of lessened value in light of regulations that require manufacturers to leave higher levels of tocopherol in the edible oil, but that the substance is an unavoidable residue resulting from soybean distillation. <em>Id. </em>at 23-24.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Plaintiff argues that the real distinction between Heading 3824 and 3825 turns on whether the \u201cmerchandise is useful in its condition as generated in the production of something else.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24. Plaintiff notes that napthenic acid appears to have an immediate practical application, whereas DOD is prepared from oil residue via the process of steam stripping, and that tocopherols are then further extracted for the use in vitamin-E products. <em>Id. </em>at 24-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Defendant argues that Customs properly classified DOD under Heading 3824, its reasoning mirroring that of Customs. Defendant\u2019s Cross-Motion at 18. In response to Plaintiff\u2019s attempt to distinguish the two headings at issue, Defendant argues that the distinction is not properly illustrated by napthenic acid, as this substance also requires further manufacturing and therefore disproves Plaintiff\u2019s theory. <em>Id. </em>at 25. Moreover, Defendant argues that the focus of the court\u2019s enquiry must be whether the substance qualifies as a byproduct, as opposed to a waste product. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Classifying merchandise under a \u201cbasket\u201d provision is only appropriate when no other tariff terms cover the product more specifically. <em>EM Indus., Inc., </em>22 CIT at 165 (1998) (\u201cbasket\u201d or \u201cresidual\u201d provisions are intended as broad catch-all tariff terms for which \u201cthere [are] no more specifically applicable subheadings.\u201d). Basket provisions are generally only used where other applicable provisions have been excluded. <em>See Rollerblade, Inc., </em>282 F.3d at 1354.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Deodorizer distillate is properly classifiable as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">Chemical products and preparations of the chemical or allied industries (including those consisting of mixtures of natural products), not elsewhere specified or included: Mixtures containing 5 percent or more by weight of one or more aromatic or modified aromatic substances: Other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">HTSUS 3824.90.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The Explanatory Notes to Heading 3824 define such products as those \u201cwhose composition is not chemically defined, whether they are obtained as by-products of the manufacture of other substances.\u201d EN 38.24. Plaintiff submitted affidavits that attest to the fact that \u201c[d]e-odorizer distillate is a complex mixture of approximately 10% sterols and steryl esters, and approximately 10% tocopherols (collectively \u2018aromatic\u2019); mixed fatty acids (approximately 70-80%), including glyc-erides, hydrocarbons, oleic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid; and organic compounds including herbicides, pesticides, insecticides, dissolved gases, moisture, and other general impurities.\u201d (Mayfield Aff. 1 16). Plaintiff conceded that \u201cthere are no formal specifications of the composition of DOD, which is dependent on the source of the vegetable material and processing conditions,\u201d (Hart Aff. \u00b6 8), and that \u201c[t]he residue of deodorization is a complex mixture of chemicals....\u201d (Collins Aff. \u00b6 5). These statements suggest that DOD qualifies as a chemical product or preparation with a non-specific chemical composition.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">While Plaintiff agrees that DOD is a by-product of soybean distillation, it contends that not all by-products are classifiable in Heading 3824. Plaintiff\u2019s Response at 24-25; see <em>also The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>(4th ed. 2000) (a by-product is \u201csomething produced in the making of something else\u201d). This assertion is clearly validated by the creation of Heading 3825, which refers to \u201cresidual products\u201d that may also be construed as a type of \u201cbyproduct.\u201d However, because subheading 3825.90 is limited to the residual products listed, classification of DOD in subheading 3824.90.28 is proper. Thus, because DOD is not properly classified in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Heading 3807, subheading 3825.61, or subheading 3825.90, and in lieu of a more specific provision, Customs properly classified entries of DOD is subheading 3824.90.28.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">For the foregoing reasons Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED, Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED, and Plaintiff\u2019s Response and Cross-Motion is DENIED. Accordingly, Customs\u2019 classification of deodorizer distillate, CAS Number 68476-80-2, in HTSUS subheading 3824.90.28 is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-12\"> At oral argument, Plaintiff agreed that DOD contains \u201c5 percent or more by weight of one or more aromatic or modified aromatic substances.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b366-5\"> The Explanatory Notes to Heading 3824 state, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">The chemical products classified here are therefore products whose composition is not chemically defined, whether they are obtained as by-products of the manufacture of other substances (this applies, for example, to naphthenic acids) or prepared directly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">EN 38.24(B) (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b368-13\"> An <em>eo nomine </em>provision describes goods by name, in contrast to \u201cuse\u201d provisions that describe merchandise by their use. <em>Carl Zeiss, Inc., </em>195 F.3d at 1379.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\"> (A) RESIDUAL PRODUCTS OF THE CHEMICAL OR ALLIED INDUSTRIES, NOT ELSEWHERE SPECIFIED OR INCLUDED</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">(1) Alkaline iron oxide for the purification of gas (in particular, coal-gas) containing impure ferric oxide, obtained as a by-product from one of the processes of the extraction of aluminium from bauxite.
