The plaintiff challenges a determination by the U.S. International Trade Commission (\u201cITC\u201d or \u201cthe Commission\u201d) that the domestic industry is not materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of the subject imports. <em>See Diamond Sawblades and Parts Thereof from Chipa and Korea, </em>Investigation Nos. 731- TA-1092 and 1093 (Final), USITC Publication 3862 (July 2006) Pub. R. Doc. 249 <em>(\u201cFinal Determina</em>tion\u201d); <em>see also </em>71 Fed. Reg. 39128 (July 11,2006). The plaintiff argues that the ITC\u2019s determination is not supported by substantial evidence and otherwise not in accordance with law; the ITC opposes the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>tiff\u2019s motion. Defendant-Intervenors St. Gobain Abrasives, Inc., Ehwa Diamond Industrial Co., Ltd., and Shinhan Diamond Indus. Co., Ltd. have joined to urge that the ITC\u2019s determination be sustained. For the reasons stated below, the court will remand the matter to the Commission for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">On May 3, 2005, DSMC filed a petition with the Commission alleging material injury to domestic producers of diamond sawblades and parts thereof due to imports from the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cChina\u201d) and Korea. <em>See Diamond Sawblades and Parts Thereof from China and Korea, </em>70 Fed. Reg. 24612 (ITC May 12, 2005) (notice of institution of antidumping duty investigations and scheduling of preliminary phase investigations). The Commission issued a preliminary injury determination in August 2005, finding by a 6 to 0 vote that imports from China and Korea materially injured, or threatened to materially injure, the U.S. diamond sawblade industry. <em>See Diamond Sawblades and Parts Thereof from China and Korea, </em>Investigation Nos. 731-TA-1092 and 1093 (Preliminary) USITC Publication 3791 (August 2005) Pub. R. Doc. 96 <em>(\u201cPreliminary Determination\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">In July 2006, the ITC issued a final determination pursuant to Section 735(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(b). The Commission, by a vote of 4 to 2, found that the domestic industry was not materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of the cumulated subject imports from China and Korea. <em>Final Determination </em>at 24. The ITC found that although subject imports were entering the United States in significant volumes and significantly undersold the domestic like product, there was \u201cno causal nexus between the subject imports and the condition of the domestic industry.\u201d Id. at 29, 31, 36. The two dissenting commissioners agreed that the domestic industry is not currently materially injured by reason of the subject imports from China and Korea; however, contrary to the majority opinion, the dissent found that the domestic industry was threatened with material injury by reason of the subject imports. <em>Id. </em>at 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">\n<em>Summary of Relevant Findings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Diamond sawblades are circular cutting tools used to cut materials such as cement, marble, brick, tile, and stone. They typically range in size from 4-70\" in diameter, with sawblades in the 10-14\" category considered to be in the \u201cmid-range\u201d size. <em>ITC Staff Report, </em>Pub. R. Doc. 249 at 1-6. Diamond sawblades have an inner steel core and a diamond-impregnated outer rim or cutting surface. Depending on the application, the cutting surface can either be segmented or continu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>ous, and different manufacturing processes (i.e., sintering, soldering, laser welding, braising) are used to attach the diamond segment to the metal core. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Although the <em>ITC Staff Report </em>indicated that \u201cU.S. producers and importers offer thousands of different diamond sawblades,\u201d the Commission determined that \u201cdiamond sawblades and parts thereof\u201d constituted a single domestic like product. <em>Final Determination </em>at 6, <em>ITC Staff Report </em>at II-5. The Commission also found that there was \u201ca reasonable overlap of competition\u201d among the subject imports from China and Korea and the domestic like product such that a cumulative assessment of volume and price effects of the subject imports was appropriate.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Final Determination </em>at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The domestic industry lost market share during the Period of Investigation (\u201cPOI\u201d) (from 2003 to 2005) in terms of both quantity and value. By value, the domestic industry\u2019s market share for finished diamond sawblades fell from [ ] % in 2003 to [ ]% in 2005. Manufacturers of sawblade components also lost market share, but to a lesser extent. <em>Final Determination </em>(Confidential version) Doc. 549 (List 2) at 26-27. Aggregate operating income of the domestic industry fell a total of [ ] % during the POI, as did the domestic industry\u2019s aggregate operating income margins (falling [ ]%) and aggregate return on assets (falling [ ]%). However, the ITC noted that cashflow increased slightly and that the domestic industry was not prevented from making significant capital expenditures during the POI. <em>Id. </em>at 37. In the end, the ITC concluded that \u201ceven after these modest declines, the domestic industry has remained highly profitable.\u201d <em>Final Determination </em>at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Subject imports from China and Korea increased market share during the POI, both in terms of quantity and value. By value, subject imports\u2019 market share increased from 27.7% in 2003 to 40.0% in 2005; on quantity basis market share was 61.2% in 2003, increasing to 75.1% in 2005. As to sawblade components, subject imports market share was mixed, gaining for cores, losing for segments. <em>Id. </em>at 25-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Overall demand for finished sawblades and sawblade components increased during the POI. <em>Id. </em>at 24. By quantity, U.S. consumption of finished sawblades increased from 4.5 million units in 2003 to 6.8 million units in 2005; by value, U.S. consumption of finished saw-blades increased from $187.4 million in 2003 to $214.9 million in 2005. <em>Id. </em>Demand for diamond sawblades is derived from the demand for construction projects involving the cutting of various aggregates. During the POI, the Commission noted that there were differences in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>the trends for consumption of diamond sawblades by diameter: Consumption of 7-10\" diameter sawblades experienced the highest rate of growth during the POI (30.7%), whereas consumption of midrange (10 \u2014 14\" diameter) blades increased 18.6%, and large blades (14\" diameter and larger) increased by 12.4%. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\">The Commission found these demand patterns to be relevant in explaining the lack of competitive overlap between the subject imports and the domestic product. The ITC determined that the market focus of the subject imports had been the demand for smaller diam-' eter, general use sawblades, which saw significant growth due to residential and home improvements construction, whereas the market focus of U.S. producers had been the demand for larger diameter, professional-use sawblades used in non-residential construction (i.e., road, infrastructure, and office building) which saw \u201crelatively flat\u201d growth during the POI. <em>Id. </em>at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">1. General Market Segmentation: \u201cProfessional Use\u201d vs. \u201cGeneral Use\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">In finding that the subject imports focused on different market segments than those served by the domestic industry, the ITC determined that the diamond sawblade industry appeared to be segregated into a substantial number of noncompetitive market segments. Broadly speaking, however, diamond sawblades could be divided into the two categories of \u201cprofessional use\u201d and \u201cgeneral use.\u201d <em>ITC Staff Report </em>at 1-10. \u201cProfessional use\u201d sawblades are (1) sold to end users in the road and commercial construction industry; (2) largely segmented blades that are greater than 14\"; and (3) \u201ctypically custom engineered for the industry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1-11. \u201cGeneral use\u201d blades however, are \u201cproduced for contractors and [do-it-yourself (\u201cDIY\u201d)] end users.\u201d End users in this category<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> would include \u201cmasons, concrete contractors, hardscape contractors, plumbing contractors,\u201d and the like, as well as, presumably, the DIY user who purchases the blade from a \u201cbig box\u201d retailer such as Lowes or Home Depot. The Commission\u2019s staff report did not provide a precise definition of \u201cgeneral use\u201d sawblades but indicated that such would include \u201csegmented and continuous rim blades with diameters of 14 inches or less but the range may extend up to 20 inches.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">As noted above, the ITC found that sales to the established \u201cprofessional\u201d market had been dominated by the domestic industry and sales to the expanding \u201cgeneral use/DIY market\u201d were dominated by the subject imports. The ITC found that the foreign producers had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>been unable to make inroads into the professional use market due to high demand for customer service and highly customized sawblades in the professional industry. <em>Final Determination </em>at 37. Additional evidence suggested that the domestic industry was likewise prevented from making inroads into the small-blade market because they did not produce lower-cost sintered blades. Hearing Transcript (\u201cTr.\u201d), Pub. Doc. 179 at 88-89, 242-52. The ITC concluded essentially that, try as they might, neither foreign not domestic producers had been able to make much of an inroad into the others\u2019 \u201cturf\u201d during the POI, and therefore found competition \u201climited\u201d between subject and domestic diamond sawblade sales. <em>See Final Determination </em>at 36-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">However, the Commission ultimately declined to adopt the \u201cprofessional\u201d vs. \u201cgeneral use\u201d market segmentation analysis (which was advocated by the Respondents). The Commission noted that \u201cwithin the finished diamond sawblade industry, there is no consensus as to which diamond sawblades categorically serve a particular [\u201cgeneral use\u201d or \u201cprofessional\u201d] market.\u201d <em>ITC Staff Report </em>at 1-10. Hence, the Commission proceeded to a more detailed (and more measurable) market segmentation analysis that examined the apparent components used to describe \u201cprofessional\u201d or \u201cgeneral use\u201d: blade size, manufacturing process, and channels of distribution/end user.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">2. In-Depth Market Segmentation Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">a. Market Segmentation Based on Physical Attribute</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The Commission determined that diamond sawblades may be categorized by (1) \u201cthe physical attributes of the finished blade\u201d (\u201cblade type\u201d); (2) \u201cthe physical attributes of the diamond section\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe method of joining the core to the diamond segments\u201d (\u201cmanufacturing process\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 1-6. \u201cBlade type\u201d refers to whether the blade cutting surface is segmented or continuous, which may dictate the application for which the blade is used. <em>Id. </em>The attributes of the diamond section relate to the concentration, quality, and size of the diamonds as well as the bond matrix that attaches the diamonds to the blade. <em>Id. </em>at 1-9. Manufacturing process refers to the process (sintering, soldering, laser welding, braising) by which the diamond segments are attached to the metal core. <em>Id. </em>at 1-5. Diamond saw-blades that have segments laser welded to the core are noted to be stronger, have fewer failure rates, and are more reliable than sintered sawblades. <em>Id. </em>at 1-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">The Commission found that differences in blade type and manufacturing process played an important role in limiting competition because the subject imports were concentrated in blade types and manufacturing processes not widely produced by the domestic industry. For example, although the majority of both domestically produced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>and subject-import sawblades were \u201claser-welded segmented product,\u201d a \u201csignificant\u201d percentage (31.4%) of Chinese and (27.6%) Korean sales during the POI consisted of sintered or continuous rim sawblades, which are almost nonexistent in the domestic industry (less than 1% of sales). <em>Final Determination </em>at 21. Likewise, the ITC found that a \u201csignificant\u201d percentage (15%) of the domestic industry\u2019s sales consisted of soldered or braised segmented products, where the subject imports had very little presence. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\">b. Market Segmentation Based Blade Diameter</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">The ITC also determined to segment the diamond sawblades market by blade diameter because different size sawblades are used in different applications and on different types of cutting equipment. <em>See id. </em>at 28; <em>Confidential Staff Report, </em>Doc. 441(List 2) at 11-48\u2014 11-50 (indicating that sawblades of different diameters are generally not interchangeable).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The ITC found attenuated competition in terms of blade diameter, noting that \u201cnearly half\u201d of U.S. shipments were in sizes 14\" and larger, whereas only 7% of the imports from China and 14% of the imports from Korea were in that size range. <em>Final Determination </em>at 27. The ITC concluded, \u201c[t]his indicates that, based on size considerations alone, the majority of domestic shipments of finished U.S. diamond sawblades were in sizes in which the subject imports had a relatively small presence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, nearly half of subject imports\u2019 U.S. shipment value was for sawblades less than 10\" in diameter (50.2% from China, 44.4% from Korea) while only 6.3% of U.S. product shipments were for that size range, so \u201ca very substantial portion of subject imports were shipped in sizes in which the domestic product\u2019s presence was relatively small.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">c. Market Segmentation Based on Channels of Distribution</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The ITC also found segmentation appropriate based on differences in the channels of distribution. <em>Id. </em>at 25. The Commission\u2019s first compilation of data indicates that the majority of all U.S., Chinese, and Korean sawblades are sold in the \u201cdistributors\u201d channel of distribution. <em>See ITC Staff Report </em>at Table 1-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">However, the ITC further segmented the \u201cdistributors\u201d category into two subcategories: \u201cbranded distributors\u201d and \u201cnonbranded distributors.\u201d The ITC explained that \u201cbranded\u201d distributors purchased/ sold diamond sawblades under their own names while \u201cother\u201d distributors sold only diamond sawblades under suppliers\u2019 names. <em>Final Determination </em>at 22 n.157. In its analysis of certain purchaser questionnaire responses, the ITC determined that there were differences in the market focus of these distributors, and concluded that different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>distributors served different end users. For example, the Commission found that \u201cbranded\u201d distributors sold a wider range of small-diameter sawblades, a smaller range of large-diameter products, and a broader range of different sawblade types, to both end users and retailers, and that \u201cother\u201d (i.e., non-branded) distributors were more likely to buy large-diameter merchandise and sell them only to end-users. <em>Id. </em>at 27-28, n.193. Producer and importer questionnaire responses also indicated differences with respect to the types of contractors that purchased sawblades from branded versus other distributors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The ITC determined that U.S. producer shipments were made primarily to the \u201cother distributor\u201d (36.1%) and \u201cend user\u201d (including professional construction firms) (46.2%) distribution channel(s) and that these two distribution channels predominantly served professional construction users of diamond sawblades for nonresidential construction activities, <em>e.g., </em>road construction and infrastructure projects. <em>Id. </em>at 23-24. By contrast, Chinese and Korean sales were directed primarily to \u201cbranded\u201d distributors (47.9% and 44.8%, respectively) and original equipment manufacturers (18.1% and 27.9%, respectively). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Based on these findings, the ITC concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">even when subject imports and U.S.-produced finished diamond sawblades are sold in similar size ranges, the end users to which the blades are sold generally differ, with the majority of subject diamond sawblade imports sold to branded distributors and the majority of the domestically-produced sawblades sold to other distributors. Accordingly, competition between the subject imports and the domestic like product is limited, largely by reason of differences in the mixes of blade diameters and customers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-7\"><em>Final Determination </em>at 27-28 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">\n<em>Jurisdiction and Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">The court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c) (2000). The court will examine the ITC\u2019s final negative determination in an antidumping duty investigation to determine whether it is \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(i) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f(i)(3)(B), the Commission is directed to \u201cinclude in a final determination of injury an explanation of the basis for its determination that addresses relevant arguments that are made by interested parties who are parties to the investigation or review (as the case may be) concerning volume, price effects, and impact on the industry of imports of the subject merchandise.\u201d 19 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f(i)(3)(B) (2000). <em>Cf. United States v. Nova Scotia Food Prods., </em>568 F.2d 240, 252 (2d Cir. 1977) (holding that \u201c[i]t is not in keeping with the rational [agency] process to leave vital questions, raised by comments which are of cogent materiality, completely unanswered.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\">In its review of FTC's determination, the Court must consider whether the agency has \u201cexamine [d] the relevant data and articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">For purposes of determining the degree of harm to a domestic industry from dumping, \u201cmaterial injury\u201d is \u201charm which is not inconsequential, immaterial, or unimportant.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7)(A) (2000). To make that determination, the ITC is directed to consider the volume, the effect on prices in the U.S. for domestic like product, and the impact of subject merchandise as well as other \u201crelevant economic factors ... and conditions of competition that are distinctive to the affected industry.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(7)(C)(iii)(2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\"><em>A. </em>Limited Competition Finding</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The principal point of controversy with respect to the negative material injury determination concerns the Commission\u2019s finding of attenuated competition. DSMC\u2019s argues that the findings of limited competition based on blade size and based on channels of distribution are erroneous and unsupported by substantial evidence of record. DSMC states that the finding of limited competition by blade size is contradicted by evidence showing that the domestic industry and the subject importers both sold the greatest number of sawblades in the 12-14\" range. Pl.\u2019s Reply Br. at 4. DSMC argues further that the <em>Final Determination </em>contains a material misstatement in this regard because there the ITC stated that the greatest degree of competitive overlap was in the 10-12\" diameter range, when the data clearly showed that the greatest degree of competitive overlap was actually in the 12-14\" range. <em>Id. </em>DSMC contends that a material error of this nature requires remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">As to channels of distribution, Plaintiff contends that the ITC\u2019s findings as to the existence and importance of \u201cdistinct\u201d channels of distribution are inconsistent with the facts of record, and that both branded and non-branded distributors sold to the same customer base, primarily general contractors. Pl.\u2019s Br. at 8-10; <em>see Final Determination </em>at 44 (dissent); Confidential Doc. 549 at 46 n.29.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>The Commission asserts that it reasonably found that competition was limited during the POI and that the <em>Final Determination </em>should be affirmed. Def.\u2019s Br. at 1. As to the plaintiff\u2019s material misstatement argument, the Commission admits that the reference to 10-12\" saw-blades in the <em>Final Determination </em>was a misstatement, but contends that it was a harmless drafting mistake. The Commission notes that the data contained in the <em>Final Determination </em>shows that the greatest percentage of competitive overlap was in the 12-14\" diameter range, and that ITC \u201cobviously\u201d understood the degrees of overlap within the respective 12-14\" and 10-12\" diameter categories. <em>Id. </em>at 17. As to channels of distribution, the ITC responds that it properly segmented those channels and that the data supported a conclusion of limited competition. <em>Id. </em>at 19-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The Commission also notes that DSMC did not discuss the differences in the cutting edges of the sawblades (whether they are continuous or segmented) and the manner by which the cutting edges are attached to their core (whether by sintering, laser-welding, soldering or braising). <em>Id. </em>at 21-22. According to the ITC, these product type differences acted to further limit competition between the subject imports and the domestic products. <em>Id. </em>at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">1. Material Misstatement in ITC\u2019s Finding of Limited Competition</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The court cannot agree that the ITC\u2019s misstatement regarding the 10-12\" size range was material to its determination or that remand is required on this ground. \u201cWhere a subsidiary finding is unfounded, the court will remand the case...only if the court is in substantial doubt whether the administrative agency would have made the same ultimate finding with the erroneous finding removed from the picture.\u201d <em>U.S. Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>18 CIT 1190, 1215, 873 F.Supp. 673, 696 (1994) (quoting <em>Kurzon v. United States Postal Serv., </em>539 F.2d 788, 796 (1st Cir. 1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Here, substantial evidence of record indicates that the ITC understood that the greatest competitive overlap was in the 12-14\" range of sawblades, not the 10-12\" range. <em>See Final Determination </em>at 27 n.193 (the \u201csize range showing the most overlap between U.S. produced and subject imported diamond sawblades\u201d was \u201csize range greater than 12\" to 14\" diameter\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 22 (noting \u201coverlap among the subject imports and the domestic like product in the 12-inch to 14-inch diameter range\u201d); <em>see also Confidential Staff Report </em>at Tables 1-1 &amp; II \u2014 1, E-l-E-3). Further, the ITC\u2019s competition analysis in terms of blade diameter focused on the lack of competitive overlap in small-diameter (less than 10\u201d) and large-diameter (larger than 14\u201d) sawblades; because mid-range blades would include 12-14\" blades, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>well as 10-1\" blades, such an error would not affect the Commission\u2019s competition finding. Accordingly, the court finds that ITC\u2019s misstatement was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"A19\">2. Finding Limited Competition Based on Sawblade Diameter</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">The court finds that the Commission\u2019s conclusion of attenuated competition based on sawblade diameter is not supported by substantial evidence of record. The Commission noted correctly that (based on value) \u201cnearly half\u201d of the domestic sawblades were sold in sizes 14\" and larger, as compared to only 7% of the subject imports, and that \u201cnearly half of the subject imports\u201d were blades of 10\" or less, a size range that occupied only 6.3% of the domestic industry. However, this conclusion ignores the fact that the <em>other half </em>of domestic saw-blades were sold in midrange (10-14\u201d) sizes, where, coincidentally, \u201cnearly half\u201d of the subject imports are also concentrated. This point is illustrated in the following table, found in the <em>ITC Staff Report:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">TABLE I-l-Continued</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Diamond sawblades: U.S. producers\u2019 and importers\u2019 U.S. shipments, by blade diameter, 2003-05</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b163-124\"><em>ITC Staff Report </em>at 1-8. Although the data contained in the above chart does support ITC\u2019s finding that \u201cnearly half\u201d of the domestic industry shipments were in sawblades of 14\" or larger (specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>46.9% in 2003, 48.5% in 2004, and 50.6% in 2005) the data also indicate that an almost equal proportion of the U.S. industry was focused on so-called \u201cmidrange\u201d sizes of 10-14\" blades (specifically 46.5% in 2003, 45.1% in 2004, and 43.4% in 2005). As noted above, more subject imports were concentrated in the .two midrange categories than the two small-blade categories. The ITC fails to offer an explanation as to how this data reflects attenuated competition based on blade size.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">3. Finding Limited Competition Based on Manufacturing Process</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Similarly, ITC\u2019s finding of attenuated competition based on manufacturing process is unsupported by substantial evidence of record and cannot be sustained. The ITC noted as significant the fact that \u201ca significant portion of the subject imports are produced using a sin-tering process to join component parts, whereas very little sintering is used in the U.S. industry.\u201d <em>Final Determination </em>at 26. Were the data to show that the subject imports used sintering uniformly accross all blade sizes, this might show attenuated commpetition; however, this is not the case. In fact, ITC\u2019s data indicate that the vast majority of sintered blades were confined to smaller diameter sawblades, where, as noted above, the domestic industry had little presence to begin with. On the other hand, the data indicate that, in the midrange sawblades where most of the overlap occurred, the vast majority of the subject imports were not sintered, but laser-welded, just as U.S.produced blades were.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">TABLE II-l</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Diamond sawblades: Sizes and method of joining core and segment, by country, weighted averages, 2004</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b165-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"Af\"><em>Preliminary Determination </em>at II-3. As the table above indicates, sawblades between 10-14\" in diameter are predominantly laser-welded, regardless of origin. Hence, the finding that sintered blades typically do not compete with the laser welded variety only underscores the lack of competition in smaller diameter blades by further differentiating the imported product from that manufactured by the domestic industry. The ITC offers no explanation as to how its data, which indicate that foreign and domestic sawblades in the midrange sizes are both laser welded and segmented, show attenuated competition.</p>\n<p id=\"AWu\">4. Finding Limited Competition Based on Channels of Distribution</p>\n<p id=\"AVx\">The court finds that the Commission has failed to explain adequately its conclusions regarding differences in channels of distribution. Although the data presented support a conclusion that (as indicated in the <em>ITC Staff Report, </em>Table 1-3) the majority of all U.S., Chinese and Korean sawblades are sold through \u201cdistributors,\u201d the Commission does not adequately explain its conclusion that \u201cbranded distributors\u201d and \u201cother distributors\u201d served different end users.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-56\">Indeed, the <em>ITC Staff Report </em>and the <em>Final Determination </em>contain a paucity of evidence demonstrating that these distributors actually served different end users. Footnote 193 of the <em>Final Determination </em>indicates that branded distributors reportedly sold (1) \u201ca larger range of smaller products\u201d than nonbranded distributors; (2) \u201ca smaller range of larger diameter products\u201d than nonbranded distributors; and (3) a broader range of sawblade types (laser-welded segmented, sin-tered continuous-rim, soldered/brazed, etc.) than nonbranded distributors. <em>Final Determination </em>at 27, n.193. The Commission noted further that \u201cthe branded distributors sold to both end users and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>resellers, the latter, in turn, selling to end users, whereas the other distributors reported selling to only end users.\u201d Finally, the Commission observed that the various suppliers disagreed as to \u201cwhat constitutes professional construction end users of sawblades\u201d which suggests \u201cdifferences in the types of contractors that the responding... distributors refer to as their customers.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">The court is unable to conclude that these observations explain adequately the Commission\u2019s rationale for finding a meaningful difference between \u201cbranded\u201d and \u201cnonbranded\u201d distributors. The propensity of a distributor to sell \u201ca larger range of smaller products\u201d and fewer large-diameter sawblades, does not, by itself, offer any insight as to how sales to that distributor attenuates competition in regard to <em>midrange </em>blades. Likewise, the fact that these distributors sold \u201ca broader range of sawblades types\u201d is neither surprising nor enlightening; given that it is only the smaller blades that are almost exclusively of the sintered/continuous rim variety, distributors selling a large range of smaller products would necessarily end up with more sawblade types. The only data presented by the Commission that provide a colorable argument for the notion that these distributors may have served different customer types is the cryptic observation that distributors disagreed as to \u201cwhat constitutes professional construction end users of sawblades\u201d which suggests \u201cdifferences in the types of contractors that the responding... distributors refer to as their customers.\u201d Unfortunately, without a substantial amount of development and explanation, this comment confuses the matter even more: How can the ITC draw a conclusion as to who the \u201cend user\u201d is if the suppliers themselves are unable to do so? Moreover, the ITC offers no explanation as to why it supports a finding as to who \u201cdistributors refer to as their customers\u201d with a citation to \u201cU.S. <em>producer and importer </em>questionnaire responses.\u201d <em>Final Determination </em>at 28, n.193 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the court is unable to conclude that the Commission\u2019s explanation provided \u201ca rational connection between the facts found and the choice made,\u201d and remand is required. <em>State Farm, </em>463 U.S. at 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">II. Price Effects Finding</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">A. Failure to Discuss Evidence and Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">DSMC asserts that the price effects finding is unsupported by record evidence and otherwise not in accordance with law because the Commission failed to address material evidence and arguments presented on the record that show the true extent of competition and price effects. Pl.\u2019s Br. at 12. Specifically, DSMC points to (1) evidence of \u201chundreds of pages of catalogues and offers to sell in the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>States\u201d that allegedly demonstrated that Chinese and Korean producers sold diamond sawblades directly competitive with those produced by the domestic industry; (2) evidence regarding the closure of two domestic-like-product plants due to import competition; (3) domestic producer testimony that subject imports compete head to head against the domestically produced product and caused significant harm <em>(see </em>TV. at 165-66 (testimony of Mr. Wolters); <em>see also id. </em>at 20 (testimony of Mr. Garrison); 38-39 (testimony of Ms. O\u2019Day)); and (4) testimony in regard to customers \u201cswitching\u201d to Chinese and Korean products because of price <em>(id. </em>at 140 (testimony of Mr. Edmond)).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\">The court is not persuaded that the ITC\u2019s failure to discuss this evidence in the <em>Final Determination </em>was error. The Commission is not required to make written findings of all the evidence it considers. <em>Negev Phosphates, Ltd. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, </em>12 CIT 1074, 1083, 699 F. Supp. 938, 947 (1988) (citation omitted). It is well established that \u201cabsent some showing to the contrary, the Commission is presumed to have considered all of the evidence in the record,\u201d and this is particularly true \u201cwhere the facts allegedly ignored were presented to the Commission at a[n] open hearing.\u201d <em>National Ass\u2019n of Mirror Mfrs. v. United States, </em>12 CIT 771, 779, 696 F.Supp. 642, 648 (1988). Moreover, the plaintiff has failed to present any argument that the evidence to which it refers is so significant as to \u201cseriously undermine\u201d the ITC\u2019s reasoning and conclusions on the issue. <em>Cf. Altyx Inc., v. United States, </em>25 CIT 1100, 1117-18, 167 F.Supp. 2d 1353, 1374 (2001) (holding that the ITC must address evidence that \u201cseriously undermines its reasoning and conclusions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">B. Failure to Investigate Lost Sales and Lost Revenue Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Plaintiff contends that the ITC \u201cimpermissibly failed to investigate\u201d \u201cmillions of dollars of lost sales and lost revenue allegations\u201d that were submitted during the investigation. Pl.\u2019s Br. at 27-28. Specifically, the plaintiff asserts that the ITC\u2019s rejection of several affidavits on the ground that they lacked specificity is not supported in the record and \u201ca product of extremely arbitrary and capricious decision-making.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28. Plaintiff alleges that the information contained in the rejected affidavits was \u201cat least as detailed as that provided in other allegations\u201d that the ITC chose to confirm, and asserts that the Commission \u201chad a duty to at least contact the customer named in the allegations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The Commission argues that it had \u201cample reason\u201d for not investigating the lost sales allegations on the ground that they were incomplete. The Commission notes that, on more than one occasion, it requested that the plaintiff submit specific information pertaining to \u201cthe name of the customer..., the name of the specific product(s) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>covered by the allegation, the date of sale, the sales quantity involved, the prices offered by the competing domestic and import suppliers, the final price of the sale, and the country of origin.\u201d Def.\u2019s Br. at 33-34. In spite of these requests, the plaintiff never provided the information. <em>Id. </em>at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Under the current posture of this case, the court cannot agree that the Commission\u2019s failure to investigate the lost sales allegations constitutes a remandable error. This Court has noted on several occasions, that \u201c[t]he Commission has broad discretion to pursue an investigation in a manner that will provide substantial evidence to support its determinations,\u201d and that \u201c[t]here is no minimum standard set by Congress to measure the thoroughness of an investigation by the Commission.\u201d <em>U.S. Steel Group v. United States, </em>18 CIT 1190, 1218, 873 F.Supp. 673, 698 (citing <em>Granges Metallverken, </em>13 CIT at 481, 716 F.Supp. at 25, <em>send. Atlantic Sugar, Ltd. v. United States, </em>744 F.2d 1556, 1561 (Fed. Cir.1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">However, the Commission is not without responsibility to procure relevant evidence of this nature; there have been instances where the Court has remanded ITC determinations based on a failure by the agency to investigate less-than-complete allegations of lost sales. <em>See, e.g., USX Corp. v. United States, 11 </em>CIT 82, 655 F.Supp. 487 (1987). It is important to note, however, that the remand in <em>USX Corp. </em>was not premised on ITC\u2019s duty to procure all reasonably available information. Instead,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">[i]t was the Commission\u2019s sole reliance on the absence of confirmed allegations \u201cin the face of steadily rising import volume and proven margins of underselling\u201d that rendered the Commission\u2019s determination unsupported by substantial evidence without further investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-7\"><em>Czestochowa (Stalexport) v. United States, </em>11 CIT 758, 785-86, 890 F.Supp. 1053, 1075 (1995) (quoting <em>USX Corp., </em>11 CIT at 86, 655 F. Supp. at 491). <em>Csestochowa, USX Corp., </em>as well <em>as Allegheny Ludlum Corp. v. United States, </em>287 F.3d 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2002) indicate that although the Commission \u201chas broad discretion\u201d in its pursuit of information for an investigation, the Court will not uphold a determination that relies solely on the absence of information that the Commission chose not to pursue. In this matter, the ITC is cautioned that the information contained in the lost sales allegations may be of greater importance on remand, and that some investigation of the incomplete allegations may then be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>C. The ITC\u2019s Price-Effects Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\">The Commission found that underselling by the subject imports was significant during the POI, but that it did not have a significant effect on prices for the domestic product. <em>See Final Determination </em>at 31 (noting that subject imports undersold the domestic product in 301 out of 360 observations by margins of up to 83.65 %). The Commission based this determination on, <em>inter alia </em>: (1) a finding that, in many cases, domestic prices fell in conjunction with increased volume, suggesting \u201cprice/volume tradeoffs that reflect a broad range of factors unrelated to subject imports\u201d; (2) the importance of \u201cnonprice factors\u201d indicated in questionnaire responses; and (3) data showing that, in some cases domestic prices increased during the POI or decreased while subject import prices rose or stayed the same. As stated in the <em>Final Determination, </em>the Commission noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-4\">[i]n 12 of 17 combinations in which U.S. producers\u2019 prices trended downward over the period, the downward prices were accompanied by increased volumes of the U.S. product over the period, suggesting price/volume tradeoffs unrelated to subject imports, including competition among domestic producers or demand conditions affecting only certain end users.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 31. The Commission then found that, \u201cgiven the limited competition between the subject imports and the domestic like product, subject imports have not had a significant role in the limited price suppression may have occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Plaintiff argues that the ITC\u2019s price-trends analysis is unsupported by the substantial record evidence because the ITC\u2019s data does not contain the necessary information to show either that the volume increase compensated for the lower prices, or that the declines could be attributed to competition between domestic producers.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The court agrees to the extent that the ITC\u2019s analysis, without further elaboration, cannot reasonably be said to support the result reached. In the common understanding of a price/volume tradeoff, the increased volume of sales must be sufficient to offset the reduced operating profit per unit. That is, it is rather a price/volume/pro/ii tradeoff.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, as the plaintiff correctly points out, the Commission\u2019s finding of a price/volume tradeoff appears to be devoid of any data indicating what the operating profit per unit was in each case. In its brief, the ITC contends that \u201c[s]ince the data do[ ] indicate...that the industry increased its sales volumes for the majority of products on which it lowered prices, and since increased sales volume is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>positive indicator of the industry\u2019s condition, the Commission reasonably found the industry made a \u2018price/volume tradeoff\u2019 for these products.\u201d Def.\u2019s Br. at 31-32. Unfortunately, this explanation ignores completely the question of whether the volume increase was an adequate \u201ctradeoff\u201d for the lowered prices. Without further elucidation as to the Commission\u2019s definition of a \u201cprice/ volume tradeoff,\u201d the court is unable to find that the ITC has provided a \u201creasoned explanation\u201d for its finding in this regard. On remand, the Commission must provide a more thorough explanation for this finding, as well as an explanation as to how the purported price/volume tradeoffs would indicate competition among domestic producers.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">To the extent that the Commission attributed the falling prices to competition among domestic producers, the Commission appears to have based this very significant finding upon the data referenced in a single footnote contained in the report.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Final Determination </em>at 31, n.224. The court cannot find that this single footnote, without further explanation, constitutes either \u201csubstantial evidence of record\u201d or \u201ca reasoned explanation\u201d for the ITC\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">III. Findings as to Volume, Impact, and Threat of Material Injury</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Finally, DSMC contends that most of the Commission\u2019s findings must be remanded because they are based, at least in part, on its erroneous finding of attenuated competition. DSMC contends that, in light of that error, (1) the volume finding, (2) the price-effects determination, (3) the impact finding, and (4) the threat analysis all must be remanded because they are based in part upon the flawed limited competition finding and are otherwise unsupported by substantial evidence of record. Pl.\u2019s Br. at 17, 19, 30, 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The court agrees with the plaintiff\u2019s assertion in this regard. The Commission appears to have relied, at least in part, on the attenuated-competition finding for each of the above-referenced determinations. <em>See Final Determination </em>at 30 (concluding that, given the finding of attenuated competition, the \u201csignificant volume has not had a significant impact on the prices or performance of the domestic producers.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 35-36 (noting that \u201cprevailing conditions of competition...indicated that the adverse effects of the subject imports is not significant.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 36-37 (concluding that the domestic industry is not vulnerable because of strong demand and \u201climited overlap in direct competition\u201d with the subject imports).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Because the Commission\u2019s findings rest, in part, upon \u201cfindings of subsidiary fact, or inferences therefrom\u201d that the court deems unsupportable, the court is in \u201csubstantial doubt\u201d whether the Commission \u201cwould have made the same ultimate finding with the erroneous findings removed from the picture.\u201d <em>U.S. Steel Corp., </em>18 CIT at 1215, 873 F.Supp. at 696. Accordingly, these issues must be remanded for reconsideration as well.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">This matter is hereby remanded to the ITC for further consideration consistent with this opinion. The ITC shall file its decision not later than April 4, 2008. Plaintiff will have 15 days from the filing of the decision to respond. Defendants may reply within 10 days thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b156-8\"> The Commission noted that although the product differences in diamond sawblades had \u201cimportant implications for our assessment of causation,\u201d the general overlap in competition was sufficient to warrant cumulation. <em>Final Determination </em>at 22.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b157-8\"> \u201cHardscape\u201d commonly refers to the portion of a building\u2019s grounds that consists of parking lots, patios, retaining walls, or walkways.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b169-8\"> <em>See generally </em>Paul A.
