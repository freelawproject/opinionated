For the reasons set forth below, the court denies Plaintiffs\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-13\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b44-14\">In March 2005 the Commission instituted five-year reviews (\u201csunset reviews\u201d) of the antidumping duty orders on PSF from Korea and Taiwan. After the sunset reviews commenced, Plaintiffs (importers of PSF) discovered evidence that some domestic producers of PSF had allegedly conspired to fix PSF prices and allocate customers during the original period of investigation and part of the sunset review period. Plaintiffs were eager to share this information with the Commission because a comparable revelation in another proceeding had led the Commission to rescind the original injury determinations in that proceeding. <em>See Ferrosilicon From Brazil, China, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine, and Venezuela, </em>Inv. Nos. 303-TA-23, 731-TA-566-570 and 731-TA-641 (Reconsideration), USITC Pub. 3218 (Aug. 1999) at 3, 8 <em>(\u201cFerrosilicon </em>Reconsideration\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-15\">In the <em>Ferrosilicon Reconsideration </em>the Commission learned of a criminal price-fixing conspiracy among the domestic ferrosilicon producers through the Brazilian ferrosilicon producers\u2019 request for a changed circumstances review pursuant to Section 751(b) of the Tariff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Act of 1930, as amended, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(b) (2000).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Troubled by the revelation of an antitrust conspiracy affecting pricing in the domestic ferrosilicon market, the Commission took the unprecedented step of <em>sua sponte </em>suspending the changed circumstances proceedings and commencing \u201creconsideration\u201d proceedings to review the original injury determinations underlying the antidumping and countervailing duty orders on ferrosilicon. <em>Ferrosilicon From Brazil, China, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine, and Venezuela, </em>64 Fed. Reg. 28,212 (Int\u2019l Trade Comm\u2019n May 25, 1999) (notice of suspension of changed circumstances review and commencement of reconsideration proceeding). In the course of those reconsiderations, the Commission discovered that in the original investigations the domestic ferrosilicon producers had misrepresented that the \u201cU.S. ferrosilicon market was driven by unfettered price competition,\u201d when in fact, \u201cthree ferrosili-con producers, representing a significant majority of 1993 U.S. production, had been convicted of conspiring to fix domestic prices of commodity ferrosilicon\u201d during a \u201csubstantial portion of the time period on which the Commission based its original determination.\u201d <em>Ferrosilicon Reconsideration </em>at 3, 8. Because \u201c[t]he Commission\u2019s statute and longstanding Commission precedent place the nature of price competition at the center of its injury analysis,\u201d <em>id., </em>the Commission concluded that the \u201cactions by the domestic producers seriously undermined the integrity of the Commission\u2019s proceedings and compromised the deliberative process, and in a broader sense, constituted an abuse of the unfair trade laws [the Commission] administer [s].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">The Commission ultimately reversed its original injury determinations and issued negative injury determinations for each of the fer-rosilicon investigations. <em>Id. </em>at 1, 4. The United States Department of Commerce (\u201cCommerce\u201d) subsequently \u201crescinded\u201d the antidumping and countervailing duty orders covering the subject imports, explaining that the Commission\u2019s negative injury determinations on reconsideration had \u201crendered [the orders] legally invalid from the date of issuance.\u201d <em>Ferrosilicon From Brazil, Kazakhstan, People\u2019s Republic of China, Russia, Ukraine, and Venezuela, </em>64 Fed. Reg. 51,097, 51,098 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Sept. 21, 1999) (notice of rescission of antidump-ing duty orders).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Returning to the facts of the PSF case under review here, on October 26, 2005, Plaintiffs filed a letter with the Commission requesting that the Commission institute a proceeding to reconsider the original PSF injury determinations because of new evidence that certain domestic producers conspired to fix PSF prices and allocate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>customers during the original period of investigation and part of the sunset review period. As support, Plaintiffs cited the guilty pleas of KoSa, a domestic producer of PSF, and Troy Stanley, a KoSa employee, in a criminal antitrust case brought by the United States Department of Justice, and agreements from three other domestic PSF producers settling civil antitrust litigation, among other documents. Plaintiffs argued that like the <em>Ferrosilicon Reconsideration </em>the conspiracy had compromised the integrity of the Commission\u2019s original investigations and that the Commission should therefore institute a reconsideration proceeding to determine whether to revoke the antidumping duty orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Unlike its approach in the <em>Ferrosilicon Reconsideration, </em>the Commission did not commence a reconsideration of the PSF original injury determinations. Instead, on December 19, 2005, the Commission issued a letter denying Plaintiffs\u2019 reconsideration request \u201cat this time.\u201d Subsequently, Plaintiffs and petitioners, Defendant-Intervenors here, addressed the alleged antitrust conspiracy in their briefs and final comments filed in the sunset reviews, and submitted documentary evidence for their respective claims. Plaintiffs reiterated and expanded upon the arguments made in their October 26, 2005 letter. They again invoked the Commission\u2019s <em>Ferrosilicon Reconsideration </em>to argue that the Commission should revoke the antidump-ing orders on PSF from Korea and Taiwan <em>ab initio </em>because an alleged conspiracy among certain domestic producers to fix prices and allocate customers during a portion of the period examined in the original investigation had compromised the integrity of the original investigative record. Plaintiffs also requested that the Commission \u201corder discovery\u201d and \u201cforce domestic producers to dislodge information concerning the conspiracy,\u201d including all discovery taken and all written and deposition testimony from the civil antitrust litigation. Due to the volume of these materials, Plaintiffs requested that the Commission extend the sunset reviews by 90 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Defendant-Intervenors argued that Plaintiffs\u2019 price-fixing allegations and documents concerned a conspiracy to fix prices and allocate customers for fine denier PSF used in textile spinning applications, a product not subject to the antidumping duty orders on PSF from Korea and Taiwan. They also argued that the alleged PSF antitrust conspiracy was unlike the <em>Ferrosilicon Reconsideration </em>antitrust conspiracy in that the overlap between the conspiracy and the period of investigation was minimal, and individuals who participated in the conspiracy had not participated in the Commission\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The Commission conducted a public hearing on January 17, 2006. At the hearing, Plaintiffs and Defendant-Intervenors provided testimony and answered questions on the alleged antitrust conspiracy. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>response to Commissioner questions at the hearing, Defendant-Intervenors provided additional documents relevant to Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations as attachments to their posthearing brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">Thereafter, the Commission gathered certain information from a source [\u00b6] ]].<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On March 20, 2006, the Commission issued its final decision on the matter, rejecting Plaintiffs\u2019 reconsideration request in a detailed analysis that the Commission chose to include in its final views for the sunset reviews of PSF from Korea and Taiwan. <em>See Certain Polyester Staple Fiber From Korea and Taiwan, </em>Inv. Nos. 731-TA-825 and 826 (Final), USITC Pub. 3843 (Mar. 2006) Conf. Views at 21-32, Pub. Views at 16-23 <em>(\u201cPSF Reconsideration Denial\u201d). </em>The Commission interpreted Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the Commission should revoke the antidumping duty orders <em>ab initio </em>as a renewal of their request for institution of a reconsideration proceeding because the Commission lacks the authority to revoke antidumping duty orders and the Commission believed it could not reconsider its original determinations within the scope of the sunset reviews. <em>PSF Reconsideration Denial </em>Pub. Views at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The Commission addressed the alleged antitrust conspiracy and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">[T]he weight of the voluminous record evidence indicates that any conspiracy was primarily limited to non-subject PSF, and that record evidence does not support the proposition that any conspiracy extended to certain PSF [subject to the antidumping duty order]. The information relied upon by respondents is generally indirect or inconclusive, and requires assumptions that are contradicted by other evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 22. Having found that the antitrust conspiracy to which KoSa and Mr. Stanley pled guilty targeted fine denier PSF and not the PSF subject to the antidumping duty order, the Commission concluded that the circumstances did not warrant institution of a reconsideration proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 22-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">The Commission also distinguished its actions in the <em>Ferrosilicon Reconsideration </em>in which the Commission \u201csuspended a changed circumstances review, and self-initiated a separate reconsideration proceeding, based on \u2018extraordinary circumstances ... that strike at the heart of the administrative process\u2019: the criminal conviction of three domestic producers for price fixing, when ferrosilicon pricing was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>\u2018focal point\u2019 of the original investigations, and evidence that these domestic producers \u2018made material misrepresentations and omissions throughout the investigation relating to that issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23 (quoting <em>Ferrosilicon Reconsideration </em>at 7-8).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">For the alleged antitrust conspiracy related to PSF, the Commission found that record evidence did not support Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that KoSa\u2019s antitrust violations had undermined the integrity of the original investigation because petitioners\u2019 evidence and testimony in the original investigation was consistent with an antitrust conspiracy targeting fine denier PSF, not the PSF subject to the antidumping duty order. <em>Id. </em>The Commission also found Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the conspiracy had inflated underselling margins to be unsupported by the record, as underselling margins generally narrowed in the only two quarters of the original period of investigation that coincided with the antitrust conspiracy to which KoSa pled guilty. The Commission therefore denied Plaintiffs\u2019 request for institution of a reconsideration proceeding. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The Commission also denied Plaintiffs\u2019 request for a 90-day extension of the reviews to conduct \u201cdiscovery\u201d into documents allegedly possessed by Defendant-Intervenors. <em>Id. </em>at 22 n. 158. The Commission explained that its reviews are conducted according to statutory provisions, regulations, and scheduling orders that do not provide for formal discovery. <em>Id. </em>The Commission added that Defendant-Intervenors had provided additional relevant documents in response to Commissioner questions at the hearing, and that it was \u201csatisfied with the completeness of the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23. Finally, the Commission observed that \u201cascertaining antitrust violations based upon conflicting or ambiguous evidence submitted in civil antitrust proceeding\u201d \u2014 the type of evidence Plaintiffs wanted the Commission to collect given that the civil litigation had been settled \u2014 \u201cis outside the Commission\u2019s expertise.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">II. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(i)(2) &amp; (4) (2000), which among other things, supplies jurisdiction for Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d) claims challenging the administration and enforcement of the antidumping laws by the Commission. The Commission and Defendant-Intervenors previously filed separate motions to dismiss this action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, contending that the Commission\u2019s denial of Plaintiffs\u2019 reconsideration request is not reviewable because there are no statutory or regulatory provisions governing a reconsideration proceeding and it is therefore an \u201cagency action... committed to agency discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>by law,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2) (2000), a jurisdictional limitation for APA claims that applies to the general grant of jurisdiction contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(i) (2000). <em>Cf. ICC v. Bhd. of Locomotive Eng\u2019rs, </em>482 U.S. 270, 282 (1987) (noting that the limitation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2) applies to \u201cthe general grant of jurisdiction contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-3\">The court denied the motions to dismiss. <em>Consilidated Fibers, Inc. v. United States, </em>30 CIT _, _, 465 F.Supp.2d 1338, 1344 (2006). The Commission and Defendant-Intervenors filed separate motions for the court to reconsider its denial of their motions to dismiss count two or, in the alternative, to certify the jurisdictional issue for interlocutory appeal. The court denied the motions because, in the court\u2019s view, the standards for reconsideration or for certification were not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">In their briefs opposing Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment on the agency record, the Commission and Defendant-Intervenors renew their objections to the court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction, repeating their argument that no specific statute or regulation governs the Commission\u2019s conduct of a reconsideration proceeding, meaning there is \u201cno law to apply,\u201d <em>Heckler v. Chaney, </em>470 U.S. 821, 830 (1985) (quoting <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 410 (1971)) and that agency decisions with respect to reconsideraton proceedings are \u201ccommitted to agency discretion by law,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2) (2000). Def.\u2019s Resp. to Pls.\u2019s Mot. for J. on the Agency R. at 2-3. The court previously addressed the jurisdictional issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">The general rule is that an agency\u2019s denial of a petition for reconsideration is committed to agency discretion and not subject to judicial review <em>unless </em>the request is based on \u201cnew evidence or changed circumstances,\u201d in which case the court evaluates whether \u201cthe refusal to reopen was \u2018arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>[ICC v. Bhd. of Locomotive Eng\u2019rs, </em>482 U.S. 270, 278-79 (1987)] (quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A)); <em>see also, AT&amp;T Corp. v. FCC, </em>363 F.3d 504, 507-08 (D.C. Cir. 2004); <em>Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. FCC, </em>180 F.3d 307, 311 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (\u201ca petition seeking review of an agency\u2019s decision not to reopen a proceeding is not reviewable unless the petition is based upon new evidence or changed circumstances.\u201d). Put another way, \u201c[i]f the petition that was denied sought reopening on the basis of new evidence or changed circumstances, review is available and abuse of discretion is the standard; otherwise, the agency\u2019s refusal to go back over ploughed ground is nonreviewable.\u201d <em>Bhd. of Locomotive Eng\u2019rs, </em>482 U.S. at 284.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>The Court in <em>Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers </em>was interpreting the Interstate Commerce Act, which contained three grounds for rehearing: \u201cmaterial error, new evidence, or substantially changed circumstances.\u201d 482 U.S. at 277 (citing 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10327(g), current version at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 722(c) (2000)). Under the antidumping laws, the Commission has express statutory authorizaton to review its prior injury determinations upon the request of a party for a \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d review. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(b). An interested party, in turn, has an express statutory right of judicial review (as opposed to an APA claim) if the Commission refuses to initiate a changed circumstances proceeding. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(l)(B). The court evaluates whether the refusal to initiate was \u201carbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion,\u201d 19 U.S.C \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(A), the same standard applied when reviewing a denial of a reconsideration request under the APA for \u201cnew evidence or changed circumstances.\u201d Plaintiffs here did not request a changed circumstances review because they were heeding the Commission\u2019s approach in <em>Ferrosilicon. </em>Plaintiffs therefore requested that the Commission commence a reconsideration proceeding to evaluate the new evidence relating to the antitrust activity of some members of the domestic industry, just as the Commission had done in [the] <em>Ferrosilicon [Reconsideration].</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-4\">Unlike the statutory provisions for a changed circumstances review, there is no express statutory authorization for the Commission to conduct a reconsideration proceeding. The Commission, however, has inherent administrative authority under the antidumping and countervailing duty laws to reconsider its original injury determinations, at least when fraud has been perpetrated on the agency during the underlying investigations. <em>See Elkem Metals Co., </em>26 CIT at 240, 193 F.Supp.2d at 1321 (reviewing <em>Ferrosilicon)', see also Alberta Gas Chems., Ltd. v. Celanese Corp., </em>650 F.2d 9, 12-14 (2d Cir. 1981) (\u201cIt is hard to imagine a clearer case for [the Commission] exercising this inherent power than when a fraud has been perpetrated on the tribunal in its initial proceeding.\u201d). Under <em>Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, </em>the Commission\u2019s denial of a reconsideration request is unreviewable unless the request is based on new evidence, in which case the court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(i) (2000) to review the denial under the abuse of discretion standard set forth in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (2000).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-5\"><em>Consolidated, 30 CIT </em>at _, <em>465 F.Supp.2d at 1343. </em>The Commission argues that the general rule of <em>Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>is not applicable because that case involved a specific statute authorizing reconsideration proceedings based on \u201cnew evidence,\u201d whereas in the instant action no specific statutory provision authorizes a reconsideration proceeding based on new evidence. Def.\u2019s Resp. to Pls.\u2019s Mot. for J. on the Agency R. at 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">This argument is unpersuasive for several reasons. First, it confuses the question of specific statutory <em>authorization </em>with <em>review-ability, </em>a distinction that <em>Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers </em>clarifies. The plaintiffs in <em>Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers </em>sought judicial review of the agency\u2019s refusal to conduct a reconsideration proceeding based on \u201cmaterial error,\u201d a proceeding specifically authorized by statute. Despite the specific statutory authorization, the Court held that the agency\u2019s refusal to reconsider based on material error is unreviewable because there are no judicially manageable standards to review such agency action. <em>Bhd. of Locomotive Eng\u2019rs, </em>482 U.S. at 278-84. The Court clarified, though, that a refusal to reconsider based on new evidence or changed circumstances is reviewable, not because of a specific statutory authorization (the very same provision authorizing reconsideration for material error), but because there are judicially manageable standards against which to review the agency action. <em>Id. </em>at 279. To be sure, \u201cthere is no dearth of \u2018judicially manageable standards\u2019 in this context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 294 (Stevens, J., concurring); <em>see also Magnola Metallurgy, Inc. v. United States, </em>Appeal No. 2007-1099 (Fed. Cir. Nov. 20, 2007) (holding that Commerce\u2019s refusal to reconsider an original determination for material error is unreviewable \u201cabsent new facts or evidence,\u201d and noting that \u201c[i]f new facts or evidence show that the original determination was erroneous, it will be revisited.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">This is an important distinction because although the Commission contends this case is unreviewable due to the lack of a specific statutory provision authorizing reconsideration proceedings to address \u201cnew evidence,\u201d it does not argue that the Commission lacks the authority to conduct such proceedings. This leads to the second deficiency with their argument: it ignores <em>Elkem Metals Co. v. United States, </em>26 CIT 234, 193 F.Supp.2d 1314 (2002), which held, consistent with what the Commission advocated in that case, that the Commission has inherent administrative authority under the antidumping statute to reconsider final determinations to consider new evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 239-40, 193 F.Supp.2d at 1320-21. This inherent authority is not ethereal; it arises from the antidumping statute and the quasi-adjudicative nature of the Commission\u2019s determinations. <em>Id. </em>Absent this precedent, one could surmise from the relative clarity and simplicity of the Interstate Commerce Act authorizing agency rehearing for \u201cmaterial error, new evidence, or substantially changed circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>stances,\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 722(c) (2000), that Congress granted the Commission less latitude, limiting reconsideration of antidumping determinations only in the event of \u201cchanged circumstances,\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(b), and not for consideration of new evidence. The Commission, however, does not press this argument because <em>Elkem Metals </em>does exist; it is a precedent of the Commission\u2019s own making. Importantly, the same law that authorizes a reconsideration proceeding based on new evidence provides the standards against which to review the Commission\u2019s refusal to perform one: the antidumping statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">In this case the authorization to reconsider based on new evidence goes hand in hand with reviewability. Contrary to the Commission\u2019s argument, the court\u2019s review of the Commission\u2019s denial of a reconsideration request to consider new evidence is not a standard-less mystery. It is a straightforward inquiry of whether the Commission\u2019s refusal to reconsider its original determination despite the new evidence is \u201carbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion\u201d, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (2000), when measured against the statutory factors composing the Commission\u2019s injury determination, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677 (7), and the Commission\u2019s findings from the original determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">This brings us to the third deficiency with the Commission\u2019s \u201cno law to apply\u201d jurisdictional argument \u2014 it ignores the <em>Ferrosilicon Reconsideration. </em>In the instant action Plaintiffs discovered evidence of an antitrust conspiracy on the part of the domestic industry, just as the Brazilian ferrosilicon producers had. Plaintiffs brought the evidence to the Commission\u2019s attention expecting that the Commission would follow the same approach of the <em>Ferrosilicon Reconsideration. </em>To Plaintiffs\u2019 frustration the Commission chose a different approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">There is a general principle of administrative law that \u201can agency must either follow its own precedents or explain why it departs from them.\u201d <em>See generally, </em>2 Richard J. Pierce, <em>Administrative Law Treatise </em>\u00a7 11.5, at 817 (4th ed. 2002). In denying Plaintiffs\u2019reconsideration request, the Commission distinguished the <em>Ferrosilicon Reconsideration, </em>explaining why similar treatment was not warranted. Plaintiffs have a cause of action to challenge, and the court has jurisdiction to review, whether the Commission\u2019s explanation is adequate, or phrased differently, whether the different agency action in this case constitutes an \u201cirrational departure\u201d from the <em>Ferrosilicon Reconsideration </em>that is \u201carbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act.\u201d <em>INS v. Yang, </em>519 U.S. 26, 32 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>III. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">The applicable standard governing the court\u2019s review of the Commission\u2019s denial of Plaintiffs\u2019 reconsideration request and the Commission\u2019s alleged departure from the <em>Ferrosilicon Reconsideration </em>precedent is whether the Commission\u2019s actions were \u201carbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (2000). Although this is a well-established APA standard, there is significant confusion among the parties about what this standard means and how it should be applied. The confusion appears to stem from the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Consolidated Bearings Co. v. United States, </em>412 F.3d 1266, 1269 (Fed.

Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Plaintiffs raise six specific arguments challenging the Commission\u2019s denial of their reconsideration request. None focus on a failure to consider relevant factors. Plaintiffs first argue that the Commission\u2019s factual finding that the antitrust conspiracy targeted a different type of PSF then the PSF subject to the antidumping duty order was predicated on an incomplete factual record, and that the Commission should have done more. Pis.\u2019 Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for J. on Agency R. at 25-27. Second, Plaintiffs argue that the record does not support the Commission\u2019s factual finding that the antitrust conspiracy did not extend to the merchandise subject to the antidumping duty order, and that the Commission placed too much weight on certain record evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 27-31. Third, Plaintiffs argue that the Commission improperly credited evidence placed on the record by Defendant-Intervenors. <em>Id. </em>at 31-32. Fourth, Plaintiffs argue that the Commission did not view the record evidence with balance and objectivity. <em>Id. </em>at 32-34. Fifth, Plaintiffs argue that the Commission acted inconsistently with the <em>Ferrosilicon Reconsideration </em>in protecting the integrity of its own proceedings. Sixth, and finally, Plaintiffs argue that the Commission\u2019s denial of the reconsideration request applied a criminal law burden of proof to Plaintiffs\u2019 claim. <em>Id. </em>at 37-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">After reviewing the record evidence, as well as the <em>Ferrosilicon Reconsideration, </em>the court understands why Plaintiffs might be frustrated with the Commission\u2019s handling of their reconsideration re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>quest. Although Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments may have merit, the court cannot conclude that the Commission\u2019s denial of their reconsideration request is irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">A. Completeness of Factual Record</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Before declaring itself \u201csatisfied with the completeness of the record,\u201d <em>PSF Reconsideration Denial </em>(Pub. Views) 22-23 n.158, the Commission collected information regarding Plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust allegations. The Commission accepted Plaintiffs\u2019 recommendation, proposed in their comments on the draft questionnaires, to include two questions in the purchasers\u2019 questionnaire addressing Plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust allegations. The Commission also worked with Plaintiffs to insure that their evidence was placed on the record in a timely fashion, attached as a public exhibit to Consolidated\u2019s Importers\u2019 Questionnaire Response. Ultimately, Plaintiffs submitted 37 exhibits totaling 1,641 pages and Defendant-Intervenors submitted nine exhibits totaling 182 pages pertaining to the antitrust allegations. Supplementing this documentary evidence was hearing testimony addressing Plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust allegations. Approximately 78 of 174 questions asked by the Commission at the hearing, or 45 percent of all Commissioner questions, focused on Plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust allegations. The Commission also requested and received additional evidence from Defendant-Intervenors.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">After the hearing, the Commission gathered additional evidence regarding the antitrust conspiracy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Staff Report addressed Plaintiffs\u2019 antitrust allegations in section I, II, and V, and summarized the relevant record evidence in Appendix E. <em>See </em>CR at 1-10-11, II-2-4, V-5, and Appendix B (CR-240).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Although Plaintiffs are disadvantaged because much of the evidence of the antitrust conspiracy is under seal in the antitrust proceeding, and the Commission possibly could have done more to access this information, the Commission here made \u201cactive, reasonable efforts to obtain relevant data,\u201d <em>Allegheny Ludlurn Corp. v. United States, </em>287 F.3d 1365, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2002), and those efforts were not irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">B. The Commission\u2019s finding that the antitrust conspiracy was not directed at PSF subject to the antidumping duty order</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 next three arguments are directed at the Commission\u2019s central finding in denying the reconsideration request: \u201cthe record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>does not substantiate the theory that the conspiracy in question covered products other than fine denier PSF for textile applications.\u201d <em>PSF Reconsideration Denial </em>Pub.

According to the Commission, this finding was supported by \u201c1) the factual basis of Mr. Stanley\u2019s guilty plea read by the lead prosecutor at Mr. Stanley\u2019s sentencing hearing on November 15, 2004, which superseded less detailed documentary evidence from 2002, indicating that the conspiracy had targeted fine denier PSF, <em>id. </em>at 19; 2) certain information gathered by the Commission;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 3) the absence of unambiguous evidence indicating that the antitrust conspiracy to which KoSa and Mr. Stanley pled guilty extended to PSF subject to the antidumping duty order, <em>see id. </em>at 26-31, including the absence of any reference to such a conspiracy in the 1,157-page transcript from the Dutton trial. <em>PSF Reconsideration Denial </em>Pub.

Views at 31 (citing CR at II-2 &amp; n.4; PR at II-2 &amp; n.4 (CR-240)).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">1. The Commission\u2019s reliance on certain information<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Plaintiffs argue that the Commission erred by relying on certain information gathered by the Commission from a source<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> as \u201chighly probative,\u201d claiming that the Commission misconstrued that information,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which is contradicted by other evidence, and that the source was not under oath.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for J. on Agency R. at 28. Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments do have some merit. The Commission chose to speak with the source<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> after the hearing, which is informative because it indicates that the Commission still harbored some uncertainty about the scope of the antitrust conspiracy. Although the Commission is authorized to conduct <em>ex parte </em>conversations, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f(a)(3), 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 207.2(f)(1) (2005), it is disappointing that the Commission, an investigatory agency with subpoena power performing quasi-adjudicatory functions, thought it wise to rely so heavily on the unrecorded statements of one individual, not under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>oath, made during an <em>ex parte </em>telephone conversation. Such a choice does seem to test the rationality of the Commission\u2019s decision. Also, as Plaintiffs point out, the statements relied upon appear inconsistent with [[ ]] in other parts of the record. Pls.\u2019 Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for J. on Agency R. at 27-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">With that said, the Commission has explained that the information from the source was supported by other evidence gathered by the Commission.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Commission also defends the information provided by the source be detailing the credibility of the source and the relationship of that source to [[ ]].<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Def\u2019s Resp. to Pls.\u2019s Mot. for J. on the Agency R. at 31-32. The court, therefore, cannot conclude that the Commission\u2019s reliance on the information provided by the source<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> is irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">2. The Commission\u2019s treatment of evidence placed on the record by Defendant-Intervenors</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">The Commission also attached probative value to certain evidence placed on the record by Defendant-Intervenors&amp;emdash;the sworn affidavit of Mr. Stanley, the only individual to plead guilty to the antitrust conspiracy targeting fine denier PSF, stating that the conspiracy had not extended to PSF subject to the antidumping duty order. Plaintiffs have a valid point that Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 submission of this document was \u201cselective\u201d and \u201cself-serving,\u201d and the Commission\u2019s decision to accord it weight should be examined. Pis.\u2019 Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for J. on Agency R. at 31. The Commission, however, explains that it only cited the affidavit as additional support for its finding that \u201c[o]ther documents submitted by respondent interested parties explicitly cite an antitrust conspiracy that targeted fine denier PSF.\u201d Def.\u2019s Resp. to Pls.\u2019s Mot. for J. on the Agency R. at 33 (quoting <em>PSF Reconsideration Denial </em>Pub. Views at 20 n.134). The Commission notes, \u201c[b]oth KoSa\u2019s statement of admissions filed in Canada, and the complaint filed in <em>Koch v. Hoescht, </em>reference a conspiracy to coordinate fine denier sales and allocate textile customers.\u201d Def.\u2019s Resp. to Pls.\u2019s Mot. for J. on the Agency R. at 33 (citing Sept. 30, 2005 Pub. Ex., Attach. 5 at paras. 12-13 and Attach. 7 at paras. 1-2 (CR-43)). Given this explanation, the court cannot conclude that the Commission\u2019s utilization of this record evidence is irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>8. Whether the Commission lacked objectivity and balance</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Plaintiffs contend that in weighing the record evidence on the question of the scope of the antitrust conspiracy, the Commission lacked objectivity and balance. The court believes that Plaintiffs, who were operating at a significant disadvantage because much of the information relating to the antitrust conspiracy was under seal, made a good evidentiary showing before the Commission that the PSF antitrust conspiracy may have extended to the PSF subject to the antidumping duty order. Although the Commission\u2019s reconsideration denial does not, in the court\u2019s view, fully reflect the contradictory evidence Plaintiffs proffered under challenging circumstances, the court is also cognizant of the standard of review operating in this case. The court here is not the finder of fact, the Commission is. The court\u2019s role is limited to (1) ensuring that the Commission considered the relevant factors and (2) reviewing the Commission\u2019s determination for rationality. Plaintiffs have not argued that the Commission failed to consider relevant factors. As for the rationality of the Commission\u2019s finding that the PSF subject to the antitrust conspiracy did not include the PSF subject to the antidumping duty order, the court cannot conclude that the finding is irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">C. The <em>Ferrosilieon Reconsideration</em></p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">In denying Plaintiffs\u2019 reconsideration request, the Commission addressed Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the facts of this case are analogous to those in the <em>Ferrosilieon Reconsideration, </em>and therefore warrant similar treatment. The Commission observed that in the <em>Ferrosilieon Reconsideration </em>three domestic producers had been convicted of price fixing, when price had been the \u201cfocal point\u201d of the original investigation, and there was evidence that these same producers had \u201cmade material misrepresentations and omissions throughout the investigation relating to that <em>issue.\u201d PSF Reconsideration Denial </em>Pub. Views at 23 (citing <em>Ferrosilieon Reconsideration </em>at 7-8). Here, on the other hand, the Commission determined that KoSa\u2019s antitrust violations did not undermine the integrity of the record of the original investigations of PSF from Korea and Taiwan because petitioners provided testimony and evidence consistent with an antitrust conspiracy targeting fine denier PSF but not the PSF subject to the antidumping duty order. <em>Id. </em>The Commission also found that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that underselling margins had been inflated by the conspiracy was unsupported by the record, which indicated that underselling margins had generally narrowed during the two quarters of the original investigation that overlapped with the antitrust violations to which KoSa pled guilty. <em>Id. </em>at 23 &amp; n.160.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>As the Commission explained, the <em>Ferrosilicon Reconsideration </em>involved new evidence of an antitrust conspiracy that affected the original injury determinations in a definitive and concrete way, a fact that was apparent when the Brazilian ferrosilicon producers first filed their request for a changed circumstances review. Plaintiffs were undoubtedly hoping that the new evidence of the antitrust conspiracy they uncovered among the domestic PSF producers would engender the same proactive response demonstrated by the Commission in the <em>Ferrosilicon Reconsideration, </em>but Plaintiffs failed to persuade the Commission that the evidence affected the original PSF injury determination in a definitive and concrete way. Lacking unambiguous evidence of that effect, the Commission declined to institute a reconsideration proceeding in which it would be \u201cascertaining antitrust violations based upon conflicting or ambiguous evidence submitted in civil antitrust proceedings\u201d, something \u201coutside the Commission\u2019s expertise.\u201d <em>PSF Reconsideration Denial </em>Pub. Views at 22-23. The differing course of action \u2014 declining to reconsider the PSF determination \u2014 therefore did not represent an irrational departure from the <em>Ferrosilicon Reconsideration.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">D. The \"guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d burden of proof</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 sixth argument is that the Commission held Plaintiffs\u2019 reconsideration request to the \u201cguilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d burden of proof by relying on certain information gathered by the Commission.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 argument begs the question of the proper burden of proof the Commission should have applied to Plaintiffs\u2019 reconsideration request, a question to which Plaintiffs do not provide an answer. Arguing about burdens of proof in this context is meaningless because the Commission does not apply \u201cburdens of proof\u201d in ruling on a reconsideration request. Instead, the Commission renders a discretionary decision that is generally unreviewable except in the limited circumstance when the request is based on new evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">In this case the court is reviewing a claim that the Commission\u2019s refusal to reconsider its original determination despite new evidence is \u201carbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion\u201d, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (2000), when measured against the statutory factors composing the Commission\u2019s injury determination and the Commission\u2019s findings from the original determination. Plaintiffs\u2019 burden of proof argument does not aid the court in analyzing whether the evidence of the antitrust conspiracy in question materially affected the Commission\u2019s original injury determination. What the court needed to hear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>from Plaintiffs instead was how the record demonstrated that the new evidence materially affected the original PSF injury determination, something that Plaintiffs simply chose not to argue.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Having reviewed the Commission\u2019s denial of Plaintiffs\u2019reconsideration request, the court concludes that the Commission\u2019s denial was not \u201carbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion\u201d, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (2000). Accordingly, the court denies Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment upon the agency record and affirms the determination of the Commission.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b45-6\"> Further citations to the Tariff Act of 1930 are to the relevant provision in Title 19 of the U.S. Code, 2000 edition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b47-10\">[[</p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">]] (Citations to confidential documents from the Administrative Records are cited \u201cCR\u201d followed by the document number.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b54-8\"> The \u201carbitrary, capricious, [or] abuse of discretion standard\u201d combines two \u201croughly equivalent\u201d word formulas, 'arbitrary [or] capricious\u2019 and \u2018abuse of discretion.\u2019 3 Charles H.

Plaintiffs have not cited <em>State Farm </em>or raised the hard look doctrine in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b56-9\"> Specifically, Plaintiff argues that the Commission placed too much weight on its [\u00b6]</p>\n<p id=\"ARc\">]] Pis.\u2019 Mem. in Supp.</p>\n<p id=\"APL\">of Mot. for J. on Agency R. at 25-27.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b57-10\"> [\u00b6]</p>\n<p id=\"b57-11\">]]\u2022</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b58-6\">[[ '</p>\n<p id=\"ATU\">]]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"AmP\">[[ ]]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"ACQ5\">[[</p>\n<p id=\"A5zF\">]]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"AX2\"> [\u00b6] ]]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"AC0\"> [\u00b6] ]]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"ADd\"> H ]]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"ADXM\"> [\u00b6] ]]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b59-9\"> [[</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">]]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b59-12\">]]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b59-13\"> [[ ]]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b61-7\"> [\u00b6]</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">]]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
