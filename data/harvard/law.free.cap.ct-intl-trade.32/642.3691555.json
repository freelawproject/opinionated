The court affirmed several of the Commission\u2019s specific findings, but remanded to allow the Commission to provide a more reasoned analysis of (1) the impact of third-country barriers on urea exports, (2) the impact of non-subject imports on domestic pricing, and (3) certain conditions of competition in the industry. The Commission issued its remand determination on November 26, 2007. <em>See </em>Remand Determination of the Commission in <em>Nevinnomysskiy Azot v. United States, </em>Court No. 06-00013 (ITC Nov. 26, 2007) <em>(\u201cRemand Determination\u201d). </em>Plaintiffs Nevinnomysskiy Azot, Novomskovsk Azot JSC, JSC MCC Eurochem, Kuybyshevazot JSC, 59 JSC \u201cAzot\u201d Be-rezniki, and JSC \u201cAzot\u201d Kemerovo (collectively \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>the Commission\u2019s remand determination, arguing that it is unsupported by substantial evidence and not in accordance with law. Agrium US, Inc., and the Ad Hoc Committee of Domestic Nitrogen Producers appear before the court as Defendant-Intervenors. The court finds that substantial evidence supports the Commission\u2019s remand determination and thus affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">I. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">In July 1987, after investigating imports of solid urea from the German Democratic Republic (\u201cGDR\u201d), Romania, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (\u201cUSSR\u201d), the Commission determined that the domestic industry suffered material injury as a result of sales at less than fair value.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Urea From the German Democratic Republic, Romania, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, </em>USITC Pub. 1992, Inv. Nos. 731-TA-338-340 (Final) (July 1987) (\u201cOriginal Determination\u201d). Commerce subsequently issued an antidumping duty (\u201cAD\u201d) order on imports of solid urea from the GDR, Romania, and the USSR. <em>See Antidumping Duty Order; Urea From the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, </em>52 Fed. Reg. 26,367 (Dep\u2019t Commerce July 14, 1987); <em>Antidumping Duty Order; Urea From the Socialist Republic of Romania, </em>52 Fed. Reg. 26,367 (Dep\u2019t Commerce July 14, 1987); <em>Antidumping Duty Order; Urea From the German Democratic Republic, </em>52 Fed. Reg. 26,366 (Dep\u2019t Commerce July 14, 1987). Following the collapse of the USSR in December 1991, Commerce divided the original AD order into separate orders for each of the fifteen newly independent states. <em>See Solid Urea From the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; Transfer of the Antidumping Duty Order on Solid Urea From the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Baltic States and Opportunity to Comment, </em>57 Fed. Reg. 28,828 (Dep\u2019t Commerce June 29, 1992).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">In March 1999, the Commission instituted its first sunset reviews of the remaining orders on solid urea pursuant to section 751(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(c). <em>See Solid Urea From Romania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan, 64 Fed. Reg. 10,020 (ITC Mar. 1, 1999). Ultimately, the Commission determined that re</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number><em>vocation of any AD order on solid urea imports, except the one pertaining to Armenia, would likely lead to a continuation or recurrence of material injury to the domestic industry within a reasonably foreseeable time. See Solid Urea From Armenia, Belarus, Estonia, Lithuania, Romania, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan, 64 Fed. Reg. 60,225 (ITC Nov. 4, 1999). Accordingly, Commerce revoked the AD order on Armenia but left the others in effect for an additional five years. See Revocation of Antidumping Duty Order: Solid Urea from Armenia, </em>64 Fed. Reg. 62,654 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Nov. 17,1999); <em>Continuation of Antidumping Duty Orders: Solid Urea From Belarus, Estonia, Lithuania, Romania, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan, </em>64 Fed. Reg. 62,653 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Nov. 17, 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Five years later, the Commission instituted its second sunset reviews of the AD orders. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1675(c); <em>Solid Urea From Belarus, Estonia, Lithuania, Romania, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan, </em>69 Fed. Reg. 58,957 (ITC Oct. 1, 2004). Because the domestic interested parties chose not to participate in the reviews, Commerce revoked all of the AD orders except those covering Russia and Ukraine. \u00a7 1675(c)(3)(A); <em>Solid Urea from Belarus, Estonia, Lithuania, Romania, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan: Final Results and Revocation of Orders, </em>69 Fed. Reg. 77,993 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Dec. 29, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The Commission issued the final determinations in its second sunset reviews of the Russian and Ukranian AD orders on December 16, 2005. <em>See Solid Urea From Russia and Ukraine, </em>70 Fed. Reg. 74,846 (ITC Dec. 16, 2005). By a three-to-three vote, the Commission determined that revocation of the AD orders on solid urea from Russia and Ukraine would likely lead to material injury of the domestic industry within a reasonably foreseeable time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Therefore, Commerce left the AD orders on Russian and Ukranian urea in effect. <em>See Notice of Continuation of Antidumping Duty Orders: Solid Urea from the Russian Federation and Ukraine, </em>71 Fed. Reg. 581 (Dep\u2019t Commerce Jan. 5, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Plaintiffs subsequently appealed the Commission\u2019s affirmative determination. <em>See Nevinnomysskiy Azot v. United States, </em>Slip Op. 07-130, 2007 WL 2563571 (Aug. 28, 2007) (not reported in F. Supp.) <em>(\u201cAzot Tj. </em>In <em>Azot I, </em>the court affirmed the Commission\u2019s findings that: (1) there was a reasonable amount of competition between granular and prilled urea; (2) the United States is an attractive market for subject producers because its urea prices are relatively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>higher than those in other markets; (3) the subject industries have the ability and incentive to divert their exports to the United States; and, (4) the global supply of solid urea will expand into a surplus in the reasonably foreseeable future. <em>See id. </em>at *7, 10-12. Finding that the Commission\u2019s determination was \u201cdevoid of the legally required explanation to support its finding,\u201d the court remanded the case so that the Commission would: (1) address \u201cwhether the likely volume of subject imports would prove significant if the [AD] orders in question are revoked\u201d; (2) address the \u201clikely price effects of subject imports in light of the already substantial presence of low-cost non-subject imports in the domestic market\u201d; and (3) \u201creassess the likely impact of subject imports on the domestic industry to account for the difference between the first sunset reviews\u2019 findings and the findings of the current reviews within the context of the domestic industry\u2019s recent improved performance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *16.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">The Commission issued its remand determination in November 2007, concluding that \u201cthe domestic industry is vulnerable to the likely adverse impact of the subject imports upon revocation.\u201d <em>Remand Determination </em>at 26. In addition, because the Commission also found that \u201csubject imports are likely to enter the market in significant volumes and at prices that will have a significant adverse impact on the industry\u2019s prices,\u201d it determined that \u201crevocation of the orders would result in the entry of significant quantities of low-priced subject imports into the U.S. market and that these imports would likely lead to material injury in the industry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">II. Statutory Background.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Every five years following the initial publication of an AD order, Commerce and the Commission must conduct a sunset review. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1675(c). Following review, Commerce must revoke the order unless the Commission determines that material injury to the domestic industry would likely continue or recur. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1675(d)(2). To make a proper determination, the Commission must \u201cconsider the likely volume, price effect, and impact of imports of the subject merchandise on the [domestic] industry if the order is revoked.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675a(a)(l). In addition, the Commission must take into account its prior injury determinations, any improvements in the state of the industry, vulnerability of the industry to material injury, and Commerce\u2019s duty absorption findings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">The Commission must weigh numerous additional considerations to properly make its determination. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1675a(a)(l)-(4). To evaluate whether the likely volume of subject imports would be significant, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Commission must consider all relevant economic factors, such as production capacity, inventories, third-country trade barriers, and manufacturing facilities\u2019 potential for product-shifting. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1675a(a)(2). In determining the likely price effects of subject imports, the Commission considers whether significant price underselling is likely and whether import prices would significantly depress or suppress domestic prices. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1675a(a)(3). Finally, to evaluate the impact of subject imports, the Commission considers \u201call relevant economic factors which are likely to have a bearing on the state of the [domestic] industry.\u201d \u00a7 1675a(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Although the Commission must weigh all of the aforementioned considerations during the course of its determination, \u201cno one factor is necessarily dispositive.\u201d <em>Azof I, </em>2007 WL 2563571, at *4. Moreover, the presence or absence of any factor \u201cshall not necessarily give decisive guidance with respect to the Commission\u2019s determination of whether material injury is likely to continue or recur within a reasonably foreseeable time....\u201d \u00a7 1675a(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">III. Jurisdiction &amp; Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">This Court has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d over actions contesting a Commission sunset review determination, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c); <em>see </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a. The Commission assesses the \u201clikely effect of revocation of the antidumping order on the behavior of the importers\u201d based on \u201ccurrently available evidence and on logical assumptions and extrapolations flowing from that evidence.\u201d <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. United States, </em>750 F.2d 927, 933 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The court will uphold the Commission\u2019s determination unless it is \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.\u201d \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(i). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Consol. Edison Co. of N.Y. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938). Crucially, \u201cthe possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Consolo v. Fed. Mar. Comm\u2019n, </em>383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). Because the Commission acts as the expert factfinder, the court will not \u201cdisplace [an agency\u2019s] choice between two fairly conflicting views, even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it <em>de novo.\u201d Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 488 (1951); <em>see Nippon Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>458 F.3d 1345, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>IV. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">A. Effect of Third-Country Barriers on the Likely Volume of Subject Imports</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">In challenging the <em>Remand Determination, </em>Plaintiffs argue that the Commission\u2019s likely volume finding is not supported by substantial evidence because the Commission erred in its cumulation of the subject imports from Russia and Ukraine and in its analysis of the Chinese urea embargo. Pis.\u2019 Resp. Br. 3, 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Pursuant to court remand, the Commission re-examined the record to determine whether existing third-country barriers were likely to encourage shifting of subject imports to the U.S. market. <em>See Remand Determination </em>at 7. The Commission found that the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) order on Russian urea and the Mexican order on Ukranian urea, are \u201cunlikely to cause a significant shift of subject imports away from those markets to the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. Specifically, in evaluating the EU\u2019s 1995 AD order on Russian urea, the Commission noted that despite an initial diversion of subject merchandise to other markets, exports of Russian urea to the EU have increased rapidly in recent years due to strengthening European prices. <em>See id. </em>at 7-8; <em>Staff Report to the Commission on Investigation Nos. 731-TA-340-E and H (Second Review): Solid Urea from Russia and Ukraine, </em>CR 134 at IV-10. Although the order would once again restrict Russian exports if prices fell below the set minimum, the Commission noted that prices \u201cwould have to fall <em>considerably </em>in the EU for Russian urea again to be hindered by the minimum pricing provision of the measure.\u201d <em>Remand Determination </em>at 8 (emphasis added). The Commission therefore found that the order \u201chas not caused the subject Russian producers to shift significant volumes of urea away from the EU market and that it is unlikely to do so in the reasonably foreseeable future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. Similarly, based on a [\u00b6] ]] metric ton increase in imports of subject merchandise to Mexico between 2003 and 2004, the Commission concluded that the \u201cMexican order has not caused the Ukranian producers to shift significant volumes of urea away from the Mexican market [since the imposition of the AD order in 2003]\u201d and is not likely do so in the reasonably foreseeable future. <em>Id. </em>at 8; <em>see Ad Hoc Committee Pre-Hearing Brief to the [Commission </em>], CR 113 Ex. 2 at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">In contrast, the Commission found that the Chinese restriction on urea and the EU order on Ukranian urea \u201care likely to continue diverting shipments of subject urea to other markets, such as the United States, in the reasonably foreseeable future.\u201d <em>Remand Determination </em>at 7. The Commission cited record evidence that China was the largest export market for both Russian and Ukranian urea before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>it imposed a \u201cvirtual embargo\u201d on urea imports in 1998. <em>Id. </em>at 8; <em>see </em>CR 134 at IV-10, IV-12. As a result, exporters \u201cshift[ed] significant volumes of urea away from the Chinese market to other export markets,\u201d causing Russian and Ukranian urea imports to drop from over 4 million metric tons in 1996 to 5,000 metric tons in 1999.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Remand Determination </em>at 9; CR 113 Ex. 2 at 9, 22. Given the export pattern data, the Commission inferred that the loss of China as an export market \u201cwas a significant factor in the substantial and rapid growth of exports of Russian and Ukranian urea to such markets as the EU and Latin America....\u201d <em>Remand Determination </em>at 9. Accordingly, the Commission concluded that the Chinese embargo would likely continue shifting urea exports towards other markets within the reasonably foreseeable future. <em>Id. </em>Likewise, the Commission also found that the EU order on Ukranian urea caused producers to shift significant volumes of urea to other markets. <em>Id. </em>After the EU imposed its AD order on Ukranian urea in 2002, imports dropped [\u00b6] ]] percent between 2001 and 2004 to [\u00b6] ]] metric tons. <em>Confidential Remand Determination </em>at 10. During that same period, Ukranian exports to Latin America grew from [\u00b6] ]] metric tons in 2001 to [\u00b6] ]] metric tons in 2004 - approximately [\u00b6] ]] percent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> CR 113 Ex. 2 at 22. As a result of these trends, the Commission found that the EU order on Ukra-nian urea \u201ccaused the Ukranian producers to shift their urea shipments away from the EU and to other markets, such as Latin America\u201d and that it would likely continue to do so within the reasonably foreseeable future. <em>Remand Determination </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Based on its analysis of third-country barriers, its affirmative findings on the foreign industry\u2019s excess capacity levels, the large size and export-oriented nature of the subject producers, the attractiveness of the U.S. market, and the likelihood of global oversupply, the Commission ultimately determined that the likely volume of subject imports would be significant if the AD orders were revoked. <em>Remand Determination </em>at 10 \u2014 12; <em>Azot I, </em>2007 WL 2563571, at *10 \u2014 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">\n<em>1. Cumulation of Subject Imports</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Plaintiffs seek a remand of the Commission\u2019s cumulation decision, arguing that the Commission failed to consider whether cumulation of the subject imports remained appropriate in light of its more rigorous analysis of third-country barriers. Pis.\u2019 Resp. Br. 3-6. Pursuant to \u00a7 1675a(a)(7), the Commission \u201cmay cumulatively assess the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>volume and effect of imports of the subject merchandise from all countries [whose sunset reviews] were initiated on the same day, if such imports would be likely to compete with each other and with domestic like products in the Unites States market.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u00a7 1675a(a)(7). However, the Commission will not cumulatively assess the volume and effects of the subject imports where it \u201cdetermines that such imports are likely to have no discernible adverse impact on the domestic industry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To determine whether imports are likely to have a discernible adverse impact if the AD orders were revoked, the Commission considers the likely volume of the subject imports, as well as their impact on the domestic industry, within a reasonably foreseeable time. <em>See </em>CR 139 at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">On remand, noting that Plaintiffs did not challenge its decision to cumulate the subject imports for the sunset analysis, the Commission explicitly adopted its prior views on cumulation. <em>See Remand Determination </em>at 5. In its second sunset determination, the Commission exercised its discretion and cumulated the likely volume and price effects of subject imports from Russia and Ukraine because it found: (a) that the subject imports would have a discernible adverse impact on the domestic industry if the orders were revoked; (b) a likely reasonable overlap of the competition between the subject imports and the domestic like product if the orders were revoked; and (c) no significant differences in the conditions of competition for subject imports from Russia and Ukraine.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> CR 139 at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Plaintiffs contend that decumulation is warranted because the Commission changed its finding on the likely effects of the EU order on Russian urea. Pis.\u2019 Resp. Br. 4-5. The record evidence, however, indicates otherwise. <em>See </em>CR 139 at 20-21; <em>Remand Determination </em>at 7-8. In its original determination, the Commission evaluated the EU orders on Russian and Ukranian urea and found that <em>\u201conly the measures on imports from Ukraine have a restraining effect, </em>leading to a decline of exports from Ukraine to the [EU] of almost 90 percent from 2003-2004 while Russian exports to the European Union increased rapidly.\u201d CR 139 at 20-21 (emphasis added). On remand, the Commission similarly found that \u201cimports of urea from Russia into the EU <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>have grown rapidly since 2000,\u201d and that the EU order on Russian urea \u201chas not caused subject Russian producers to shift volumes of urea away from the EU <em>market...\u201d Remand Determination </em>at 7-8. As the Commission\u2019s original conclusions are consistent with its later determination on the likely effects of the EU order on Russian urea, the court holds that decumulation is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Plaintiffs also claim that the Commission should have decumulated the subject imports because the effects of the EU orders on Russian and Ukranian urea result in competition differences within the U.S. market. Pls.\u2019Resp. Br. 4; <em>see </em>\u00a7 1675a(a)(7). To support their argument, Plaintiffs cite a determination in which the existence of different third-country measures was one factor which led the Commission to find that subject imports are likely to compete differently in the U.S. market. Pis.\u2019 Resp. Br. 4 (citing <em>Stainless Steel Wire Rod from Brazil, France, India, and Spain, </em>Inv. Nos. 701-TA-178 and 73l-TA-636-638 (Review), Pub. No. 3321 (July 2000) at. 14 <em>(\u201cSSWR\u201d). </em>In <em>SSWR, </em>the Commission found \u201csignificantly different conditions of competition for French [stainless steel wire rod] relative to imports from Brazil and India,\u201d and accordingly, elected not to cumulate Brazilian and Indian imports with those from France. <em>SSWR </em>at 14. Although the Commission considered third-country measures during its competition analysis, it also evaluated numerous other factors that contributed to the Commission\u2019s decision, such as length of time and consistency of presence in the U.S. market, ability to maintain a presence in the U.S. market in spite of an antidumping order, ability to sell through U.S. subsidiaries, and average unit values. <em>Id. </em>The number of elements considered by the Commission in <em>SSWR </em>stands in sharp contrast to the present case, where Plaintiffs base their remand request on a single factor, <em>i.e., </em>different third-country measures. That the record in this case contains evidence of one factor among many does not necessitate a remand of the cumu-lation decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Moreover, that the Commission found a likelihood of a reasonable overlap of competition in spite of the differing effects of the EU orders indicates there is little support for Plaintiffs\u2019 claim of competition differences. <em>See </em>CR 139 at 11-13, 20-21. Following agency practice, the Commission duly addressed each of the four factors used in its competition analysis. <em>See id. </em>at 8 n.45. First, the Commission found that subject imports and domestic like product are \u201csufficiently fungible for there be a reasonable overlap of competition\u201d because some of the subject imports would be used as fertilizer and because one-quarter of domestic production is prilled urea. <em>Id. </em>at 12. The remain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>ing three factors, <em>i.e., </em>geographic overlap, channels of distribution, and simultaneous presence, were difficult to evaluate because the subject merchandise has been absent from the U.S. market since 1987. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, the Commission found a reasonable overlap of competition based on record evidence that: (a) international trading companies would likely sell solid urea from the subject countries to U.S. importers if the orders were revoked, (b) domestic and imported urea were \u201cdirected to the same customers and were frequently commingled in wholesalers\u2019 warehouses,\u201d and (c) \u201curea from both subject countries is marketed by the same international trading companies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12-13. The Commission also took other factors into consideration, including the subject industries\u2019 export oriented nature, similar export markets, and high rates of capacity utilization. <em>Id. </em>In light of the evidence cited by the Commission, the court finds that substantial evidence supports the decision to cumulate the subject imports.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">\n<em>2. Likely Volume of Subject Imports</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Plaintiffs also challenge the affirmative volume determination by arguing that the Commission erred in its analysis of the Chinese urea embargo. Pis.\u2019 Resp. Br. 6-7. Specifically, Plaintiffs contend that record evidence of operation at almost [\u00b6] ]] capacity shows that the Russian and Ukranian industries had adjusted to the effects of the Chinese urea embargo and would be unlikely to shift exports into the United States.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Pis.\u2019 Resp. Br. 7. In its <em>Remand Determination, </em>the Commission found that \u201cChina\u2019s decision to restrict urea imports is likely to continue causing the subject producers to ship their production to <em>other markets </em>within the reasonably foreseeable future.\u201d <em>Remand Determination </em>at 9 (emphasis added). The plain meaning of the language demonstrates the Commission did not conclude that the Chinese measure would encourage subject producers to shift exports to the United States. Rather, the Commission found that subject producers will ship to other markets because they are unlikely to gain access to the Chinese market in the foreseeable future. <em>See Remand Determination </em>at 9. That the data implies subject producers have been able to adapt to the closing of China as an export market does not preclude the Commission from concluding that subject producers must search for export markets other than China. Indeed, the Commission\u2019s conclusion is supported by evidence that the Chinese embargo was a \u201csignificant factor in the substantial and rapid growth\u201d of exports to the EU and Latin America, and that the \u201csubject industries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>have the ability to divert rapidly a significant volume of their exports from foreign markets to the domestic market if Commerce revokes the orders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9; <em>see </em>CR 113 Ex. 2, at 8-10, 21-22; <em>Azot I, </em>2007 WL 2563571, at *10 n.15.

Likely Price Effects</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Finding that the Commission failed to explain why subject imports would likely depress U.S. urea prices when non-subject imports have not affected domestic prices, the court ordered the Commission to explain \u201cwhy the elimination of the subject imports would benefit the domestic industry instead of resulting in the non-subject imports\u2019 replacement of the subject imports\u2019 market share without any beneficial impact on domestic producers.\u201d <em>Azot I, </em>2007 WL 2563571, at *14-15. On remand, the Commission considered the record evidence and ultimately concluded that the \u201csubject imports are likely to enter the United States and have significant adverse effects on domestic prices if the orders are revoked.\u201d <em>Remand Determination </em>at 14. The Commission offered the following reasons for its finding: (1) \u201cfundamental economics\u201d predicts that significant volumes of low-priced Russian and Ukranian urea would likely place additional pricing pressure on all domestic and non-subject suppliers currently in the market; (2) the subject imports are likely to significantly undersell both the domestic like product and non-subject imports; (3) the record does not establish that the non-subject imports were significantly lower-priced than the domestic like product during the period of review; and (4) the lack of observable price effects from the non-subject imports is due, in part, to domestic producers importing a significant share of non-subject imports into the United States. <em>See id. </em>at 14 \u2014 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">\n<em>1.

Pis.\u2019 Resp. Br. 8-9. This argument, however, mischaracterizes the record evidence. Although the record indicates that non-subject imports have the <em>ability </em>to leave the United States and seek alternative markets, it does not show that they are <em>likely </em>to leave.

The Commission found that \u201cthe record evidence, viewed as a whole, indicates that the subject imports are likely to significantly undersell both the domestic like product and non-subject imports.\u201d <em>Remand Determination </em>at 14 (footnote omitted); <em>see Azot I, </em>2007 WL 2563571, at *13.

Fourth, the court agrees with the Commission that \u201cif the subject producers are pricing their products at lower prices to offset transportation costs to Asian markets, this indicates that they are willing to compete aggressively on price to compete with other suppliers in export markets.\u201d <em>Remand Determination </em>at 15 n.52.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Given that freight differentials to [\u00b6] ]] export markets do not explain a low f.o.b. price for urea that subject producers ship predominantly to markets other than Asia and Oceania, and given that \u201cthe Commission, as the trier of fact, has considerable discretion in weighing the probative value and relevance of evidence,\u201d the court finds that the Commission reasonably relied on Black Sea f.o.b. prices as an indication that subject imports were likely to undersell both domestic and non-subject urea. <em>Mukand </em>Ltd., 20 CIT at 906, 937 F.

Likely Impact on the Domestic Industry</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Upon review of the Commission\u2019s second sunset determination, the court held that the Commission failed to explain how it could find that high natural gas prices have weakened the domestic industry despite record evidence of increased profits and rising domestic urea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>prices. <em>See Azot I, </em>2007 WL 2563571, at *15. In addition, because the court found that the data on sales, production, market share, production capacity, and capacity utilization revealed no particular trend, the Commission could not reasonably conclude that the industry would be vulnerable to material injury. <em>See id. </em>at *16. On remand, the court instructed the Commission to \u201creassess the likely impact of subject imports on the domestic industry to account for the difference between the first sunset reviews\u2019 findings and the findings of the current review within the context of the domestic industry\u2019s recent improved performance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *16.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Following its reexamination of the record, the Commission found that the \u201cindustry is vulnerable to the likely adverse impact of the subject imports upon revocation of the orders.\u201d <em>Remand Determination </em>at 18.

Specifically, the industry lost 15.6 percent of its market share over the period of review, \u201cfalling from a majority position of 51.5 percent in 1999 to a minority position of 36.0 percent in 2004.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Between 2001 and 2004, industry capacity also declined significantly, falling 12 percent to 4.8 million tons. <em>Id. </em>Between 1999 and 2004, capacity utilization declined from 92.2 percent to 78.8 percent. <em>Id. </em>Other industry indicators show similar declines: shipment quantities fell by 19.8 percent during the period of review, workforce employment fell by 29.2 percent, hours worked fell by 30.5 percent and total wages fell by 13.3 percent. <em>Id. </em>(citing CR 134 at 1-7, Table 1-1 &amp; App. C.

The Commission also acknowledged that \u201calthough the industry\u2019s average unit prices and sales revenues increased considerably over the period of review, these increases were offset to some degree by considerable, but smaller, increases in the industry\u2019s cost of goods sold, and selling, general and administrative expenses.\u201d <em>Remand Determination </em>at 20; <em>see </em>CR 134 at 1-7, Table 1-1.

According to Plaintiffs, the inclusion of data from Mississippi Chemical Corp. and Terra Industries (which had exited the industry by 2005), to evaluate the \u201cvulnerability or likely impact to the remaining producers distorts the actual performance of the industry, making it look [\u00b6] ]] than it actually was.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Confidential Resp.

That the term \u201cindustry\u201d means <em>\u201cproducers as a whole </em>of a domestic like product\u201d indicates that the Commission must evaluate the entire industry and include all of the participating producers. \u00a7 1677(4)(A) (emphasis added).

A clear picture of market conditions and trends is possible only if the Commission considers all of the relevant economic data from the period of review. The fact that domestic producers were forced to exit the market is itself a condition of competition and an indicator of overall market conditions.
