Defendant opposes the motion, arguing that the substitution plaintiffs propose is prohibited by the Anti-Assignment Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3727 (2000). The court will deny plaintiffs\u2019 motion because plaintiffs have not alleged facts under which the proposed substitution of parties would be permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-15\">Plaintiffs seek to substitute High Liner Foods Incorporated (\u201cHigh Liner\u201d) for current plaintiff Ocean Cuisine International, a division of FPI Limited (\u201cFPI\u201d). Mot. to Substitute Party (Public) 1 (\u201cPis.\u2019 Mot. (Public)\u201d). In support of the motion, plaintiffs cite FPI\u2019s December 20, 2007 press release announcing that High Liner purchased certain of FPI\u2019s assets, specifically, FPI\u2019s \u201cNorth American Marketing and Manufacturing business, including value added processing facilities in Danvers, Massachusetts and Burin, Newfoundland and Labrador.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 1-2. Plaintiffs also state that FPI\u2019s importer numbers were terminated on January 14, 2008 and that thereafter, imports of subject merchandise were made using High Liner\u2019s importer number and continuous entry bond. <em>Id. </em>at 2. Plaintiffs state that \u201c[t]his substitution in no way seeks to enlarge or amend Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint to include bonds other than those listed\u201d and that they \u201cseek only to substitute FPI with High Liner with respect to those bonds already subject to this proceeding....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1346-4\">USCIT Rule 25(c) provides that \u201c[i]n case of any transfer of interest, the action may be continued by or against the original party, unless the court upon motion directs the person to whom the interest is transferred to be substituted in the action or joined with the original party.\u201d USCIT R. 25(c). To grant plaintiffs\u2019 motion, the court first must identify an interest that has been transferred from FPI to High Liner and that stands to be affected by the outcome of this litigation. On the facts plaintiffs have stated in their motion, the court is unable to identify such an interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-5\">This case involves, <em>inter alia, </em>challenges to bond sufficiency determinations by United States Customs and Border Protection. Plaintiffs acknowledge that High Liner\u2019s participation in this case would be confined to bonds already subject to this litigation. Plaintiffs, however, have not informed the court whether High Liner is now obligated to the United States on the entries that are covered by those bonds, on which entries High Liner was not the importer of record. Nor have plaintiffs explained whether, or how, High Liner became the principal on those bonds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1346-6\">Although plaintiffs state that \u201c[t]he name Ocean Cuisine International has been retired,\u201d it appears to the court that the interest in question may still reside with FPI. The court notes, in this regard, that plaintiffs state a fact causing the court to conclude that Ocean Cuisine International may not have capacity to sue in this case. Plaintiffs have represented that Ocean Cuisine International is an operating division of FPI, formerly known as Fishery Products International Ltd. Pis.\u2019 Mot. (Public) 1; Form 13, Feb. 24, 2006. An operating division of a corporation, which is not a separate legal entity, would not have the capacity to sue. <em>See EEOC v. St. Francis Xavier Parochial School, </em>77 F.Supp.2d 71, 75-76 (D.D.C. 1999) (discussing \u201ca line of precedent holding that unincorporated divisions of a corporation lack legal capacity to be sued\u201d); USCIT R. 17(b). Oh the facts as stated by plaintiffs in support of their motion, the court has no reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>to conclude that FPI is no longer the principal on the bonds at issue. The fact that the name Ocean Cuisine International is no longer in use does not lend support to plaintiffs\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-4\">In conclusion, the facts stated in plaintiffs\u2019 motion do not afford the court a basis to conclude that the proposed substitution of High Liner for FPI would satisfy USCIT Rule 25(c). The court, therefore, does not reach the issue of whether the proposed assignment would violate the prohibitions in 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3727 with respect to assignment of claims against the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-5\">For the foregoing reasons, and in consideration .of all submissions and proceedings herein, it is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-6\">ORDERED that plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Substitute Party, filed on October 14, 2008, is hereby DENIED without prejudice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1346-7\"> Plaintiffs state in their motion that \u201cHigh Liner has [</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-8\">].\u201dMot. to</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-9\">Substitute Party (Confidential) 2. Plaintiffs\u2019 statement, [</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-10\">] does not resolve</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-11\">the court\u2019s questions concerning High Liner\u2019s interest in this litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
