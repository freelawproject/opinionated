In response, Commerce initiated an antidumping investigation in early October 2005. CLPP From India, Indonesia, and the People\u2019s Republic of China, 70 Fed. Reg. 58,374 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Oct. 6, 2005) (notice of initiation of anti-dumping duty investigations).</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>Commerce published its preliminary determination in April 2006. <em>See </em>CLPP From India, 71 Fed. Reg. 19,706 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Apr. 17, 2006) (notice of preliminary determination of sales at less than fair value) (the \u201cPreliminary Determination\u201d). The Preliminary Determination found that two of the three respondents in the investigation, Navneet Publications (India) Ltd. (\u201cNavneet\u201d) and Aero Exports (\u201cAero\u201d), provided incomplete information in their cost of production questionnaire responses and that the information in their responses could neither be verified nor reasonably relied upon to calculate dumping margins. <em>See id. </em>at 19,709. As a result, the Department concluded that Navneet and Aero \u201cimpeded [Commerce\u2019s] investigation\u201d and \u201cfailed to cooperate to the best of their ability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19,709-10. Based upon these findings, Commerce assigned Navneet and Aero each an adverse facts available<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (\u201cAFA\u201d) dumping rate of 110.43 percent. <em>See id. </em>This rate was the highest transaction-specific margin found in the proceeding, i.e., a rate from a single Kejriwal transaction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-4\">Shortly after it issued the Preliminary Determination, Commerce conducted an on-site verification of Kejriwal. <em>See </em>Final-Results, 71 Fed. Reg. at 45,012. Commerce\u2019s verification analyzed the company\u2019s business and determined that its primary business was not producing and exporting the subject CLPP, but rather trading newsprint. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Br. 4; I&amp;D Memo, Comm. 2 at 6. Commerce\u2019s verification report \u201cexplained that Kejriwal finds suppliers and purchasers of newsprint in the domestic market, and negotiates purchase and sale prices with the manufacturers and purchasers of newsprint.\u201d Def.\u2019s Br. 4-5 (citing Memorandum to File from Laurens van Houten re: Verification of the Cost Response of Kejriwal Paper Limited in the Antidumping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>Investigation of Lined Paper from India at 4-5 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce June 13, 2006) (the \u201cVerification Report\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-5\">The Department concluded that Kejriwal incurred \u201csignificant expenses\u201d in financing and conducting the aforementioned transactions, but that, as a strategic business decision, it did not take title to or possession of the newsprint involved in these transactions in order \u201cto take advantage of a 16 percent tax exemption offered by the Government of India if newsprint \u2018is supplied directly from the manufacturer to the end consumers.\u2019 \u201d Def.\u2019s Br. 5 (quoting Verification Report at 8).</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-6\">Commerce issued its Final Results in August 2006. Final Results, 71 Fed. Reg. at 45,012. These Final Results deviated from the Preliminary Determination in one significant respect. Commerce determined that the AFA rate assigned to Navneet and Aero, which was based upon Kejriwal\u2019s highest transaction-specific dumping margin, \u201cwas aberrational because it stemmed from a single sale of a quantity that was significantly less than the size of the average sales quantity.\u201d Def.\u2019s Br. 5-6 (citing I&amp;D Memo, Comm. 15). As a result, in the Final Results, Commerce assigned Navneet and Aero the rate of 23.12 percent, the second highest margin calculated for Kejriwal during the proceeding. <em>See </em>Final Results, 71 Fed. Reg. at 45,103. This rate was a significant decrease from the preliminary rate of 110.43 percent. In doing so, the Department reasoned that, unlike the higher rate, the 23.17 percent rate was both \u201cnot aberrational and sufficiently higher than Kejriwal\u2019s calculated rate to induce respondents to cooperate fully with Commerce\u2019s requests.\u201d Def.\u2019s Br. 6 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-7\">In addition to assigning this AFA rate, the Department made other determinations in the Final Results. With regard to Kejriwal, Commerce granted it both a scrap offset and an excise tax rebate offset, and also \u201crevised the calculations from the <em>Preliminary Determination </em>to take into account its findings at verification and comments received from the parties.\u201d <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Br. 5. Commerce thus included the cost of newsprint turnover in the calculations of Kejriwal\u2019s financial expense ratio. Def.\u2019s Br. 6. In addition, the Department allocated a proportionate share of general and administrative (\u201cG&amp;A\u201d) expenses to Kejriwal\u2019s newsprint business. The Final Results provided Kejriwal a final weighted-average dumping margin of 3.91 percent. <em>See </em>Final Results, 71 Fed. Reg. 45,014.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-9\">The court reviews the Final Results under the substantial evidence and in accordance with law standard' set forth in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(i) (\u201cThe court shall hold unlawful any determination, finding, or conclusion found...to be unsupported by substantial evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>dence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law....\u201d). \u201cSubstantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Huaiyin Foreign Trade Corp. (30) v. United States, </em>322 F.3d 1369, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\">Further, the court must \u201creview verification procedures employed by Commerce in an investigation for abuse of discretion rather than against previously-set standards.\u201d <em>Micron Tech., Inc. v. United States, </em>117 F.3d 1386, 1396 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (\u201cBy requiring that Commerce report, on a case-by-case basis, the methods and procedures used to verify submitted information, Congress has implicitly delegated to Commerce the latitude to derive verification procedures <em>ad hoc\u201d) </em>(citations and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-6\">I. Commerce\u2019s Selection of an AFA Rate for Navneet and Aero</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-7\">The Association takes issue with Commerce\u2019s reduction of the AFA rate assigned to Navneet and Aero from the rate found in the Preliminary Determination (110.43 percent), to that in the Final Results (23.17 percent). It maintains that Commerce\u2019s 23.17 percent AFA rate is unlawful because it \u201cis not relevant to the uncooperative respondents [Navneet and Aero], does not reflect the likely rate for [them] had they cooperated..., and is not sufficiently high so as to discourage [their] noncompliance in future proceedings.\u201d Ass\u2019n Br. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-8\">In support of its arguments, the Association claims that Commerce improperly relied on Kejriwal\u2019s data in calculating the AFA rate without explaining the relevance of this data to Navneet and Aero. Furthermore, the Association insists that there is no record evidence demonstrating that the AFA rate assigned to Navneet and Aero reflects a rate that would have been calculated for them had they cooperated (including \u201ca built-in increase as a deterrent to noncompliance\u201d). Ass\u2019n Br. 11. To support its position, the Association analyzed the data actually submitted by Navneet and Aero (but rejected by Commerce), and urges that even \u201ca cursory analysis of the data .</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-9\">. . suggests that an [AFA] rate based on what their margins would have [been] in the event of their cooperation, would differ substantially from the rate selected by the Department.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>Ass\u2019n Br. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-10\">In its papers, Commerce maintains that its selection of the 23.17 percent rate was lawful and supported by substantial evidence. Def.\u2019s Br. 19. Commerce argues that the higher 110.43 percent rate was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>aberrational and thus it properly selected a different, albeit lower, rate that was \u201cbased on corroborated, verified, and reliable record information.\u201d Def.\u2019s Br. 10. Further, Commerce insists that the rate selected was \u201cindicative of the respondents\u2019 customary selling practices and... rationally related to the transactions to which the adverse facts available are being applied.\u201d Def.\u2019s Br. 15 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-5\">As to the Association\u2019s analysis of the data submitted by Navneet and Aero, Commerce argues that it is inherently flawed because it relies upon data rejected by the Department as incomplete and unverifiable. For Commerce, information that was found unreliable for calculating an actual rate cannot be considered \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d for purposes of questioning the assigned rate. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Br. 16. Finally, Commerce asserts that it acted within its discretion in selecting the AFA rate and determining that it was sufficiently high to deter noncompliance in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">Here, no party is challenging Commerce\u2019s decision to use an AFA rate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rather, the Association faults Commerce\u2019s manner of selecting the rate. \u201cCommerce has broad, but not unrestricted, discretion in determining what would be an accurate and reasonable dumping margin where a respondent has been found uncooperative.\u201d <em>Reiner Brack GmbH &amp; Co. KG v. United States, </em>26 CIT 549, 565, 206 F.Supp.2d 1323, 1339 (2002) <em>{\u201cReiner\u201d). </em>When applying an adverse inference, Commerce may rely on information from the petition, the final determination, previous reviews or determinations, and any other information placed on the record. <em>See F.lli De Cecco Di Filippo Fara S. Martino S.p.A. v. United States, </em>216 F.3d 1027, 1029-32 (Fed. Cir. 2000) <em>(\u201cDe Ceceo\u201d) </em>(\u201cIn the case of uncooperative respondents, the discretion granted by the statute... allow[s] Commerce to select among an enumeration of secondary sources as a basis for its adverse factual inferences.\u201d) (citing 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-7\">An AFA rate must \u201cbe a reasonably accurate estimate of the . . . actual rate, albeit with some built-in increase as a deterrent to noncompliance.\u201d <em>Ta Chen Stainless Steel Pipe, Inc. v. United States, </em>298 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>F.3d 1330, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (citing <em>De Ceceo, </em>216 F.3d at 1032). Therefore, \u201c[a]n AFA rate must be both reliable and bear a rational relationship to the respondent.\u201d <em>See Shandong Huarong Gen. Group Corp. v. United States, </em>31 CIT _, _, Slip Op. 07-4 at 9 (Jan. 9, 2007) (not reported in the Federal Supplement) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-6\">Because this case concerns an investigation, rather than an administrative review, under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b)(3), Commerce could not rely on the results of a previous review of Aero and Navneet\u2019s behavior, as is common in AFA determinations. <em>See, e.g., Shandong Huarong Mach. Co. v. United States, </em>31 CIT _, _, Slip Op. 07-169 at 10-11 (Nov. 20, 2007) (not reported in the Federal Supplement). Furthermore, Commerce determined that the margins included in the petition \u201cgreatly exceeded the ranges of rates calculated during the investigation\u201d and, therefore, lacked probative value. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Br. 14 (citations omitted). Thus, Commerce turned to record data from the investigation obtained from Kejriwal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-8\">The court finds Commerce\u2019s 23.17 percent rate was reasonable. In assigning this rate, Commerce was exercising its discretion as permitted by the statute, and was attempting to \u201cbalance the statutory objectives of finding an accurate dumping margin and inducing compliance, rather than creat[e] an overly punitive result.\u201d <em>Timken Co. v. United States, </em>354 F.3d 1334, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (citing <em>De Ceceo, </em>216 F.3d at 1032). As Commerce correctly points out, relying upon Navneet and Aero\u2019s rejected data would ignore the deficiencies in their responses that render them unreliable and thus not a source of substantial evidence. Any rate employing Navneet and Aero\u2019s rejected data \u2014 both as the basis of calculating an actual rate or for purposes of comparison \u2014 would therefore be invalid. <em>See Shanghai Taoen Int'l Trading Co. v. United States, </em>29 CIT 189, 199, 360 F.Supp.2d 1339, 1349 (2005) (finding that a preliminary margin relying upon data that was rejected and lacked credibility \u201chas no validity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-9\">For Commerce, the rate it selected, although not calculated using Navneet and Aero\u2019s data, \u201cis indicative of the respondents\u2019 customary selling practices and is rationally related to the transactions to which the [AFA] rates are being applied\u201d because it was calculated in the POR for a company in the same business. <em>See </em>I&amp;D Memo, Comm. 15 at 38. That is, Commerce selected a rate it perceived to be \u201cwithin the mainstream of Kejriwal\u2019s transactions (i.e., transactions that reflect\u2019 sales of products that are representative of the broader range of models used to determine [normal value]).\u201d I&amp;D Memo, Comm. 15 at 38. Further, having concluded that the 110.43 percent rate was aberrational because it was \u201cfrom a single sale with a sales quantity that is less than two percent of the average sales quantity,\u201d Commerce determined that \u201cthe second highest margin is not aberrational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>because its quantity...is within one standard deviation of the mean [quantity of merchandise in Kejriwal\u2019s reported transactions] . . . [and] it was a sale of notebooks.\u201d <em>See </em>Memorandum from Christopher Hargett to File re: Final Determination in the Antidumping Investigation of CLPP from India: Selection of Total AFA Rate\u201d at 2 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce July 31, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">Thus, here, though Commerce was not relying on Navneet and Aero\u2019s data, it did seek to ensure that its determination related to the companies to the greatest extent possible under the circumstances. That is, it (1) relied on verified data from another producer and exporter of CLPP in India during the same time period, (2) used a transaction that was of an adequate quantity of subject merchandise, and (3) confirmed that the quantity was appropriate with standard deviation analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Shanghai Taoen International Trading Co. v. United States, </em>29 CIT 189, 360 F.Supp.2d 1339 (2005) <em>(\u201cShanghai Taoen\u201d), </em>is instructive. In <em>Shanghai Taoen, </em>plaintiff challenged Commerce\u2019s final results of an administrative review of an antidumping duty order on crawfish tail meat from the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cPRC\u201d). Among other things, the plaintiff challenged the AFA rate assigned to it by Commerce. Commerce had assigned plaintiff a rate calculated for a different respondent from a prior administrative review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-7\">In upholding Commerce\u2019s AFA rate, the <em>Shanghai Taoen Court </em>observed that: (1) \u201cCommerce had no probative alternatives\u201d to the assigned margin; (2) this was the plaintiff\u2019s first administrative review on exports of subject merchandise so that there was no prior antidumping margin for Commerce to select; and, as referenced above, (3) proposed rates calculated with deficient data \u201c[have] no validity after Commerce\u2019s credibility conclusion\u201d (which led it to apply AFA in the first place). <em>Shanghai Taoen, </em>29 CIT at 199, 360 F.Supp.2d at 1348. Thus, the Court found that Commerce\u2019s selected AFA rate was \u201crationally related\u201d to the plaintiff \u201cbecause (1) the rate reflects recent commercial activity by a crawfish tail meat exporter from the PRC, and (2) [the plaintiff\u2019s] failure to accurately respond to Commerce\u2019s producer questions has resulted in an egregious lack of evidence on the record to suggest an alternative rate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199, 360 F.Supp.2d at 1348.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-8\">The logic of <em>Shanghai Taoen </em>is equally applicable here. Although <em>Shanghai Taoen </em>involved an administrative review and this case involves an investigation, the theory of the case is useful because <em>Shanghai Taoen </em>involved the first administrative review in which the plaintiff participated. Thus, in both cases, no prior rates for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>plaintiffs Were available and Commerce could not rely on the plaintiffs\u2019 own deficient data to determine a rate. Therefore, here, it was reasonable for Commerce to look to Kejriwal\u2019s data because: (1) it \u201creflects recent commercial activity\u201d by an exporter of subject merchandise from India, and (2) it was Aero and Navneet\u2019s reporting deficiencies that resulted in the lack of evidence on the record for Commerce to select an alternative rate. <em>See id. </em>at 199, 360 F.Supp.2d at 1348. Accordingly, Commerce selected, based upon the verified information available to it in the record, a rate that was reliable and' relevant to Navneet and Aero. The court finds that Commerce acted reasonably. <em>See NSK, Ltd. v. United States, </em>28 CIT 1535, 1562, 346 F.Supp.2d 1312, 1336 (2004) (stating that \u201cCommerce has leeway in calculating the applicable AFA rate\u201d for an uncooperative respondent).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">As to whether the rate was high enough to encourage future compliance, Commerce reasoned that the AFA rate \u201cselected [23.17 percent rate] is sufficiently higher than the calculated [3.91 percent] rate of the cooperative respondent [Kejriwal] in this investigation to induce respondents [Navneet and Aero] to cooperate fully with the Department\u2019s requests for accurate, complete and timely data.\u201d I&amp;D Memo, Comm. 15 at 38. Given the record before it, it cannot be said that Commerce was unreasonable in finding that the 23.17 percent AFA rate, which is nearly 600 percent greater than Kejriwal\u2019s rate, would encourage Navneet and Aero to comply fully in future reviews and investigations. <em>See De Cecco, </em>216 F.3d at 1032 (\u201cParticularly in the case of an uncooperative respondent, Commerce is in the best position, based on its expert knowledge of the market and the individual respondent, to select adverse facts that will create the proper deterrent to non-cooperation with its investigations and assure a reasonable margin.\u201d); <em>Ta Chen Stainless Steel Pipe, Inc., </em>298 F.3d at 1340 (\u201cWhile Commerce may have chosen the [AFA] rate with an eye toward deterrence, Commerce acts within its discretion so long as the rate chosen has a relationship to the actual sales information available.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">Accordingly, the court sustains as lawful and supported by substantial evidence Commerce\u2019s selection of an AFA rate for Navneet and Aero.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>II. Commerce\u2019s Grant of a Scrap Offset to Kejriwal</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">Commerce generally will only grant an offset to normal value,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for sales of scrap generated during the production of the subject merchandise, if the respondent can demonstrate that the scrap is either resold or has commercial value and re-enters the respondent\u2019s production process. <em>See Shandong Huarong Mach. Co. v. United States, </em>29 CIT 484, 487, Slip Op. 05-54 at 6 (2005) (not reported in the Federal Supplement). The Association argues that Kejriwal claimed a scrap offset to the cost of manufacturing CLPP, but that the company \u201cneither reintroduced into the production process nor sold [the scrap] during the period of investigation [(\u2018POI\u2019)].\u201d Ass\u2019n Br. 20. Therefore, the Association complains that Commerce erred in granting the offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-6\">The Association\u2019s primary objection to Commerce\u2019s decision to grant the offset to Kejriwal is that, even if the scrap had a value, the \u201cvalue was not realized during the [POI].\u201d Ass\u2019n Br. 21. Thus, the Association maintains that Commerce\u2019s decision \u201cto offset period costs with revenue generated afterwards... distort[s] the actual costs that Kejriwal faced during the relevant time period.\u201d Ass\u2019n Br. 24. Accordingly, it claims that Kejriwal did not meet its burden of demonstrating that an offset was warranted. <em>See </em>Ass\u2019n Br. 24-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-7\">Commerce, for its part, maintains that it properly granted Kejriwal a scrap offset because the scrap was \u201cdirectly related to subject merchandise produced during the [POI],\u201d and was recorded in Kejri-wal\u2019s books during the POI in accordance with the accrual method of accounting. Def.\u2019s Br. 20. Commerce points to the \u201creasoned explanation\u201d contained in its Issues and Decisions Memorandum to counter the Association\u2019s assertion that its decision to grant the offset was inadequately explained. Def.\u2019s Br. 20 (citing I&amp;D Memo, Comm. 4). By way of explanation, Commerce states that, although Kejriwal neither sold nor reintroduced the scrap during the POI, it did account for the scrap\u2019s estimated value on its books and that this treatment is consistent with Commerce\u2019s past practice. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Br. 20-21 (citation omitted) (reasoning that because \u201cthe scrap offset was based upon the costs of merchandise created during the [POI].... and was recorded in Kejriwal\u2019s books on an accrual basis for the [POI]...the question of when the actual scrap sale occurred [is] irrelevant)\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>Kejriwal notes that, because it first began producing subject merchandise during the POI (i.e., was a start-up operation), it sold much of the scrap generated during the POI in the several months after the POI ended, rather than during it. <em>See </em>Kejriwal Resp. Pl.\u2019s Mot. 9-10 (citing Verification Report at 15-17). Thus, \u201calthough Kejriwal\u2019s sales of scrap were outside of the POI, the revenue from sales was verifiable, and Commerce appropriately used the verified sales of scrap generated during the POI to value the required scrap offset.\u201d <em>See </em>Kejriwal Resp. Pl.\u2019s Mot. 10 (citations omitted). In other words, Commerce examined Kejriwal\u2019s financial records and concluded that, although Kejriwal did not sell the scrap during the POI, it estimated the value of the scrap based upon average market prices, recorded that amount in its stock statement and balance sheets, and was able to trace this estimated value to Kejriwal\u2019s own invoices for sales after the POI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">Kejriwal argues, therefore, that Commerce complied with the statutory requirements of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(b)(f)(l)(A) in its calculations. For Kejriwal, Commerce: (1) \u201ccalculated] [costs] based on the records of the exporter or producer of the merchandise, if such records are kept in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles [\u201cGAAP\u201d] of the exporting country...and reasonably reflect the costs associated with the production and sale of the merchandise,\u201d and (2) \u201cconsidered] all available evidence on the proper allocation of costs, including that which is made available by the exporter or producer on a timely basis, if such allocations have been historically used by the exporter or producer....\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(b)(f)(l)(A). Accordingly, Ke-jriwal insists that, using the accrual method of accounting, in accordance with Indian GAAP, it recorded the estimated value of scrap generated \u201cas a manufacturing cost\u201d and that Commerce correctly considered this fact when it reviewed its books. <em>See </em>Kejriwal Resp. Pl.\u2019s Mot. 11 (citing Verification Report at 23).</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-5\">The Association\u2019s claim presents both a legal and factual question: (1) whether Commerce\u2019s methodology in granting Kejriwal a scrap offset was in accordance with law, and (2) whether Commerce supported its decision to grant Kejriwal the offset with substantial evidence. As to the Association\u2019s legal claim, this Court, in <em>Ames True Temper v. United States, </em>31 CIT _, _, Slip Op. 07-133 at 10 (Aug. 31, 2007) (not reported in the Federal Supplement) <em>{\u201cAmes\u201d), </em>recently observed \u201cthe antidumping statute is silent as to how Commerce is to determine whether a respondent is entitled to a scrap offset to normal value and, if so entitled, how to calculate the amount of the offset.\u201d As such, the court\u2019s role is to assess if Commerce\u2019s determination is \u201cbased on a reasonable permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at _, Slip Op. 07-133 at 11-12 (citing <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number><em>Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984)); <em>see also Guangdong Chem. Imp. &amp; Exp. Corp. v. United States, </em>30 CIT _, 460 F.Supp.2d 1365, 1373 (2006) (\u201c19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c) does not mention the treatment of byproducts, nonetheless, Commerce sometimes grants a respondent a credit for a by-product... generated in the manufacturing process [that is] either reintroduced into production or sold for revenue.\u201d) (quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-7\">The court finds that Commerce acted in accordance with law in granting Kejriwal a scrap offset. The agency based its decision on its review of \u201cthe normal books and records of [Kejriwal] in accordance with Indian generally accepted accounting principles,\u201d kept on an accrual basis. I&amp;D Memo, Comm. 4 at 11. In addition, although Kejriwal\u2019s sales of scrap were outside of the POI, Commerce was able to verify the revenue from those sales and compare it to the amount recorded on Kejriwal\u2019s books during the POI. As a result, the Department confirmed the accuracy of Kejriwal\u2019s estimated values by tracing Kejriwal\u2019s actual average sales value to its invoices. I&amp;D Memo, Comm. 4 at 11. Thus, the amount of the offset was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Thai Pineapple Pub. Co. v. United States, </em>187 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (\u201cAs a general rule, an agency may either accept financial records kept according to generally accepted accounting principles in the country of exportation, or reject the records if accepting them would distort the company\u2019s true costs.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-8\">Accordingly, the court cannot credit the Association\u2019s argument that Commerce did not offer an adequate explanation for its decision. \u201cCommerce is [obligated] to adequately explain how its chosen methodology achieves the required result [of determining antidumping margins as accurately as possible].\u201d <em>Shandong Huarong Mach. Co., </em>29 CIT at 489, Slip Op. 05-54 at 10 (citations omitted). It has done so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-9\">It is clear that, because its CLPP business was a start-up operation, Kejriwal would not in the ordinary course of business sell its scrap during the POI. It is equally clear that its process generates valuable scrap and that Commerce was able to determine the scrap\u2019s value. Thus, in granting Kejriwal the scrap offset, Commerce acted reasonably by trying to present a true picture of Kejriwal\u2019s business under the circumstances. <em>See Ames, </em>31 CIT at _, Slip Op. 07-133 at 14 (sustaining a scrap offset because \u201cCommerce properly based its decision to grant Huarong the steel scrap offset on the company\u2019s financial books and records, applied a reasonable methodology, [and] supported its conclusion with substantial evidence . . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>Therefore, the court finds Commerce\u2019s conclusions to be in accordance with law and supported by substantial evidence and sustains Commerce\u2019s scrap offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">III. Commerce\u2019s Grant of an Excise Tax Rebate Offset to Kejriwal</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">The Association additionally argues that Commerce\u2019s decision to grant Kejriwal an excise tax rebate offset was improper. <em>See </em>Ass\u2019n Br. 25-26. Kejriwal paid an excise tax<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> on the purchase of raw materials in India and then received a rebate on the tax paid when the finished products were exported. Ass\u2019n Br. 25-26 (citation omitted). Given that Kejriwal\u2019s lined paper business was a start-up operation, the rebates \u201cin most cases,... occurred after the [POI].\u201d Ass\u2019n Br. 26 (citing Verification Report at 7). According to the Association, under these circumstances, the grant of an offset was improper because \u201cthe tax paid impacted... [Kejriwal\u2019s] costs of manufacture, but. . . the rebates had no effect at all on period costs.\u201d Ass\u2019n Br. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-6\">The Association, therefore, maintains that Kejriwal did not meet its burden of demonstrating that an offset was proper because Kejriwal necessarily could not show that the rebates reduced its costs during the POI. Thus, it argues that Commerce\u2019s grant of a rebate here is \u201cillogical\u201d and asks the court to remand the matter to Commerce for reconsideration. <em>See </em>Ass\u2019n Br. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-7\">Commerce insists that the grant of an excise tax rebate offset to Kejriwal was warranted because the rebate was directly related to Kejriwal\u2019s production of CLPP during the POI. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Br. 19-20. That is, \u201c[a]s with the value of scrap revenue, Commerce found that Kejriwal accrued or credited the tax rebate in the <em>current </em>period in its normal books and records.\u201d Def.\u2019s Br. 21. Commerce argues that the Association\u2019s \u201cfocus upon the fact that the rebate was not received during the current [POI] ignores record facts,\u201d i.e., that Kejriwal\u2019s lined paper business was a start-up operation, it utilized the accrual method of accounting, and it accounted for the value of the tax rebate on its books. Def.\u2019s Br. 22. Therefore, even though the revenue was not received during the POI, Commerce contends that the offset was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>justified and asks the court to sustain its determination. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Br. 22-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-6\">For its part, Kejriwal asserts that \u201cCommerce\u2019s recognition of an excise tax offset was correct in every respect, in accordance with India\u2019s GAAP and India\u2019s tax law and in accordance with U.S. anti-dumping law.\u201d <em>See </em>Kejriwal Resp. Pl.\u2019s Mot. 15-16 (citing 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(e)(3), which states that \u201cthe cost of materials shall be determined without regard to any internal tax in the exporting country imposed on such materials or their disposition which are remitted or refunded upon exportation of the subject merchandise produced from such materials\u201d). Thus, Kejriwal asserts that Commerce verified its accounting of excise taxes paid and that, in fact, they were later rebated, and that the Department\u2019s decision to grant the offset conforms with its past practice. <em>See </em>Kejriwal Resp. Pl.\u2019s Mot. 17-18 (citing Stainless Steel Bar From India, 65 Fed. Reg. 48,965 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Aug. 10, 2000) (final results); Certain Stainless Steel Wire from India, 65 Fed. Reg. 31,302 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce May 17, 2000)(fi-nal results).</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-7\">As with the scrap offset, Commerce relied on a review of Kejriwal\u2019s books to justify the grant of an excise tax rebate offset. Specifically, the Department observed that: (1) Kejriwal paid excise taxes, (2) Kejriwal received a refund for these paid taxes, albeit after the POI, and therefore (3) \u201c[i]n the end, no taxes were paid\u201d upon CLPP during the POI. Def.\u2019s Br. 21 (quoting I&amp;D Memo, Comm. 7 at 15). Commerce further observed that Kejriwal accounted for the tax rebate in its books for the time period covered by the POI in accordance with the accrual method of accounting. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Br. 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-8\">The court sustains Commerce grant of an excise tax offset to Ke-jriwal. Commerce acted properly under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(f)(l)(A) (requiring Commerce to calculate costs based on the records of the exporter if kept in accordance with GAAP of the exporting country and to \u201cconsider all available evidence\u201d), and in accordance with the case law. <em>See Elkem Metals Co. v. United States, </em>468 F.3d 795, 802 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (\u201c[I]t is entirely appropriate for Commerce to make an individual determination as to whether and to what extent [a value-added tax] is, given the circumstances of a particular country and company, a cost.\u201d); <em>FAG U.K. LTD. v. United States, </em>20 CIT 1277, 1290, 945 F. Supp. 260, 271 (1996) (\u201c[T]his Court has consistently upheld Commerce\u2019s reliance on a firm\u2019s expenses as recorded in the firm\u2019s financial statements, as long as those statements were prepared in accordance with the home country\u2019s GAAP and do not significantly distort the firm\u2019s actual costs.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>It is apparent that Commerce\u2019s grant of an excise tax rebate offset to Kejriwal was proper as Commerce based its decision on Kejriwal\u2019s financial records, circumstance as a start-up operation, and \u201ceconomic realities.\u201d <em>See Elkem Metals Co., </em>468 F.3d at 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">IV. Commerce\u2019s Calculation of Kejriwal\u2019s Financial Expense Ratio</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">The court next considers the Association\u2019s claim that Commerce\u2019s calculation of Kejriwal\u2019s financial expense ratio was flawed and unlawful. In antidumping investigations, Commerce must determine whether merchandise is sold, or is likely to be sold, at less than fair value by making \u201ca fair comparison . . . between the export price, or constructed export price and normal value.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a). During Commerce\u2019s investigation, it determined that \u201cKejriwal . . . did not sell subject merchandise in the ordinary course of trade in its home market during the POI.\u201d <em>See </em>Preliminary Determination, 71 Fed. Reg. at 19,707. Therefore, Commerce concluded that it \u201cmust use constructed value ... in its calculation of normal value . . . . \u201d <em>See id. </em>No party objects to this- conclusion..</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-6\">The financial expense ratio is a component of Commerce\u2019s constructed value calculation. Under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(e)(l)(B), when calculating constructed value, Commerce is directed to add an \u201c \u2018an amount for general expenses and profit equal to that usually reflected in sales of merchandise of the same general class or kind as the merchandise under consideration . . . \u2019 to the cost of materials and of fabrication or other processing.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See Gulf States Tube Div. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number><em>Quanex Corp. v.

Supp. 630, 648 (1997) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-5\">The Association maintains that Commerce improperly \u201cincluded newsprint turnover in Kejriwal\u2019s costs of goods sold and in the financial expense ratio calculations.\u201d Ass\u2019n Br. 13. It argues that the calculation was contrary to Commerce\u2019s established practices and inadequately explained. Ass\u2019n Br. 13. According to the Association, \u201c[t]he Department\u2019s decision to include newsprint turnover value in the denominator of the financial' expense ratio calculations was inconsistent with the treatment of the same item in the [general and administrative] expense ratio calculations,\u201d where the Department did not include newsprint turnover value in the denominator. Ass\u2019n Br. 14-15. It argues that Commerce has consistently considered an item to be \u201cpart of the costs of goods sold for purposes of calculating the financial expense ratio where the item is recorded as part of the costs of goods sold in a respondent\u2019s audited financial statements.\u201d Ass\u2019n Br. 16 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-6\">The Association notes that the cost of newsprint is not included as part of Kejriwal\u2019s cost of goods sold on its financial statements because it is a trader rather than a manufacturer of newsprint. Thus, according to the Association, Commerce\u2019s calculation contradicts its \u201cconsistent past practice.\u201d Ass\u2019n Br. 15-17 (citing Certain Pasta from Italy, 64 Fed. Reg. 6,615 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Feb. 10, 1999) (notice of final results); Silicomanganese from India, 67 Fed.

Reg. 47,100 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Aug. 4, 2004) (notice)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-7\">For its part, Commerce concedes that it departed from its past practice when it included the cost of newsprint traded in Kejriwal\u2019s cost of goods sold, but argues that doing so was necessary because of the unique nature of Kejriwal\u2019s business model. Def.\u2019s Br. 23 (citing I&amp;D Memo, Comm. 2). That is, \u201c[w]hile it is [Commerce\u2019s] normal practice to use the [cost of goods sold] from the income statements as [its] denominator,... [the] unusual facts in this case [thwarted] the purpose of the allocation ratio because of the structure of the newsprint transactions.\u201d <em>See </em>I&amp;D Memo, Comm. 2 at 6. In other words, Commerce- determined that, even though Kejriwal incurred great expense as a trader of newsprint, because it never took title to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>paper, using Commerce\u2019s normal calculation these significant expenses would not have been included in its cost of goods sold, and therefore a deviation was justified. <em>See </em>I&amp;D Memo, Comm. 2 at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-4\">Thus, Commerce argues that, when necessary, \u201cit is free to change its methodology as long as it fully explains its reasoning for doing so.\u201d Def.\u2019s Br. 24-25 (explaining that Commerce determined that following its standard practice in this matter would have led to a \u201cdistorted calculation\u201d) (citations omitted). Commerce additionally argues that it was justified in including newsprint turnover value in the denominator of Kejriwal\u2019s financial expense ratio but not in its G&amp;A expense ratio. Def.\u2019s Br. 29. Again, Commerce noted, it did so because this case presented \u201cunusual facts,\u201d i.e., the significant proportion of Kejriwal\u2019s financial expenses incurred by its trading rather than its sales business. <em>See </em>I&amp;D Memo, Comm. 2 at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-5\">Kejriwal asserts that Commerce\u2019s calculation of its financial expense ratio was reasonable, supported by substantial evidence, and in accordance with law. <em>See </em>Kejriwal Resp. Pl.\u2019s Mot. 3. It maintains that the Association seeks to have Commerce calculate a ratio that \u201cignores the intensity of Kejriwal\u2019s financial investment and commitment to its newsprint business.\u201d Kejriwal Resp. Pl.\u2019s Mot. 3. Put another way, Kejriwal argues that Commerce was correct in determining that Kejriwal\u2019s financial expense ratio would have been distorted if Commerce had not included the cost of newsprint traded in the denominator. .</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-6\">Kejriwal further notes that its audited financial statements include \u201cnumerous references\u201d to its newsprint turnover and that \u201c[djuring verification, Commerce ascertained that approximately 69% of Kejri-wal\u2019s financial expenses were attributable solely to the company\u2019s newsprint business, compared to about 22% attributable to the production of subject merchandise.\u201d Kejriwal Resp. Pl.\u2019s Mot. 3-4 (citing Verification Report at 36).</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-7\">It is well-settled that \u201c[a]n agency is obligated to follow precedent, and if it chooses to change, it must explain why.\u201d <em>M.M. &amp; P.

This being the case, the court must examine the adequacy of the Department\u2019s justification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>for this deviation. By way of explanation, Commerce states that it typically uses the cost of goods sold from a respondent\u2019s income statements as the denominator of the financial expense ratio. I&amp;D Memo, Comm. 2 at 6. Commerce decided here, however, that because of Kejriwal\u2019s significant newsprint business, it was \u201cappropriate to include the value of the newsprint traded as part of the denominator of the financial expense ratio in order to allocate the expenses to all of Kejriwal\u2019s business activities.\u201d I&amp;D Memo, Comm. 2 at 6. Commerce arrived at this decision after considering arguments advanced by both Kejriwal and the Association at the agency level and verifying Kejriwal\u2019s financial expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-5\">Having reviewed Commerce\u2019s findings and reasoning, the court concludes that Commerce adequately explained itself and supplied the \u201creasoned analysis\u201d necessary to depart from its normal practice. <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>463 U.S. 29, 42 (1983). Commerce agreed with Kejriwal that it would be unreasonable to include only cost of goods sold in the denominator in calculating the financial expense ratio because the financing costs associated with Kejriwal\u2019s newsprint business far exceeded the cost of goods sold (i.e., its CLPP business) reflected in Kejriwal\u2019s financial statements. That is, because the newsprint line of business incurred significant financial expenses, it was not reasonable to allocate all financial expenses to the CLPP line of business. I&amp;D Memo, Comm. 2 at 5 (\u201c[A]llocating all financial expenses to lined paper would overstate the cost of production of lined paper.\u201d). Thus, Commerce concluded that in order to achieve a true picture of the company\u2019s business, an amount must be included for the financial expenses incurred to trade paper, i.e., the amount of interest it paid in financing its newsprint transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-6\">Given this analysis, the court cannot credit the Association\u2019s assertions that Commerce did not adequately explain its decision or provide adequate reasons for deviating from past precedent. The court\u2019s review of the Department\u2019s findings reveals that the agency considered the unique facts that Kejriwal\u2019s business model presented and made its decision after verifying Kejriwal\u2019s financial expenses.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>Further, having acknowledged that it was treating this matter differently than it typically treats financial expense ratio calculations, Commerce provided \u201cadequate guidance to parties affected by its actions\u201d and \u201cpresent [ed] the reviewing court with a discernable basis to judge\u201d the deviation from its normal practice. <em>Comm. for Fair Beam Imps. v.

The G&amp;A expense ratio is the component of constructed value in which Commerce accounts for certain of a company\u2019s overhead expenses.

The Association acknowledges that Commerce requested \u201ca detailed analysis\u201d of G&amp;A expenses, but claims that, rather than provide such an analysis, Kejriwal provided new factual information. It insists that Commerce\u2019s acceptance of this new information runs counter to the purpose of verification, which is to confirm the accuracy of previously obtained information rather than to gather new information. <em>See </em>Ass\u2019n Br. 19 (citing 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.307(d)). The Association asserts, therefore, that Commerce should have rejected Kejriwal\u2019s submission as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1235-8\">Commerce maintains that Kejriwal\u2019s submission was not untimely because the Department \u201casked Kejriwal to prepare, to clarify and corroborate the data submitted in [its] questionnaire responses.\u201d Def.\u2019s Br. 36. Commerce characterizes Kejriwal\u2019s submission as a \u201cdetailed analysis of information already submitted,\u201d rather than new information. Def.\u2019s Br. 36. The Department thus asserts that it acted within its discretion in accepting Kejriwal\u2019s analysis and also states that, in limited circumstances,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> respondents may provide new factual information at verification.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>Commerce notes that it sent Kejriwal an agenda before the verification, asking for a more detailed analysis of certain G&amp;A expenses. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Br. 37-38; <em>see also </em>Letter Dated May 5, 2006 with Attachments from Program Manager to deKieffer &amp; Horgan at 10 (the \u201cVerification Agenda\u201d). The Department adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1236-4\">To the extent that Commerce requested and Kejriwal provided further details regarding particular cost items, accounts, or transactions, the information that was obtained [was] to \u201ccorroborate, support, or clarify information already on the record\u201d of the proceeding, in accordance with Commerce practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1236-5\">Def.\u2019s Br. 38-39 (quoting Structural Steel Beams From Luxembourg, 67 Fed. Reg. 35,488, Comm. 1 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce May 20, 2002) (notice)). As a result, Commerce argues that the procedures it employed respecting Kejriwal\u2019s verification were in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-6\">While faulting Commerce\u2019s calculation of its G&amp;A expense ratio in other respects, Kejriwal asserts that it timely submitted all information requested by the Department. <em>See </em>Kejriwal Resp. Pl.\u2019s Mot. 6-7. It argues that its G&amp;A analysis submission was fully in accordance with Commerce\u2019s requests. In other words, Kejriwal insists that its submission was responsive rather than excessive. <em>See </em>Kejriwal Resp. Pl.\u2019s Mot. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-7\">Generally, when asked by an interested party, Commerce \u201cshall,\u201d to the extent practicable, verify information presented to it during an antidumping review. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(i)(3); 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.307(a). As noted above, however, the Department enjoys some discretion in selecting its verification methodology. <em>See Micron Tech., Inc., </em>117 F.3d at 1396.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-8\">With this in mind, the court finds that Commerce correctly accepted Kejriwal\u2019s G&amp;A analysis submission provided to the Department at the time of verification. It is within Commerce\u2019s discretion to accept such information, particularly when Commerce reasonably believes the information clarifies and corroborates previously submitted information. <em>See Reiner, </em>26 CIT at 560, 206 F.Supp.2d at 1334 (explaining that Commerce has discretion to accept new information presented during verification that clarifies or corroborates information on the record, but may also reject as untimely \u201csubstantial revisions\u201d presented during verification) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-9\">Here, Commerce\u2019s Verification Agenda expressly required Kejriwal to prepare, in advance of verification: (1) a review of its newsprint business explaining \u201chow the expenses related to the Newsprint business is recorded in Kejriwal\u2019s financial accounting system;\u201d (2) \u201c[o]b-tain a schedule that identifies all major categories of selling, general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>and administrative expenses;\u201d and (3) \u201c[t]race the total of selling, general and administrative expenses to the [company\u2019s] financial statements....\u201d <em>See </em>Verification Agenda at 4, 10-11. These requests expanded upon requests previously made in Commerce\u2019s Standard Questionnaire. <em>See </em>Standard Questionnaire at D-14, 1 (asking for a G&amp;A breakdown and requesting the respondent to \u201c [demonstrate how the G&amp;A expenses and the [cost of goods sold] used in the ratio reconcile to your company\u2019s audited fiscal year financial statements\u201d). In addition, Commerce\u2019s regulations specifically permit respondents to provide the Department with new factual information at or soon after verification: \u201cfactual information requested by the verifying officials from a person normally will be due no later than seven days after the date on which the verification of that person is completed.\u201d <em>See </em>19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.301(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-5\">Therefore, it was entirely in accordance with law for Commerce to seek clarification as to these topics at the time of verification and for Kejriwal to provide additional responsive information, particularly concerning the extent of its newsprint business. \u201cCommerce has often accepted new information when...the information corroborates, supports, or clarifies information already on the record.\u201d <em>CITIC Trading Co., </em>27 CIT at 373, Slip Op. 03-23 at 27-28 (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-6\">Here, as evidenced by Commerce\u2019s Verification Report, the Department \u201cused the analyses provided by Kejriwal and reconciled them with the information already submitted\u201d and \u201censure [d] that cost data already submitted was categorized correctly.\u201d <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Br. 39; Verification Report at 31-34. Accordingly, it cannot\u2019be said that Commerce abused its discretion. <em>See Am. Alloys, Inc. v. United States, </em>30 F.3d 1469, 1475 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (\u201c[T]he statute gives Commerce wide latitude in its verification procedures.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-7\">2. Commerce\u2019s Calculation of Kejriwal\u2019s General and Administrative Expense Ratio</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-8\">For its part, Kejriwal challenges Commerce\u2019s calculation of its G&amp;A expense ratio because the Department did not include the cost of newsprint traded in the ratio\u2019s denominator. Kejriwal argues that, by not including the cost of newsprint traded in the denominator, Commerce failed to adhere to its own precedent and long-standing practice of calculating a company\u2019s G&amp;A expense ratio for the operations of a company as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-9\">As an initial matter, Kejriwal points to Commerce\u2019s Antidumping Manual to establish Commerce\u2019s standard calculation of the G&amp;A expense ratio. The Antidumping Manual states, in pertinent part, that Commerce prefers to calculate the G&amp;A expense ratio \u201cby divid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>ing the fiscal year G&amp;A expenses by the fiscal cost of goods sold (adjusted for categories of expense not included in [cost of manufacture], such as packing)...\u201d <em>See </em>Antidumping Manual Ch. 8 at 58 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Jan. 22, 1998). Commerce then applies the percentage to the cost of manufacture of the product. <em>See id. But see </em>Kejriwal\u2019s Br. 15, n.16 (acknowledging that Commerce\u2019s Antidumping Manual states that it \u201cis for the internal guidance of import administration personnel only and cannot be cited to establish Commerce practice\u201d). Kejriwal then points to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Floral Trade Council v. United States, </em>23 CIT 20, 44, 41 F.Supp.2d 319, 341 (1999), among others, to note that this Court has repeatedly upheld this method of determining the G&amp;A expense ratio. <em>See </em>Kejriwal\u2019s Br. 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">According to Kejriwal, after verification, \u201cCommerce realized that it could not calculate an accurate [constructed value] for Kejriwal on a company division basis,\u201d and therefore modified its methodology by \u201cidentifiying] certain direct expenses,\u201d removing them from the numerator, \u201cand add [ing] them to the denominator as the cost of newsprint revenue.\u201d Kejriwal Br. 18. For Kejriwal, Commerce\u2019s methodology did not fully account for the significance of its newsprint business. It asserts that \u201c|h]ad Commerce properly calculated the company\u2019s G&amp;A expense ratio and thus arrived at an accurate [constructed value], Kejriwal\u2019s corresponding dumping margin would have been <em>de minimus </em>and the company would not be subject to the antidumping duty order against [CLPP] from India.\u201d Kejriwal\u2019s Br. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-5\">To bolster its point, Kejriwal notes that Commerce \u201cverified in great detail\u201d that the bulk of its G&amp;A expenses were attributable to its newsprint business, but Commerce still allocated 91 percent of its G&amp;A expenses to subject CLPP and only 9 percent to non-subject merchandise. <em>See </em>Kejriwal Br. 19-20. Kejriwal further argues that Commerce\u2019s reason for not including newsprint traded in the denominator (i.e., that \u201cthe cost of the raw materials supplied by the customer should not be included in the [cost of goods sold] because there was no recognized expense and there is no matching revenue item for those physical raw materials\u201d) is flawed. <em>See </em>Kejriwal\u2019s Br. 21 (quoting I&amp;D Memo, Comm. 3 at 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-6\">Kejriwal points out that Commerce included the cost of newsprint traded in the.denominator in its calculation of Kejriwal\u2019s financial expense ratio because of the unique nature of its business model. <em>See </em>Kejriwal\u2019s Br. 24-26. It believes that this unique nature makes it necessary to allocate company-wide G&amp;A expenses to the company-wide cost of goods sold in both its G&amp;A and financial expense ratios. Therefore, it asserts that, to \u201cproperly \u00e1ccount for Kejriwal\u2019s business in nonsubject merchandise, Commerce should have included the cost of newsprint traded in the denominator of its G&amp;A expense ratio. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>There are no reasonable arguments to justify excluding this cost from Commerce\u2019s calculation.\u201d Kejriwal\u2019s Br. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">For its part, the Association argues that \u201cKejriwal proposes that the Department impute a cost for newsprint that the company never purchased, never received into inventory, never took title to, never paid for, and never resold.\u201d <em>See </em>Ass\u2019n Resp. Br. 10. Therefore, it insists: \u201c[T]he Departments\u2019s refusal to include the cost of newsprint in the G&amp;A expense ratio was reasonable and was supported by the evidence of record....\u201d <em>See </em>Ass\u2019n Resp. Br. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">Commerce argues that it justifiably distinguished its treatment of the costs of newsprint traded in calculating Kejriwal\u2019s financial expense and G&amp;A expense ratio because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1239-7\">Commerce found that the financial expense for the traded newsprint was necessary due to \u201cunusual facts in this case where the purpose of the allocation ratio is thwarted because of the structure of the newsprint transactions. Thus, it is appropriate to allocate the financing expenses of the company as a whole to both the cost of goods manufactured directly by Kejriwal and the cost of the goods traded.\u201d For G&amp;A expenses, on the other hand, Commerce found that the \u201ccost of the raw materials supplied by the customer should not be included in the [cost of goods sold] because there was no recognized expense and there is no matching revenue item for those physical raw materials.\u201d Thus, Commerce did not \u201cinclude [ ] the cost of newsprint in the [cost of goods sold] but instead reclassified certain newsprint operation direct expenses from G&amp;A expense to cost of newsprint revenue and included those expenses in the denominator of the G&amp;A expense ratio calculation.\u201d This division is reasonable given the \u201cunique\u201d facts and division between financial expense, which applied to all of the newsprint, and G&amp;A, which did not involve the raw materials for the newsprint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1239-8\">Def.\u2019s Br. 29 (quoting I&amp;D Memo, Comms. 2-3) (internal citations omitted). Thus, the Department maintains that it made the necessary adjustments to give a fair picture of Kejriwal\u2019s business. As a result, Commerce asks the court to sustain its decision because, it insists, the decision was justified, fully explained, and within its discretion. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Br. 28-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-9\">Commerce must calculate as accurate a constructed value as possible, including therein its calculation of general and administrative expenses. <em>See Thai I-Mei Frozen Foods Co. v. United States, </em>32 CIT _, _, 572 F.Supp.2d 1353, 1359 (2008) (\u201cCommerce must be guided by the objectives of achieving an accurate margin and a fair comparison between export price and normal value.\u201d). Commerce is further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>required to calculate costs based on a respondent\u2019s reasonably reflective records and \u201cconsider all available evidence on the proper allocation of costs....\u201d <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(f)(l)(A). The statute provides no further guidance and therefore Commerce is afforded certain discretion in calculating G&amp;A expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-4\">Having reviewed the record, the court finds that Commerce\u2019s explanation of its construction of the G&amp;A expense ratio is inadequate. Therefore, it must be remanded for reconsideration. Here, Commerce verified that the majority of Kejriwal\u2019s G&amp;A expenses are associated with its newsprint operations, but allocated the majority of such expenses to its CLPP business. As Kejriwal explains, and the record confirms, Kejriwal had approximately 60 suppliers and customers of newsprint and fewer than five CLPP customers. Further, six and one-half out of Kejriwal\u2019s seven offices were dedicated to newsprint trading, as were most of its employees. <em>See </em>Kejriwal Br. 19 \u2014 20 (citing Verification Report at 8-11, Ex. 4 at 2. This being the case, the Department has failed to explain how it is reasonable to include overhead expenses associated with Kejriwal\u2019s newsprint business in the numerator and not include some appropriate corresponding value in the denominator. In addition, the court\u2019s comparison of Kejriwal\u2019s profit and loss account for the year ending March 31, 2004, before the POR and before Kejriwal started its CLPP operation, with that for the year ending March 31, 2005, further reveals that the large majority of Kejriwal\u2019s G&amp;A expenses were associated with newsprint trading, i.e., non-subject merchandise.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Nevertheless, Commerce\u2019s calculation does not seem to account for this in allocating G&amp;A expenses to subject merchandise, and therefore does not give a fair picture of the company\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1240-5\">Given these findings, the court cannot conclude that Commerce\u2019s analysis was reasonable. Accordingly, this matter is remanded to Commerce for it to reconsider Kejriwal\u2019s G&amp;A expense ratio calculation in a manner comporting with this opinion. On remand, the agency is directed to account for Kejriwal\u2019s cost of newsprint traded (or some fair equivalent value) in the denominator of the ratio of its G&amp;A expense ratio calculation, and recalculate Kejriwal\u2019s G&amp;A expenses allocated to Kejriwal\u2019s subject merchandise. Alternatively, Commerce is directed to explain in detail how its treatment of Kejri-wal\u2019s G&amp;A expense ratio fairly allocates G&amp;A expenses between subject and non-subject merchandise. Commerce shall make specific reference to the record evidence demonstrating that, as reported in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>footnote 14, the majority of Kejriwal\u2019s G&amp;A expenses are associated with its newsprint operations. This includes, but is not limited to, the number of Kejriwal\u2019s offices, employees, suppliers, and customers dedicated to its newsprint business, as compared to its CLPP operation. The Department shall further explain how its G&amp;A expense ratio calculation is consistent with its treatment of Kejriwal\u2019s financial expense ratio and with the overarching purpose of calculating as accurate a dumping margin as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-6\">For the reasons stated, Commerce\u2019s final results of administrative review are sustained in part and remanded. Remand results are due on or before January 16, 2009. Comments to the remand results are due on or before February 16, 2009.
