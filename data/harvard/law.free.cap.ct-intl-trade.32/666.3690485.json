Ltd. (\u201cThai-I-Mei\u201d) has moved for a modification of a preliminary injunction previously entered by this court on November 26, 2007 (\u201c2007 Injunction\u201d). Defendant-Intervenor asks this court to remove its entries of certain frozen warmwater shrimp shipp\u00e9d between August 4, 2004 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>and January 31, 2006 from the scope of the 2007 Injunction. The court has the power to grant the requested relief pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a71516a(c)(2) and USCIT R. 65(a). <em>See also SKF Inc. v. United States, </em>28 CIT 170,182, 316 F.Supp. 2d 1322, 1334 (2004). Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s Partial Consent Motion to Modify the Preliminary Injunction (\u201cDefendant-Intervenor\u2019s Motion to Modify\u201d) is DENIED, for failure to meet the burden of establishing a change in circumstances which is necessary for the court to modify a preliminary injunction. <em>Aimcor, Ala. Silicon, Inc. v. United States, </em>23 CIT 932, 939, 83 F.Supp.2d 1293, 1298-99 (1999) (citing <em>Favia v. Ind. Univ. of Pa., </em>7 F.3d 332, 340 (3d Cir. 1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Plaintiff Ad Hoc Shrimp Trade Action Committee, requested, on November 21, 2007, an order from this court enjoining, during the pendency of this action, the liquidation of entries into the United States of certain frozen warmwater shrimp from Thailand that: (1) are covered by <em>Certain Frozen Warmwater Shrimp from Thailand: Final Results and Final Partial Rescission of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, </em>72 Fed. Reg. 52,065 (Sept. 12, 2007) (\u201cFinal Results\u201d); (2) were entered, or were withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after August 4, 2004, through and including January 31, 2006; and (3) were produced and/or exported by any of the following exporters: Good Luck Product Co., Ltd., Thai I-Mei Frozen Foods Co., Ltd. (Defendant-Intervenor), Fortune Frozen Foods (Thailand) Co., Ltd., and Surapon Nichirei Foods Co., Ltd. Plaintiff\u2019s Consent Motion for Preliminary Injunction to Enjoin Liquidation of Certain Entries (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Consent Motion for Preliminary Injunction\u201d). In its Consent Motion, Plaintiff presented to the court sufficient evidence of all of the factors necessary for the court to grant a preliminary injunction as established by <em>Zenith Radio Corp. v. United States, </em>710 F.2d 806, 809 (Fed. Cir. 1983).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff\u2019s Consent Motion for Preliminary Injunction at 2-6. Upon review of the arguments set forth by Plaintiff, the court issued a preliminary injunction on November 26, 2007. Order Granting Plaintiff\u2019s Consent Motion for Preliminary Injunction at 1 (November 26, 2007). On January 4, 2008, the court permitted Defendant-Intervenor to intervene as a matter of right in this case. Order Granting Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Motion to Intervene Admittance at 1 (January, 4, 2008). On January 18, 2008, Defendant-Intervenor filed a partial consent motion seeking to modify the 2007 Injunction. (\u201cDefendant-Intervenor\u2019s Motion to Modify\u201d). Defendant-Intervenor brought to the court\u2019s attention the fact that Plaintiff, in its Consent Motion for the 2007 Preliminary Injunction, had not made the court aware of an existing order enjoining the liquidation of Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s entries of certain frozen warmwater shrimp made between August 4, 2004 and January 31, 2006, issued by this court in 2005 in the case <em>Thai I-Mei Frozen Foods Co., Ltd. v. United States, </em>CIT Court No. 05-00197 (the \u201c2005 Injunction\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 2-3. Defendant-Intervenor argues that the court granted Plaintiff\u2019s Consent Motion for Preliminary Injunction, in part, as a result of Plaintiff\u2019s failure to raise the 2005 Injunction. Id. at 3. Defendant-Intervenor takes the position that but for this failure, Plaintiff\u2019s omission to the court regarding the 2005 injunction, Plaintiff would have not have been able to make the required showing under each of the four <em>Zenith </em>factors and thus was not entitled to injunctive relief with respect to Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s entries. <em>Id. </em>at 4. Defendant-Intervenor argues that Plaintiff has not established that sufficient irreparable harm that would occur without the 2007 injunction, and as a result, Plaintiff did not satisfactorily prove its need for a preliminary injunction with respect to its entries. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, Defendant-Intervenor asks the court to modify the 2007 Injunction by limiting its scope so that no longer applies to Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s entries.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">.A</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">The Court Correctly Issued the 2007 Injunction in Accordance with the <em>Zenith </em>Factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">Injunctive relief is an \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d to be granted sparingly. <em>Weinberger v. Romero-Barcel\u00f3, </em>456 U.S. 305, 102 S. Ct. 1798, (312, 72 L. Ed. 2d 91),(1982); <em>FMC Corp v. United States, </em>3 F.3d 424 427 (Fed Cir. 1993). However, there are circumstances that do merit injunctive relief before trial. To be granted injunctive relief, the mo-vant bears the burden of establishing that (1) absent the requested relief, it will suffer immediate irreparable harm; (2) there exists in its favor a likelihood of success on the merits; (3) the public interest would be better served by the requested relief; and (4) the balance of the hardships on all parties tips in its favor. <em>Zenith Radio Corp, </em>710 F.2d at 809. Plaintiff successfully proved all four of the required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>factors to the court\u2019s satisfaction. Order Granting Plaintiff\u2019s Consent Motion for Preliminary Injunction at 3-5. Upon these showings, the court granted Plaintiff\u2019s Consent Motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">Defendant-Intervenor claims that the 2007 Injunction should be modified to exclude Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s entries given Plaintiff\u2019s failure to raise the 2005 Injunction; according to Defendant-Intervenor, this failure invalidates Plaintiff\u2019s position with respect to \u201cirreparable harm,\u201d the first of the four <em>Zenith </em>factors. Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s Motion to Modify at 4; Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s Reply in Support of Partial Consent Motion to Modify Preliminary Injunction (\u201cDefendant-Intervenor\u2019s Reply\u201d) at 2. Furthermore, Defendant-Intervenor argues that Plaintiff must again prove the immediacy of irreparable harm in order to keep the 2007 Injunction intact. <em>Id. </em>at 3-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The Plaintiff, having met its burden of persuasion (the four <em>Zenith </em>factors) initially in order to receive the 2007 Injunction does not have to convince the court again of its necessity. <em>SKF USA Inc. v. United States, </em>28 CIT at 182. (\u201cThe court, however is not persuaded that the Plaintiffs, having met their burden of persuasion initially in order to receive the preliminary injunction, must again convince the court of its necessity in order to appeal the court\u2019s judgment. Rather it remains incumbent upon the Defendant to persuade the court that the injunction is unnecessary and should be reconsidered or dissolved.\u201d). In the instant case, the court will not allow Defendant-Intervenor, which is attempting to modify the 2007 Injunction to effectively shift the burden to the Plaintiff to reprove the factors for preliminary injunction that have previously been proven to the court\u2019s satisfaction. Rather, the court needs only to examine whether the Defendant-Intervenor has raised circumstances which effectively justify a rehearing of its prior determination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">The Court Has the Authority to Maintain the 2007 Injunction Even if the Threat of \u201cIrreparable Harm\u201d Is Not as Imminent as First Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">The court has the power to grant an injunction even in the absence of a strong \u201cirreparable harm\u201d showing. The court is entitled to employ a \u201csliding scale\u201d in regards to the valuation of the four <em>Zenith </em>factors, <em>Chilean Nitrate Corp v. United States, 11 </em>CIT 538, 539 (1987), and consequently need not assign to each factor equal weight, <em>FMC </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number><em>Corp., </em>3 F.3d at 427. None of the <em>Zenith </em>factors, \u201ctaken individually must necessarily be dispositive in the court\u2019s analysis.\u201d See <em>Id. </em>at 427; the weakness of the showing regarding one factor may be overborne by the strength of others. <em>Id. </em>Thus, while the court is within its rightful discretion to issue a preliminary injunction even if there is a less immediate finding of irreparable harm, Plaintiff has demonstrated the immediacy of harm in a manner sufficient to this court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Plaintiff\u2019s Response to Thai I-Mei\u2019s Motion to Modify Preliminary Injunction (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Response\u2019) at 7-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Defendant-Intervenor Has Not Met Its Burden of Proving \u201cChanged Circumstances\u201d to Warrant a Modification of the 2007 Injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">The court has inherent power and discretion to modify injunctions for changed circumstances.\u201d <em>Aimcor, </em>23 CIT at 938 (citing <em>Sys. Fed\u2019n No. 91 v. Wright, </em>364 U.S. 642, 647, (81 S. Ct. 368) 5 L. Ed. 2d 349 (1961)). However, the party challenging the preliminary injunction or seeking to modify it must prove that the injunction \u201cis unnecessary and should be reconsidered or dissolved.\u201d <em>SKF, </em>316 F. Supp.2d at 1334. Accordingly, in order to succeed in obtaining a modification of the 2007 Injunction, Defendant-Intervenor must establish a change in circumstances of the parties from the time the injunction was issued that would make the modification necessary. Additionally, the party seeking to modify a preliminary injunction bears the burden of establishing a change in circumstances that would make continuation of the original preliminary injunction inequitable. <em>SNR Roulements v. United States, </em>521 F.Supp.2d 1395, 1398 (CIT 2007) (citing <em>Favia v. Ind. Univ. of Pa., </em>7 F.3d at 340). The Defendant-Intervenor has failed to effectively prove the necessary elements required for a modification of the 2007 Injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">While this court has the discretion to modify injunctions, it will not modify the 2007 Injunction because Defendant-Intervenor has not established (1) a changed circumstance of either Plaintiff or Defendant-Intervenor, or (2) that the 2007 Injunction is unnecessary to protect Plaintiff from harm that would occur upon liquidation of Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s entries covered under the 2005 injunction. Defendant-Intervenor does not address or support in its Motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>Modify (1) an argument that a change in either party\u2019s circumstance has made or would make the 2007 Injunction inequitable to Defendant-Intervenor or (2) that without the modification of the November 26, Preliminary Injunction Defendant-Intervenor will suffer commercial harm. <em>See </em>Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s Motion to Modify at 2-5. In fact, <em>Defendant-Intervenor admits in its Reply that it will \u201cnot suffer commercial harm if its Partial Consent Motion is denied\u201d </em>Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s Reply at 1 (emphasis added). .</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Plaintiff, in contrast, addressed in its Response the probability that Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s case <em>(Thai I-Mei Frozen Foods Co., Ltd. v. United States, </em>CIT Court No.05-00197) will be completed before the instant case. Plaintiff\u2019s Response to Thai I-Mei\u2019s Motion to Modify Preliminary Injunction (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Response\u201d) at 7-9. If the 2005 Injunction issued in that case dissolves while this case is still being litigated, the statutory scheme requires that Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s entries from the first period of review be liquidated in accordance with Commerce\u2019s final determination under challenge in this case unless those entries are included the November 26 Preliminary Injunction. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a71516(a)(c)(l)-(2). Plaintiff\u2019s Response at 6-7. Accordingly, Plaintiff has demonstrated the immediacy of injury/harm that could arise from a modification of the 2007 Injunction to exclude Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s entries and Defendant-Intervenor has not met the required burden to receive a modification of the November 26 Preliminary Injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The 2007 Injunction and. the 2005 Injunction Are Different in Scope and Application and Are Not Duplicative</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s failure to raise the 2005 Injunction was largely immaterial because the 2005 Injunction and the 2007 Injunctions are not identical in their scope and coverage of entities, and are not overlapping, as Defendant-Intervenor asserts. Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s Motion to Modify at 3-5. The 2007 Injunction is broader in its application than the 2005 Injunction. Contrary to Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s arguments, Defendant has not been enjoined twice from liquidating the same entries. Under the statutory scheme, 19 U.S.C. \u00a71516(a)(c) (l)-(2), Defendant has been preliminarily enjoined from liquidating certain entries in accordance with the final determination of the LTFV investigation, and has separately been preliminarily enjoined fromdiquidating certain entries in accordance with the final results of the first administrative review. <em>See </em>Plaintiff\u2019s Response at 6. The 2007 Injunction enjoins from liquidation any unliquidated entries of certain frozen warmwater shrimp from Thailand that: (1) are covered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>by the <em>Final Results, </em>72 Fed. Reg. 52,065; (2) were entered or were withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after August 4, 2004 through and including January 31, 2006; and (3) were produced and or exported by Good Luck Product Co., Ltd., Thai I-Mei Frozen Foods Co., Ltd., (Defendant-Intervenor), Fortune Frozen Foods (Thailand) Co., Ltd., and Surapon Nichirei Foods Co., Ltd. 11/26/07 Order Granting Consent Motion for Preliminary Injunction at 1-2. The 2005 Injunction enjoins the liquidation of all entries that: (1) are covered by <em>Notice of Amended Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Antidumping Duty Order: Certain Frozen Warmwater Shrimp from Thailand, </em>70 Fed Reg. 5,145 (Feb. 1, 2005); (2) were produced or exported by Defendant-Intervenor; and 3) were entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after August 4, 2004. <em>Thai I-Mei Frozen Foods Co., Ltd. v. United States, </em>Ct No. 05-00197 Order Granting Plaintiff Thai I-Mei\u2019s Motion for Preliminary Injunction (December 15 2005) The 2005 Injunction is narrower in its scope and application than the 2007 Injunction. While there are some overlapping entries, they are not all the same. The 2007 Injunction applies to a number of producers/exporters, including Defendant-Intervenor, while the 2005 Injunction applies only to Defendant-Intervenor. In its Motion, Defendant-Intervenor argues that the same Thai I-Mei entries are already enjoined during the period of review covered by the administrative proceedings giving rise to the underlying action. Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s Motion to Modify at 2. Defendant-Intervenor relies on <em>Combined Ins. Co. of Am. v. Blackwell, </em>1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7483 at 2 (S.D. Ala. May 18, 1998), for its proposition that \u201ca court cannot enjoin an action that is already enjoined\u201d. Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s Motion to Modify at 2. This case is inapposite here both because the 2005 and the 2007 Injunctions are not identical and thus, are not duplicative, and because <em>Combined Ins. Co. of Am. </em>is not precedential.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">For these reasons, Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s Partial Consent Motion to Modify Preliminary Injunction is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b687-7\"> A party seeking injunctive relief bears the burden of establishing that: (1) absent the requested relief, it will suffer immediate irreparable harm; (2) there exists in its favor a likelihood of success on merits; (3) the public interest would be better served by the requested relief; and (4) the balance of the hardships on all parties tips in its favor. <em>Zenith Radio Corp. v. United States, </em>710 F.2d at 809; <em>Bomont Indus. v. United States, </em>10 CIT 431, 434, 638 F. Supp. 1334, 1337 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b689-10\"> While Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s Motion to Modify is analyzed below for \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d it is also, in effect, a Rule 60(b) Motion for Relief from Judgment or Order for Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly Discovered Evidence; Fraud, Etc. It does not rise to these standards, since as discussed below, the mistake alleged is at most <em>de minimis, </em>if it is an error at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b690-9\"> Plaintiff and Defendant have submitted comments on the Remand Results issued by the Department of Commerce in the case <em>Thai I -Mei Frozen Foods Co. Ltd v. United States, </em>CIT Court No. 05-00197. The court will either affirm the determination or will remand the decision back to the Department of Commerce. If the decision is remanded, the 2005 Injunction will remain in place. However, if the decision is affirmed, the 2005 Injunction will be lifted; Defendant-Intervenor\u2019s entries in that case will be liquidated, and Plaintiff will be irreparably harmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
