During the course of the review, Plaintiff Fag-ersta Stainless AB (\u201cFagersta\u201d) requested that Commerce modify its existing model-match methodology by adding an additional product criterion. Commerce rejected this request on the basis that Fagersta had not demonstrated that there were \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d to do so. Plaintiff challenges this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-18\">This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c). For the reasons set forth below, Commerce\u2019s determination is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">On September 15, 1998, Commerce published an antidumping duty order on stainless steel wire rod (\u201cSSWR\u201d) from Sweden. <em>Notice of Antidumping Duty Order: Stainless Steel Wire Rod from Sweden, </em>63 Fed. Reg. 49,329 (September 15, 1998). The model-match criteria applied by Commerce consisted of four product characteristics: (1) grade, (2) diameter, (3) further processing, and (4) coating. <em>See </em>Memorandum in Support of Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Motion\u201d) at 2; Defendant\u2019s Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s Rule 56.2 Motion for Judgment Upon the Agency Record (\u201cDefendant\u2019s Response\u201d) at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">On October 25, 2005, Commerce published a notice of initiation of the administrative review on SSWR from Sweden for the period September 1, 2004 through August 31, 2005. <em>Initiation of Antidump-ing and Countervailing Duty Administrative Reviews, </em>70 Fed. Reg. 61,601 (October 25, 2005). As part of the administrative review, Commerce sent an antidumping duty questionnaire to Fagersta in November 2005. Defendant\u2019s Response at 2. Fagersta responded and requested that Commerce revise its model-match criteria to include electro-slag refining (\u201cESR\u201d) as a fifth product characteristic. Fager-sta Section B Questionnaire Response, Confidential Record (\u201cC.R.\u201d) Doc. No. 3, at B-2. In its questionnaire response, Fagersta defined electro-slag refining as a \u201cseparate and significant processing stage . .. [that] imparts unique material qualities, primarily superior fatigue resistance, to the finished wire rod product.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">In October 2006, Commerce published the preliminary results of this review. <em>Stainless Steel Wire Rod from Sweden: Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, </em>71 Fed. Reg. 59,082 (October 6, 2006). Commerce determined that compelling reasons did not exist to modify the model-match criteria by adding electro-slag refining as a product characteristic. <em>Id. </em>at 59,085. In the preliminary phase of the administrative review, Commerce therefore applied the same model-match criteria to determine the \u201cforeign like product\u201d as in the initial \u201cless than fair value\u201d investigation. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 2; Defendant\u2019s Response at 3. Fagersta subsequently renewed its request that Commerce modify the model-match criteria to include ESR as a product characteristic. <em>See </em>Fagersta Stainless AB Case Brief, United States Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration, Case No. A-401-806 (November 27, 2006), C.R. Doc. 33, at 3. Commerce again declined to modify its model-match criteria. <em>See Issues and Decision Memorandum for the Final Results of the Administrative Review of Stainless Steel Wire Rod from Sweden {\u201cFinal Decision Memo\u201d) </em>(April 4, 2007), Public Record (\u201cP.R.\u201d) Doc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>102, at 9; <em>Stainless Steel Wire Rod from Sweden: Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, </em>72 Fed. Reg. 17,834, 17,835-37 (April 10, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">The court must uphold a determination by Commerce resulting from an administrative review of an antidumping duty order unless it is \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(i); <em>Carpenter Tech. Corp. v. United States, </em>510 F.3d 1370, 1372-73 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The substantial evidence test \u201crequires only that there be evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Cleo Inc. v. United States, </em>501 F.3d 1291, 1296 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (citing <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 477, 71 S. Ct. 456, 95 L. Ed. 456 (1951)). While the court must consider contradictory evidence, \u201cthe substantial evidence test does not require that there be an absence of evidence detracting from the agency\u2019s conclusion, nor is there an absence of substantial evidence simply because the reviewing court would have reached a different conclusion based on the same record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Universal Camera Corp., </em>340 U.S. at 487-88); <em>see also Am.-Silicon Techs. v. United States, </em>261 F.3d 1371, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <em>U.S. Steel Group v. United States, </em>96 F.3d 1352, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">To determine whether Commerce\u2019s interpretation and application of the antidumping statute at issue \u201cis in accordance with the law,\u201d the court must conduct the two-step analysis articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984). Under the first step of the <em>Chevron </em>analysis, the court must ascertain \u201cwhether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Wheatland Tube Co. v. United States, </em>495 F.3d 1355, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (citing <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">The court reaches the second step of the <em>Chevron </em>analysis only \u201cif the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under this second step, the court must evaluate whether Commerce\u2019s interpretation \u201cis based on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843. The agency\u2019s construction need not be the only reasonable interpretation or even the most reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>interpretation. <em>Zenith Radio Corp. v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 443, 450, 98 S. Ct. 2441, 57 L. Ed. 2d 337 (1978). The court must defer to Commerce\u2019s reasonable interpretation of a statute even if it might have preferred another. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">\n<em>Legal Framework</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">Goods imported into the United States will be subject to an anti-dumping duty if Commerce determines that foreign merchandise is being sold in the United States at \u201cless than its fair value.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673; <em>see also Ad Hoc Shrimp Trade Action Comm. v. United States, </em>15 F.3d 1372, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2008). The amount of the antidumping duty reflects the amount by which the home-market price of the foreign like product (the \u201cnormal value\u201d) exceeds the price charged in the United States (the \u201cexport price\u201d), 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(l)(A)-(B); this difference is referred to as the \u201cdumping margin,\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(35)(A). After an antidumping duty order is issued, the amount of the antidumping duty may be revised in subsequent administrative reviews. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a)(1)(B). In an administrative review, Commerce recalculates the normal value and export price to establish an updated dumping margin. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1675(a)(2)(A)(i)-(ii). In order to establish the dumping margin, whether in an initial investigation or in an administrative review, Commerce must first identify the \u201cforeign like product\u201d which will form the basis for comparison to merchandise exported to the United States. <em>See Pesquera Mares Australes Ltda. v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1372, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">Commerce Has Considerable Discretion in Constructing a Model-Match Methodology for Identifying the \u201cForeign Like Product\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">Because Congress has not precisely defined the methodology by which Commerce must identify the \u201cforeign like product,\u201d it has implicitly delegated that authority to Commerce. <em>New World Pasta Co. v. United States, </em>28 CIT 290, 305-06, 316 F.Supp.2d 1338, 1352 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>(2004) (citing <em>Pesquera Mares, </em>266 F.3d at 1384; <em>Koyo Seiko Co. v. United States, </em>66 F.3d 1204, 1209 (Fed. Cir. 1995)). Commerce has \u201cconsiderable discretion\u201d to construct a methodology for identifying the \u201cforeign like product\u201d in antidumping proceedings. <em>SKF USA, Inc. v. United States, </em>2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 18159, at *13 (Fed. Cir. 2008); <em>SKF USA Inc. v. United States, </em>263 F.3d 1369, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2001).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Commerce states that it does so by \u201cdevis[ing] a hierarchy of commercially significant characteristics suitable to each class or kind of merchandise.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Response at 10. This hierarchy of commercially significant characteristics is the \u201cmodel-match methodology.\u201d According to Commerce, it then utilizes these characteristics to \u201ccompare [ ] United States sales to sales in the comparison market.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">Pursuant to the statutory scheme, Commerce must \u201cfirst look for identical merchandise with which to match the United States model to the comparable home or third country market model.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Viraj Forgings, Ltd. v. United States, </em>27 CIT 1472, 1477, 283 F.Supp.2d 1335, 1340 (2003) (citing <em>Torrington, </em>25 CIT 395, 417, 146 F.Supp.2d 845, 874 (2001). The Federal Circuit has established, however, that merchandise need not be exactly the same in order to be considered \u201cidentical.\u201d <em>Pesquera Mares, </em>266 F.3d at 1384. In the final analysis, Commerce states that it \u201cconsiders merchandise to be identical within the meaning of section 1677(16)(A) when all the relevant characteristics match.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Steel Wire Rod from Trinidad &amp; Tobago, 63 Fed. Reg. 9,177, 9,180 (February 24, 1998)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>2</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">A Party Seeking to Modifying an Existing Model-Match Methodology Must Meet a \u201cCompelling Reasons\u201d Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Once Commerce has established a model-match methodology in an antidumping investigation, it will not modify that methodology in subsequent proceedings unless there are \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d to do so. <em>See Final Decision Memo, </em>P.R. Doc. No. 102, at 10 (citing <em>Ball Bearings and Parts Thereof From France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Singapore, and the United Kingdom: Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, </em>70 Fed. Reg. 54,711 (September 16, 2005), and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum at cmt. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">A party seeking to modify an existing model-match methodology has alternative means to demonstrate that \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d exist to do so. Commerce will find that \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d exist if a party proves by \u201ccompelling and convincing evidence\u201d that the existing model-match criteria \u201care not reflective of the merchandise in question,\u201d that there have been changes in the relevant industry, or that \u201cthere is some other compelling reason present which requires a change.\u201d <em>Notice of Final Results of the Twelfth Administrative Review of the Antidumping Duty Order on Certain Corrosion-Resistant Carbon Steel Flat Products from the Republic of Korea, </em>72 Fed. Reg. 13,086, and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum at cmt. 1(b) (March 20, 2007). Such other compelling reasons may include, for example, (1) \u201cgreater accuracy in comparing foreign like product to the single most similar U.S. model, in accordance with [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(16)(B)];\u201d (2) \u201ca greater number of reasonable price-to-price comparisons in accordance with [19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b];\u201d or (3) the existence of a \u201cspecific standard . . . that is not captured in the model-matching criteria but which is industry-wide, commercially accepted and recognizes material physical characteristics of various types for the particular product at issue.\u201d <em>Final Decision Memo, </em>RR. Doc. No. 102, at 10, 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">Commerce\u2019s stated position that it will not modify an existing model-match methodology absent \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d has been recognized as a reasonable means of interpreting the statute. <em>See, e.g., SKF USA Inc. v. United States, </em>491 F.Supp.2d 1354, 1363 (CIT 2007) (\u201cCommerce does indeed express its preference for maintaining a stable methodology across reviews unless compelling reasons exist.\u201d), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 18159; <em>Mittal Steel USA, Inc. v. United States, </em>Slip Op. 07-117, 2007 Ct. Int\u2019l Trade LEXIS 138, at *8-*9 (August 1, 2007) (\u201cFor Commerce, the need for consistency in the model match criteria stems from its duty to calculate antidumping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>rates as accurately as possible.\u201d) (citing <em>Lasko Metal Prods., Inc. v. United States, </em>43 F.3d 1442, 1446 (Fed. Cir. 1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\">Fagersta does not contest the lawfulness of the \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d standard. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 11. Nor does Fagersta dispute that Commerce may define products as \u201cidentical\u201d even if those products are not exactly the same. <em>Id. </em>at 10. Instead, Fagersta argues that it sufficiently demonstrated to Commerce that ESR and non-ESR SSWR are not \u201cidentical,\u201d <em>id., </em>and thus that the existing \u201cmodel match is not reflective of the merchandise in question,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 29. In addition, Fagersta contends that it sufficiently demonstrated that there are other \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d for Commerce to modify the existing model-match methodology. <em>Id. </em>at 11. Fagersta has not sufficiently demonstrated either of these positions. Accordingly, Commerce\u2019s designation of ESR SSWR and non-ESR SSWR as identical is both in accordance with law and supported by substantial evidence. Likewise, Commerce\u2019s determination that Fagersta did not otherwise provide \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d to add ESR as a product characteristic to the existing model-match methodology is in accordance with law and supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">\n<em>Commerce\u2019s Designation of ESR SSWR and Non-ESR SSWR as \u201cIdentical\u201d Products is Based on a Reasonable Interpretation of the Relevant Statute and Supported by Substantial Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">Fagersta frames the issue in this case as \u201cwhether ESR SSWR is so similar to non-ESR SSWR to . . . justify Commerce treating them as <em>identical.\u201d </em>Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 10. To that end, Fagersta raises the question \u201cwhether the products are \u2018the same with minor differences.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based on Commerce\u2019s interpretation of the word \u201cidentical,\u201d as discussed in Sub-section (A)(1) above, the court must determine whether Fagersta has demonstrated that any differences between ESR SSWR and non-ESR SSWR are \u201ccommercially significant.\u201d <em>See Pesquera Mares, </em>266 F.3d at 1384. The court will also evaluate Fagersta\u2019s contention that, in determining the structure of the model match, Commerce has \u201csimply brushed aside\u201d the price and cost differences between ESR SSWR and .non-ESR SSWR that it placed on the record below. <em>See </em>Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">Fagersta Has Not Demonstrated That Any Differences That Exist Between ESR SSWR and Non-ESR SSWR are \u201cCommercially Significant\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">According to Fagersta, electro-slag refining is \u201ca complex production process that reduces the number and segregation of non-metallic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>inclusions, thereby resulting in a \u2018cleaner\u2019 steel with superior fatigue resistance and other important product characteristics.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 3. Fagersta placed on the record below various technical reports and other evidence demonstrating what it asserts are the physical differences, primarily \u201csuperior fatigue resistance,\u201d between ESR SSWR and non-ESR SSWR. <em>See, e.g., </em>Fagersta Section B Questionnaire Response, G.R. Doc. No. 3, at Exhibit B-l (product specification sheets); Fagersta Supplemental Sections A-C Response, C.R. Doc. No. 14, at Exhibits S-6 to S-8, S-10 to S-12 (technical literature and test data).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This \u201csuperior fatigue resistance,\u201d asserts Fagersta, is a result of the \u201csignificant reduction in non-metallic inclusion content in ESR treated . . . products.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 15. Further, Fagersta represents that additional product characteristics, such as maximum levels of various chemical compounds, are requested by the customer to whom it sells the ESR SSWR. <em>Id. </em>Fagersta claims that, to the best of its knowledge, this specific product (i.e., SSWR with maximum levels of various chemical compounds as well as a maximum number of inclusions) cannot be produced without using the ESR process. <em>Id. </em>Fagersta argues that \u201cCommerce simply dismissed\u201d these physical differences. <em>Id. </em>at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">In response, Commerce explains that it constructs its model-match methodology by \u201cdevis [ing] a hierarchy of <em>commercially significant </em>characteristics.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Response at 10 (emphasis added). Commerce then asserts that it \u201cdid not contest that ESR-treated SSWR has different properties than some other SSWR products,\u201d but rather that \u201cFagersta did not establish that these properties were unique to ESR-treated merchandise.\u201d Defendant\u2019s Response at 12. In its <em>Final Decision Memo, </em>Commerce stated that \u201cmany factors and/or different production steps could affect the final SSWR product with respect to both its internal characteristics (e.g., impurities or inclusion, dimensional tolerances) and its external characteristics (e.g., surface imperfections).\u201d <em>Final Decision Memo, </em>RR. Doc. No. 102, at 14.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Based on this statement, Defendant-Intervenors argue that Commerce \u201cestablished that the ESR product was not significantly different than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>the non-ESR product . . . Defendant-Intervenors\u2019 Response Brief (\u201cDefendant-Intervenors\u2019 Response\u201d) at 14.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">Commerce has interpreted the word \u201cidentical\u201d to mean the same with \u201cminor differences in physical characteristics, if those minor differences are not commercially significant,\u201d and this interpretation has been upheld as a \u201cpermissible construction of the statute.\u201d <em>Pesquera Mares, </em>266 F.3d at 1384 (quoting <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843). Commerce has not explained what it considers a \u201ccommercially significant\u201d difference in physical characteristics, and appears to conduct a case-by-case assessment each time it determines whether products are identical. <em>See, e.g., New World Pasta Co., </em>28 CIT at 309 n.20; <em>Pesquera Mares Australes Ltda. v. United States, </em>24 CIT 443, 447 n.l (2000), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>266 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Indeed, the Federal Circuit has established that Commerce\u2019s commercial significance determination is subject to review under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard, <em>Pesquera Mares, </em>266 F.3d at 1384. In <em>Pesquera Mares, </em>the court affirmed Commerce\u2019s decision to treat \u201cpremium\u201d and \u201csuper-premium\u201d salmon as identical, partly because that distinction was only reflected in the grading standards of the Chilean salmon industry and not in any of the other of the \u201cworld\u2019s largest salmon farming countries.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">In this case, Fagersta has not demonstrated that the differences between ESR SSWR and non-ESR SSWR are commercially significant. In its response to Commerce\u2019s questionnaire, Fagersta stated that it produces and sells SSWR according to its own internal grading system which, according to Fagersta, is more specific than the grading system established by either the American Iron and Steel Institute (\u201cAISI\u201d) or the American Welding Society (\u201cAWS\u201d). Fagersta Section C Questionnaire Response, C.R. Doc. No. 4, at C-4. Fagersta also stated that its internal grades \u201coccasionally do not have a comparable AISI or AWS counterpart.\u201d Fagersta Section A Questionnaire Response, C.R. Doc No. 1, at A-39. Fagersta has not disputed that both categories of SSWR produced by Fagersta fit within the same commercial grade established by the AISI, <em>Final Decision Memo, </em>P.R. Doc. No. 102, at 11, without regard to their respective levels of inclusions or fatigue resistance or any other characteristic. What <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>Fagersta has asserted is that \u201cAISI and other grade designation schemes do not fully capture certain physical distinctions.\u201d Fagersta Section B Questionnaire Response, C.R. Doc. No. 3, at B-2. Fagersta has placed no evidence on the record which demonstrates that any relevant industry grading standards reflect a distinction based on the use of ESR technology in the production of SSWR. Thus, because Commerce can reasonably rely on industry grading standards to assess commercial significance, <em>see Pesquera Mares, </em>266 F.3d at 1384-85, Commerce\u2019s decision not to modify the existing model-match methodology to incorporate ESR as an additional product characteristic is both in accordance with law and supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">Commerce is Not Required to Adjust for Differences in Price and Cost Between Products When Those Products Are Identical</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">According to Fagersta, \u201cESR-treated merchandise is significantly more costly to make, and carries a significant price premium in the market, compared to non-ESR-treated merchandise.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 18. In support of this assertion, Fagersta sets out the difference between the weighted-average price of ESR SSWR and the average price of non-ESR SSWR, and the total cost of manufacture, across the three control numbers to which those products were assigned. <em>Id. </em>Fagersta contends that Commerce \u201cshould have placed great weight on the differences in price and cost\u201d between these products. <em>Id. </em>at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">First, Fagersta asserts that \u201cCommerce routinely considers prices and costs in the structure of the model match,\u201d and cites to two recent decisions issued by Commerce in support of that proposition. <em>See id. </em>at 36 (citing <em>Metal Calendar Slides from Japan: Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Final Negative Determination of Critical Circumstances, </em>71 Fed. Reg. 36,063, and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum at cmt. 1 (June 23, 2006), and <em>Certain Corrosion Resistant Carbon Steel Flat Products from Canada, Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, </em>70 Fed. Reg. 13,458, and accompanying Issues and Decision Memorandum at cmt. 1 (March 21, 2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">Those decisions do not support that proposition. Commerce states that it did not switch the hierarchical order of two model-matching criteria in <em>Metal Calendar Slides from Japan, </em>71 Fed. Reg. 36,063, because the petitioner \u201cdid not demonstrate that the differences in functionality, production, or pricing, and marketing were sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>overturn the established methodology.\u201d <em>Final Decision Memo, </em>P.R. Doc. No. 102, at 16. Similarly, Commerce states that it decided not to include a certain characteristic in the model-match criteria in <em>Carbon Steel Flat Products from Canada, </em>70 Fed. Reg. 13,458, in part because there were no significant price differences associated with it, and in part because the respondent had not demonstrated other compelling reasons - such as new technological developments and/or an industry-wide, commercially accepted standard. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\">Second, Fagersta criticizes Commerce for not \u201caddress [ing] the significance of the difference in production costs between ESR SSWR and non-ESR SSWR, particularly in light of Commerce\u2019s DIFMER test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34. Fagersta summarizes the test as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-5\">(1) comparison between non-identical, or \u201csimilar,\u201d products with differences in variable production costs representing more than twenty percent of total manufacturing costs are forbidden, even with an adjustment to normal value to account for the difference; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-6\">(2) when comparing non-identical, or \u201csimilar,\u201d merchandise an adjustment to normal value is made to account for the differences in variable production costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">That summary is not accurate. Commerce is required to make adjustments to reflect the difference in price between home market sales and sales in the United States when that difference in price arises because the foreign like product is not \u201cidentical\u201d to the domestic product to which it is being compared. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(6)(C)(ii). In such a case, Commerce must make an adjustment to normal value for the \u201cdifference in cost attributable to the difference in physical characteristics.\u201d <em>Viraj Forgings, </em>27 CIT at 1478-79 (quoting <em>Mitsubishi Heavy Indus. v. United States, </em>23 CIT 326, 340, 54 F.Supp.2d 1183, 1196 (1999)). This adjustment is commonly referred to as the difference in merchandise (\u201cDIFMER\u201d) adjustment. <em>See </em>U.S. Import Administration, Policy Bulletin 92.2, Differences in Merchandise; 20% Rule (1992) (\u201cDIFMER Policy Bulletin\u201d); <em>see also Mitsubishi Heavy Indus. v. United States, </em>275 F.3d 1056, 1059 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2001). A DIFMER calculation exceeding twenty (20) percent does not result in an absolute prohibition of on comparing the products at issue, as Fagersta asserts; rather, it creates a \u201cpresumption of noncomparability.\u201d <em>Mitsubishi Heavy Indus., </em>275 F.3d at 1059 n.2; <em>see </em>DIFMER Policy Bulletin at 2. Any comparison of products with a DIFMER exceeding twenty (20) percent \u201cshall be noted and fully explained.\u201d DIFMER Policy Bulletin at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>Commerce urges the court not to consider Fagersta\u2019s DIFMER argument on the basis that Fagersta did not raise this argument in the administrative proceeding below and thus, according to Commerce, failed to exhaust its administrative remedies.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s Response at 19. The Federal Circuit has affirmed that \u201cthe application of\u2018exhaustion principles in trade cases is subject to the discretion of the judge of the Court of International Trade,\u201d\u2019 <em>Agro Dutch Indus. Ltd. v. United States, </em>508 F.3d 1024, 1029 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (citing <em>Corns Staal BV v. United States, </em>502 F.3d 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2007)). However, it is not necessary to address Commerce\u2019s objection in detail because, as discussed above, Commerce is not required to take cost differences into account when the products being compared are identical, <em>see </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(6)(C)(ii), and thus Fagersta\u2019s arguments with respect to DIFMER fail as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">\n<em>Commerce\u2019s Determination that Fagersta Did Not Establish Other \u201cCompelling Reasons\u201d to Modify the Model Match</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">\n<em>Criteria is Both In Accordance With Law and Supported by Substantial Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">Fagersta contends that it has demonstrated other \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d for Commerce to modify its existing model-match methodology. Specifically, Fagersta claims that it has demonstrated that adding electro-slag refining to the model-match criteria would result in (1) greater accuracy in comparing the foreign like product to the single most similar U.S. model, <em>id. </em>at 12; and (2) a greater number of reasonable price-to-price comparisons,\u201d <em>id.; </em>and would also (3) reflect a new technological development with respect to SSWR, <em>id. </em>at 29. Fagersta, however, has neither made any of these showings nor demonstrated any other compelling reason for Commerce to modify its existing model-match methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b920-9\">Fagersta Has Not Demonstrated That Adding Electro-Slag</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">Refining to the Model-Match Methodology Will Result in Greater Accuracy in Comparing the Foreign Like Product to the Single Most Similar U.S. Model</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">Fagersta asserts that adding electro-slag refining to the existing model-match methodology would result in greater accuracy in comparing the foreign like product to the single most similar U.S. model. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 12; Plaintiff\u2019s Reply Brief (\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Reply\u201d) at 13. According to Fagersta, while both ESR SSWR and non-ESR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>SSWR are sold in the home market, only non-ESR SSWR is sold in the United States. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 12. Because the current model-match methodology does not distinguish between the two products, the comparison price for U.S. sales of non-ESR SSWR is calculated based on the weighted average prices of home market sales of both ESR SSWR and non-ESR SSWR. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\">Commerce notes that its current model-match methodology compares home market sales of SSWR to U.S. sales of SSWR that fall within the same AISI grade, and that both ESR and non-ESR SSWR are captured in that grading category. <em>Final Decision Memo, </em>P.R. Doc. No. 102, at 11. On this basis, Commerce determined that by adding ESR to the model-matching criteria, \u201cthe home market price and production costs of the SSWR grade at issue . . . are artificially lowered when compared to sales of the same grade in the U.S. market.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, Commerce reasons, \u201cincluding ESR as a model-matching criterion will not result in greater accuracy with respect to product comparisons involving the SSWR grade at issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Commerce further reasons that because the use of ESR \u201cis limited to the production of one AlSI-equivalent grade in this review, inclusion of ESR as a model-matching characteristic will not result in greater accuracy with respect to comparing the remaining foreign like product.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Fagersta argues that Commerce\u2019s methodology results in a \u201csignificant inaccuracy\u201d and that its proposed modification would \u201ccorrect this significant inaccuracy by matching U.S. sales of the non-ESR product ... to the weighted average prices of home market sales of only the truly identical non-ESR product... because the ESR product would no longer be treated as identical.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 12. In support of this proposition, Fagersta states that \u201c[i]t cannot be disputed that matching sales of the truly identical product is more accurate than matching the U.S. sales price to a home market basket of the truly identical product and a vastly dissimilar and superior product that costs roughly double to produce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, Fagersta argues, \u201cCommerce failed to explain . . . what could possibly be \u2018artificial\u2019 about a comparison market price consisting of only sales of <em>a truly identical product.\u201d </em>While Commerce correctly pointed out that products need not be truly identical in order to be considered identical within the meaning of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(16)(A), Defendant\u2019s Response at 10 (citing <em>Pesquera Mares, </em>266 F.3d at 1383-84), Fagersta responds that \u201ca \u2018compelling reason\u2019 must necessarily include a modification that is required to conform the model match to the governing law,\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Reply at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">The governing law - in this case, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(16)(A) and the Federal Circuit\u2019s clarification of the appropriate interpretation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>terms contained therein - does not compel the outcome sought by Fagersta. The Federal Circuit recognized that interpreting the term \u201cidentical\u201d in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(16)(A) to require exact identity \u201cwould frustrate the purpose of the [antidumping] statute.\u201d <em>Pesquera Mares, </em>266 F.3d at 1383. The court also observed that \u201cCongress could hardly have intended to require Commerce in each and every instance to compare <em>all </em>the physical characteristics of the goods.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Thus, Fagersta\u2019s argument that \u201cmatching sales of the truly identical product is more accurate\u201d is unavailing. Because Commerce is not required to match only products that are truly identical, Fag-ersta would have to prove that the differences between ESR SSWR and non-ESR SSWR are commercially significant and, thus, that Commerce\u2019s characterization of those products as identical does not conform to the governing law. As discussed in detail in Section IV(B)(1) above, Fagersta has not made such a showing and Commerce\u2019s designation of ESR SSWR and non-ESR SSWR as identical is both in accordance with law and supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Fagersta Has Not Demonstrated That Adding Electro-Slag Refining to the Model Match Methodology Will Result in More Reasonable Price-to-Price Comparisons</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">Fagersta asserts that adding electro-slag refining to the existing model-match methodology will result in more reasonable price-to-price comparisons. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 16-17; Plaintiff\u2019s Reply at 13-14. Specifically, Fagersta submits that its sales of AISI Grade 20 ESR SSWR in its home market constitutes [\u00b6] a certain ]] percent of its total reported market home sales, while its sales of AISI Grade 20 non-ESR SSWR constitutes [\u00b6] a different ]] percent of its home market sales, and that its sales of non-ESR SSWR in the United States accounts for [\u00b6] a certain ]] percent of its total U.S. sales. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 16-17. Thus, Fagersta argues, \u201cthe comparison market of fully [\u00b6] a certain ]] percent of [its] home market sales has been inaccurately calculated\u201d because Commerce treated ESR SSWR as identical to non-ESR SSWR. <em>Id. </em>at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">Fagersta\u2019s argument is unavailing, as it assumes that is unreasonable for Commerce to treat ESR SSWR and non-ESR SSWR as \u201cidentical.\u201d As discussed in Section IV(B)(1) above, there is nothing unreasonable about Commerce\u2019s decision to treat as identical two products that are assigned the same commercial grade according to the AISI grading system, particularly in light of the fact that Fagersta has not put forth any evidence that the distinction between ESR SSWR and non-ESR SSWR is reflected in any relevant commercial grading system. If Commerce\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cidentical\u201d to include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>products that have minor differences that are not commercially significant is reasonable, then it follows that conducting price comparisons between those products is also reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Fagersta Has Not Demonstrated That ESR is a New Technological Development in the SSWR Industry</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Fagersta states that it placed \u201cundisputed evidence on the record stating that the ESR process was not used to produce SSWR until after the investigation.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Motion at 28. In addition, Fager-sta argues that \u201cit is not necessary to show that ESR is a new technological development,\u201d as \u201cthis is merely one of the factors that Commerce considers in determining whether to alter its model match criteria.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29 (citing <em>SKF USA, Inc., </em>491 F.Supp.2d at 1358 n.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">Fagersta is not required to prove that ESR is a new technological development in the SSWR industry in order to meet the \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d standard because, as discussed in Section IV(A)(2) above, a party seeking to demonstrate that there are \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d for Commerce to modify an existing model-match methodology has several alternative means to do so. However, because Fagersta has not demonstrated any other compelling reason, it would have to demonstrate that ESR is a new technological development in the SSWR industry in order to prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">Commerce acknowledged that ESR was not used during the production of SSWR until after the initial antidumping investigation. Defendant\u2019s Response at 15. Nevertheless, Commerce determined that this was insufficient to establish that ESR is a new technological advancement to the SSWR industry, <em>id., </em>and this determination was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">For the reasons stated above, Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED and Commerce\u2019s determination in <em>Stainless Steel Wire Rod from Sweden: Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, </em>72 Fed.
