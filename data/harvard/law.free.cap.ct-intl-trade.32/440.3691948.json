Reg. 7,513 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Feb. 13, 2006) (eleventh admin, review), <em>as amended by </em>Certain CORE from the Republic of Korea, 71 Fed. Reg. 13,692 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Mar. 20, 2006) (amended final results) (collectively, the \u201cFinal Results\u201d). Jurisdiction lies pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(c) (2000), and 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(2)(B)(iii). For the reasons set forth below, Commerce\u2019s Final Results are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">Plaintiff is a domestic producer of CORE. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Mot. J. Agency R. (\u201cPl.\u2019s Br.\u201d) 4. On August 19, 1993, following its investigation, Commerce published the antidumping duty order <em>See </em>Certain CORE From Korea, 58 Fed. Reg. 44,159 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Aug. 19, 1993) (the \u201cCORE Order\u201d). On August 3, 2004, after having conducted ten prior administrative reviews of the CORE Order, Commerce published notice that it would consider requests for the eleventh review. <em>See </em>Opportunity to Request Admin. Review, 69 Fed. Reg. 46,496 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Aug. 3, 2004) (notice). Thereafter, on August 31, 2004, plaintiff asked Commerce to conduct a review of the behavior and market activities of certain Korean respondents including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Pohang Iron &amp; Steel Co., Ltd. (\u201cPOSCO\u201d), Dongbu Steel Co., Ltd. (\u201cDongbu\u201d), Hyundai HYSCO Co., Ltd. (\u201cHYSCO\u201d), and Union Steel Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (\u201cUnion\u201d). The eleventh administrative review, was initiated on September 22, 2004. <em>See </em>Initiation of Anti-dumping and Countervailing Duty Admin. Reviews and Request for Revocation in Part, 69 Fed. Reg. 56,745 (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Sept. 22, 2004) (notice).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\">On February 13, 2006, Commerce published its Final Results. <em>See </em>Final Results, 71 Fed. Reg. at 7,513. Based on its analysis, the Department assigned imports from POSCO a 2.16 percent dumping margin; those from Union a <em>de minimis </em>margin;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and those from Dongbu a 2.26 percent dumping margin. <em>See id. </em>at 7,514. Defendant-intervenor HYSCO received a margin of zero. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">When reviewing a final antidumping determination, the court \u201cshall hold unlawful any determination, finding, or conclusion found...to be unsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(l)(B)(i). \u201cSubstantial evidence is \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Huaiyin Foreign Trade Corp. (30) v. United States, </em>322 F.3d 1369, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (quoting <em>Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938)). The existence of substantial evidence is determined \u201cby considering the record as a whole, including evidence that supports as well as evidence that \u2018fairly detracts from the substantiality of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Atl. Sugar, Ltd. v. United States, </em>744 F.2d 1556, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">In addition, \u201c[a]s long as the agency\u2019s methodology and procedures are reasonable means of effectuating the statutory purpose, and there is substantial evidence in the record supporting the agency\u2019s conclusions, the court will not impose its own views as to the sufficiency of the agency\u2019s investigation or question the agency\u2019s methodology.\u201d <em>Ceramica Regiomontana, S.A. v. United States, </em>10 CIT 399, 404-05, 636 F. Supp. 961, 966 (1986), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>810 F.2d 1137, 1139 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s motion presents four issues<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in challenging Commerce\u2019s Final Results. The court is mindful that similar issues were considered in <em>Mittal Steel USA, Inc. (formerly International Steel Group, Inc.) v. United States, </em>31 CIT _, Slip Op. 07-117 (Aug. 1, 2007) (\u201cMittal\u201d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (not reported in the Federal Supplement), by which the final results of Commerce\u2019s tenth administrative review were sustained. The issues raised by plaintiff\u2019s motion are resolved as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">I. Model Match</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Plaintiff\u2019s first claim is that Commerce abused its discretion by failing to request the more detailed product information from Dongbu, HYSCO, POSCO, and Union (collectively, \u201cdefendant-intervenors\u201d), that plaintiff believed was necessary for use in Commerce\u2019s model match comparisons. As a result, plaintiff insists that Commerce\u2019s model match results were not supported by substantial evidence, because incomplete information \u201clikely yielded inaccurate results.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Br. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">Model match criteria are used by Commerce to ensure that the merchandise sold in the United States market is being compared \u201cwith a suitable home-market product\u201d for purposes of calculating antidumping duties. <em>Koyo Seiko Co. v. United States, </em>66 F.3d 1204, 1209 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <em>see also </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(16)(C)(iii). In this eleventh review, Commerce used a CORE-speeific questionnaire to gather information to identify \u201cidentical\u201d merchandise for use in its model match methodology. <em>See, e.g., </em>Letter Dated Nov. 1, 2004 from Commerce to POSCO, and accompanying Request for Information, CORE from Korea (the \u201cQuestionnaire\u201d), Public Doc. (\u201cPD\u201d) No. 19. The Questionnaire employed twelve criteria including \u201cwidth,\u201d \u201cthick<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>ness,\u201d \u201ctype/\u2019 and \u201cquality.\u201d See Questionnaire, PD No. 19 at 3-5. For certain categories of data sought, the Questionnaire asked for information based on ranges of characteristics rather than precise measurements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Questionnaire, PD No. 19 at 3-5. \u201cThus, to identify goods for price comparisons, Commerce would treat as factually \u2018identical\u2019 all CORE within a given range...[such that] articles with different actual dimensions could still be treated as \u2018identical\u2019....\u201d Pl.\u2019s Br. 5. Commerce\u2019s questions relating to \u201ctype\u201d and \u201cquality\u201d also used groupings of characteristics rather than requiring exact product matches.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Questionnaire, PD No. 19 at 3-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Before Commerce in the.tenth administrative review and before this court in <em>Mittal, </em>plaintiff made similar arguments by presenting to Commerce a submission employing certain of defendant-intervenors\u2019 own price lists. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Br. 7. According to plaintiff, this submission demonstrated that Commerce\u2019s model match methodology yielded aberrant results and that this \u201cshould have prompted the agency to <em>at least request </em>more precise data\u201d such that Commerce and plaintiff \u201ccould have pursued the matching issues in greater depth <em>via </em>computer analysis.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Br. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">In the tenth administrative review, as it has here, Commerce rejected plaintiff\u2019s submission and its request to seek more precise information primarily because the price lists submitted by plaintiff did not reflect actual transaction prices. Further, \u201cseveral of the price lists cited...are exclusive to the Korean respondents\u2019 home market and, thus, offer no information on how the products are sold in the U.S. market.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Br. 8 (quoting Memorandum from Eric. B. Grey-nolds to Melissa Skinner Regarding Petitioners\u2019 Proposal to Change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>the Model Match Methodology (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Aug. 27, 2004 (the \u201cTenth Review Model Match Memo\u201d), Confidential R. Doc. (\u201cCR\u201d) No. 1 at 5-6).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">In this eleventh review, Commerce \u201creaffirmed\u201d its reasoning from the tenth administrative review and again declined to seek all of the information requested by plaintiffs. <em>See </em>Issues and Decisions for the Final Results of the Eleventh Administrative Review of the Anti-dumping Duty Order on Certain CORE from Korea (2003 - 2004) (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Feb. 6, 2006) (the \u201cI&amp;D Memo\u201d), PD No. 226 at Comment 1. Before doing so, however, the Department issued supplemental questionnaires to defendant-intervenors responsive to certain of plaintiff\u2019s requests. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Resp. Mot. J. Agency R. (\u201cDef.\u2019s Br.\u201d) 3. By these supplemental questionnaires, Commerce sought additional information regarding \u201cthe physical characteristics of the goods sold in Korea and in the United States and associated cost of production information.\u201d Def.\u2019s Br. 3 (citations omitted). Commerce did not, however, \u201crequest actual measurement data for each model sold because such a request \u2018would have been extremely burdensome for [defendant-intervenors].\u201d\u2019 <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Br. 3 (citations omitted). Thus, although Commerce did obtain more detailed information, particularly with respect to type, quality, and cost of production, it did not request all of the data asked for by plaintiff. <em>See, e.g., </em>Dongbu Suppl. Questionnaire Sections A-D (Dep\u2019t of Commerce May 17, 2005), PD No. 117 (requesting information concerning corporate structure, financial statements, distribution process, type, and quality). In addition, unlike in the tenth review, Dongbu, POSCO, and HYSCO voluntarily submitted additional data reflecting exact widths and thicknesses of the products covered by sales they reported to Commerce. <em>See </em>I&amp;D Memo, PD No. 226 at 4-5; <em>see also </em>Pl.\u2019s Br. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Notwithstanding this more detailed information, plaintiff continues to insist that it needs more data so that it can \u201cdemonstrate the likely inaccuracy of Commerce\u2019s methodology so far as quality and type were concerned.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Br. 11 (\u201cSince no respondent voluntarily submitted more precise \u2018Type\u2019 or \u2018Quality\u2019 information, Mittal was unable to test for those factors.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Having reviewed the record, the court finds that Commerce made a reasonable decision not to seek all of the information sought by plaintiff. Here, plaintiff\u2019s submission, which purports to demonstrate that Commerce\u2019s results were aberrant, relies on the identical price lists it presented in the tenth review. Unsurprisingly, Commerce again concluded that \u201cthe price lists submitted by [plaintiff] contained no evidence indicating that the price lists reflect actual transaction prices, and, thus,...do not necessarily reflect the Korean [defendant-intervenors\u2019] actual sales and pricing practices.\u201d I&amp;D <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Memo, PD No. 226 at 6. Commerce further observed that \u201cseveral of the price lists cited by [plaintiff] were exclusive to the [Korean defendant-intervenors\u2019] home market and offered no information concerning how the products are sold in the United States.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Def.\u2019s Resp. 11. Thus, for Commerce, this evidence is less reliable and less accurate than the actual sales data it obtained. <em>See generally </em>I&amp;D Memo, PD No. 226 at Comment 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">With respect to this evidence, the <em>Mittal </em>Court found that Commerce was justified in relying upon the actual Unites States sales data it obtained, rather than price lists for merchandise sold in the Korean home market. <em>See Mittal, </em>31 CIT at _, Slip Op. 07-117 at 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">As to plaintiff\u2019s argument that Commerce has not supported its conclusions with substantial evidence because it did not request the additional information plaintiff asked for, Commerce, in fact, had in its possession all of the information needed to make a fair and reasonable product comparison. That is, Commerce had sufficient information \u2014 submitted in response to its initial Questionnaire, the follow-up questionnaires, and voluntarily submitted by defendant-intervenors \u2014 about product details such as type, reduction and coating processes, clad material, quality, yield strength, metallic coating weight, width, thickness, form, temper rolling, and leveling. <em>See </em>Questionnaire, PD No. 19 at 3-5. \u201cCommerce enjoys broad discretion in conducting... reviews under the antidumping statute, particularly in...[making] decisions regarding relevant evidence.\u201d See <em>E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>22 CIT 19, 32, Slip Op. 98-7 (Jan. 29, 1998) (not reported in the Federal Supplement); <em>U.S. Steel Group v. United States, </em>96 F.3d 1352, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (\u201cIt is the [Department\u2019s] task to evaluate the evidence it collects during its investigation.\u201d); <em>but see Ceramica Regiomontana, S.A., </em>10 CIT at 405, 636 F. Supp. at 966 (\u201cOf course, this Court will not allow an agency, under the guise of lawful discretion, to contravene or ignore the intent of the legislature or the guiding purpose of the statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Plaintiff, seemingly aware that it cannot demonstrate a compelling need for Commerce to change its model match methodology, relies on the argument that, if Commerce obtained more information, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>perhaps it could demonstrate a compelling need. This, however, is mere speculation. While it may be that more information might be useful, plaintiff\u2019s submission did not demonstrate that it is necessary. <em>See </em>I&amp;D Memo, PD No. 226 at Comment 1. Commerce \u201ccannot possibly account for every difference between products....\u201d <em>See </em>Tenth Review Model Match Memo, CR No. 1 at 6. Therefore, Commerce\u2019s decision not to request additional information was a \u201creasonable means of effectuating the [antidumping law\u2019s] statutory purpose....\u201d <em>Cer\u00e1mica Regiomontana, S.A., </em>10 CIT at 404-05, 636 F. Supp. at 966. Accordingly, Commerce\u2019s model match results are sustained as supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">II. Constructed Export Price: Deduction of Selling Expenses</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">As it did in the tenth administrative review, plaintiff argues that Commerce, in calculating constructed export price (\u201cCEP\u201d), acted unlawfully and rendered a determination unsupported by substantial evidence by not deducting certain expenses incurred by the Korean exporter parent companies.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Br. 22-23, 30-36. According to plaintiff, when the Korean parent companies perform \u201ccore selling functions<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in connection with their U.S. affiliates\u2019 resales,\u201d Commerce must deduct these expenses when calculating CEP.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Pl.\u2019s Br. 22-23. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Plaintiff maintains that \u201c[a]ny other conclusion undermines the concept of \u2018CEP\u2019 as contemplated by the statute and construed by the Federal Circuit.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Br. 22-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s motion notes that, while the facts it relies on are company-specific, a \u201ccommon theme exists\u201d for all of the defen-dantintervenors.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Pl.\u2019s Br. 12. Accordingly, plaintiff alleges the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">A. Union</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Defendant-intervenor Union sold CORE to its American affiliate, which in turn resold the CORE to unrelated United States purchasers in reportable CEP transactions. Pl.\u2019s Br. 12 (citing Union Sections A-C Questionnaire Resp. (\u201cUnion Quest. Resp.\u201d), PD No. 59 \u00e1t 15, 17). Plaintiff alleges that record evidence demonstrates that Union performed numerous selling functions in the resales, including having final authority to accept or reject orders and shipping the goods directly to purchasers, as well as \u201cprocess [ing] claims for defective merchandise sold in the U.S. market.\u201d <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Br. 13 (citing Union Quest. Resp., PD No. 59 at 7, 15). Plaintiff argues that Commerce, despite inquiring in two supplemental questionnaires about these activities, was wrong in concluding that the record evidence did not demonstrate that these selling expenses should have been deducted in CEP calculations. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Br. 13-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>B. POSCO</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Defendant-intervenor POSCO had two Korean affiliates that sold CORE to its United States affiliate, which then resold the goods to unrelated United States buyers in CEP reportable transactions. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Br. 14 (citing POSCO Sections A-D Questionnaire Resp. (\u201cPOSCO Quest. Resp.\u201d), PD No. 68 at 7-11). Plaintiff alleges that one of POSCO\u2019s Korean affiliates negotiated sales terms and that its United States affiliate simply assisted in these negotiations and communications. Pl.\u2019s Br. 14. Furthermore, according to plaintiff, the Korean affiliates performed market research, computer/legal/ accounting work, engineering services, and advertising. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Br. 14-15 (citing POSCO Quest. Resp., PD No. 68 at 25-28). Plaintiff further alleges that some of these activities <em>had </em>to relate to United States resales, not simply sales to POSCO\u2019s United States affiliate. Thus, it again argues that Commerce should have concluded that there was substantial evidence on the record demonstrating that these selling expenses should have been deducted in CEP calculations. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Br. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">C. Dongbu</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Defendant-intervenor Dongbu sold CORE to its United States affiliate which then resold the CORE to United States purchasers in CEP reportable transactions. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Br. 15 (citing Dongbu Section A Questionnaire Resp. (\u201cDongbu Quest. Resp.\u201d), PD No. 57 at A-13, A-18). According to plaintiff, Dongbu\u2019s United States affiliate played a self-described \u201cliaison\u201d role. Plaintiff insists that Commerce did not ask for sufficient information for Commerce to understand the true role of the United States aaffiliate. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Br. 15-16. Thus, plaintiff asserts that, because Commerce had incomplete information, it is \u201cunclear whether [the Department] ultimately deducted sufficient selling expenses in the CEP calculations.\u201d PI. Br. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">D. HYSCO</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Plaintiff insists that the record contained evidence that HYSCO performed most of the functions in resales by its United States affiliate. Thus, plaintiff agrees that Commerce has supported with substantial evidence its decision to include a portion of these selling expenses in its CEP calculations for HYSCO. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Br. 16-17. .For plaintiff, however, \u201call [defendant-intervenor] parent companies participated in their subsidiaries\u2019 U.S. resales, particularly Union and POSCO.\u201d <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Reply Br. 10. Therefore, plaintiff characterizes Commerce\u2019s treatment of HYSCO as contradictory behavior by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>agency. It maintains that \u201cthe government undercuts its own position by the action it took on HYSCO\u2019s facts,\u201d when it purportedly made similar showings for all defendant-intervenors. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Reply Br. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">For its part, Commerce maintains that, with respect to three of the defendant-intervenors, it \u201creasonably determined not to deduct home market indirect selling expenses from [CEP].\u201d Def.\u2019s Br. 13. Commerce asserts that the antidumping statute and the statute\u2019s legislative history, as well as its \u201clongstanding practice,\u201d confirm that a deduction is not warranted for indirect selling expenses that are \u201cgeneral in nature\u201d and \u201cnot associated specifically with United States affiliates\u2019 resales to unaffiliated customers.\u201d Def.\u2019s Br. 13-14. The Department further claims that record evidence demonstrates that the expenses cited by plaintiff were general in nature, i.e., attributable to all sales not simply United States resales. Def.\u2019s Br. 17-18. For Commerce, plaintiff\u2019s arguments are misguided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">[Plaintiff] asserts that Commerce should have deducted certain expenses incurred by the foreign parent for selling activities like price negotiation because without these activities, the United States sales would not have occurred. Yet, [plaintiff] fails to recognize the critical distinction, i.e., that these types of expenses are general in nature because they are incurred regardless of whether the sale in question is an export price sale (direct to the unaffiliated United States customer) or a constructed export price sale. The expenses that Commerce deducts pursuant to 19 CFR \u00a7 351.402(b) are <em>only </em>those associated with the additional selling activities that the foreign parent or its United States affiliate must undertake in selling constructed export price subject merchandise to unaffiliated United States customers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Def.\u2019s Br. 17 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Additionally, Commerce notes that it made the deduction where warranted, i.e., when \u201cHYSCO had reported that it, not its United States affiliate, performed most of the resale activities in the United States market.\u201d Def.\u2019s Br. 18 (citing I&amp;D Memo, PD No. 226 at Comments 5, 15, and 23). Therefore, Commerce argues that it \u201ccorrectly applied the law to the facts\u201d and asks that this court sustain its determinations. Def.\u2019s Br. 17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">A resolution of this dispute revolves around whether Commerce misinterpreted the evidence before it. The court finds that it did not. With respect to the deductibility of these expenses, the only material difference between <em>Mittal </em>and the present case is the treatment of HYSCO. Thus, <em>Mittal </em>is useful here. <em>Mittal </em>sustained as lawful and supported by substantial evidence Commerce\u2019s refusal to deduct ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>penses it found to be general in nature. <em>See Mittal, </em>31 CIT at _, Slip Op. 07-117 at 14-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Here, as in <em>Mittal, </em>there is nothing in the record to indicate that Commerce did not request and receive all of the business information required in order to ascertain the respective levels of involvement of the Korean companies and their United States affiliates in the United States sales.

United States, </em>96 F.3d 1352, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (\u201cIt is the [Department\u2019s] task to evaluate the evidence it collects during its investigation.\u201d). Commerce\u2019s position is based upon its assessment of verified information.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Here, \u201cplaintiff has not made a case that the selling functions performed by the parent companies were mischar-acterized by Commerce.\u201d <em>Mittal, </em>31 CIT at _, Slip Op. 07-117 at 20.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, the court finds that, while plaintiffs and Commerce have a difference of opinion as to the characterization of the parent com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>panies\u2019 activities, Commerce adequately applied the law to the facts and has \u201c\u2018articulate [d] a[ ] rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Mittal, </em>31 CIT at _, Slip Op. 07-117 at 20-21 (quoting <em>Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s argument that Commerce\u2019s decision to deduct HYSCO\u2019s selling expenses (and not other defendant-intervenors\u2019 selling expenses) is somehow demonstrative of Commerce\u2019s contradictory behavior is not convincing. Commerce is entitled to treat companies differently if it articulates its reasoning for doing so and if its conclusions are supported by substantial evidence. Here, Commerce agreed with plaintiff that the \u201crecord evidence indicates that HYSCO performed most of the functions involved in [its United States affiliates\u2019] resales.\u201d <em>See </em>I&amp;D Memo, PD No. 226 at 22 (detailing Commerce\u2019s review of HYSCO\u2019s selling functions chart and explaining that HY-SCO \u201cstated that it negotiated and approved U.S. sales transactions\u201d). Plaintiff has simply not demonstrated that the selling functions performed by the other parent companies were mischaracterized by Commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Based on the foregoing, the court sustains as supported by substantial evidence and according to law Commerce\u2019s determination not to deduct selling expenses from CEP because (1) Commerce had all of the necessary information before it; and, (2) the Department reasonably concluded that the defendant-intervenors\u2019 reported selling ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>penses were general in nature and not specifically associated with resales of CORE to unaffiliated purchasers in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">III. CEP Offset Adjustments</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">In its investigation, Commerce was required by statute to take into account level of trade (\u201cLOT\u201d) differences to account for any price differential resulting from a Korean exporter\u2019s sales in Korea being made at a more advanced LOT than its sales to the United States. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(7)(A). Commerce is directed to make an actual LOT adjustment to normal value only if \u201cthe difference in [LOT]...is demonstrated to affect price comparability, based on a pattern of consistent price differences between sales at different [LOTs] in the country in which normal value is determined.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(7)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(7)(B), where the record contains insufficient data to make a LOT adjustment, a CEP offset to normal value calculations may be granted. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(a)(7)(b).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">When normal value is established at a [LOT] which constitutes a more advanced stage of distribution than the [LOT] of the [CEP], but the data available do not provide an appropriate basis to determine under subparagraph (A)(ii) a [LOT] adjustment, normal value shall be reduced by the amount of indirect selling expenses incurred in the country in which normal value is determined on sales of the foreign like product....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(7)(B); <em>see also Mittal, </em>31 CIT at _, Slip Op. 07-117 at 24 (citing 19 CFR \u00a7 351.412 (f)(3)).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">In deciding whether to grant a CEP offset, Commerce will analyze a party\u2019s LOT for its home market and for its CEP sales. <em>See </em>Def. Br. 20. \u201cFinding sales to be at a more advanced stage of distribution can be shown by evidence that the foreign producer or exporter performs more selling activities, and thus incurs more selling expenses, in its home market than it does in the United <em>States.\u201dMittal, </em>31 CIT at _, Slip Op. 07-117 at 25 (citing <em>Micron Tech., Inc. v.

That is, plaintiff asserts that the record was incomplete and that Commerce did not have sufficient evidence on the record to \u201cperform fair comparisons of activities at the two respective LOT[s].\u201d Pl.\u2019s Br. 18. \u201cBecause Commerce refused to ask questions that would have revealed the selling activities at the so-called CEP [LOT]..., it was not possible for Commerce to determine that the parents\u2019 sales to their U.S. affiliates were at a less advanced LOT than sales to non-affiliates in the home market.\u201d <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Reply Br. 13; Pl.\u2019s Br. 39. Plaintiff argues that Commerce\u2019s failure to remedy these deficiencies in the record demonstrates that the CEP offsets \u201care unsupported by substantial evidence because no reasonable mind would accept Commerce\u2019s analysis of the facts on the basis of the record as made.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Br. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Specifically, plaintiff insists that defendant-intervenors provided incomplete information in response to Commerce\u2019s initial and supplemental questionnaires requesting information about <em>\u201call </em>the selling functions\u201d at the CEP LOT. Pl.\u2019s Br. 37 (citations omitted). Plaintiff further argues that its comments to Commerce \u201ccalled attention to [the defendant-intervenors\u2019] failure to show entitlement to the offsets they claimed.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Br. 38. According to plaintiff, the defendant-intervenors collectively engaged in a \u201cpattern\u201d of \u201cactive [ly] assisting] their affiliates in reselling in the United States,\u201d and thereby promoting their own sales to their affiliates at the CEP LOT. Pl.\u2019s Br. 38. Plaintiff asserts that Commerce did not exercise \u201ccommon commercial sense\u201d by not inquiring further into these activities at the CEP LOT, thus failing to perceive \u201cthat affiliates engage in numerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>inter-company activities when performing complementary and overlapping roles in marketing goods internationally.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Plaintiff further asserts that Commerce\u2019s failure to seek more information about sales made by defendant-intervenors to their United States affiliates \u201cmeans that the record cannot support the agency\u2019s determination that home market sales were made at a LOT \u2018more advanced\u2019 than the CEP LOT, as judged by a reasonable mind.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Br. 39. Therefore, plaintiff seeks a remand to have the record made complete.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Pl.\u2019s Br. 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">Notwithstanding plaintiff\u2019s arguments, the court finds that Commerce\u2019s grant of CEP offsets to defendant-intervenors are supported by substantial evidence. For each defendant-intervenor, Commerce determined that there was sufficient evidence in the record to determine that: (1) each had a single LOT in its home market and a single LOT in the United States market, and (2) their home market sales were at more advanced LOT than their United States CEP sales. <em>See </em>I&amp;D Memo, PD No. 226 at Comments 6, 8, 14, 24; <em>see also </em>Def.\u2019s Br. 21. Thus, the Department reasonably relied on the extensive information provided by defendant-intervenors concerning their selling functions in the Korean and United States markets in granting each a CEP offset. <em>See </em>I&amp;D Memo, PD No. 226 at Comments 6, 8, 14, 24; <em>see also </em>Def.\u2019s Br. 21; <em>Mittal, </em>31 CIT _, Slip Op. 07-117 at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Specifically, for Dongbu, Commerce reviewed its questionnaire responses and concluded that the same selling activities occurred in both of its two home market distribution channels in \u201ccomparable frequency\u2019 and found \u201cthat the two home market channels of distribution alleged by [Dongbu] constitute one [LOT].\u201d Calculation Memo, for Dongbu Steel, Co., Ltd. (\u201cDongbu Calc. Memo\u201d), CR No. 79 at 2. Furthermore, Commerce noted that, \u201c[i]n the U.S. market, Dongbu made only CEP sales through its U.S. affiliate, Dongbu USA, to unaffiliated customers in two customer categories, end-users and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>distributors.\u201d Dongbu Calc. Memo, CR No. 79 at 2. Commerce \u201ccompared the selling functions in the home market to the selling functions in the U.S. market at the CEP LOT, and found a less advanced [LOT] in the U.S. market.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Dongbu Calc. Memo, CR No. 79 at 2. Based upon this selling function analysis, Commerce concluded that Dongbu\u2019s home market sales were \u201cmade at a different, and more advanced, stage of marketing than the LOT of CEP sales.\u201d Commerce, however, found that it lacked the price data needed to make a LOT adjustment. Dongbu Calc. Memo, CR No. 79 at 2. Therefore, Commerce reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-3\">Dongbu did not sell subject merchandise in the home market at the same LOT as that of the CEP, and there [was] no other data on the record that would allow the Department to establish whether there is a pattern of consistent price differences between sales at different [LOTs] in the comparison market. Accordingly, while we determined that a LOT adjustment may be appropriate for CEP sales...we are unable to make such an adjustment. Instead, we have made a CEP offset to NV [normal value]....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Dongbu Calc. Memo, CR No. 79 at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">With regard to HYSCO, Commerce undertook a similar analysis and reached the same conclusion, i.e., that \u201cthe evidence on the record was sufficient to demonstrate that HYSCO\u2019s [home market] sales were at a more advanced LOT than its CEP sales, and that the data available does not provide an appropriate basis to determine an LOT adjustment.\u201d <em>See </em>I&amp;D Memo, PD No. 226 at 19 (citing Calculation Memo, for Hyundai Hysco (Dep\u2019t of Commerce Aug. 31, 2005) (\u201cHY-SCO Calc.

Memo, PD No. 181 at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Likewise, Commerce undertook the same kind of analysis for Union and reached the conclusion, that Union was entitled to a CEP offset. <em>See generally </em>I&amp;D Memo, PD No. 226 at Comment 14. Commerce found that all of Union\u2019s Korean sales were made at one LOT, which was more advanced than the LOT of its affiliate\u2019s United States sales, and that \u201cit [was] not possible to quantify the extent to which sales at different LOTs in the [home and United States markets] differ in price.\u201d <em>See </em>I&amp;D Memo, PD No. 226 at 25.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Commerce again based this conclusion on its review of Union\u2019s questionnaire responses and selling function chart. <em>See </em>I&amp;D Memo, PD No. 226 at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">Commerce reached the same conclusions for POSCO. It found that record evidence demonstrated that its home market sales were at a more advanced LOT than its CEP sales, and granted POSCO a CEP offset. <em>See </em>I&amp;D Memo, PD No. 226 at 35-36. Commerce again did so based upon its review of POSCO\u2019s questionnaire responses and sell<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>ing chart.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>See </em>I&amp;D Memo, PD No. 226 at 35-36. As noted, plaintiff takes issue with Commerce\u2019s findings because it claims that the Department lacked sufficient evidence to justify the offsets. Plaintiff claims that there was incomplete information in the record to demonstrate that defendant-intervenors\u2019 home market sales were made at a more advanced LOT more advanced than the CEP LOT. Plaintiff, however, cites no record evidence to demonstrate that defendant-intervenors\u2019 reporting to Commerce was lacking; rather it relies upon \u201ccommon commercial sense.\u201d Commerce, however, is entitled to at least some deference when gauging the adequacy of the factual representations made to it. <em>See U.S. Steel Group v. United States, </em>96 F.3d 1352, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (\u201cIt is the [Department\u2019s] task to evaluate the evidence it collects during its investigation.\u201d). Without more, plaintiff\u2019s reference to \u201ccommon commercial sense\u201d is unavailing. <em>See Ceramica Regiomontana, S.A., </em>10 CIT at 404-05, 636 F. Supp. at 966 (\u201cAs long as the agency\u2019s methodology and procedures are reasonable means of effectuating the statutory purpose, and there is substantial evidence in the record supporting the agency\u2019s conclusions, the court will not impose its own views as to the sufficiency of the agency\u2019s investigation or question the agency\u2019s methodology.\u201d). Therefore, \u201c[t]he court cannot... credit plaintiff\u2019s unsubstantiated assertion that commercial realities render insufficient the evidence Commerce relied upon in making its decision\u201d to grant CEP offsets here. <em>Mittal, </em>31 CIT at _, Slip Op. 07-117 at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Thus, the court finds that in light of Commerce\u2019s detailed factual findings, and in accordance with the statutory scheme, Commerce supported with substantial evidence its grant of CEP offsets to the defendant-intervenors. That is, under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(7)(B), Commerce determined that \u201cthe data available [did] not provide an appropriate basis to determine...a [LOT] adjustment,\u201d and thus Commerce reasonably relied on the evidence of the selling functions performed by defendant-intervenors\u2019 United States affiliates in deciding to grant the companies a CEP offset. <em>See </em>Mittal, 31 CIT at _, Slip Op. 07-117 at 27-28; <em>see also Timken Co. v.

Duty Drawback Adjustment</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">A \u201c[d]rawback is the reimbursement of duties paid on goods imported into the United States and then used in the manufacture or production of articles which are subsequently exported.\u201d <em>Chrysler Motors Corp. v. United States, </em>14 CIT 807, 809, 755 F. Supp. 388, 390 (1990); <em>see also E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. v. United States, </em>24 CIT 1045, 1046 n.2, 116 F.Supp.2d 1343, 1345 n.2 (2000). The anti-dumping statute provides that \u201c[t]he price used to establish ...[CEP] shall be...increased by...the amount of any import duties imposed by the country of exportation which have been rebated, or which have not been collected, by reason of the exportation of the subject merchandise to the United States....\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(l)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">Based on the statute, Commerce has created a two-prong test that must be satisfied prior to the grant of a drawback adjustment. The first prong requires the exporter to establish that \u201cthe import duty and rebate are directly linked to, and dependent upon, one another.\u201d <em>Far East Mach. Co. v. United States, </em>12 CIT 972, 974, 699 F. Supp. 309, 311 (1988). The second prong demands that \u201cthe company claiming the adjustment demonstrate that there were sufficient imports of imported raw materials to account for the duty drawback received on the exports of the manufactured product.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 974, 699 F. Supp. at 311. For over twenty years, Commerce has consistently applied, and this Court has consistently upheld, this test. <em>See, e.g., Carlisle Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. United States, </em>11 CIT 168, 171, 657 F. Supp. 1287, 1290 (1987); <em>Far East Mach. Co., </em>12 CIT at 431-33, 688 F.

According to plaintiff, Commerce\u2019s current method of making drawback adjustments amplifies the potential for distorted dumping margins on Korean products, in part, because \u201cKorean law allows substitution-type drawback, and this allows Korean exporters to pick and choose the export shipments on which they base their drawback claims when they export from Korea.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Br. 19-20. Plaintiff argues that Commerce wrongfully denied its request \u201cto require [defendant-intervenors] to submit certain aggregate data\u201d in order \u201cto test the fairness of their claims.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Br. 20. According to plaintiff, \u201c[t]his data would have permitted Commerce to analyze whether any [defendant-intervenor] claimed excessive amounts on U.S. sales.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Br. 20. Thus, plaintiff maintains that it was foreclosed from pursuing this \u201ctheme\u201d of argument before Commerce. Pl.\u2019s Br. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Moreover, plaintiff asserts that Commerce\u2019s failure to request further information was an abuse of its discretion, particularly because Commerce itself \u201chas called into question its current methodology for drawback adjustments.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Br. 43-44. Plaintiff points the court to a Federal Register notice of June 30, 2005, in which Commerce stated that it \u201cis considering whether changes to its practice, including the two-prong test..., may be appropriate.\u201d <em>See </em>Duty Drawback Practice in Antidumping Proceedings, 70 Fed.

This First Request for Comments,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> according to plaintiff, represented an \u201cimplicit recognition\u201d that Commerce\u2019s two-prong test may be invalid in particular circumstances and, as such, it is unfair to make plaintiff \u201cwait for the agency to complete is current review to get reconsideration of the drawback adjustments.

Plaintiff\u2019s reliance on these requests, however, is misplaced. In the administrative setting</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">two conditions must be satisfied for agency action to be final: First, the action must mark the consummation of the agency\u2019s decision-making process, it must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature. And second, the action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-6\"><em>Bennett v. Spear, </em>520 U.S. 154, 178 (1997) (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The court\u2019s acceptance of these notices as binding recognition that Commerce\u2019s methodology was invalid or might be invalid would contravene the administrative process and hold the agency to a decision that is not final. This is the case despite Commerce\u2019s statement that it \u201cagrees with [the] commenters and proposes to modify its approach.\u201d Second Request for Comments, 71 Fed. Reg. at 61,723. Commerce is still \u201cwelcomfing] comment on this <em>proposed </em>methodology,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 61,724 (emphasis added), and therefore the Second Request for Comment is just that \u2014 a call for comments. Thus, Commerce\u2019s methodology and its interpretation of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a is entitled to deference until the Department completes its administrative processes. <em>See Wieland-Werke AG v.

The following hypothetical scenario can occur.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuN\">We can assume that Korean \u201cProducer X\u201d produces only one product, CORE, and that it uses steel scrap as the basic input. We can further assume that \u201cX\u201d imports 50 percent of its scrap consumption (paying import duties on the same) and obtains the balance locally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">We can finally assume that \u201cX\u201d sells 50 percent of its total production for export to the United States and 50 percent to Canada. Under these imagined circumstances, in conjunction with the Korean law, \u2018X\u201d could limit its claims for drawback solely to the shipments to the United States while claiming nothing on shipments to Canada - with U.S. antidumping motivations in mind. As a further hypothetical assumption, we can even assume that \u2018X\u201d could do this even if, as a matter of fact, none of the exports to the United States actually used any imported scrap, but were produced solely from domestic scrap. In circumstances such as these, the result would be a clear distortion so far as U.S. antidumping results are concerned. The claims may be normal and lawful in Korea, but the effect distorts U.S. antidumping calculations in a way that reduces antidumping margins to the disadvantage of U.S. producers. They result in disproportionate upward adjustments to reported United States prices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">Pl.\u2019s Br. 41 (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b481-6\"> The First Request for Comments reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">The Department is <em>considering </em>whether changes to its practice, including the two-prong test ..., may be appropriate. For instance, some parties have argued that the Department\u2019s practice should be modified by requiring a respondent party seeking a duty drawback adjustment to demonstrate payment of import duties on raw material inputs used to produce merchandise sold in the home market. They argue that such a requirement is consistent with principles of price comparability and the implementation of Congressional intent with respect to the duty drawback adjustment. In addition, according to such parties, any duty drawback adjustment made should also be limited to the amount of duties actually paid on material inputs used to produce merchandise sold in the home market. Certain parties have also argued that the Department should allocate the total pool of relevant drawback available under some systems to total exports of subject merchandise to ensure that the adjustment claimed on U.S. sales is not overstated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APC\">Parties advocating a change in Department practice argue that in creating the duty drawback adjustment, Congress intended that an increase in the export price resulting from the duty drawback adjustment was designed to offset an increase in the home market price resulting from the payment of import duties on inputs. As a result, the duty drawback adjustment was designed to prevent dumping margins from arising simply because of the rebate (or non-collection) of import duties on the inputs resulting from the export of subject merchandise to the United States. Yet, these parties argue, to permit a drawback adjustment where home market sales do not include import duties leaves nothing for the rebate or exemption to offset.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\"><em>In order to fully consider and address these claims </em>as well as other concerns about the Department\u2019s practice regarding duty drawback, the Department is providing an opportunity for the public to comment....
