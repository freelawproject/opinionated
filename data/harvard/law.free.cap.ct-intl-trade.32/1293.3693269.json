In <em>Jazz Photo Corp. v. United States, </em>31 CIT _, 502 F.Supp.2d 1277 (2007) <em>(\u201cJazz TV\"), </em>the court held that some of the government\u2019s positions in litigation before the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (\u201cCourt of Appeals\u201d) in 2005 and 2006 were not substantially justified. The court allowed plaintiff to submit a revised EAJA application statement identifying the attorneys\u2019 fees and other expenses incurred in litigating certain issues before the Court of Appeals on which Jazz prevailed and on which the government\u2019s position was not substantially justified. <em>See </em>Revised Application for Fees and Other Expenses Pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d), Title II of Public Law 96-481, 94 Stat. 2325 and Rule 54.1 (\u201cRevised Application\u201d) 2. Upon considering the revised application, the court determines a fee award of $38,704.76 which amount consists of $34,350.51 in compensation for attorneys\u2019 fees and $4,354.25 in compensation for disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-14\">\n<em>I. BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1313-15\">Plaintiff\u2019s EAJA claim arose from litigation involving the admissibility of Jazz\u2019s imported merchandise, which consisted of certain \u201clens-fitted film packages,\u201d which are more commonly known as \u201cdisposable cameras,\u201d \u201csingle use cameras,\u201d or \u201cone-time use cameras.\u201d In its revised EAJA application, plaintiff seeks $123,521.00 for attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>neys\u2019 fees and $9,297.31 for disbursements. <em>Id. </em>Arguing that Jazz\u2019s EAJA request fails to comply with the court\u2019s order in <em>Jazz IV, </em>the government submits that the fee award should be reduced to an amount no greater than $16,773.75 and opposes any reimbursement for other expenses. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Resp. to Pl.\u2019s Revised Application for Fees and Other Expenses Under the Equal Access to Justice Act 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d), Title II of Public Law 96-481, 94 Stat. 2325 and Rule 54.1 (\u201cDef.\u2019s Resp.\u201d) 7-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-4\">Background information on Jazz\u2019s revised EAJA application is presented in the opinion of the Court of Appeals in <em>Jazz Photo Corp. v. International Trade Commission, </em>264 F.3d 1094 (Fed. Cir. 2001) <em>(\u201cJazz F), </em>the opinion of the United States Court of International Trade in <em>Jazz Photo Corp. v. United States, </em>28 CIT 1954, 353 F.Supp.2d 1327 (2004) <em>(\u201cJazz IF), </em>and the opinion of the Court of Appeals in <em>Jazz Photo Corp. v. United States, </em>439 F.3d 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2006) <em>(\u201cJazz IIP), </em>which affirmed the court\u2019s judgment in <em>Jazz II </em>and decided the appellate issues on which Jazz qualifies for an EAJA award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-5\">In <em>Jazz IV, </em>the court held that the positions taken by United States Customs and Border Protection (\u201cCustoms\u201d) in the administrative proceeding resulting in the <em>Jazz II </em>and <em>Jazz III </em>litigation were substantially justified. <em>Jazz IV, </em>31 CIT _, 502 F.Supp.2d at 1293-94. The court reached the same conclusion with respect to the government\u2019s positions in the <em>Jazz II </em>litigation before the Court of International Trade. <em>Id. </em>at _, 502 F.Supp.2d. at 1284-91. Concerning the <em>Jazz III </em>litigation before the Court of Appeals, the Court of International Trade ruled in <em>Jazz IV </em>that the United States was not substantially justified in pursuing its position on the issue of permissible repair and also was not substantially justified in pursuing its position on the authority of the court to order expedited administrative proceedings directing Customs to participate in segregating the admissible portion of Jazz\u2019s imported merchandise from the inadmissible portion. <em>Id. </em>at _, 502 F.Supp.2d. at 1287-93. At the conclusion of the <em>Jazz IV </em>litigation, the court declined to award fees and other expenses and instead allowed plaintiffs to submit a revised application statement that identifies the specific legal services provided, and expenses incurred, in plaintiff\u2019s litigation of those two issues before the Court of Appeals. <em>Id. </em>at , 502 F.Supp.2d at 1295.</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-10\">\n<em>II. DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1314-11\">If the government pursues a litigation position that is not substantially justified, and if other conditions set forth in EAJA are satisfied, a court may award a prevailing party \u201creasonable attorney fees.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(A). Plaintiff seeks compensation for the fees paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>to three partners and two associates of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, Neville Peterson LLP. Affirmation of John M. Peterson in Support of Application for Fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, Aug. 27, 2006 (\u201cAffirmation\u201d) \u00b6 13. Counsels\u2019 hourly rates ranged from $450 for the lead partner to $225 for the most junior associate. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1315-4\">In its original EAJA application, plaintiff sought $347,333.00 in attorneys\u2019 fees and $34,428.45 in disbursements, totaling $381,761.45, for services rendered from September 30, 2004 through February 8, 2006. Affirmation of John M. Peterson in Support of Application for Fees Under the Equal Access to Justice Act, May 26, 2006, Ex. A at 1. Plaintiff reduced its original EAJA claim by shortening the requested compensation period to eliminate all billing entries and disbursements that preceded the issuance of the <em>Jazz II </em>opinion. Affirmation \u00b6 13. Plaintiff\u2019s revised application seeks compensation for services beginning November 18, 2004 and ending February 8, 2006. <em>Id. </em>For a total of 363.1<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hours of legal services provided in connection with the appellate litigation, plaintiff requests $123,521.00 for legal fees and reimbursement of $9,297.31 in other expenses. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-5\">The government advocates an award for attorneys\u2019 fees in an amount not to exceed $16,773.75, which would limit plaintiff\u2019s hourly fee to the $125 EAJA rate and exclude 229.56 hours of billing from plaintiff\u2019s request. Def.\u2019s Resp. 7-14, 16. In seeking a deduction of 229.56 hours, defendant argues that plaintiff\u2019s revised application improperly includes 130.60 hours for representation pertaining exclusively to litigation with a third party, 6.8 hours for representation related to <em>Jazz </em>I,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 16.5 hours for billing by one of the firm\u2019s attorneys, Mr. Thompson, on matters unrelated to the appellate litigation in question. <em>Id. </em>at 7-10. The government further alleges, with respect to 97.25 hours, that plaintiff failed to segregate the hours for services rendered on issues for which the court permitted EAJA recovery in <em>Jazz IV. Id. </em>at 10-12. The government requests that the court deduct 75.66 of the 97.25 hours to account for this error. <em>Id. </em>at 13. Although rejecting some of defendant\u2019s calculations, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>concludes that certain adjustments to plaintiffs revised EAJA claim are appropriate to ensure that plaintiff does not recover under EAJA legal fees and other expenses related to litigation of issues on which the government\u2019s position was substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">\n<em>A. The Special Factor Enhancement Is Warranted for Representation on the Issue of Segregation of Merchandise</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-5\">EAJA states that \u201cattorney fees shall not be awarded in excess of $125 per hour unless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee.\u201d. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(A)(ii). Plaintiff seeks compensation at rates above the $125 statutory maximum, arguing that higher rates are justified because of the presence of special factors and increases in the cost of living.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-6\">Plaintiff contends that a special-factor enhancement is warranted because, in addition to basic litigation skills, plaintiff\u2019s attorneys \u201chad to have specialized knowledge in International Trade Commission 337 General Exclusion Orders, intellectual property matters such as first sale and under patent laws, permissible repair, and some expertise in the manner in which Customs is called to execute 337 Orders at the ports of entry.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Reply Mem. in Supp. of Its Application for an Award of Attorney\u2019s Fees Under the Equal Access to Justice Act (\u201cPl.\u2019s Reply\u201d) 12. Plaintiff also argues that \u201cthe attorneys at Neville Peterson LLP presented all these skills\u201d on an emergent trial schedule and that \u201cno other law firm or attorney would take on such an expedited trial (which was the first of its kind, and which involved almost entirely issues of first impression) and appeal schedule for a client which was already under bankruptcy protection.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Reply 8, 13. The government argues that none of these factors justifies a special-factor enhancement. Def.\u2019s Resp. 7-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-7\">In <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 572 (1988), the Supreme Court clarified that the EAJA special factor exception for qualified attorneys \u201crefers to attorneys having some distinctive knowledge or specialized skill needful for the litigation in question.\u201d The Court noted, as an example of a special factor, expertise in \u201can identifiable practice speciality such as patent law.\u201d <em>Pierce, </em>487 U.S. at 572. The Court then listed several factors that it deemed insufficient to merit an increase in the statutory cap: \u201c[t]he \u2018novelty and difficulty of issues,\u2019 \u2018the undesirability of the case,\u2019 the \u2018work and ability of counsel,\u2019 and \u2018the results obtained.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573 (internal citation omitted). The Court explained that these \u201care factors applicable to a broad spectrum of litigation; they are little more than routine reasons why market rates are what they are.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>The court considers customs law to be a specialized practice area, distinct from general and administrative law, for purposes of EAJA. <em>See Nakamura v. Heinrich, </em>17 CIT 119, 121 (1993). The court further concludes that plaintiff\u2019s attorneys possess distinct knowledge and litigation experience in the field of customs law. The law firm Neville Peterson LLP describes itself as \u201ca law firm concentrating in international and domestic trade regulation matters.\u201d <em>See </em>Neville Peterson LLP, http://www.npwtradelaw.com (last visited Dec. 1, 2008). The biography of the lead billing partner in the Jazz litigation, Mr. Peterson, attests to expertise in international trade and customs topics. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, Mr. Peterson is a member of the Customs and International Trade Bar Association. <em>Id. </em>Defendant does not question the credentials and expertise of plaintiff\u2019s attorneys in customs law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-4\">The court next considers whether specialized customs law skills were required for competent representation in the case. <em>See Pierce, </em>487 U.S. at 572; <em>see also Libas, Ltd. v. United States, </em>27 CIT 1193, 283 F.Supp.2d 1327 (2003) (finding that attorney\u2019s knowledge of customs law was necessary to litigate case). The court concludes that plaintiff\u2019s attorneys\u2019 expertise in customs law warrants a special-factor enhancement because knowledge of customs law was critical to effective representation in litigating the issue of segregation. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel participated in an additional administrative proceeding directed to the segregation issue. Plaintiff argued successfully on appeal that the Court of International Trade was authorized to order expedited administrative proceedings and that Customs was obligated to supervise the importer\u2019s segregation of commingled goods stored in a bonded warehouse. The court accepts that the billing rates of plaintiff\u2019s attorneys are reasonable based on the customary compensation charged by other customs and international trade lawyers in other cases. <em>See </em>Affirmation \u00b6 12. The court calculates, later in this Opinion and Order, the value of the representation by plaintiff\u2019s counsel on the segregation issue. The court declines, however, to award a special factor for plaintiff\u2019s attorneys\u2019 representation on issues other than segregation. Plaintiff\u2019s argument that the case involved \u201cnumerous questions of patent infringement law,\u201d Pl.\u2019s Reply 8, is generally correct; however, plaintiff has not submitted evidence demonstrating that the firm Neville Peterson LLP specializes in intellectual property law generally or patent law in particular, nor has it demonstrated that the billing attorneys in this case hold themselves out as specialists in these areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">With the possible exception of plaintiff\u2019s request for a special-factor enhancement for preparing the trial and appeal in a relatively short time period, <em>see </em>Pl.\u2019s Reply 8, the remaining justifications for special-factor enhancements that plaintiff advances were justifications re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>jected in <em>Pierce. </em>In support of its claimed special-factor enhancement for expedited trial and appellate preparation, plaintiff argues that \u201cno other law firm or attorney would take on such an expedited trial.\u201d PL\u2019s Reply 8. The shortage of lawyers who would take a particular case has been held to be inadequate to establish a \u201cspecial factor\u201d exception to the statutory rate. <em>See Hyatt v. Barnhart, </em>315 F.3d 239, 249 (4th Cir. 2002). Plaintiff\u2019s argument is further undercut by its failure to substantiate the premise that no other firm or attorney was available to undertake the representation. <em>See Libas, </em>Ltd., 27 CIT at 1198, 283 F.Supp.2d at 1333 (where plaintiff submitted affidavits of attorneys from the Los Angeles area who stated that the customs bar was very small in the area). Moreover, plaintiff\u2019s rationale that the need to prepare for expedited trial and appeal satisfies the standard for a \u201cspecial factor\u201d increase might be viewed as akin to the \u201cundesirability of the case\u201d rationale that the Supreme Court found insufficient. <em>See Pierce, </em>487 U.S. at 573; <em>Role Models America, Inc. v. Brownlee, </em>353 F.3d 962, 969 (D.C. Cir. 2004) <em>(\u201cPierce </em>made clear that an increase in the cap is justified only by work requiring specialized skills or knowledge beyond what lawyers use on a regular basis. Producing high-quality work on a short deadline hardly satisfies this standard.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-4\">\n<em>B. The Court Allows an Adjustment for Cost of Living</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-5\">The court concludes that a cost-of-living increase is warranted. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(A)(ii). The court may exercise judicial discretion in granting cost-of-living adjustments so as to effectuate the intent of Congress \u201cto provide adequate compensation notwithstanding inflation.\u201d <em>Payne v. Sullivan, </em>977 F.2d 900, 903 (4th Cir. 1992) (quoting <em>Sullivan v. Sullivan, </em>958 F.2d 574, 578 (4th Cir. 1992) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Plaintiff correctly submits that the costof-living adjustment in this case may be calculated using the Consumer Price Index (\u201cCPI-U\u201d). <em>See Kerin v. U.S.P.S., </em>218 F.3d 185, 194 (2d Cir. 2000) (\u201c[T]he district court may choose to apply a cost of living adjustment to [the statutory rate], as measured by the Consumer Price Index.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-6\">The court calculates adjustments to EAJA fees using the CPI-U information available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the Northeast Urban Area pertaining to the periods in which the services were performed, which were the second half of 2004, the first half of 2005,. and early 2006. <em>See Kerin, </em>218 F.3d at 194 (\u201c[T]he hourly rate... should only be increased by the corresponding Consumer Price Index for each year in which the legal work was performed.\u201d (internal citations omitted)). Although seeking reimbursement for at least four billing entries occurring in January and February of 2006, plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>does not identify a CPI-U rate for the year 2006 in its revised EAJA application. The court concludes that it is appropriate to calculate a cost-of-living adjusted rate for the 2006 attorney billing hours because a portion of these billing entries are allowed. To calculate the EAJA fee adjustment, the court makes an adjustment to the $125 statutory EAJA amount. <em>See Allegheny Bradford Corp. v. United States, </em>28 CIT 2107, 2114, 350 F.Supp.2d 1332, 1339 (2004); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(A)(ii). The adjustment is as follows: $125 per hour (the statutory amount for fees), multiplied by 201.7 for the year 2004; 205.3 for the year 2005; and 211 for January 2006<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (the relevant years for the Northeast Urban Area CPI-U), divided by 162.8 (the Northeast Urban CPI-U of March 1996).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1319-4\">Accordingly, the adjusted EAJA fee rate for 2004 is $154.87 ($125 x 201.7/162.8). The adjusted rate for 2005 is $157.63 ($125 x 205.3/ 162.8). The adjusted rate for 2006 is $162.01 ($125 x 211/162.8). The court next considers the numbers of hours requested in the revised EAJA application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-5\">\n<em>C. The Court Reduces the EAJA Award to Avoid Improper Reimbursement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-6\">Plaintiff seeks reimbursement for 363.15 hours of legal services. Plaintiff has the burden of establishing the reasonableness of its fee request. <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 437 (1983). Defendant contends that plaintiffs EAJA claim for 363.15 hours is unreasonable and excessive because it includes attorneys\u2019 time and expenses for issues unrelated to the government\u2019s appeal in <em>Jazz III. </em>Def.\u2019s Resp. 7. Defending its request, plaintiff argues that, where a litigant has substantially prevailed in its position, \u201cto limit the award and reduce the fees according to specific issues would undermine the spirit of the EAJA.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Reply 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-7\">The court disagrees that limiting an EAJA award according to specific issues would undermine the spirit of EAJA. Although the court may have discretion to do otherwise, the court concludes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>the better result in this case is to avoid a result requiring the government to bear the expense of defending even its reasonable positions. <em>See Ellis v. United States, </em>711 F.2d 1571, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1983). <em>Jazz IV </em>held that the government pursued substantially unjustified positions on only two of the issues in the <em>Jazz III </em>appellate litigation, <em>i.e., </em>whether the processing conducted on Jazz\u2019s imported merchandise constituted permissible repair and whether the Court of International Trade had authority to order expedited administrative proceedings to segregate merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-4\">Certain billing entries appear to be unrelated to the <em>Jazz III </em>litigation in the Court of Appeals on the two issues for which the court is allowing EAJA reimbursement. Some of these billing entries, corresponding to 7.6 hours, pertain to plaintiff\u2019s participation in the Jazz <em>I </em>litigation before the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additionally, it is appropriate to reduce the EAJA award by the 16.5 hours billed by one of plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, Mr. Thompson, for legal services rendered from January 27, 2006 to February 8, 2006, inclusive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Plaintiff\u2019s billing record indicates that plaintiff presented oral argument in <em>Jazz III </em>on January 5, 2006. <em>See </em>Revised Application, Ex. A at 10; <em>see also </em>Pl.\u2019s Reply, Ex. A (case detail sheet for the Court of Appeals, calendaring oral argument for January 9, 2006). There is no indication that plaintiff filed any brief following the oral argument in the <em>Jazz III </em>appellate litigation. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Reply, Ex. A. The court concludes, therefore, that the subject billing entries by Mr. Thompson should be deleted from any recovery under EAJA. <em>See Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-5\">The government challenges 206.26 of the remaining 339.05 hours in plaintiff\u2019s revised EAJA application. The billing entries for these hours do not segregate the amount of time plaintiff\u2019s attorneys spent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>in the <em>Jazz III </em>appellate litigation on the issues of permissible repair and merchandise segregation from the amount of time spent on the other issues involved in the <em>Jazz III </em>litigation. The court recognizes that at the time of billing these entries, plaintiff\u2019s counsel was not aware of the future need to identify the specific time incurred in litigating each of those two issues. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Reply 9. However, the court considers an adjustment appropriate so that plaintiff does not recover under EAJA legal fees for issues on which the government\u2019s litigating position was substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-3\">In determining plaintiff\u2019s EAJA award, the court is guided by the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Hensley </em>on an analogous issue. <em>Hensley </em>held that EAJA awards should not be reduced according to a mathematical ratio comparing the number of issues upon which the plaintiff actually prevailed with the total number of issues in the case. <em>See Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 435-36, n.11. Although this case presents a different issue, <em>Hensley </em>is nevertheless instructive on the general question of how EAJA awards should be allocated between litigated issues. Further, while defendant requests that \u201cthe ratio of the number of pages in Jazz\u2019s appellate brief devoted to each of the issues be used as a means of measurement,\u201d Def.\u2019s Resp. 13, the Court of Appeals held in <em>Naekel v. Department of Transportation, </em>884 F.2d 1378, 1379-80 (Fed. Cir. 1989), that trial courts may not reduce awards by a fraction corresponding to the number of briefing page's devoted to successful versus unsuccessful issues, because the \u201ccount of pages\u201d argument does not necessarily indicate the significance of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-4\">\n<em>1. Reduction of Attorney Hours for Litigation Opposing Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s revised statement includes the hours plaintiff\u2019s counsel billed that resulted from opposing the positions in the <em>Jazz III </em>appellate litigation that were taken by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. (\u201cFuji\u201d). The government alleges that approximately 130.60 hours of attorney time requested in Jazz\u2019s revised application related to Jazz\u2019s opposing motions filed by Fuji on which the government either took no position or opposed Fuji\u2019s positions. Def.\u2019s Resp. 9. Plaintiff contends that attorney representation on matters concerning Fuji were properly included in its fee application because the government worked together with Fuji to overturn the court\u2019s decision and failed to take a position separate from Fuji at the appellate level. Pl.\u2019s Reply 10. Plaintiff also argues that permitting it to recover fees for litigation opposing Fuji is appropriate because the government and Fuji shared oral argument time during the appeal, the government consolidated its appeal with Fuji, and the government took no position on frivolous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>motions asserted by Fuji. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1322-4\">It is inappropriate to award attorneys\u2019 fees against the government for those phases of litigation in which the claimant was opposed solely by third parties. <em>See Judicial Watch, Inc. v. United States Dep\u2019t of Commerce, </em>470 F.3d 363, 373 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (providing instructive reasoning on EAJA with regard to claimant\u2019s litigation disputes with third parties); <em>see also Love v. Reilly, </em>924 F.2d 1492, 1496 (9th Cir. 1991) (applying EAJA and concluding that \u201cwhere plaintiffs are litigating an issue and are opposed only by private defendants, a fee award against the government would be \u2018manifestly unfair and contrary to historic fee-shifting principles.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Avoyelles Sportsmen\u2019s League v. Marsh, </em>786 F.2d 631, 636 (5th Cir. 1986)). The court determines that the position taken by the government with regard to Fuji at the appellate level was not in opposition to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-5\">The <em>Jazz III </em>litigation involving Fuji before the Court of Appeals centered on the issues of intervention and joinder. The government maintained before the Court of Appeals that Fuji\u2019s intervention was barred by \u201cthe plain language of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2631(j)\u201d and that Fuji did not qualify as a necessary party to the proceeding. Br. of Def.Appellant United States 25, n.2. Although the government did not take a position on the issue of joinder, the Court of Appeals noted that the government and Jazz were aligned on the position that Fuji was barred from intervention by the express language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2631(j)(l)(A). <em>See Jazz III, </em>439 F.3d at 1357; <em>see also </em>Br. of Def.-Appellant United States 25, n.2. The Court of Appeals concluded that where a party is statutorily prohibited from intervening in a proceeding, the party cannot be considered a necessary party to that proceeding for purposes of joinder. <em>Jazz III, </em>439 F.3d at 1357.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-6\">On appeal, Fuji also argued that its outside counsel should have been granted access to confidential documents under the protective order entered into under USCIT Rule 26(c). <em>See id. </em>at 1357-58. The protective order was intended to protect. Jazz\u2019s commercial information. Fuji was denied access to this information because it was not a party to the case. The government did not object to Fuji\u2019s gaining access to confidential documents, either at trial or on appeal. Br. of Def.-Appellant United States 25, n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-7\">The primary purpose of EAJA is to eliminate legal expense as a barrier to challenges of \u201cunreasonable government action.\u201d <em>See Ellis, </em>711 F.2d. at 1576. Because EAJA contemplates deterring only unreasonable positions taken by the government, the court agrees with the reasoning in <em>Judicial Watch, Inc. </em>and <em>Love </em>and concludes that it is improper to grant an EAJA award where a non-governmental party litigated the issue and the government took no position. <em>See Love, </em>924 F.2d at 1496 (holding that the government should be liable only for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>fees related to third parties insofar as they \u201cwere incurred in opposing government resistence\u201d). Fuji was not represented by the government and brought its own appeal, in which it disputed the Court of International Trade\u2019s rulings on standing and access to certain Jazz proprietary information. The litigation issues involving Fuji were neither initiated nor pursued by the government, Fuji was a third party that was not within the government\u2019s control or authority, and the litigation dispute between Fuji and Jazz did not relate to the two issues for which the court is permitting plaintiff\u2019s EAJA recovery. Accordingly, plaintiff\u2019s revised EAJA application must be reduced to exclude attorneys\u2019 fees for representation opposing Fuji.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-4\">The court deducts 111.61 hours from plaintiff\u2019s revised EAJA application to reflect time spent on litigation against Fuji, as challenged by defendant in its Exhibit A. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Resp., Ex. A. In arriving at this figure, the court disallowed recovery for certain billing entries, agreeing with defendant that these are \u201cbilling entries describing attorney work and hours spent on responses to Fuji filings.\u201d <em>See id. </em>For a limited number of the contested entries, where the billing descriptions indicated that, in addition to Fuji matters, plaintiff\u2019s counsel represented Jazz on an issue for which EAJA recovery is permitted, the court deducted ten percent of the attorneys\u2019hours. The court estimates that a ten percent reduction to these particular entries is appropriate because the issues involving Fuji were not major issues on appeal, were not particularly complex, and could beresolved through basic statutory interpretation with only limited analysis of precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-5\">\n<em>2. Additional Reduction of Attorney Hours for Appellate Litigation on Issues Related to Fuji and Reduction of Attorney Hours for Appellate Litigation on the \u201cFirst Sale\u201d Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-6\">The government identifies 97.25 hours in plaintiff\u2019s revised EAJA statement that it contends are not properly segregated among the issues for which recovery is permitted. The government requests that the court deduct 75.66 of the 97.25 hours to account for time spent by plaintiff on issues for which recovery is not permitted, i.e., those related to Fuji and the \u201cfirst sale\u201d issue. The court deducts from the 97.25 hours an amount to reflect billing on the issue of first sale and the issues involving Fuji. Below, the court discusses its method of calculating this deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-7\">The first sale issue, on which the government\u2019s litigation position in <em>Jazz III </em>was held in <em>Jazz IV </em>to be substantially justified, involved two questions, degree of burden of proof and application of a presumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>of regularity, that were issues of first impression. <em>See Jazz IV, </em>31 CIT at _, 502 F.Supp.2d. at 1286. Considered as a whole, the resolution of the first sale issue by the Court of Appeals was a matter of some complexity. <em>See Jazz III, </em>439 F.3d at 1350-53. Because it cannot identify the specific time entries for legal representation provided in contesting the government\u2019s positions on the first sale issue, the court is basing its fee reduction on its understanding gained by presiding over the pre-trial, trial, and post-trial proceedings in <em>Jazz II </em>and on its general familiarity with the issues of first sale, permissible repair, and segregation. The court estimates that the issues of first sale and permissible repair each accounted for forty percent of plaintiff\u2019s appellate representation in <em>Jazz III. </em>The court values the less complicated issues involving Fuji and the issue of segregation to each represent ten percent of plaintiff\u2019s appellate representation, for a total of twenty percent. On this basis, the court makes a deduction of 48.63 hours, which is fifty percent of the total of 97.25 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-6\">In sum, the court is deducting a total of 160.24 hours from plaintiff\u2019s revised EAJA application to address the inclusion in plaintiff\u2019s billing submissions of hours for litigation with Fuji and for litigating the issue of first sale.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1324-7\">3. <em>Calculation of Plaintiff\u2019s EAJA Award</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1324-8\">The court will award plaintiff reimbursement for 178.81 hours of attorneys\u2019 time incurred in litigating the <em>Jazz III </em>matter before the Court of Appeals. The court determines that the issue of segregation, for which the special enhancement factor is permitted, accounted for twenty percent of the 178.81 hours of appellate representation for which the court is allowing reimbursement, or approximately 35.76 hours. The court will allocate attorneys\u2019 fees for this issue on a pro-rata basis. To calculate the appropriate attorneys\u2019 fees, the court will credit each of the five billing attorneys for their representation on the issue of segregation based on their overall percentage of hours billed on this case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In total, plaintiff is awarded $12,061.35 for representation on the issue of segregation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>For the remaining 143.05 hours, the court calculates the total amount of reimbursable attorneys\u2019 fees as $22,289.16. This amount includes $14,920.80 for 2004, $7,154.51 for 2005, and $213.85 for 2006. In sum, plaintiff is awarded $34,350.51 in attorneys\u2019 fees for the issues of permissible repair and segregation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-4\">\n<em>4. Reduction for Inappropriate Expenses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-5\">Plaintiff also requests compensation of $9,297.31 for disbursements. Affirmation \u00b6 17. EAJA permits reimbursement for \u201cfees and other expenses.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(l)(A)(2)(A) (setting forth a list of examples of permissible expenses). The Court of Appeals has held that \u201c[w]e interpret 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 to mean that the trial court...may award only those reasonable and necessary expenses of an attorney incurred or paid in preparation for trial..., which expenses are those customarily charged to the client where the case is tried.\u201d <em>Oliveira v. United States, </em>827 F.2d 735, 744 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (footnote omitted). The plaintiff in <em>Oliveira </em>sought to recover expenses for photocopying, printing and binding briefs, telephone, postage, and overnight delivery services. <em>Id. </em>Although the Court of Appeals did not decide whether the plaintiff could recover the expenses claimed, it cited with approval a Ninth Circuit opinion that awarded telephone, postage, air courier, and attorney travel expenses under \u00a7 2412(b). <em>See id. </em>at 744 &amp; n.27 (citing <em>Int\u2019l Woodworkers of Am. v. Donovan, </em>792 F.2d 762, 767 (9th Cir. 1985)). Based on <em>Oliveira, </em>the terms \u201cfees and other expenses\u201d in \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) should be interpreted broadly enough to include the specific categories of expenses claimed by the plaintiff in its revised EAJA application. <em>See, e.g., Filtration Dev. Co. v. United States, </em>63 Fed. Cl. 612, 626 (Fed. Cl. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-6\">Plaintiffidentifi.es the basis of its expenses as follows: taxi ($30.00), travel ($64.43), postage ($112.31), court fee ($150.00), fax ($178.00), messenger ($215.69), miscellaneous ($588.82), photocopies ($1,138.20), express courier ($352.00), phone charges ($2,100.36), and computerized research ($4,367.50). Affirmation, Ex. A. Defendant argues that, due to plaintiff\u2019s failure to attach to its revised application documentation substantiating its expenses, the court must deduct all requested expenses from plaintiff\u2019s revised application. Def.\u2019s Resp. 15-16 (citing <em>Naporano Iron &amp; Metal Co. v. United States, </em>825 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>F.2d 403, 405 (Fed. Cir. 1987)). In <em>Naporano, </em>the plaintiff submitted a billing statement that included a request for disbursements but did not itemize the disbursements to identify specific expenses, i.e., an amount for photocopies, telephone bills, etc. <em>Naporano, </em>825 F.2d at 404. Unlike the plaintiff in <em>Naporano, </em>Jazz has identified expenses in its revised application with sufficient specificity to allow the court to determine whether these expenses are reasonable. An exception is the amount requested for miscellaneous expenses, which the court is disallowing because it cannot make a reasonableness determination. Based on the percentages discussed previously, the court also deducts 50% of the remainder to reflect estimated expenses relating to representation opposing Fuji\u2019s position and representation on the issue of first sale. Accordingly, the court awards plaintiff $4,354.25 for disbursements in its revised EAJA application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-4\"><em>III. CONCLUSION </em>AND ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-5\">Based on the foregoing discussion, the court concludes that plaintiff\u2019s Revised Application for an Award of Attorney Fees Under the Equal Access to Justice Act should be granted in part and denied in part. Plaintiff is awarded reimbursement for $34,350.51 of attorneys\u2019 fees and $4,354.25 for identified expenses. Accordingly, it is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-6\">ORDERED that defendant shall pay to plaintiff $38,704.76 in reimbursement under EAJA for attorneys\u2019 fees and disbursements.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1315-6\"> In its revised EAJA application, plaintiff requests compensation for 363.75 hours.

The government argues, incorrectly, that plaintiff\u2019s counsel failed to provide the corresponding hours for the billing entry of January 14, 2005. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Resp. to Pl.\u2019s Revised Application for Fees and Other Expenses Under the Equal Access to Justice Act 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d), Title II of Public Law 96-481, 94 Stat. 2325 and Rule 54.1 (\u201cDef.\u2019s Resp.\u201d) 8.

In addition, although plaintiff alleges that Maria E. Celis billed 45.1 hours and Catherine Chess Chen 36.5 hours, based on the attorneys\u2019 billing statements attached to plaintiff\u2019s affirmation, the correct calculation is 44.9 hours and 36.1 hours, respectively. See Affirmation \u00b6 13. Accordingly, the court calculates the billing of: Mr. Peterson (a total of 121.85 hours) to account for thirty-six percent, or 12.85 hours, of the billed hours on the issue of segregation, amounting to $5,782.50 in attorneys\u2019 fees; Mr. Thompson (a total of 18.6 hours) to account for five percent, or 1.96 hours, of the billed hours on the issue of segregation, amounting to $754.60 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>attorneys\u2019 fees; Mr. Knauss (a total of 117.6 hours) to account for thirty-five percent, or 12.40 hours, of the billed hours on the issue of segregation, amounting to $3,410.00 in attorneys\u2019 fees; Ms. Celis (a total of 44.9 hours) to account for thirteen percent, or 4.74 hours, of the billed hours on the issue of segregation, amounting to $1,066.50 in attorneys\u2019 fees; and Ms. Chen (a total of 36.1 hours) to account for eleven percent, or 3.81 hours, of the billed hours on the issue of segregation, amounting to $1,047.75 in attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b1313-16\">With the consent of the parties, this public version is being issued without the redaction of any information contained in the confidential version of this Opinion and Order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
