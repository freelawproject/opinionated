(See in addition to cases cited in opinion therein, <em>Valentine </em>v. <em>Police Court, </em>141 Cal. 615, [75 Pac. 336]; <em>American Law Book Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>164 Cal. 327, [128 Pac. 921].) <bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It is immaterial <em>in this proceeding </em>whether or not the complaint in the justice\u2019s court stated facts sufficient to show the commission of a public offense. If it did not state such facts, the superior court <em>erred </em>in affirming the judgment, but that was mere error in the exercise of its lawful jurisdiction. If for any reason the judgment of the justice\u2019s court is <em>void </em>for want of jurisdiction, the superior court nevertheless had <em>jurisdiction </em>to affirm it. Whether or not such judgment can be attacked in some other proceeding, such as <em>habeas corpus, </em>for instance, is altogether immaterial here. The <em>superior court </em>did not exceed its jurisdiction in affirming such judgment. It follows that the order assailed must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The order of the superior court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Angellotti, C. J., Shaw, J., Wilbur, J., Sloane, J., Lennon, J., Lawlor, J., and Olney, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Rehearing denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">All the Justices concurred, except Olney, J., who voted for rehearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
