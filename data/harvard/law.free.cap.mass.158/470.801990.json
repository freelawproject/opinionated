The prayer of the bill is- that the defendant be ordered to deliver up to the plaintiff the bond, cancelled or discharged. The bill is dated October 11, 1892.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">That equity has jurisdiction, under some circumstances, to order an instrument valid in its inception to be delivered up after it has ceased to be operative, is unquestionable. \u201c The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>exercise of this power,\u201d says Chancellor Kent, in <em>Hamilton </em>v. Cummings, 1 Johns. Ch. 517, 523, \u201c is to be regulated by sound discretion, as the circumstances of the individual case may dictate ; and . . . the resort to equity, to be sustained, must be expedient, either because the instrument is liable to abuse from its negotiable nature, or because the defence, not arising on its face, may be difficult, or uncertain at law, or from some other special circumstances peculiar to the case, and rendering a resort here highly proper, and clear of all suspicion of any design to promote expense and litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Where the existence of the instrument acts as a cloud upon the title of the person executing it, or subjects him to the danger of some future litigation \u201c when the facts are no longer capable of complete proof, or have become involved in the obscurities of time,\u201d is stated by Mr. Justice Story as the ground for affording relief in equity. 2 Story Eq. Jur. \u00a7 705. See also <em>Webb </em>v. Noah, 1 Edw. Ch. 604, 615; <em>Hughes </em>v. Sanders, 3 Bibb, 360; <em>Foley </em>v. Kirk, 6 Stew. 170, 174. Generally, however, where the instrument is a bond, equity will not interfere, but will leave the obligor to his defence at law to an action brought on the bond. <em>Strong </em>v. <em>M'Donald, </em>1 Root, 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The danger of future litigation when the facts may be no longer capable of proof, which is stated by Mr. Justice Story, <em>ubi supra, </em>as a ground of relief in equity, would seem to have little weight in those jurisdictions where, as in this Commonwealth, evidence may be perpetuated. Pub. Sts. c. 169, \u00a7 45. Tn New York, the existence of such a statute has been held a sufficient reason why relief in equity on account of the danger of future litigation should not be granted. <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>62 N. Y. 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">In the case at bar we see no reason why the defendant should be compelled to try in a court of equity the question whether the plaintiff has kept and performed the contracts made with the customers of the firm. If the fact be as the plaintiff alleges, the retention of the bond by the defendant can do the plaintiff no harm, unless it arises from the fact that the plaintiff has entered into a contract with a third person. The defendant was not a party to that contract, and it does not even appear that he had knowledge of it, if this would be of consequence, and his rights should not be affected by it.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number><em>S.
