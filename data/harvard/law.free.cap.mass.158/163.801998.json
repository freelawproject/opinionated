The capias was not produced by the government, although called for by the defendant. The judge refused to rule, as requested by the defendant, that, in the absence of the capias, the evidence for the government did not sustain the complaint. <em>Held, </em>that the defendant had no ground of exception.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-13\">Complaint to the District Court of East Norfolk, for an assault and battery upon George O.

If the identification of it by paroi as a capias, and the implication that it ran against the defendant, in extreme strictness, could have been objected to as reciting the contents of the writ, no such objection was taken, and the case could not be taken from the jury at a later stage because the capias was not produced. <em>Niles </em>v. <em>Patch, </em>13 Gray, 254, 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
