Shaw, 7 Cush. 282. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>2 Allen, 187. <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>124 Mass. 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">By the Pub. Sts. c. 162, \u00a7 31, and by the amendment thereof, St. 1888, c. 419, \u00a7 7, the court or magistrate is required to \u201c appoint a time and place for his [the debtor\u2019s] examination,\u201d and to \u201cissue a notice thereof to the plaintiff or creditor.\u201d The appointment of the time and place is the first substantive act of the court, and, that having been done, \u201c notice thereof \u201d is issued. The amended record shows that Monday was the time appointed for the examination, but by inadvertence the notice gave the time as Sunday. When the mistake was discovered, a later day was appointed for the examination, and a new notice was served.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">By the Pub. Sts. c. 162, \u00a7 33, it is provided that, \u201c when a defendant or debtor has given notice of his desire to take the oath for the relief of poor debtors,\u201d no new notice shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>given until the expiration of seven days, <em>\u201c </em>unless the former notice was insufficient in form or service,\u201d and it is contended that the second notice in this case was invalid, because it was issued only two days after the issuing of the first one. The first notice did not conform to the order of the court. It stated a time which had not been appointed. It was not the notice which the court directed, and was as if no notice had been given. It was insufficient in form, inasmuch as in form it was incorrect and worthless. The purpose of the Legislature was evidently to prevent a person who has given one good and sufficient notice from abandoning the proceedings, and giving another before the expiration of seven days from the service of the first; and the statute permitting the issuing of a second notice immediately should be held to apply to any case where the first was invalid and insufficient. The word \u201c form \u201d is not used in this section in a narrow sense, but includes everything that goes to the validity of the notice. The case is covered by the decision in <em>Burt </em>v. Geary, 128 Mass. 404. The second notice was properly issued, and the judgment debtor was lawfully discharged. <em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
