The judge refused to rule, as requested by the defendant, that there was not sufficient evidence to justify a verdict of guilty. <em>Held, </em>that the defendant bad no ground of exception.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b227-9\">At the trial in the Superior Court, on appeal, of a criminal case, a witness cannot testify to what he heard another person, who is ill and unable to attend the trial, testify to at the trial of the case in the lower court.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-10\">Complaint, to the First District Court of Eastern Middlesex, alleging that the defendant, on January 1, 1892, and on divers other days and times between that day and February 26,1892, the date of the complaint at Malden, unlawfully exposed and kept for sale intoxicating liquors, with intent unlawfully to sell the same in this Commonwealth. Trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Fessenden, </em>J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-11\">There was evidence for the government that the defendant was a pedler and provision dealer, and kept a store in Malden. The store was in a large block, in which there were eight or ten tenants, and there was an unoccupied store adjoining the store <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>of the defendant, but having no direct connection with his store, although it was connected by a door leading into an entry-way in the rear of the defendant\u2019s store. A door opened into the entry-way from the defendant\u2019s store.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-5\">Evidence was introduced that on February 22, 1892, fifty-two bottles of lager beer and four quarts of whiskey were found on ice in a chest in the unoccupied store, and three empty lager beer cases were found in the same place. The owner of the building testified that he did not let the store to any person, and did not occupy it himself. There was no evidence, except such as appears in this bill of exceptions, that the unoccupied store was used, controlled, or in any manner occupied by the defendant, or that he had any key to the door of the same, or that he had access to it in any way during the time covered by the complaint. The lock on the door was an ordinary lock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-6\">There was evidence that on January 5, 1892, at a time when the defendant was not present, a quart of whiskey in a bottle was found by an officer in the cellar of the building in which the store of the defendant was situated. There was a stairway leading from the defendant\u2019s store to the cellar, and there were two other stairways leading from the premises of other tenants to the cellar, which was not divided off or partitioned, but permitted an unobstructed passage under the whole block.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-7\">The defendant lived with his grandmother, Catherine Kearns, about one hundred or one hundred and fifty yards from the store. The police searched the house of Mrs. Kearns, and in the kitchen, under\" a trap-door in the floor, were found concealed two quart bottles containing whiskey, and two empty jugs smelling of whiskey. It was shown that the defendant went back and forth from his store to this house when he took his meals, and also whenever he desired to do so at such times as he was not on the road engaged in peddling provisions. There was no evidence that anything was brought by him from the house to the store, nor was there any evidence of any other person passing or being sent as messenger between the store and house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-8\">There was evidence, admitted without objection, that Mrs. Iveams was seventy-three years of age, and was ill and unable to appear in court. The defendant offered to prove that Mrs. Kearns claimed the liquor found at her house as her own, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>for this purpose asked, on cross-examination, the chief of police of Malden, who was a witness for the government, and who was not inquired of as to this matter by the district attorney, if he heard the testimony of Mrs. Kearns when a witness at the trial of this case in the lower court. He testified that he did. The defendant thereupon asked him what Mrs. Kearns testified as to the ownership of the liquors found in her house. The judge excluded the question ; and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-5\">There was evidence that quite a number of men congregated around the corner where the defendant\u2019s store is situated, and that some of them were sometimes under the influence of liquor; that on one occasion when the defendant was present, during the time covered by the complaint, a pint bottle was found in the defendant\u2019s store half filled with lager beer, and also eight empty lager beer bottles; that on another occasion, when the defendant was present, there was a whiskey glass which smelt of whiskey; that quite a number of young men were about the store of the defendant, and many of them were seen by officers sitting about the stove in the back room of the store, from which a door opened into the entry-way before mentioned ; and that on different occasions men were seen in the store and in the back room, and in the presence of the defendant, under the influence of liquor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-6\">There was no evidence that the defendant bought or sold, or delivered, or had possession of any intoxicating liquors during the time covered by the complaint, unless the same may be inferred from the evidence hereinbefore set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-7\">The defendant asked the judge to rule that there.was not sufficient evidence to justify a verdict of guilty; but the judge refused so to rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-8\">The jury returned a .verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions. -</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b229-9\"><em>P. J. Doherty E. D. </em>Sibley, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b229-10\"><em>C. N. Harris, </em>Second Assistant Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b229-11\">Field, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AR4\">We are of opinion that the evidence recited in the exceptions was sufficient to warrant the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">The remaining exception is to the refusal of the court to permit a.witness to testify to what Mrs. Kearns testified to at the trial of this case in the district court, she being ill and unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>be present at the trial in the Superior Court. The witness heard her testimony, and we assume that it was material. On this question there is a conflict of authority in other jurisdictions, but here, so far as we know, the practice has been to confine such testimony to cases where the witness has died; and the weight of authority elsewhere in criminal proceedings is, we think, that the rule should not be extended to cases where the witness is ill at the time of the trial. <em>State </em>v.
