Nelson died on March 2, 1889, and by her will, which was duly admitted to probate, gave pecuniary legacies to Abraham W. Seaver and to several others, and added after the residuary bequest, \u201c All the aforesaid legacies are payable at the convenience of my executor hereafter named, but within two years from the probate of this will. All the aforesaid legacies are to them and their heirs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-13\">She appointed Abraham W. Seaver as her executor, but he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>died in the lifetime of the testatrix, and Samuel Wood was appointed administrator with the will annexed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-5\">Anna M. Seaver, the appellant, is the daughter of Abraham W. Seaver, and is the residuary legatee and devisee under his will, of which she is executrix, and she is his next of kin and heir at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-6\">The appellant contended that the words \u201c all the aforesaid legacies are to them and their heirs \u201d meant that the legacies were given to the legatees named in the will if alive at the death of the testatrix, but if not alive at that time, then to their heirs respectively.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-7\">Subsequently Samuel Wood, as executor of the estate of Julia A. Nichols and as guardian of the estate of Addie A. Davis, a minor, and Eudolphus T. Rand, as executor of the estate of Eliza A. Rand, the residuary legatees and devisees under the will of Adaline K. Nelson, appeared as parties to this suit, and filed a supplemental statement of agreed facts, substantially similar to the foregoing, and at their request the case was reserved by Lathrop, J., for the consideration of the full court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b432-8\"><em>C.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARE9\">The contention of the appellant is that the words, \u201c All the aforesaid legacies are to them and their heirs,\u201d found at the close of item 17 of the will, mean that the legacies are given to the legatees named in the will if alive at the death of the testatrix; but if not alive at that time, then to their heirs, respectively. \u201c And \u201d in a will is sometimes read \u201c or,\u201d when the context shows that such is the intention of the testator, but there is nothing in the context here which shows that the word has not its customary meaning. In a legacy of personal property to a legatee named and his heirs, the word \u201c heirs,\u201d although technically appropriate to real estate, is taken to be a word of limitation, and to indicate that the whole interest of the testator in the personal property is given absolutely to the legatee. In the present case, one of the legatees not a child or other relation of the testatrix having died before the testatrix, the legacy lapsed. Pub.
