The witness replied, \u201c I told the lieutenant to book this man for drunkenness, and told him that a man had been knocked down and robbed, and this man corresponded to the description given.\u201d The defendant\u2019s counsel, having put in evidence the substance or effect of the charge made by the witness at the station-house, it was clearly competent for the Commonwealth to prove the exact words the witness used in making the charge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v.
