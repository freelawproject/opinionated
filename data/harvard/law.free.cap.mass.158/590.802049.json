The bill further stated that the defendant had given the plaintiffs notice that he intended to sell the bonds held as collateral security in order to pay the notes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-11\">The answer denied that the notes had been given on such terms, and averred that they had been given in final and abso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>lute settlement of a claim for a much larger amount, to recover which the defendant had brought an action, and this action he had dismissed as a part of his settlement with the plaintiffs. At the hearing in the Superior Court a large amount of documentary evidence was introduced, which consisted of the correspondence between the parties relative to the notes, the notes themselves, the letters of the defendant to his attorney directing the dismissal of the defendant\u2019s action at law, etc. The other evidence was the oral testimony of the defendant and the plaintiff Howland, in respect to the character and circumstances of the transaction in which the notes in question were given. The court made a decree adjudging that the plaintiffs owed the defendant $2,690.96 on the notes, and ordering that this amount be paid out of a fund which the plaintiffs had deposited in the hands of the clerk of the court, and the plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b611-5\"><em>E. Avery &amp; G. M. </em>Hobbs, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b611-6\"><em>S. H. </em>Dudley, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b611-7\">Barker, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXt\">The single question raised by the plaintiffs is whether, upon the evidence, a compromise settlement made by the parties on October 29, 1890, was final and absolute, or conditional. One of the plaintiffs and the defendant were the only witnesses examined, and their testimony was contradictory. But they both testified that, at the time of the settlement, the plaintiffs gave the defendant a negotiable promissory note with collateral security for the amount agreed upon; that when the note became due a portion of it was paid and the balance was renewed ; and that payments of different amounts were subsequently made from time to time. The exhibits show no trace of any condition annexed to the settlement, although they indicate that both parties afterwards claimed that some items had not been considered in arriving at the compromise. Upon the whole, the documentary evidence bears strongly in favor of the defendant, who, at the time of the settlement, dismissed an action previously brought to recover the claims which he compromised. In addition, the plaintiff, who testified in this case that the settlement was conditional, admitted, upon cross-examination, that he had, on the day after it was made, testified in another case that he had paid the defendant in full all that he owed him by a payment equivalent to cash, giving him the bonds which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>plaintiffs seek to redeem as collateral for a note which it was arranged should be discounted so that he could get the money. The weight of the evidence is not only so strongly in favor of the defendant as to support the decree, but also to convince us that the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is frivolous. The case calls for the imposition of double costs, and interest at the rate of twelve per cent by the year from the time when the appeal was taken, and the decree is to be affirmed with such modifications as are rendered necessary by the lapse of time and the order for double costs and interest. See St. 1883, c. 223, \u00a7 15. The modifications made necessary by this decision will be made in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
