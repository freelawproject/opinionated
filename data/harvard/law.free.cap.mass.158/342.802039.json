Stimpson, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, who died about January 1, 1888, had owned the property in question, and that the plaintiff herself and George R. Stimpson, her adopted son, who, it appeared, was her fully authorized agent to manage her property and to sell the personal property in question, were the only witnesses as to the title of the plaintiff, and testified that William H. Stimpson did not, to their knowledge, sell this property during his lifetime. It also appeared that the hotel in question, and the land on which it stood, had belonged to William H. Stimpson, and that he had given his wife, Elizabeth Stimpson, the furniture the subject matter of this suit, during his lifetime, not by any conveyance in writing, or by the agency of or delivery to a third person, but by a verbal gift direct to his wife, and that the plaintiff and George R. and Maria W. Stimpson, his wife, had assumed that such gift was valid, and that Elizabeth Stimpson owned the furniture. It further appeared that Elizabeth was appointed administratrix on or about January 1, 1891, for the purpose of bringing this suit; that the suit was brought in that month; that, by mesne conveyances, the real estate had come into the name of Maria W.; that in the fall of 1890 the real estate was put by Maria W. in the hands of one Nason, an agent, to be <em>sold; </em>that at the same time Nason was authorized (if the plaintiff at that time had power so to authorize) to sell the personal property, the subject of this suit, and that Nason was instructed to sell either the hotel alone or the hotel with the furniture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-5\">It further appeared that George R. Stimpson was the owner of certain articles of furniture within the hotel, to wit, one gas machine, office counters, one common chamber set, and the gas fixtures in the house, as appeared by enclosure in a letter of October 30, 1890, written by George R. Stimpson to the defendant in this action, a copy of which is hereinafter contained; that, in pursuance of such instructions, Nason, on October 7, 1890, made a written contract between Maria W. Stimpson, in her own right, and the defendant, whereby the said Maria agreed to sell the real estate, including the building and stable and \u201c all the personal property in said house belonging to me,\u201d full possession to be given at the time of the delivery of the deed, October 17, 1890, \u201cand the bill of sale of all the personal property in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>said house\u201d; and that on or about October 23 Maria W. and Nason went to Plymouth, and there delivered to the defendant a deed of the real estate, properly executed by Maria W., and a bill of sale, of which the following is a copy *.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-5\">\u201c Boston, Oct. 23, 1890. Received of Robert E. Achorn one dollar, in full for the furniture in the Mattapoisett House belonging to me, the same that was included in the sale of said property. George R. Stimpson.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-6\">The defendant offered to show by one Bowles, who was called by him as a witness, that William H. Stimpson, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, during his lifetime told Bowles that he (William H. Stimpson) had put all his (William H. Stimpson\u2019s) property out of his hands, both real and personal. On the plaintiff\u2019s objection the judge excluded the evidence, and the defendant excepted. It was not suggested by the defendant that this statement referred to any other disposition of the personal estate than the gift to the wife, Elizabeth Stimpson. It appeared further that on October 23, 1890, the deeds called for by the agreement were passed, and the cash called for paid at Plymouth ; that at the time there were present Maria W. Stimpson, Nason, and the defendant <em>; </em>and that at the time of signing the agreement and at the time of passing the deeds and the paying the cash the defendant was occupying the real estate, and was in possession of the personal property in question as assignee of a lease by the lessee of the property which had expired or was about to expire. Nason, among other things, testified that in the spring of 1890 he went to Mattapoisett with George R. Stimpson to examine the hotel and furniture; that George R. Stimpson told him to advertise the property and sell it by private sale, the hotel and furniture; that he (Nason) supposed that the furniture \u2014 now the subject of this suit \u2014 belonged to Elizabeth Stimpson in her own right, that during the summer of 1890 he saw the plaintiff at his own office and house a good many times, and had talks with her about the Mattapoisett Hotel and furniture in it, and that she told him to sell the personal property and the real estate, \u2014 to sell the personal property with the house ; and that at the time of executing the written agreement on October 7,1890, the defendant spoke of the personal property, and the words \u201c and the bill of sale of all the personal property in said house\u201d were interlined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>in the agreement by him (Nason) and before the agreement was signed. George R. Stimpson testified that the words \u201c and bill of sale of all the personal property in said house,\u201d which were inserted in a printed blank in the handwriting of Nason after the words \u201c full possession of the said premises,\u201d etc., were not in the agreement when the same was shown to him at some time between October 7 and October 23 by Nason, and that the agreement had at that time been signed by both Nason as agent and by the defendant. Nason further testified, that in Septemtember, 1890, while negotiations for the sale were going on, he reported to George R. Stimpson the defendant\u2019s offer of $6,000 for \u201c the hotel property,\u201d and that he (Nason) as George R. Stimpson\u2019s agent had refused the offer, and then asked for instructions. In reply, George R. Stimpson authorized him (Nason) to sell at $6,500, \u2014 \u201c told me to sell the property to Mr. Aehorn for $6,500, or, if I could n\u2019t do any different, in case I could n\u2019t get $6,500, let him (Aehorn) split the difference ($6,250), including the furniture.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b365-5\">George R. Stimpson testified that Nason told him that he thought he could get $6,500 for the house without the furniture, and that Nason then asked, \u201c Suppose I could get you $6,000 clear for the house, and my commission above that?\u201d and said, \u201c I will get my commission clear over and above $6,000, and the furniture not to go \u201d; that a question was raised by Nason as to the ownership of the gas fixtures and the gas machine, and that Nason asked Stimpson if he owned any furniture in the house; that Stimpson replied that he did own 'one chamber set, and, to avoid any question, would give a bill of sale of the gas fixtures and the gas machine, and throw in the chamber set, and that Nason afterwards showed him the agreement, and that Stimpson then said, \u201c It is signed for Maria W. Stimpson, and she don\u2019t own a cent\u2019s worth of furniture \u201d; Nason said, \u201c That don\u2019t make any difference to you, does it?\u201d Stimpson replied, \u201c Certainly; it ought to be what I have got.\u201d Nason replied that it made no difference. Nason testified, that at the time the papers were passed at Plymouth, a bill of sale, the same as printed above, was delivered to the defendant; that there were then present Maria W. Stimpson, J. L. Nason, and the defendant. Nason\u2019s evidence on this point was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>\u201c <em>Q. </em>Will you tell us what you said at that time. <em>A. </em>I called for the bill of sale of the personal property that I prepared the Saturday previous for them to sign and have at the record office with him. When we went down in the morning, Mrs. Stimpson handed me another bill of sale. It was not the bill of sale that I prepared; it read different. She said Mr. Stimpson prepared it, as he wanted it his way.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-5\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>What was said in Mr. Achorn\u2019s presence ? <em>A. </em>She read the bill of sale and delivered it to Mr. Achorn in my presence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-6\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>What did you say to her there that this bill of sale carried ? <em>A. </em>The personal property in the house at Mattapoisett that he was already in possession of.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-7\">Maria W. Stimpson testified that George R. Stimpson handed her the bill of sale in Boston, and that she handed the same to Nason while on the train travelling to Plymouth, and that the same was handed by said Nason to the defendant without remark.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-8\">Maria W. Stimpson further testified that, when the papers were passed, the defendant asked her for a list of the furniture owned by George R. Stimpson and transferred by the bill of sale, and that she promised to send him such list.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-9\">The day after papers were passed at Plymouth, George R. Stimpson mailed to the defendant, and the defendant admitted receiving, the following letter :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-10\">\u201c Boston, Oct. 24, 1890. Mr. Robert E. Achorn. Dear Sir, Mrs. G. R. Stimpson says you spoke to her regarding list personal property belonging to her or myself in the Mattapoisett House that you purchased. I will send you same soon, and that not belonging to us, Mrs. E. Stimpson, the owner, says may remain, if you desire, until she decides to remove it, or should you be ready to furnish, and it be in your way, let her know and she will immediately remove the same, or she will sell you at appraisal by good parties, if it is such as you want. Yours very resp\u2019fly, Geo. R. Stimpson.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-11\">On October 30, 1890, George R. Stimpson mailed, and the defendant received, the following letter:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-12\">\u201c Boston, Oct. 30, 1890. Mr. R. E. Achorn. Dear Sir, Please find enclosed list personal property sold to you with Mattapoisett House.

I will confer with my mother, the owner, upon any suggestion you make and let you know as aforesaid. Yours, G. R. Stimpson.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-5\">This letter contained the following enclosure:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-6\">\u201c Boston, Oct. 30, 1890. List personal property that was in Mattapoisett House belonging to G. R. Stimpson, as per bill of sale given Robert E. Achorn, viz. (see letter Oct. 30, 1890) : 1 gas machine, office counters, 1 common chamber-set; gas fixtures in house. Recvd payment, by sale hotel. G. R. Stimpson.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-7\">The defendant made no reply to either of these letters, or to several succeeding. About December 1, George R. Stimpson went to Mattapoisett, and for the first time learned that the defendant claimed to have purchased the furniture at the time of the purchase of the hotel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-8\">At the conclusion of the evidence, the defendant asked the judge to rule as follows: \u201cIf the jury find that the plaintiff, either by herself or her agents, knowingly caused or allowed the defendant to believe that, upon the payment by him of the cash agreed upon in the sale of the hotel and the delivery of the deed of the hotel to him, all the personal property belonging to the plaintiff that was there at the time of such payment and delivery in the hotel, should thereupon belong to him, the defendant, and that the defendant while so believing, and while the plaintiff, either by herself or her agents, knowingly caused or allowed him so to believe, paid such cash, and received delivery of said deed, and that the said personal property was, at the time of such payment and delivery, in the defendant\u2019s possession, the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-9\">The judge refused so to rule, and ruled that \u201c the only question for the jury was the assessment of damages.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-10\">The jury found for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b367-11\"><em>E. D. Stetson, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b367-12\"><em>G. W. Anderson, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Knowlton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASN2\">The plaintiff, as administratrix, had a good title to the property in question. The gift from her husband to her, considered as an attempt to make the furniture her sole and separate property under our statute, was invalid. Pub. Sts. c. 147, \u00a7 3. At common law, such a gift cannot transfer the property during the lifetime of the husband, and can take effect after his death only in case it does not interfere with the claims of creditors, and in case there was a delivery in his lifetime and a retention of possession by the wife. The gift is revocable, and, if the property is subsequently taken back into the possession of the husband, the wife\u2019s right is at an end. <em>Spelman </em>v. <em>Aldrich, </em>126 Mass. 113. <em>Fellows </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>130 Mass. 378. <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Jaquith, </em>134 Mass. 138. In the present case, it does not appear that there was any delivery to the plaintiff by her husband, or that she was ever in possession in his lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The testimony, offered by the defendant, of the declaration of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, that he had put all his property out of his hands, it not being suggested that the statement referred to any other disposition of the personal estate than the gift to his wife, was immaterial. It had no tendency to contradict the plaintiff\u2019s present contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The court rightly ruled that there was no evidence to warrant a verdict for the defendant. The agreement to sell, and the subsequent bill of sale, did not purport to convey the plaintiff\u2019s property, but only that belonging to Maria W. Stimpson and George R. Stimpson. It is not contended that the defendant took any title to this property under those writings.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The \u00bfontention is that the plaintiff is estopped from claiming the property because of the conduct of Nason and George R. Stimpson, her agents, in so acting as to induce the defendant to believe that he was getting a good title under the writings. There is no evidence to connect the plaintiff personally with these transactions, and if we assume that there was evidence against Nason or George R. Stimpson such as would warrant a finding of fraud against them, and work an estoppel against the plaintiff if she were bound by their conduct, the answer to the defendant\u2019s contention is that they were the plaintiff\u2019s agents only to sell her property. She might be bound by their fraudulent conduct while acting for her in making a sale, but she would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>not be affected by their fraud in selling the property of another person, and pretending at the same time that her property belonged to that other and was included in the sale; nor could she be estopped on the ground that, while having authority to represent her in selling her goods, they silently stood by and permitted her goods to be sold and paid for as the property of another. Such an act would not be within their authority, nor done in the transaction of her business. There was nothing disclosed at the trial to interfere with the right of the plaintiff to recover the value of her property.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
