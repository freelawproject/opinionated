Hill.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-9\">It appeared in evidence that the plaintiff was the widow of James Hill, who had in his lifetime together with the defendant constituted the firm of Whidden, Hill, and Company. Upon the death of Hill, the plaintiff was appointed executrix of his will, and a controversy arose between herself as such executrix and the defendant as surviving partner of the firm in relation to the amount due to the estate of Hill upon a settlement of the firm accounts. In the spring or summer of 1889, terms of settlement were substantially agreed upon, but in arranging the details more or less delay was caused, so that the settlement was not finally carried through until August 23, 1889, although all the papers were dated as of July 24, which was the date when it was anticipated that the settlement would be consummated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-10\">There was no dispute at the trial as to the terms of the settlement, except so far as concerned the two notes sued upon, the terms being in substance as follows. The defendant was to pay to the plaintiff, as executrix, the sum of $3,000 in cash, and to give her fourteen notes of $100 each, and a bond of indemnity against the debts of the firm of Whidden, Hill, and Company ; while the plaintiff as executrix was to transfer and assign all her right and interest in the real and personal property and assets of the firm to the defendant, and release the firm and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>defendant as surviving partner from all claims and demands of whatsoever nature.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-5\">On June 24, 1889, the plaintiff filed a petition in the Probate Court for authority, as executrix, to settle the controversy upon the above mentioned terms, and that court, on July 22, 1889; entered the following decree:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-6\">\u201c That said petitioner, executrix as aforesaid, be, and she hereby is, authorized to release all claims of said estate against said Whidden on account of said copartnership, and to release to said Whidden and convey any and all interest of said deceased in and to a certain lot or parcel of land, with the buildings thereon, situate and lying between Malden and Wareham Streets in said Boston, and to transfer and assign to said Whidden all of the interest of said estate in and to the assets of said copartnership of every nature and description ; all in consideration of the sum of three thousand dollars in cash, promissory notes amounting to fourteen hundred dollars, to be paid her, and the execution of a bond of indemnity by said Whidden, with sureties satisfactory to said petitioner, to pay all liabilities, debts, and claims of every kind against said firm, or which said estate would be liable for on account of said firm.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-7\">On August 28, 1889, the parties made and consummated the terms of the settlement above stated; the defendant on that day paying to the plaintiff as executrix the sum of $3,000 in cash, fourteen notes of $100 each, payable at monthly intervals until the whole were paid, and a satisfactory bond of indem\u00f1ity against the debts of Whidden, Hill, and Company. Of the amount of the notes $400 was to pay a part of the accountant\u2019s bill. At the same time the plaintiff, as executrix and individually, executed and delivered the instrument above set forth, and also two deeds conveying all the interest of the estate of James Hill in the partnership real estate. The notes which were thus delivered have been paid, and the terms of the settlement set out in the decree of the Probate Court and in the above named instrument have been fully complied with.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-8\">The plaintiff was called as a witness, and, among other things, testified that, after her appointment as executrix, there was a controversy between her and the defendant as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>amount due her on the settlement of the partnership account as such executrix ; that she and the defendant had numerous interviews and conversations upon the subject; that, some time in the spring of 1889, she stated to the defendant that she would settle the whole matter for $10,000; that the defendant offered $6,000 in settlement, which she declined to accept; that at a later interview between them, in April, it was agreed that a settlement should be effected for $6,000, and one half of the bill of the expert accountant who had examined the partnership books ; that $3,000 of that amount should be paid in cash and $3,000 by promissory notes of the defendant; that the defendant afterwards gave the plaintiff two promissory notes, signed by himself, of $1,000 each, payable to the plaintiff; that she accepted those notes on account of the agreed settlement, and was requested by the defendant to keep the fact of his giving the notes a secret, as otherwise he would have difficulty in raising the money to carry out the settlement; that she showed those notes to her counsel, and requested the defendant, previously to the final settlement, to give her new notes in substitution of those she already had, bearing the same date as the time of final settlement; and that the following letter, dated \"July 30, 1889, was received by her from the defendant in reply to her request: \u201c I will change the notes I gave you some time ago, and give you two with date of day we pass papers in settlement of your claims in exchange for them. I will see Mr. Gaston, and get a day fixed for the finishing up of this business. The notes to read same as ones now in your hands.\u201d She also testified that, before the terms of settlement were finally agreed upon, she had been paid $250 on account of her claim as executrix against the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-5\">After the close of the defendant\u2019s evidence, the plaintiff was recalled, and further testified, that she made a settlement with the defendant in the spring, long before May 21, 1889, and the notes were given before May 21; that she never told the defendant that she wanted the notes to secure the <em>settlement; </em>that the notes in suit were written by the defendant in Mr. Gaston\u2019s office ; that in the latter part of July, 1889, she insisted that the defendant should give her two notes to take the place of those she already held, and he agreed to do so by letter; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>that on August 28, 1889, she together with her counsel went to the office of the defendant\u2019s counsel to carry out the terms of the settlement; that before the papers were signed or executed she requested the defendant to step into the rear office, which he did, and, they being alone, she asked him to give her two new notes for $1,000 each, to take the place of the two which he had given her in the spring; that he thereupon did so, and she surrendered the other two notes; that she then returned with the defendant to the main office and told her counsel, in a whisper, that she had the notes, but without communicating the fact in any way to counsel for the defendant; that thereafter the $3,000 in cash was paid to her, the fourteen notes for $100 each were signed by the defendant and delivered to her, as also the bond of indemnity; and that she thereafter signed and delivered the instrument of release above set forth, and also the deeds of the real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-5\">The defendant testified that he had given the plaintiff two notes for $1,000 each in May, 1889, because she wanted some guaranty that he would carry out the settlement, but that he told her at the time that they were not to be of any effect if the settlement was carried through; that on August 23 the plaintiff called him into the rear office of his counsel, and demanded two notes in place of the two which she held, but he told her they would not be any good if the settlement went through, but that she said she would take her chances of making it hot enough for him so that he would pay them; that he accordingly gave her the two notes in suit, in place of the other two which were surrendered; that he understood that, if he gave them to her, she rrould carry out the agreement; and that he did not know whether she would or not if he did not give them to her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-6\">Neither the plaintiff, the defendant, nor the plaintiff\u2019s counsel communicated the giving of the notes to the defendant\u2019s attorneys at the time of the settlement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-7\">The defendant requested the judge to rule as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-8\">\u201c 1. It is not competent for the plaintiff to contradict or vary by oral testimony the terms of the release, or to show by oral testimony that the settlement embraced the delivery to the plaintiff of the two notes in suit, in addition to the cash and notes spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>cially mentioned in said release. 2. Upon all the evidence in the case, the notes in suit were discharged by the release. 3. It is not competent for the plaintiff to contradict or vary the terms of the release by oral evidence that it was given in consideration of the delivery to her of the two notes in suit in addition to the cash, notes, and bond of indemnity specified in said release. 4. Upon all the evidence in the case, there was no consideration for the notes in suit. 5. A claim on the part of the plaintiff, as executrix of the will of her husband, if any existed, was not a legal consideration for the notes in suit. 6. Upon all the evidence in the case, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-5\">The judge refused to give these rulings, except the first part of the first ruling requested as far as the words \u201c or to show \u201d ; found for the plaintiff, and\u201d assessed damages in the sum of $2,294.80 ; and also made the following finding of facts : \u201c The court finds that the notes declared on in said action were given as a part of the consideration of the release of the plaintiff to the defendant, and that the same belong to the estate of her deceased husband, James Hill.\u201d The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-6\"><em>F. E. </em>Snow, ( <em>W. A. Gaston </em>with him,) for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-7\"><em>S. H. Tyng, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b293-8\">Knowlton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXG\">There was abundant evidence to warrant the finding of the justice of the Superior Court that the notes declared on were given as a part of the consideration for the release to the defendant, and that they belonged to the estate of the plaintiff\u2019s deceased husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">The questions raised by the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings may be reduced to three: first, whether it was competent to prove that the notes were given as a part of the consideration of the release signed by the plaintiff as executrix, notwithstanding the recital in the release of a different consideration which does not include this; secondly, whether the notes, being given to the plaintiff in her own name, and not in her name as executrix, can be enforced, if founded on a consideration moving from her as executrix; and thirdly, whether they are barred by the release itself, which purports to discharge the defendant from all debts, demands, actions, or causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>1. It has repeatedly been held in this Commonwealth that the recital of a consideration in a deed does not preclude either party from showing an additional consideration; and it was competent for the plaintiff to show that the notes were given as a part of the consideration for the release, in addition to the consideration mentioned therein. <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>17 Mass. 249, 257. <em>Preble </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>6 Cush. 549. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Deshon, </em>12 Cush. 589. <em>Twomey </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>137 Mass. 184. <em>Soule </em>v. <em>Soule, </em>157 Mass. 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">2. The fact that the notes were made payable to the plaintiff in her own name, without mention of her official relation as executrix, does not affect their validity. It is her duty to collect them and account for the proceeds as assets of the estate of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">3. The release does not bar or \"discharge notes which came into existence as part of the transaction of giving the release, which were given as a part, of the consideration for it, and which first took effect, to create a liability, at the instant when the release took effect. The release operated only on liabilities which were in existence when it was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
