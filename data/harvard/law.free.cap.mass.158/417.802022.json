At the trial in the Superior Court, before Bond, J., there was evidence tending to show that the defendant, as constable, attached a horse on a writ against Patrick O\u2019Connor as his property. The plaintiff introduced in evidence a bill of sale of the horse to him from O\u2019Connor, who was his brother in law. On direct examination the plaintiff was asked, <em>\u201c </em>At any time did your brother in law get any money from you, and under what circumstances ? \u201d The defendant objected to the admission of this evidence, but the presiding judge overruled the objection, and admitted the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-11\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b437-12\"><em>J.
