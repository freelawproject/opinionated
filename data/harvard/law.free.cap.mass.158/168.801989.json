In the Superior Court, upon appeal, after a verdict of guilty, the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint, and in arrest of judgment. The motions were overruled; and the defendant appealed to this court. The material facts appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b188-10\"><em>J.

Sts. c. 154, \u00a7 25, in case of the absence of a justice of a police court, or at any time upon his request, a special justice may hold a session of the court, the fact being stated upon the record. The amended record in the present case shows that the court in all the different stages of the proceedings against the defendant was held by the special justice, in the absence and at the request of the justice. This was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">The defendant, however, moves to dismiss, and also in arrest of judgment, because these facts do not also appear in the complaint and warrant. The complaint was addressed \u201c To the Justice of the Police Court of Chelsea.\u201d There is nowhere any requirement that it should be otherwise addressed, and this form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>was sufficient and proper, even though a special justice was sitting at the time when it was actually laid before him. The warrant properly bore test of the justice of the court, as required by St. 1888, c. 415, amending Pub. Sts. c. 154, \u00a7 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The motions were properly overruled. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fay, </em>151 Mass. 380. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>155 Mass. 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\n<em>Order denying motions affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
