This sum is held in money by the plaintiff, as trustee, and it always has been money in his hands, except when temporarily lent by him on interest. The particular provisions of the will under which the money is held are as follows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>In article 9, after giving the rest and residue of his property and estate, real, personal, and mixed, to trustees, in trust to manage the same, and make and deliver all deeds proper to invest the purchasers with good titles, \u201c and using the proceeds of all such sales for the purpose hereinafter described,\u201d the will says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayb\">\u201c When my estate shall finally be disposed of by my said trustees, or the survivor of them, and all collections made that can be made, then my said trustees, or the survivor of them, shall dispose of the net proceeds in their hands by dividing the same among my heirs at law as provided for by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Payments on account of the first settlement I hereby authorize to be made to my wife, daughter, and son.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The question is whether the testator\u2019s widow is to be considered as one of his heirs at law, within the meaning of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">It might be suggested that these words should be construed to mean that real estate should go to those entitled by law to real estate, and personal estate to those entitled by law to personal estate. But it seems more reasonable to hold that only one set of persons was intended, as in <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>149 Mass. 368, and <em>Fabens </em>v. <em>Fabens, </em>141 Mass. 395. If this is so, although at present we are only asked as to the disposition of personal estate, we can hardly avoid considering the disposition of the proceeds of the real estate also.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">A devise of real and personal estate to heirs at law, especially when they are to take in their own right and not as substitutes for their ancestor, will ordinarily be held to mean those who would be entitled to succeed to real estate in case of intestacy. <em>Proctor </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>154 Mass. 45. But this construction will yield if the whole will shows a different intention. When it is contemplated that real estate shall be changed into money before going to the heirs at law, then those words are held to mean those entitled to succeed to personal estate in case of intestacy. <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Gleason, </em>152 Mass. 457. <em>White </em>v. <em>Stanfield, </em>146 Mass. 424. Such an intention is manifested in the present will.! The estate is to be turned into personal property, and the proceeds divided. Moreover, the provision that payments on account of the first settlement are authorized to be made to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>testator\u2019s wife, daughter, and son cannot be explained except by-assuming that the wife was to share as an heir at law with the daughter and son, as provided for by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This view is further confirmed by looking at the earlier parts of the will, in which the testator three times speaks of his \u201cbeloved wife,\u201d yet, if she is not to be included in the residuary bequest, she is cut off with a scanty allowance, much less than she would be entitled to by law.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b414-5\"><em>E.
