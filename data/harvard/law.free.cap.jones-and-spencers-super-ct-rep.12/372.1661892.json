It also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>averred the payment of the sum of $500, mentioned in the contract, and the sustaining of damages to the extent of $250, for examining the title, and of $500, for removing buildings, and preparing to take possession, which three several sums defendant prayed to counterclaim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-5\">On the trial it appeared that defendant was in possession, that the lot was a part of the Harlem common lands, and was conveyed by the Harlem common commissioners to Dudley Selden by deed recorded Lib. 194 of Conveyances, p. 44, and by Dudley Selden and wife to Isaac Adriance, by deed recorded in Lib. 291 of Conveyances, p. 594. It also appeared that Isaac Adriance had died, leaving a will by which he devised all his property real and personal to his wife, Margaret E. Adriance, which will was admitted to probate October 21,1862 ; and that Margaret E. Adriance, by deed dated August 1, 1871, and recorded in the Lib. 1175 of Conveyances, p. 672, for the consideration of $5,000, conveyed the lot in question to the defendant. There was no proof that Selden or Adriance ever went into actual possession of the lot; the evidence tended to show the contrary. There was conflict of evidence as to under whom and under what defendant entered and the manner of his entry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-6\">There was also evidence as to defects and irregularities in the levying of the taxes for which the premises were sold, in the proceedings for the sale, and in the compliance with the statutes requiring certain things to be done after the sale before the giving of a lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-7\">The cause was tried at special term without a jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-8\">The learned judge before whom it was tried, found, as matters of fact:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-9\">\u201cI.

That the said leases were irregular and defective, and that the requirements of the statute of 1843 were not complied with ; and that the proceedings taken to authorize the making of said leases on the part of the mayor, aldermen and commonalty were defective or irregular, in these respects, to wit: <em>As to the first lease. </em>1. That there is no certificate of the comptroller of the fact of the service of the notice of redemption, as required by \u00a7 24, art. 3, c. 230, <em>Laws </em>1843. 2. The notice of redemption, dated December 11,1849, signed by Gordon L. Ford, was unauthorized and invalid, and its service a nullity. 3. The taxes for payment of which the lot in this lease was sold were illegally assessed for the years in question, viz. : 1841 and 1842 and 1843. 4. No legal demand for the payment of the taxes for those years was or could be made. 5. The certificate of the assessors attached to the assessment roll and signed by them is not verified or sworn to (53 <em>Af. T. </em>49). 6. No certificate of the assessors is attached to the assessment roll for the years 1842 and 1843. As <em>to the second lease. </em>1. No order was taken by the comptroller for advertising the lands or tenements in said lease described, pursuant to \u00a7 1, art. 3, c. 230, <em>Laws of </em>1843. 2. There was no publication of the delivery of the assessment rolls to the tax commissioners three times in each week, in newspapers in New York, employed by the corporation of said city, during the years 1853 and 1854. 3. The notices served requiring payment of the taxes for the years 1853 and 1854, were defective in form and substance and service, viz.: (1) It was not served upon the person from whom the tax was due, nor with sufficient time. (2) It did not specify the amount of the tax, (3) Nor the percentage to accrue thereon. (4) Nor that payment should be made on or before January 1. 4. The redemption notice of February 18, 1862, as served by Phineas 0. Kingsland, was irregular in form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>and false in substance. (1) It does not state for what \u00a3 taxes and \u25a0 regular rents for Croton water \u2019 the premises were sold. (2) It does not state the name of the purchaser of the premises. (3) The notice recites that \u00a3 the' said premises have been conveyed to me,\u2019 and is signed \u00a3 Eliza C. Kip.\u2019 The conveyance was in fact to Wm. B. Peyton. (4) The notice recites that the premises were sold for taxes and Croton water rents upon the same, without stating for what year or years, and also recites the amount of the taxes and charges as $31.58, which is incorrect, as shown by the lease. 5. The sale for the year 1859 was irregular, and also the redemption notice. (1) Four lots were sold, of which one was illegal, as exempt from any sale. (2) Two of the lots were redeemed for $44.49, out of $88.98, for the four lots sold; the sale as to the other lot was canceled, leaving $22.24 against the lot in question. The redemption notice erroneously required payment of $31.58. 6. The demand of the forty-two per cent, upon $31.58 was unauthorized and invalid. <em>7. </em>The premises were in occupation, but there is no proof of service of redemption notice upon the occupant by a person residing in the city of Kew York. 8. There is no proof of proper service of said notice upon the last assessed owner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-5\">\u00a3 1 III. That the defendant did not enter into nor take possession of the premises in question, under the contract, but refused so to do when requested by the plaintiffs, and notwithstanding their offer of indemnity\"; that the delivery of the key of the building situated thereon was not intended to be, and was not accepted as, a delivery of possession of the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-6\">\u201cIV. That the defendant did take possession on or after July 15, 1871, under license and authority from Mrs. Margaret Adriance, the owner of the fee, and not otherwise, and that he afterwards acquired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>title to the said premises in fee <em>by </em>conveyance from her, dated August 1, 1871, \u2018Exhibit E.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-5\">\u201cV. That on or about April 1, 1871, the defendant paid to the plaintiffs the sum of $500 as part of the consideration of the said contract then executed.\u201d .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-6\">And found the following conclusions of law :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-7\">\u201cI. I find that the contract between the parties for the specific performance of which this action is brought, is an undertaking on the part of the plaintiffs to transfer something more than mere municipal corporation tax lease, defeasible under certain circumstanced by redemption or otherwise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-8\">\u201cI find that by the terms of the contract the plaintiffs were bound to grant, convey and assign to the defendant not only such indentures of lease, but with them an estate in land, viz.: \u2018 in all and singular the premises therein mentioned and described, and the buildings thereon, together with the appurtenances,\u2019 to be held by the defendant and his assigns, from May 1, 1871, for and during the residue of the term of years mentioned in said indentures.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-9\">\u201cII. I find that the contract being an executory agreement, for the sale of an estate in land, is not within the prohibitions of the Revised Statutes with respect to the implication of covenants in conveyances of real estate (1 <em>B. S. </em>738, \u00a7 140).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-10\">\u201c III. I find therefore that a covenant, that the vendors had a good title not only to the instruments purporting to be the leases, but to the premises therein described, for and during the residue of the term purporting to be granted thereby, is accordingly to be implied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-11\">\u201cIV. I also find that in the case of municipal corporation leases where the contract provides for an assignment not merely of the instruments as such, but of the estate and term thereby purporting to be granted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>there is also to be implied a covenant that the corporation had the right and power to grant the estate and term, in manner and form as therein expressed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-5\">\u201cV. I find that under the construction of the said contract as above found, the burden of proof was upon the plaintiffs, to show the regularity and validity of the instruments by the tender of which they claim to have sufficiently established performance of or readiness to perform the contract on their part.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-6\"><em>\u201c </em>VI. I find that the said leases being defective and irregular, as found in the second finding of fact above stated, were void, and conferred upon the lessees and their assigns no estate, title or interest whatsoever in the premises thereby purporting to be demised, and that there was a failure of the consideration of the said contract of April 1, 1871.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-7\">\u20181VII. I find that the defendant is entitled to recover back the $500 paid by him on account of said contract with interest from the date of payment, and that he should have judgment therefor, and for dismissal of the complaint upon the merits with costs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-8\">Judgment was entered for defendant accordingly, and plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b400-9\"><em>Man &amp; </em>Parsons, attorneys, and <em>John E. </em>Parsons, of counsel, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Azk\">I. The contract implied no covenant that the title of the plaintiffs to the lot was good for the demised term. It was error for the special term to hold the reverse of this. 1. That in an agreement to convey tax leases there is no implied covenant of title to the premises, was expressly decided by the court of appeals, in Boyd v. Schlesinger, 59 <em>N. Y. </em>301; Bensel <em>v. </em>Gray, 62 <em>Id. </em>632 ; where, in deciding this very case, the court of appeals affirmed Boyd <em>v. </em>Schlesinger as authority, and as requiring the reversal of the decision of the general term.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-10\">II. The contract was not, as found by Judge Sar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>ford in his opinion, a contract by the terms of which the plaintiffs were bound to grant to the defendant an estate in the lot for the residue of the term of years mentioned in the leases. 1. The contract is written into a printed blank for the assignment of a lease. By it the plaintiffs agreed to <em>transfer </em>to Gray the two leases, describing them, and that is all (fol. 44). The contract then goes on to specify the conditions of the assignment; that Gray was to pay $7,000, &amp;c., &amp;c. After that follow the printed words which would be applicable to an actual assignment, but they have no application to the agreement to assign. The words expressing the agreement to assign, &amp;c., relate to the leases alone. The contract cannot be read in any such way as to make them apply to the lot.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-5\">ITT. It was error for Judge Sanford to find that Mrs. Adriance was the owner of the fee of the lot, and that Gray acquired title in fee by her conveyance, and that it was under her that he took possession. 1. The lot in question was alleged to form a part of what was formerly known as Harlem commons, in the twelfth ward, of the city of Hew York (fol. 350). It was one of the lots described in a deed from Dudley Selden and wife, to Isaac Adriance, dated April 23, 1832, and recorded February 8, 1833, in the office of register of the city and county of Hew York, in liber 291 of Conveyances, p. 594. Heither Dudley Selden nor the Adriances were ever in possession. It was a wild lot (fol. 453), and there was no possession of it until under one of the tax leases Mrs. Kip took possession, erected buildings, &amp;c. At that time the lot was only worth $300 to $350 (fol. 450). Title to real estate must originate in actual possession (Smith <em>v. </em>Lorillard, 10 <em>Johns. </em>338). Heither the Adriances nor Gray as Mrs. Adriance\u2019s grantee would maintain an action of ejectment upon the evidence in the case. It is probably impossible for any body to make out a legal Harlem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>commons title. However this may be, it was not made out in Mrs. Adriance. It is to be observed that the Dudley Selden deed to Isaac Adriance, which conveys a very large number of lots, expresses only a nominal consideration. Isaac Adriance never paid taxes or assessments, and neither he or his family made any claim to the lot until Gray put himself in communication with them (fols. 392-400), he doubtless using the tax leases for which he was to pay <em>$7,000 </em>as-an argument by which to obtain the claimed title in fee for $5,000. 2. Gray could not, therefore, enter under Mrs. Adriance. She had no title: she was not in. possession, and could not give possession to him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-6\">IV. Gray did take possession of the lot under the contract in question. Judge Satteord was in error in finding the reverse of this. 1. Upon precisely the same testimony, so far as concerns this point, Judge Freedmatt, on the first trial, found that Gray did enter under this contract, and that, for the purpose of depriving the plaintiffs of their possession and improvements without payment, he held on to 'possession until he procured the Adriance deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-7\">Y. Gray having put himself in possession under the contract, was estopped from disputing the plaintiff\u2019s title. By taking possession he put plaintiffs at this disadvantage, that it was necessary for them, if they sued in ejectment, to succeed upon the strength \" of their title. This advantage he gained from them under their agreement with him, and it effectually precluded him from disputing the title under which he entered (Jackson <em>v. </em>Stewart, 6 <em>Johns. </em>34 ; Jackson <em>v. </em>De Walts, 7 <em>Id. </em>157; Bk. of Utica <em>v. </em>Mesereau, <em>3 Barb. Ch. </em>528; Jackson <em>v. </em>Hotchkiss, 6 <em>Cow. </em>401; Jackson <em>v. </em>Walker, 7 <em>Id. </em>637, and numerous other cases, laying down the rules in ejectment).</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-8\">YI. By his deed from the Adriances, according to \u2022 the finding .of Judge Satteord that it conveyed a title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>In fee, Gray has himself cured all difficulties in the leases. 1. That deed merged the plaintiff\u2019s title, under which Gray entered (4 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. </em>99-101 ; 3 <em>Greenl. Cr. </em>467; Roberts <em>v. </em>Jackson, 1 <em>Wend. </em>478; James <em>v. </em>Morey, 2 <em>Cow. </em>246, 248, 300 ; Clift <em>v. </em>White, 12 <em>N. Y. </em>519). 2. A purchaser who has entered cannot defeat specific performance by reason of alleged defects which he has cured (Smedberg <em>v. </em>Moore, 26 <em>Wend. </em>238). 3. And so Gray\u2019s deed put it out of the power of the plaintiff to obtain a title which would cure the alleged defects, and one cannot defend against the performance of a contract on the ground of impossibility which he himself has created <em>(Chitty on Con</em>tracts, 636, and cases cited ; Fleming v. Gilbert, 3 <em>Johns. </em>528, 534; Betts <em>v. </em>Perine, 14 <em>Wend. </em>219; Young <em>v. </em>Hunter, 6 <em>N. Y. </em>203). 4. As Gray took possession without waiting for an actual assignment of the leases, the plaintiffs had until the trial of their action to make their title complete (Brown <em>v. </em>Half, 5 Paige, 235; Reformed Dutch Church <em>v. </em>Mott, 7 <em>Id. </em>77; Vielle <em>v. </em>Troy &amp; B.

Such arrangement he finally succeeded in making and then he took visible possession. But in view of the intimations given by the court of appeals, on defendants\u2019 appeal, to the effect, that possession under a tax lease cannot become adverse to the right of the real owner, the conduct of the defendant becomes immaterial, if the contract was as found below. Indeed, if this rule is to govern the case, it is difficult to see. how the plaintiffs can have any relief whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Under the changed issues of the case the learned judge below was correct in holding that the contract called for a conveyance of a leasehold interest in the land, and not merely for a conveyance of the paper title.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">This being so and the tax-leases being clearly invalid, if plaintiffs could ground no rights upon adverse possession, the defendant was legally justified in doing as he did, however wrong his conduct towards the plaintiffs may have been from a moral point of view.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">\u2022 The case is one involving great hardship to the estate of which the plaintiffs are executors, but in view of the intimations given by the court of appeals by way of admonition, we cannot see how this court can help them.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">The judgment must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">Speie, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Note. This is the decision on the appeal from a judgment entered on a second trial of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-15\">On the first trial plaintiffs recovered judgment, the court resting its decision on the proposition (as controlling the decision of the case) that there was no warranty to be implied in an agreement to assign a tax lease by a municipal corporation, and consequently refusing to pass on the evidence adduced as to the invalidity of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-16\">On appeal by defendant, the general term held that a warranty was implied, and that the refusal of the court below was error, it also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>held that the fact that the defendant went into possession, under the contract, did not deprive him of the right to acquire it in fee, and to contest the tax title. The judgment below was reversed, and a new trial ordered (38 N. <em>Y. Superior </em>Court, 447).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Plaintiffs <em>stipulated </em>and appealed to the court of appeals. That court (62 <em>N. Y. </em>632) held, in conformity with its previous decision in Boyd <em>v. </em>Schlesinger, 59 N. <em>Y. </em>301 (then still in MSS.), that in an agreement to assign a corporation tax lease there was not an implied warranty of title to a leasehold interest, and that consequently the general term decision could not be sustained on the basis on which it was placed. It, however, held that in either of two aspects (which were not presented to or passed on by either the special or general term, and need not have been, under the views which controlled the decision there) it was necessary to pass on the evidence given as to the validity of the leases. (1) If the agreement undertook to assign, not only the leases as merely instruments in writing, but also to transfer the right in the premises for the term in the leases named, it was necessary that the force of that testimony should be passed on. (3) It was equally necessary, even if the agreement did not so undertake, but only to assign the -writing, and thereby agreed to transfer nothing valuable, and so left the contract of the defendant without consideration to support it. It, however, declined to construe the contract, because, if it was construed favorably to the defendant, it might involve the necessity of determining the question of fact as to the validity of the leases, and if the determination was against the validity it would lead to a reversal of a judgment of the special term on a question of fact as to which that court had made no finding, which would be contrary to the established rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The court also declined to reverse the judgment of the general term and affirm that of the special term, on the ground that the former was wrong and the latter right on the question of implied warranty, and that the positions taken by the defendant in that court were not in the way of its so doing, inasmuch as they were not pleaded by his answer, nor taken in the court below, because fliere were exceptions taken on the trial by the defendant, which were not considered by the general term, and which might have been presented in his favor if that court had thought it necessary to have noticed them, and which the defendant had a right to urge on the plaintiff\u2019s appeal. (Simon v. Canaday, 53 <em>N. Y. </em>298).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">But for various reasons, among them the fact that the objections to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>evidence taken by the defendant did not enter into a consideration of the case by the general term, the court concluded to exercise a power which it had frequently in analogous cases felt called on to exercise, and permit the appellants to take a <em>dismissal of their appeal and proceed to a new Prial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-19\">The court referred to previous decisions made by it as'to the effect of municipal tax leases as clouds on titles, as to bills <em>guia timet, </em>and as to its not being possible that possession under a tax lease could become adverse to the right of the real owner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
