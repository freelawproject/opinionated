The house was for years the summer residence of the plaintiff and his family, from about' the middle of May to the middle of November. November 20, 1876, the plaintiff and his family came to this city, leaving the dwelling-house and other property mentioned in the policy, in charge of his farmer, who, with his family, resided in the frame dwelling mentioned in the policy, and who were permitted to live in the main dwelling-house if they had not sufficient room in their own. The plaintiff left in the house all his furniture, cooking-utensils, piano, beds, mattresses, and the summer clothing of himself and family.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-11\">The premises remained in the charge of the farmer and his family until the fire.

They used, watched and guarded it and the other buildings and property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-12\">After plaintiff moved to the city, he and Ms wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>visited the dwelling-house in question every two weeks, remained in it during the day, examined the property, and lunched there; and were last there three days before the fire, with painters, going through the house with, and directing them as to painting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-5\">Plaintiff intended to return with his family to the premises in question as their summer residence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"APh\">Upon the trial, the defendant waived the defense of plaintiff\u2019s refusal to arbitrate, and made no question as to the amount of the loss, or the service, or sufficiency, of the proofs of loss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-7\">A fire occurred April 8, 1877, destroying portions of the insured property, and caused a loss to the plaintiff of over $12,000.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b464-8\"><em>George N.

As to occupancy: Whitney <em>v. </em>Black River Ins. Co., 9 <em>Hun, </em>41; Paine v. Agricultural Ins. Co., 5 <em>Thomp. &amp; Cooke, </em>619 ; Wustum <em>v. </em>City Fire Ins.

Co., 112 <em>Mass. </em>423; \u00c6tna Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Burns, 5 <em>Ins. Law Journal, </em>69. As to vacancy : In American Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Padfield, 78 <em>Ill. </em>167, the policy contained the provision that \u201cIf the house should become vacant and unoccupied, policy should be void.\u201d The tenant had left, but some furniture remained. The court <em>held, </em>that a fair and reasonable construction of the language, vacant and unoccupied, was, that the house should not be without an' occupant\u2014without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>any one living in it. That the words were not used in a technical but in a popular sense; and in conclusion <em>held, </em>that the house became vacant and unoccupied within the meaning of the policy (North Am. Ins. Co. v. Zaenger, 63 <em>Ill. </em>464). In Sleeper v. New Hampshire Fire Ins. Co., 56 N. <em>H. </em>401, the policy provided that it should be void if the premises should become vacant by the removal of the owner or occupant without immediate notice. The occupant removed to another town with his family and part of his furniture, without notice to the owner or the company, intending to return in eight months, or earlier, if business warranted. Fire occurred in four months. <em>Held, </em>that the premises were vacated within the meaning of the policy and policy void\u2014and overrules the case in 55 <em>N. H. </em>249. To same effect is Thayer v. Agricultural Ins. Co., 5 Hun, 566.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-5\">II. It was argued by plaintiff\u2019s counsel on the trial that inasmuch as defendant insured a dwelling for plaintiff in the city as well as this dwelling in the country, defendant\u2019s officers must have known that plaintiff occupied one place in winter and the other in the summer, and alternately left each unoccupied during his occupancy of the other, and hence defendant was estopped from invoking this clause in defense of this action. As to this: The agreement in the policy has repeatedly and uniformly been held to be a promissory warranty, which must be strictly kept; and not like a condition of insurance, the observance or performance of which might be waived by knowledge and acquiescence <em>(Wood on Ins. </em>\u00a7 165, 317, and cases cited ; see also <em>Id. </em>341, where warranty is concisely stated ; Mead v. North Western Ins. Co., 3 <em>Seld. </em>530 ; see also Ripley v. \u00c6tna Ins. Co., 30 N. <em>Y. </em>136; Bilbrough v. Metropolis Ins. Co., 5 <em>Duer, </em>587; <em>Wood on Ins. </em>330, and cases cited; Lee v. Howard Ins. Co., 3 Gray, 588; Murdock v. Chenango Co. Ins. Co., 2 Comst. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>210; Wood <em>v. </em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 13 <em>Conn. </em>533 ; Chase <em>v. </em>Hamilton Ins. Co., 20 <em>N. Y. </em>52; Gilbert v. Ph\u0153nix Ins. Co., 36 <em>Id. </em>372 ; Alexander <em>v. </em>Germania Ins. Co., 66 <em>Id. </em>464 ; 3 Allen, 569 ; 8 Cushing, 127 ; 10 <em>Barb. </em>285 ; 7 <em>N. Y. </em>370 ; Blumer <em>v. </em>Phenix Ins. Co., 7 <em>Ins. Law </em>Journal, 833, July, 1878 Poor <em>v. </em>Humboldt Ins. Co., <em>Id. </em>874, March, 1878; \u00c6tna Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Burnes, 5 <em>Id. </em>69, <em>supra). </em>The cases that plaintiff relied upon to the effect that knowledge on the part of the underwriter of the breach of a warranty operates to relieve from the breach, will be found to be based upon the principle of estoppel; and to decide simply that where the underwriter, with a knowledge of the breach, does some act recognizing and affirming the validity of the policy, he shall not be heard to question it after-wards.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-5\">III. Another suggestion made in behalf of plaintiff on the trial was that all of the buildings on the farm were comprised in the word \u201cpremises\u201d used in the policy; and that as all of them were not vacant and unoccupied, the warranty was not broken. 1. A reference to the policy will exhibit the fallacy of the proposition. The different buildings and properties were separately insured, as much so as if separate policies had been issued upon each risk. In Associated Firemen\u2019s Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Assum, 5 <em>Md. </em>165, the policy was for $1,000\u2014say $700 on books and $300 on music, &amp;c.; and the policy contained a clause that if the assured should thereafter make other insurance on the assured premises, the policy should be void, unless notice was given. <em>Held, </em>that the proper construction of the policy was that if any part of the goods embraced in the policy were afterwards insured in another office without notice, the policy became void. To the same effect is Smith <em>v. </em>Empire Ins. Co., 25 <em>Barb. </em>497 ; Whitwell <em>v. </em>Putnam Fire Ins. Co., 6 <em>Lans. </em>166; also Ill. Mu. Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Fix, 53 <em>Ill. </em>151.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>IY. Finally it was claimed on the trial that because the words \u201cvacant and unoccupied\u201d were connected by a copulative conjunction, they must have a different signification; but counsel failed to show which word had a more extended or different meaning than the other, or which word saved plaintiff from the application of the evidence in this case. 1. But contracts as well as pleadings often contain synonymous terms connected indiscriminately ; as in this instance, by copulative or disjunctive conjunctions, without in any sense changing the signification (Hill <em>v. </em>Equitable Mu. Fire Ins. Co., 6 <em>Ins. L. J. </em>314). <em>(a) </em>Thus we say without \u201clet or hindrance,\u201d when the meaning of the words used in that connection are the same. In the last and best dictionary of English synonyms, by Richard Soule, one of the synonyms of \u201clet\u201d is \u201chindrance.\u201d (6) An instrument of assignment says, \u201cassign and transfer, and make over,\u201d when the words are clearly synonymous (See same author, which gives as one of the synonyms of \u201cassign\u201d the wmrd \u201ctransfer;\u201d another is \u201cmake over ;\u201d so one synonym of \u201ctransfer \u201d is to \u201c make over,\u201d &amp;c.). (c) So in the old action of trespass <em>quare clausum </em>fregit, defendant pleads that a fence was in great decay for want of \u201c needful and necessary \u201d repairs, &amp;c., when one synonym of needful\u201d is \u201cnecessary,\u201d and one synonym of \u201cnecessary\u201d is \u201cneedful.\u201d 2. But a complete answer to the point is that the same author treats the very words in question as synonyms. The word \u201c vacant \u201d has for its synonym the word \u201cunoccupied.\u201d And Burrill in his law dictionary gives the legal meaning of the word \u201cvacant\u201d as \u201cunfilled, unoccupied, without a claimant, tenant or occupier.\u201d This ought to dispose of the suggestion. 3. The only case cited in support of the proposition of plaintiff was an unreported one from the general term of supreme court in this district, viz.: Woodruff <em>v. </em>Imperial Ins. Co., which does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>mot pass upon the question, but merely says that as plaintiff was surprised by an inadv\u00e9rtent answer of a witness about the house being unoccupied, the court below properly exercised its discretion in setting aside a nonsuit, and allowing the whole evidence on that subject to come in; and the question whether there was a distinction to be made between that case, where the words \u201c vacant and unoccupied\u201d were used, and the cases cited on that argument in which the word \u201cunoccupied\u201d only was used, was not passed on. 4. But it will be noticed that neither of the cases in which that question was presented, viz. : Whitney <em>v. </em>Black River Ins. Co., American Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Padfield, North American Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Zaenger, <em>Wood on Insurance, </em>supra, were cited to that court; so that it appeared to the court, as intimated in the opinion, that that was a question which had not been passed upon judicially.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b468-5\">if. <em>B. Hoxie, </em>attorney, and of counsel, for respondent, argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AT0\">The policy is to be construed in the light of the knowledge by the defendant of the character and use of the premises. It is legally chargeable with such knowledge, and if so it -is estopped to claim that the clause in question is applicable to such a cessation or suspension of occupancy as occurred here, for -such was clearly contemplated (Whitney <em>v. </em>Black River Ins. Co. 9 <em>Hun, </em>37 [affi\u2019d in Ct. of Appeals, Feb. 14, 1878] ; Cone <em>v. </em>Niagara Ins. Co., 60 N. <em>Y. </em>619; Pitney v. Glens Falls Ins. Co., <em>65 Id. </em>6). The premises were not vacant and unoccupied, because they were in the charge of and occupied by the farmer and his family from the time plaintiff and his family left until the fire-\u2014the dwelling-house in question as much so as the farmer\u2019s own dwelling, the barns, &amp;c., &amp;c. \u2022In this case the premises or the dwelling-house alone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>would be considered as vacant and unoccupied only if the same were abandoned as a residence or a dwelling-house, and left without any human being to use, watch and care for it, and preserve it in condition fit and necessary for use as a dwelling. A dwelling-house is not vacant and unoccupied within the meaning of this policy, where, as in this case, the household furniture, wearing apparel, &amp;c., remain in it, the house and furniture in charge of, and receiving the constant visits, care and scrutiny of members of the establishment (the farmer and his family), periodical visits and occupation by the owner and his wife, although the family of the owner are absent, but with intention to return and resume continuous dwelling therein, be the period of such contemplated absence long or short (Whitney <em>v. </em>Black River Ins. Co., <em>supra </em>; O\u2019Brien <em>v. </em>Comm. Ins. Co., 6 <em>J. &amp; S. </em>517; Cummins <em>v. </em>Agricult. Ins. Co., 67 <em>N. Y. </em>260 ; Shearman v. Niagara Ins. Co., 46 <em>Id. </em>526 ; Gibbs <em>v. </em>Continental Ins. Co., 13 <em>Hun, </em>611, 620). The use of the copulative conjunction in the clause in question \u201cvacant and unoccupied,\u201d contemplates an abandonment of the premises; certainly something more than a temporary cessation of eating and sleeping, <em>i. </em>e., dwelling in the house. If the dwelling house was \u201c unoccupied \u201d it was not \u201cvacant.\u201d The household furniture, wearing apparel, &amp;c., all remained, and under the constant supervision of the farmer and his family. In the case of Woodruff <em>'o. </em>Imperial Ins. Co., Supreme Court, General Term, First Department, May, 1877 (not reported), this precise question was considered, and determined in accordance with above views. The object of the use of the word \u201c vacant \u201d, seems to have been to prevent the mere fact that the premises might become unoccupied, from itself rendering the policy void. For that purpose they were required to be vacant as well as unoccupied, and that sufficiently distinguishes this from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>the cases cited on behalf of the defendants to prevent them from controlling its present disposition.. They were decided upon the effect required to be given to the clause relating alone to the fact of occupation (Keith <em>v. </em>Quincy Mut. Ins. Co., 10 Allen, 228; Wustrum <em>v. </em>City Fire Ins. Co., 15 <em>Wis. </em>138 ; Ashworth <em>v. </em>Builders\u2019 Ins. Co., 112 <em>Mass. </em>422, 424; Paine <em>v. </em>Agricult. Ins. Co., 5 <em>N. Y. S. C. </em>[T. <em>&amp; C.] </em>619), and in no way considered the effect that should be given to the phrase made use of in the policy issued to the plaintiff.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b470-5\">By the Court.\u2014Curtis, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aat\">The principal question discussed and. presented at the argument was whether the policy was annulled by a violation of the condition contained in these words \u201cif the premises shall become vacant and unoccupied, except as herein specially provided for, or hereafter agreed to by this corporation in writing upon this policy, from thenceforth this policy shall be void, and of no force or effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">It is apparent that for the breach of this provision of the policy two separate facts, vacancy and absence of occupancy of the premises insured, must occur, and that, too, jointly, so as to be in existence at the same time. This is what the language of the policy calls for. It is urged by the defendants that these words were not used in the policy in a technical but a popular sense. Happily for the protection of real estate, the words expressing the relations and rights of individuals and the public towards it have existed from a very remote period, and during that interval been interpreted by the courts as always possessing the same meaning. Very little has been conceded to what may . be their use in a popular sense, but it has been deemed that private rights and property were best protected by construing them strictly.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The word vacant is not the synonym of \u201cun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>occupied.\u201d Vacant means primarily, empty,, void of every substance except air ( <em>Webster\u2019s Dictionary), </em>and unoccupied is that status where no one has the actual use or possession of the thing or property in question. This distinction originates and exists in the language from which the terms descend to us (Redfield <em>v. </em>Utica, &amp;c. R. R. Co., 25 <em>Barb. </em>58; People <em>v. </em>Ambrecht, 11 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>101; National Fire Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>McKay, 5 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S. </em>449).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Although there may be sound reasons for holding that the plaintiff, in the legal sense, and according to which the agreement should be construed, had not ceased to occupy the dwelling-house, yet it is not necessary to rest the decision on this view of it. The language of the policy calls for the dwelling being left both vacant' and unoccupied before the policy will thereby become void. It cannot be, that either in the legal construction or popular sense claimed as the proper definition of the term \u201c vacant,\u201d that this dwelling-house, in charge of plaintiff\u2019s servants, with all its furniture, cooking utensils, piano, beds, mattresses, and summer clothing belonging to the plaintiff and his family remaining there, was left vacant or empty (Woodruff <em>v. </em>Imperial Ins. Co., First Department, General Term, not reported ; Cummins <em>v. </em>Agricultural Ins. Co., 67 N. <em>Y. </em>263; O\u2019Brien <em>v. </em>Commercial Fire Ins. Co., 6 <em>J. &amp; S. </em>517 ; reversed, but not on this point, 63 N. <em>Y. </em>108).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The court properly excluded the evidence offered, to show that the defendant\u2019s risk was increased, by the alleged vacancy and non-occupancy of the premises, as such v\u00e1cancy and unoccupancy of the premises did not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Sedgwick and Freedman, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
