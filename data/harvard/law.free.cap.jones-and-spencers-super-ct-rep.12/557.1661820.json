In order <em>to </em>bring up the case for review upon the facts there must be an appeal from the order denying the motion for a new trial.. The mere denial of a motion made upon the judge\u2019s minutes presents no question of fact for review upon appeal from the judgment. The appeal should be from an order denying such motion, and exception taken thereto, if the facts are to be reviewed (Matthews <em>v. </em>Mayburg, 63 <em>N. 7. </em>656). On the other hand, if it be claimed that the order denying such motion is an intermediate ord\u00e9r involving the merits and affecting the judgment, the New Code requires that, before it can be reviewed upon an appeal from the judgment, it must be specified in the notice of appeal (\u00a7\u00a7 1301, 1316). Questions of law, therefore, only are to be considered.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b576-5\">Defendant offered to show that the plaintiffs had recovered in another action a verdict, including a demand of <em>some </em>of the property named in this action. The offer was not for a recovery of the <em>some </em>property. There was no offer to show that satisfaction had been obtained on the judgment, or that plaintiffs had made their election by suing out <em>execution,\u2014Held, </em>inadmissible (Osterhout a.
