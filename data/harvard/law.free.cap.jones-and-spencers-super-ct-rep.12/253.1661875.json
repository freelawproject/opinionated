A contract in writing may be varied by parol, the original contract furnishing sufficient consideration for the modification (38 <em>N. Y. </em>225, 227, Hunt, Ch. J.; 20 <em>Barb. </em>42). Original contract in writing, modified by parol afterward. \u201cHeld also it was competent for the parties by a subsequent parol <em>contract, to </em>extend the time for the performance of the original agreement, and this without any new consideration.\u201d The time for performance in this last case was enlarged by parol, and held well (20 <em>Barb. </em>64. See 5 <em>Cow. </em>506; 8 <em>Johns. </em>528; 1 <em>Barb. </em>327 ; 15 Johns. 200 ; 7 <em>Cow. </em>48, 50 ; 12 <em>Barb. </em>366). The case in 38 <em>N.

See also Van Allen <em>v. </em>Jones, 10 <em>Bosw. </em>369; Coe <em>v. </em>Harly, <em>Daily Register, </em>March 4, 1878, Ct. of App.).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b272-6\">By the Court.\u2014Speir, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aj7\">The action was brought to recover a balance of $764.88 due to the plaintiff for rent on a lease dated October 19, 1874. By the terms of the lease the defendant was to pay the sum of $1,550 per annum, payable monthly in advance, for two years and six months from November 1, 1874.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">The defendant gave evidence tending to show that when the lease was running, and after the January term of 1876 had commenced, the plaintiff agreed to accept $100 per month thereafter, and that defendant paid such sum until June, 1876, when plaintiff agreed to accept for the balance of said term $80 per month rent until the end of the term, and that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>directed a man who boarded with him to pay plaintiff that amount, which he did pay until the termination of the lease. The court ordered a verdict for the plaintiff\u2014for the reason that the agreement claimed by the defendant was without consideration and void. This is too plain for discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The judgment must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Freedman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
