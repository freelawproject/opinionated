The suit and proceeding were settled between the parties. The terms were that Charles F. Weber should give to Mary A. L. Weber 'the promissory notes in question, and Mary A. L. Weber should assign all claim to the estate of Albert Weber, deceased, her husband, to Margaret Weber, wife of Charles F. Weber, and discontinue the above mentioned suits, and stipulate that she would bring no other for the same cause of action or any part thereof, or for any goods, chattels, money, or credit claimed to have been taken by the defendant therein, and that she should surrender to Charles F.

To justify the direction of verdict in favor of either party the evidence must hot only be undisputed, but there must be no evidence in the case which would warrant a jury in drawing contrary inferences. If there are any inferences to be drawn, the case must be left to the jury. \u201cThe evidence tended to maintain the issue which the jury were to try; whether weak or strong, it was their right to pass upon it\u201d (Hickman v. Jones, 9 <em>Wall. </em>201; Barney v. Schmeider, <em>Id.). </em>\u201cNor is it always enough that the evidence be undisputed, if it be of a circumstantial character, for then there is often a conclusion to be drawn by the jury\u201d (Rich v. Rich, 17 Wen.676). When a question of fraud arises on the trial, the court cannot withhold such question from the jury (Upton v. Bedlow, 42 <em>How. </em>121). It was for them (the jury) to draw inferences from the conduct of the parties, and upon an examination of all the facts to declare what that conduct was designed to express (Lockwood v. Thorn, 18 <em>N. Y. </em>291).</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>II. The answer denies that there was any consideration whatsoever paid for the notes. The notes were given in compromise of a suit in the superior court and surrogate\u2019s proceedings ; the court declined to try the question whether or not these claims were <em>tona fide </em>or not, and excluded nearly all the evidence offered to show the claims to be totally unfounded. Upon all the authorities this was clearly error. If the estate of Albert Weber had no claim against his father, Charles F. Weber, then a bringing of a suit did not make it any better; it made it worse, being in the nature of a blackmail claim, and its discontinuance would not be any consideration ; as plaintiff, by discontinuing a suit without any foundation, got rid of the certainty of paying costs. This point was directly raised and decided by Ti\u00edtdal, C. J., and Cress well, J., in Wade <em>v. </em>Simeon (3 <em>D. &amp; L. </em>596), where the declaration stated that the sums sued for had been promised by defendant during the pendency of a former suit, and in consideration of its being discontinued, which was done. The defense was that the plaintiff never had any cause of action, and that he knew it. To which defense plaintiff demurred. The demurrer was sustained (See also Cook <em>v. </em>Wright, 1 <em>B. &amp; S. </em>539, 570 ; Tooley <em>v. </em>Windham, <em>Cro. Eliz. </em>206). Longridge <em>v. </em>Danville (5 <em>Barn. &amp; Ald. </em>122), suit on compromise of claim for damages against the owners of the ship Carolina. \u201cBayley, J. If it had appeared in this case that the owners of the Carolina' could not have been liable at all, I agree that the consideration for the promise would have failed.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b276-5\"><em>J'.

The notes in this action, having been given in settlement of former actions, are founded on good consideration, and the court will not look behind the compromise,\u2014it is not competent to show that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>first suit could not have been maintained (Bronson, J., Stewart <em>v. </em>Ahrenfeldt, 4 <em>Denio, </em>189; Farmers\u2019 Bank of Amsterdam <em>v. </em>Blair, 44 <em>Barb. </em>641; Russell <em>v. </em>Cook, 3 <em>Hill, </em>504 ; Seaman <em>v. </em>Seaman, 12 <em>Wend. </em>381).</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-5\">II. The notes in suit given by defendant\u2019s testator to Mary A. L. Weber, and the consent given by Mary to discontinue the actions brought by her against said Charles F. Weber, and the assignment by Mary to defendant of her interest in the estate of Albert, and the general release to Charles F. Weber, each was the consideration for the other, and constitute a written agreement. The defendant is estopped from avoiding said agreement, or the payment of said notes, without having restored or having offered to restore to plaintiff\u2019s assignor or plaintiff whatever the defendant or her testator received for said notes (Ely <em>v. </em>Kilburn, 5 <em>Den. </em>514; 2 <em>Abb. Dig. </em>270, \u00a7 1395 ; Mumford <em>v. </em>Am. Life Ins. Co., 4 <em>N. Y. </em>482, 483; Hogan <em>v. </em>Weyer, 5 <em>Hill, </em>389 ; 5 <em>Barb. </em>319 ; 13 <em>Id. </em>641; 2 <em>Story Eq. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 693, 694 ; <em>Willard's Equity </em>(Potter\u2019s ed.) 303).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b277-6\">By the Court.\u2014Speir, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Am3\">The main defense interposed on the trial was that the notes were given and executed without any consideration. It appears that a suit was pending in this court, brought by Mary A. L. Weber, executrix of Albert Weber, deceased, against Charles F. Weber, the maker of the, notes, for the recovery of certain goods, chattels and money supposed to belong to the estate of Albert Weber, deceased. That at the same time, certain proceedings were pending in the surrogate\u2019s court in the matter of the estate of Albert Weber, deceased, in which she as executrix and legatee claimed as owner all the estate and assets belonging to him in his lifetime. These proceedings in the surrogate\u2019s court and the suit in the superior court were compromised and discontinued on September 2, and the notes in suit are of the same date and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>were given in consideration of the settlement of the suit and the proceedings in the two courts. The defendant\u2019s counsel furnished the. evidence on the trial of the discontinuance and settlement in both cases; He then offered to show that Mary A. L, Weber, executrix, &amp;c., had no legal cause of action against Charles F. Weber, the defendant in said suit or proceedings.. The learned judge, very properly, we think, declined to try that issue. The settlement and compromise rested upon a good consideration. The counsel did not offer proof of any fraudulent concealment of material facts,, which were not within the knowledge of his client, who made the notes ; he was not therefore in a position to defeat a recovery-upon his promise to pay them. The defendant having himself furnished the evidence of settlement and compromise was estopped from setting up that the proceedings in the courts had no foundation in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The claim that Charles F. Weber was under duress at the time he executed the notes and delivered them to Mary A. <em>L. </em>Weber, was clearly shown to be destitute of any foundation by defendant\u2019s own- witness. Further notice of the point is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The judgment must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Freedman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
