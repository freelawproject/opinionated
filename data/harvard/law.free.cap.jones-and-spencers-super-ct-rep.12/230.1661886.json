The evidence at the trial justifies the theory that the defendants dealt with Dayton &amp; Co. as principals; that the latter were permitted by the plaintiffs, either designedly or through their negligence, to sell the sugar in question as their own and to collect the price from the defendants; and that the defendants, having paid Dayton &amp; Co. for the sugar, discharged their liability therefor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-6\">II. The expression in the sale note, \u2018 \u2018 collect at our office,\u201d can only be interpreted to mean that the price of the sugar should be collected by Dayton &amp; Co. at their office in \u00a1New York, and not by the plaintiffs in Philadelphia. It is analogous to the case of a note payable at bank. The plaintiffs themselves so interpreted it. It is also manifest from the tenor of Mr. Frazier\u2019s testimony, and of the plaintiffs\u2019 letters to Dayton &amp; Co., that they never expected to collect the moneys due for their sugar, sold by Dayton &amp; Co., themselves.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-7\">III. The theory, upon which the plaintiffs apparently proceeded at the trial, that Dayton &amp; Co. were the agents solely of the defendants, was wholly unwarranted by the testimony.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-8\">IV. The defendants have paid for the sugar, not only in accordance with the contract of sale, but in compliance with the wishes and instructions of the plaintiffs expressed in the letter of June 9 ; and to require them to pay it again is repugnant alike to justice and to the law of the case. If any mistake has occurred, it is not the fault of the defendants, who performed their whole duty in the premises, but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>result of the plaintiffs\u2019 negligence in omitting to notify them in season not to pay Dayton &amp; Co.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b252-5\"><em>Mann </em>&lt;6 Parsons, attorneys, and <em>John E. </em>Parsons, of counsel; for respondents:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVH\">I. The sugar was sold by the plaintiffs to the defendants. Dayton &amp; Co. were employed by the defendants to purchase the sugar. They merely acted as brokers in the transaction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-6\">II. Before the defendants placed any funds in Dayton &amp; Co.\u2019s hands they knew that the plaintiffs were the sellers of the sugar. This is quite immaterial. They knew that somebody was the seller of the sugar ; that they were the purchasers ; and that they could only discharge themselves by payment. In point of fact, however, they did know that the sugars were purchased from the plaintiffs before sending any money to Dayton &amp; Co.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-7\">III. The remittances by the defendants to Dayton &amp; Co. were not intended to be on account of the plaintiffs\u2019 bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-8\">IV. The only question in the case is whether the provision of the contract, \u201c send invoice and bill of lading to our office, collect at our office,\u201d had the effect of making the plaintiffs chargeable for money received by Dayton &amp; Co. from the defendants. This cannot be successfully maintained. 1. The invoice referred to was the bill of the plaintiffs. According to the contract it was a bill against the defendants. The provision that it should be sent to Dayton &amp; Co.\u2019s office meant simply that the plaintiffs were to send there for payment of the bill. The bill of lading was to be sent there. That is, the sugar was to be delivered to the defendants at the office of Dayton &amp; Co. Sending the bill there did not constitute payment. 2. A person residing in Boston buys of Messrs. Tiffany &amp;\u2022 Co. a bill of jewelry, and directs his bill to be sent to his New York agent. Does that constitute payment of the bill? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Do Messrs. Tiffany &amp; Co. thereby accept the responsibility of the agent ? In such a case the agent does not even assume the responsibility of payment. Neither did Dayton <em>&amp; </em>Co. do so in this case. 3. And so, again, though the contract contains the expression, \u201c collect at our office,\u201d the deposit by the defendants of money there did not pay the bill. \u201c Collect \u201d means \u201c obtain the money,\u201d \u00a3\u00a3 receive the money.\u201d The plaintiffs were to collect. They were to receive the money. Unless they did so receive it, it was not collected by them. A promissory note is very frequently made payable at the bank in which the maker keeps his account. Even that does not constitute payment (Hill <em>v. </em>Place, 5 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>N. S.18, special term, affirmed by general term). No question of negligence is involved. The plaintiffs pressed Dayton &amp; Co. They failed. 4. It was a matter of indifference to the plaintiffs where the bill was to be paid ; that which was essential was, that it. should be paid. They acquiesced, therefore, in the provision of the contract that the bill should be collected at Dayton <em>&amp; </em>Co.\u2019s office. This assumed that the defendants would see that the bill was paid there, and they were required to do so. In accordance with this construction of the contract the plaintiffs, on June 9, 1875, wrote to the defendants, informing them that the bill had not been paid, though they had drawn upon Dayton <em>&amp; </em>Co. for payment, and requesting the defendants to put Dayton &amp; Co. in funds, and to instruct them to accept the draft; in other words, to instruct them to pay the bill. If Dayton &amp; Co. had accepted such a draft, that would not constitute payment unless it was specifically so agreed (Claflin <em>v. </em>Ostrom, 54 N. <em>Y. </em>581; Roberts <em>v. </em>Fischer, 43 <em>Id. </em>159). 5. The defendants may maintain that this letter authorized the remittance of funds by the\" defendants to Dayton &amp; Co. on the plaintiffs\u2019 account. This is not so : First, because the letter follows the provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>the contract, which requires the defendants to put Dayton &amp; Co. in funds, and to see that they pay the plaintiffs\u2019 bill: and, Second, because no money was remitted to Dayton &amp; Co. by the defendants upon or after the receipt of this letter.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b254-5\">By the Court.\u2014Speir, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7V\">[After reviewing the evidence and arriving at the conclusion that upon the undisputed evidence and facts the sale was made through Dayton <em>&amp; </em>Co., who acted as brokers for both seller and buyer, that defendants had knowledge before they placed any funds in the hands of Dayton &amp; Co., that the plaintiffs were the sellers of the sugar; that the remittance to Dayton &amp; Co. was not intended to be on account of plaintiff\u2019s bill; and that plaintiffs, in fact, received but $1,000 from defendants, for which due credit was given, proceeds :] The only question in the case is whether the provision of the contract\u2014 \u201csend invoice and bill of lading to our office, collect at our office,\u201d\u2014had the effect of charging the plaintiffs for money received by Dayton &amp; Co. from the defendants. The invoice mentioned here is the plaintiffs\u2019 bill sent to the defendants with the shipment of the sugar. The contract informs the defendants that the sale was made on account of the plaintiffs to them, and the bill is made against them and calls for payment: The defendants were not authorized to pay to Dayton &amp; Co., although payment was to be made at. their office. The general rule is, that a broker employed to buy or sell, has no authority to receive payment. The exception to the rule prevails where the broker is clothed with the <em>indicia </em>of authority to receive payment, especially where the principal is not disclosed <em>(Russell on Fac. and </em>Brokers, 48 <em>Law Lib. </em>68-110; Cassel <em>v. </em>Thornton, 3 <em>Car. &amp; P. </em>352 ; Higgins <em>v. </em>Moore, 34 <em>N. Y. </em>417). The defendants were apprised by the contract and the bill received from the plaint<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>iffs, that the goods were bought from the plaintiffs, and payment was due to them, to be made at the office of the brokers. The main defense relied on was: that at the time the sugars were received and paid for they had no knowledge that the same had been purchased from the plaintiffs. The contrary was affirmatively proved by the testimony of one of the defendants, and what is still more conclusive, the payments made to Dayton &amp; Co. were made before the time of payment had expired, and were made on an arrangement with them by which a currency price had been converted into a gold price, and after the receipt of the plaintiffs\u2019 bill by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The judgment and order should be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Sanford, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
