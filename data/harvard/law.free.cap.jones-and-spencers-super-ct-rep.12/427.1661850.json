It cannot, however, consist of anything which merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>denotes the name or quality. There can be no right to the use of mere generic words.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AxC\">The language of Lord Justice Gifford, in Lee \u00ab. Haley (39 <em>Law </em>Journal, 380), approved: \u201c The principle upon which the cases go is not that there is a property in the word, but that it is a <em>fraud </em>upon a person who has established a trade, \u201d &amp;c., &amp;c.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b446-5\"><em>Held, </em>in this case, that the- injunction sought to be obtained in the action should be granted.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b446-6\">Before Curtis, Ch.

Claudius L. Monell, at a special term, April, 1875.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-10\">The complaint alleged that the plaintiff, for more than three years, had been engaged in putting up in packages of about one pound each, and importing, an article known as \u201c Julienne,\u201d compounded of various vegetables, for making Julienne soup, upon which package he had placed a label or trade-mark devised by him, a copy, of which is annexed to the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-11\">The device consists of the words \u201c Conserves Alimentaires,\u201d under which is the coat-of-arms of the city of Paris ; upon either side of the monogram a \u201c C \u201d in a circle, and underneath the words \u201cParis\u201d and \u201c Julienne,\u201d with directions for preparing for use and using.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-12\">The device adopted by the defendants is in all -respects like the plaintiff\u2019s device, except the monogram is \u201cF. Gr.\u201d In size, type, color, and appearance, the two devices are entirely alike.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-13\">The answer alleged that \u201cJulienne\u201d was a generic name, and the mixture of vegetables used in making julienne soup was prepared and imported into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>United States long prior to its' being put up and imported by the plaintiff, and was previously well known to the general public by the name of \u201c Julienne.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-5\">Upon the pleading and affidavits, a motion was made and granted to dissolve the preliminary injunction, but no appeal was taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-6\">On the trial the plaintiff testified that the article was put up for him in Paris, and that it has not before been prepared or put up in the same manner. There was evidence on the part of the defendants that the article known as \u201c Julienne\u201d was prepared and put up by several other manufacturers in France, and was imported into this country.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-7\">One of the defendants testified that the defendant caused the label they used to be printed in Paris by their agent, having previously seen the plaintiff\u2019s label on packages of the \u201c Julienne\u201d they had purchased from him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-8\">The court found the fact that the plaintiff first adopted, and uses the label claimed as his trade-mark, that the defendants\u2019 label was calculated to deceive the customers of the plaintiff to his damage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-9\">The following opinion was delivered at special term :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-10\">Mo well, Ch. J.\u2014The case made by the evi-, dence upon the trial of this action so far varies it from the case presented upon the motion to vacate the injunction, that I am not embarrassed by the decision then made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-11\">It now appears that the article sold by the plaintiff was prepared-and put up for him in Paris by the firm of Hollier &amp; Co., and although there is evidence that a similar article, designated \u201cJulienne,\u201d is prepared and put up at other establishments in France, yet it is clearly established that the \u201cJulienne\u201d imported and sold by the plaintiff is prepared and put up expressly, for him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>It is not, therefore, in my opinion, material whether other manufacturers prepare the same article in the same manner and of the same material, or that it is imported into the United States and sold by other persons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-5\">There is no such property in the secret of manufacture that it can be protected; any one may prepare \u201c Julienne \u201d of the same ingredients that enters into the composition of the plaintiff\u2019s article, and he may designate it \u201c Julienne,\u201d and sell it as such. The property and right to protection is in the device or symbol which is invented and adopted to designate the goods to be sold, and not in the article which is manufactured and sold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-6\">The right to protection is not exclusively in the manufacture. The person for whom the goods are manufactured (Amoskeag M\u2019f\u2019g Co. <em>v. </em>Spear, <em>2 Sand/. 599 </em>; Walton <em>v. </em>Crawley, 3 <em>Blatch/. </em>440) and the vendor -who sells and who may have no direct relation to the manufacturer, has such right (Partridge \u00bb. Menck, <em>2 Barb. Oh. </em>103 ; Taylor <em>r. </em>Carpenter, <em>2 Sand/. Oh. </em>614).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-7\">Even, therefore, assuming that the article imported by the plaintiff is an article of common manufacture in France, and is imported generally into this country, and sold under the name of \u201c Julienne,\u201d that does not deprive the plaintiff of his property in the device which he has invented as a trade-mark, and which he has put upon the packages, for the purpose of designating the article he sells.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-8\">In Amoskeag Manufacturing Company r. Spear <em>{supra), </em>the learned Justice Duer says (p. 605):\u2014 \u201c Every manufacturer and every merchant for whom goods are manufactured has an unquestionable right to distinguish the goods he manufactures or sells by a peculiar mark or device, in order that they may be known as his in the market;\u201d and in Partridge <em>v. </em>Menck <em>{supra), </em>the chancellor says (p. 103): \u201c The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>question is not whether the complainant was the original inventor or proprietor of the article made by him, and upon which he now puts his trade-mark, nor whether the article made and sold by the defendant is of the same quality and value.\u201d And Beardsley, J., says, in Tyler <em>v. </em>Carpenter <em>(supra) </em>: \u201cIt is immaterial that the complainants were not admitted to be the manufacturers of the article. It was conceded that they were the vendors, and engaged in the sale of it.\u201d In Lee <em>v. </em>Haley (39 <em>Law Jour. </em>284) the plaintiffs were dealers in coal\u2014a natural product, in the general reach of all dealers. Yet the court protected the good-will of a business represented by a particular style of address.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ApF\">It sufficiently appears from the evidence that the plaintiff is in a position to entitle him to adopt a trademark to designate the goods in question. They were manufactured exclusively for him, and, within the authorities I have cited, he, as the vendor, had a right to establish a reputation for the quality of the article he sold, and perpetuate it by a device which would denote its origin and ownership.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-6\">If he has done so, he should be protected in its exclusive use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-7\">A trade-mark may consist of anything, marks, forms, symbols, which designate the true origin or ownership of the article. It cannot consist of anything which merely denotes the name or quality.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-8\">There can be no right to the use of mere generic words. Hence \u201cJulienne,\u201d designating the manufactured article, does not denote origin or ownership, and like \u201c Schnapps\u201d (Wolfe <em>v. </em>Goulard, 18 <em>How. Pr. </em>64) and \u2018 \u2022 Club House Gin \u2019 \u2019 (Corwin <em>v. </em>Daly, 7 <em>Bosw. </em>222), it is a word used merely to designate the article or its quality.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-9\">The words \u201c Conserves Alimentaire,\u201d which are alike applicable to every description of preserved or dessicated food, do not relate exclusively to the name or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>the quality of - any particular preparation, and are, \u2018therefore, the subject of an exclusive appropriation in connection with words which did not denote the name or quality, and in that sense they may be regarded as designating the true origin or ownership of the manufacturers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-5\">The adoption of words in common use as a trademark was sanctioned in Matsell <em>v. </em>Flanagan (2 <em>Abb. Jf. 8. </em>459), where the \u201c United States Police Gazette\u201d was held to be an- infringement of the plaintiff\u2019s right <em>to the </em>use of the \u201cNational Police Gazette and in Messerole \u00bb. Tynberg (4 <em>Id. </em>410), the word, \u201cBismark,\u201d as a trade-mark for a particular description of paper collars, was protected; and in Newman <em>v. </em>Alvord (49 <em>Barb. </em>588), a stronger case, \u201c Akron Cement,\u201d which was the name of the <em>place </em>where the cement was made, was brought within the class of words entitled to be appropriated as a trade-mark. These several cases are apprpved in Billet <em>v. </em>Oarlier (11 <em>Abb. N. 8. </em>186), inhere the manufacture of a syrup from the juice of the pomegranate was called \u201cGrenadine\u201d and \u201cGrenade Syrup.\u201d In that casee it appeared that \u201cGrenade\u201d was a French word signifying pomegranate, and that '\u201c Grenade Syrup \u201d was sold in France under that name. It was, however, held that the plaintiff, by the adoption of the words, has acquired a property in their use which the courts would protect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-6\">Again, the copy of the coat-of-arms of the city of Paris, when in connection or combination with other-marks, words or devices, not denoting name or quality, will cover a property in it which will prevent its use in the same connection or combination by another person., ; In this case, however, none of the words or devices are isolated or disconnected with each other. They form in combination a whole, supplemented by the plaintiff\u2019s monogram, together, as is claimed, constitute his trade-mark.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>It is not necessary in this case to designate any particular words or symbols as constituting the plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark ; although I am of opinion that the words \u201c Conserves Alimentaires \u201d on the coat-of-arms of the city of Paris as a symbol, could, if it was necessary, be separately regarded as such ; but the combination of all the words and symbols, which the plaintiff has put upon his label, entitles him to be protected against the appropriation and use of such combination by the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-5\">It has now come to be well settled, that the adoption of any words or device not already in use, and not denoting the name or quality of the article, will constitute a trade-mark ; and they so far become property that the courts will protect the owner against any usurpation or interference ; and for the well-grounded reason that a person who, by his skill and industry, has acquired a good reputation for the commodity he manufactures or sells, ought to be allowed to reap the fruits of it. This is forcibly illustrated in Williams <em>v. </em>Johnson (2 <em>Bosw. </em>1), when the trade-mark was \u201c Genuine Yankee Soap,\u201d words of common use, but as they did not denote the name or quality of the manufacture, the plaintiff\u2019s property in them was fully sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-6\">Independently of this, the label, as ,a whole, is entitled to protection. The courts have gone to the extent of bringing within its protection not the trade-mark alone, but the packages, cases, and handbills (Williams v. Spence, 25 <em>How. Pr. </em>366). In Cook <em>v. </em>Stark-weather (13 <em>Abb. N. 8. </em>392), the court held, that the package, case, or vessel, in which the commodity is put,\" is prepared in a peculiar or novel manner, constituted it so much a part of the trade-mark as to entitle it to participate in the protection which would be given to the trade-mark itself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-7\">Upon the whole case, therefore, I am satisfied that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>the plaintiff has such property in the label he has adopted to designate the goods he offers for sale, that he should be protected in its exclusive use. He has, through his skill and industry, gained a reputation in the community for the excellence of the article he imports, and he ought to be permitted to reap the profits of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-5\">I am led to my conclusion in this case the more readily for the reason that I can find ho excuse or justification for the defendants\u2019 acts. One of them testified that they had frequently purchased packages of the plaintiff\u2019s \u201c Julienne,\u201d and had sent to Paris directions to have their label prepared. It was prepared in ail respects like the plaintiff\u2019s, except the insignificant change in the monogram.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-6\">That it was a willful invasion of the plaintiff\u2019s rights there can be no possible doubt. The defendants were at liberty to manufacture \u201c Julienne,\u201d or have it manufactured for them, of the same materials and in the same manner, and to import and sell it in this market under the same name, and the plaintiff would have had no legal cause of complaint. 'With that undisputed right they were not content, but they meant to also trade upon the plaintiff\u2019s reputation, and profit by it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-7\">In Lee <em>v. </em>Haley <em>{ubi supra), </em>Lord Justice Gifford says: \u201cThe principle upon which the cases go is not that there is ' property in the word, but that it i\u00e1 a <em>fraud </em>upon a person who has established a trade, and carries it on under a given name, that some other person should assume the same name.\u201d And the Chancellor in Partridge <em>v. </em>Monck <em>{ubi supra), </em>also says: \u201c That, having appropriated to himself a particular label or sign or trade-mark, indicating to those who wish to give him their patronage, that the article is manufactured or sold by him or by his authority, or that he carries on his business at a particular place, he is entitled to protection against any person who at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>tempts to pirate upon, the good-will of the complainant\u2019s friends or customers, or of the patrons of his trade or business, by sailing under his flag, without his authority or consent.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-5\">And, again, in Billet <em>v. </em>Carlier <em>(ubi supra), </em>Mr. Justice Pratt says: \u201cThe defendants can have no possible motive in using these words (Grenade Syrup), except to avail themselves of the reputation the plaintiff\u2019s article has gained under this name.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-6\">The plaintiff must have judgment perpetually, enjoining the defendants from using the trade-mark, with costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b453-7\"><em>Hugh Porter, </em>attorney, and of counsel, for appellant,\u2014Cited:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Al1\">Newman <em>v. </em>Alvord, 51 <em>N.
