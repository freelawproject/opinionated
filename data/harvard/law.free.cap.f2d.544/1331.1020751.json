He seeks a writ of habeas corpus, complaining that evidence of a \u201cvoid conviction\u201d and products of an invalid 1962 probation revocation were used to impeach his testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1401-28\">Langston testified on his own behalf at the murder trial. He asserted that his killing of the victim was in self defense. The prosecutor cross-examined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1401-29\">\u201cQ You are the same Joe Wayne Langston that on January the 30th, 1962, that pled guilty to the offense of passing a forged instrument and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>forging the instrument and was given five years in the Texas State pen; you are that same Joe Wayne Langston, aren\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1402-4\">\u201cA I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1402-5\">\u201cQ And that was on January the 30th, 1962 \u2014 You didn\u2019t spend five years down there did you, Joe Wayne?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1402-6\">\u201cA I spent nineteen months down there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1402-7\">\u201cQ You spent nineteen months and you were given five years, so that a convicted forger and a convicted thief and you were too good to burn the house down, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1402-8\">\u201cA That\u2019s right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1402-9\">In fact, Langston pled guilty to forgery in 1958 and received five years\u2019 probation in lieu of confinement. On January 12, 1962, that probation was revoked. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals later granted relief from the probation revocation because Langston was not represented by counsel at the revocation hearing. <em>Ex Parte Langston, </em>Tex.Cr.App., 1974, 511 S.W.2d 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-10\">In the Texas courts and in the district court appellant<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> urged that the use of the conviction and products of the probation revocation is constitutionally infirm under the <em>Gideon </em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>-Burgett </em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em>-Loper</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>doctrine and, therefore, cannot be used to impeach his testimony. This doctrine holds that the use of uncounseled <em>convictions </em>to impeach a defendant\u2019s credibility \u2014 and thereby support evidence of guilt \u2014 raises a claim of denial of due process. In this case, however, it is not contended that Langston was unrepresented at the conviction, but rather that he was unrepresented at the time of the revocation of a probated sentence. The impairment of appellant\u2019s rights at the probation revocation hearing does not, at least in this context, invalidate the use of the underlying conviction. <em>See Mays v. Estelle, </em>5 Cir. 1974, 505 F.2d 116; <em>Gutierrez v. Estelle, </em>5 Cir. 1973, 474 F.2d 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-13\">The nineteen months Langston served in prison as a result of the invalid probation revocation was also referred to by the prosecutor. In <em>Gill v. Estelle, </em>5 Cir. 1976, 530 F.2d 1152,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we said that \u201c[cjonstitutional law clearly requires that counsel be afforded to a defendant in a probation revocation proceeding.\u201d The prosecutor there referred constantly to the earlier probation revocation: that defendant \u201chad been given his chance, that he [defendant] \u2018blew\u2019 it, and that he should be put away for a long time\u201d 530 F.2d at 1154-55. This use of the uncounseled revocation of probation as evidence at the punishment stage of the trial reached \u201cconstitutional proportions\u201d. In our case, however, the fact of incarceration, introduced for the purpose of impeachment, was mentioned only once, and was insignificantly damaging in light of the other telling impeaching evidence. Therefore even if the reference to incarceration is improper in light of our reasoning in <em>Gill, </em>this is a case where \u201cthe use of the product of counselless criminal proceedings can be protected under the harmless error rule\u201d, 530 at 1155. <em>See, e. g., Zilka v. Estelle, </em>5 Cir. 1976, 529 F.2d 388; <em>Webster v. Estelle, </em>5 Cir. 1974, 505 F.2d 926, <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 918, 95 S.Ct. 1581, 43 L.Ed.2d 785 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1402-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1402-11\">. Under the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure \u00a7 38.29, no evidence of a conviction from which a sentence of probation has been completed may be used to impeach a witness\u2019s credibility. Appellant indirectly contends that the effect of a void probation revocation is the same as completed probation. Therefore, he asserts, it was error for the prosecutor to bring out the forgery conviction. In light of our disposition, we need not reach this issue of state evidence law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1402-16\">. <em>Gideon v.
