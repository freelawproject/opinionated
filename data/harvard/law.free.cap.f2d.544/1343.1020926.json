The petition is opposed by plaintiff who states that though the judgment of $51,895.66 is subject to a credit of $7,578.40 paid to Barker\u2019s Department Store, the judgment should not be reduced to a flat $42,500 since plaintiff is entitled to interest on the original sum from date of judicial demand, subject to the credit; thus he desires to preserve what he contends is his right to receive interest from date of judicial demand on all sums unpaid until the time these sums are actually paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-12\">Thus it appears that defendants are entitled to a credit for the sum paid to Barker\u2019s Department Store, but we are unable from this record to determine the proper manner of allocating the credit. The procedure for doing so is appropriate for determination by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1414-13\">The case is remanded to the district court for appropriate disposition in view of the issues stated by the parties. The district court will therefore determine the manner of applying the credit for the payment made to Barker\u2019s Department Store, and render its judgment stating the exact amount in principal and interest which remains to be paid for the satisfaction of plaintiff\u2019s demand. In all other respects the petition for rehearing is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
