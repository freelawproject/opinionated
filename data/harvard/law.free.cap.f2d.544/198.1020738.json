Lopez was killed. The deceased\u2019s parents, Salome D. Lopez and Basilaesa Lopez, filed a state-court action against Jesse Reyes Moreno, claiming his negligence caused the accident. When Moreno claimed that he was insured by Stonewall Insurance Company, Stonewall brought this declaratory action in federal court, naming the Lopezes and Moreno as defendants. Stonewall claimed that the accident occurred before Moreno obtained the insurance. The district court reached the merits, accepted Stonewall\u2019s contention, and rendered judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>ment accordingly.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, appellants do not challenge the district court\u2019s resolution of the merits but assert solely that the amount in controversy does not exceed the jurisdictional minimum of $10,000. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Stonewall\u2019s liability for bodily injury under the insurance contract at issue is limited to $10,000 per person. Because this suit involved injuries to only one person, Stonewall\u2019s maximum bodily injury liability is $10,000. As appellants correctly note, when the amount in controversy is exactly $10,-000, it does not <em>exceed </em>$10,000, and \u00a7 1332 does not establish jurisdiction. The controversy here, however, involves not only Stonewall\u2019s potential liability for the $10,-000. but also Stonewall\u2019s obligation to defend the state-court action against Moreno, its insured. If the insurance contract covers the accident in question, Stonewall is obligated, by the contract\u2019s terms, to defend Moreno. If, on the other hand, the insurance contract does not apply to the accident in question, Stonewall has no obligation to provide a defense. The pecuniary value of the obligation to defend the separate lawsuit is properly considered in determining the existence of the jurisdictional amount, and the amount in controversy here therefore exceeds $10,000. <em>See Allstate Ins. Co. v. Dillard, </em>190 F.Supp. 111 (E.D.Pa.1960); <em>Criterion Ins. Co. v. Quillen, </em>212 F.Supp. 924 (D.Md.1963); cf. <em>Motorists Mutual Ins. Co. v. Simpson, </em>404 F.2d 511 (7th Cir. 1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>394 U.S. 988, 89 S.Ct. 1470, 22 L.Ed.2d 763 (1969) (dictum).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">We affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-8\">. The district court acted properly when it resolved the claim on the basis of the facts presented without attributing any significance to the insurance company\u2019s name, \u201cStonewall\u201d. That an insurance company would take as its name a verb meaning \u201cto engage in obstructive parliamentary debate or delaying tactics,\u201d <em>see </em>Webster\u2019s Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary 864 (1970), may demonstrate remarkable candor but does not help guide the decision of a particular case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b269-9\">. Appellants vigorously assert that the jurisdictional amount issue is governed by the \u201cplaintiff\u2019s viewpoint\u201d rule, under which we should purportedly assess the existence of the jurisdictional amount solely from the viewpoint of the plaintiff, ignoring the lawsuit\u2019s pecuniary impact upon the defendant. Here we have no occasion to assess the import or applicability of that rule, however, because the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000 when viewed from either the plaintiff\u2019s or the defendants\u2019 viewpoint. The difference between winning and losing this lawsuit, either to appellants or to Stonewall, will be $10,000 plus the cost of defending the state-court action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
