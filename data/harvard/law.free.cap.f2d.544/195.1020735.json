Cluck appeals from his conviction for importing a stolen firearm into the United States from Mexico. He testified in his own behalf, attempting to explain that the firearm was not stolen. On cross-examination the Assistant United State Attorney asked him, over defense objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-13\">\u201cNow you are the same John Rexford Cluck that was charged in Beaumont, Texas for unlawfully carrying a weapon on 12-31-75?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-14\">\u201cYes sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-15\">\u201cAre you the same John Rexford Cluck that was charged in Beaumont, Texas, on 12-31-75 for possession of stolen property?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-17\">\u201cNo sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-18\">The district court then instructed the jury that the questions were asked for the sole purpose of testing the credibility of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-19\">The government then called as a rebuttal witness a Beaumont policeman who testified that appellant was arrested in Beaumont on December 31, 1975, for possession of stolen property. There is no evidence of the disposition of either charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-20\">Appellant contends that it was error to admit, for impeachment purposes, evidence of his arrest and accusation of crimes for which there was no evidence of convictions. The government has filed no brief, but it has advised this Court that it does not oppose the appellant\u2019s request for reversal and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-21\">It is error to attack a witness\u2019s credibility by using extrinsic evidence of his conduct that has not resulted in conviction of a crime. Fed.R.Evid. 608(b) (1975). The government makes no argument that the error here was harmless. We therefore hold that permitting the testimony of the Beaumont policeman to be introduced was reversible error. <em>Cf., United States v. Musgrave, </em>483 F.2d 327, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1023, 94 S.Ct. 447, 38 L.Ed.2d 315 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-22\">The conviction is reversed and the cause remanded to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-23\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
