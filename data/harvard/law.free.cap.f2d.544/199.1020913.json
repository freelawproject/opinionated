Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., </em>5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b270-9\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">Appellant challenges the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to appellee Gautreau on the ground of judicial immunity in this action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">Appellant purchased a vehicle from Julius Guedry, paying him with his check in the amount of $1,750. Shortly thereafter appellant discovered certain alleged defects in the vehicle and stopped payment on the check. Upon learning about the stop payment order Guedry went to appellee, a Louisiana Justice of the Peace, and swore out a warrant for the arrest of appellant for the offense of \u201ctheft by check.\u201d Appellee told Guedry that stop payment disputes were civil matters, but upon Guedry\u2019s insistence, he issued the requested warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">There is no dispute over appellee\u2019s right to hold his office as Justice of the Peace or over his right to issue warrants for arrests of persons alleged to have committed offenses. Judges are immune from section 1983 liability for their acts within the judicial role. <em>Pierson v. Ray, </em>386 U.S. 547, 553-55, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 18 L.Ed.2d 288, 295 (1967). The parties concede that a Justice of the Peace comes within this judicial immunity, but appellant contends that appellee lost the cloak of immunity by issuing a warrant on a charge he knew to be noncriminal. It is clear from appellee\u2019s deposition, however, that appellee thought that appellant\u2019s conduct could give rise to a criminal theft charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-14\">Q: Mr. Gautreau, if Mr. Keeton bought a truck from Mr. Guedry and he wrote a check knowing at the time he wrote the check he was going to stop payment on it, knowing he was going to stop payment on it, and he stops payment, then the charge of theft would be a good charge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-15\">A: That\u2019s what made me write the charge knowing the man didn\u2019t have his truck. The poor man didn\u2019t have no money, no check, no car, no truck, no money for it. And that\u2019s what made me write the charge, theft by check.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-16\">Nonetheless, appellant points to appellee\u2019s repeated statements that he told Guedry that stop payment disputes were exclusively civil matters. The context of these statements clearly indicates that appellee understood the district attorney\u2019s policy to be not to prosecute charges involving stop payment orders, for example:' \u201cIt\u2019s a civil matter only according to the district attorney in our parish.\u201d Thus, what appellant contends are admissions as to appellee\u2019s knowledge or lack of authority are really expressions of doubt as to the eventual prosecution of the arrestee. Although appellee may have doubted eventual prosecution by the district attorney, he clearly believed that criminal conduct possibly had occurred. Appellee\u2019s issuance of an arrest warrant upon the seller\u2019s insistence was therefore in his capacity as Justice of the Peace, and consequently, appellee is entitled to the protection of judicial immunity. <em>Guedry v. Ford, </em>431 F.2d 660, 664 (5th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-17\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
