The court imposed consecutive sentences on four of the counts aggregating fifteen years and added a five year probation term on another count. The remaining counts brought concurrent sentences. This court affirmed the conviction on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>451 F.2d 209 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-25\">The sentencing court denied the instant motion to vacate the judgment of conviction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, rejecting Fair-man\u2019s assertions of defects in the indictment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-26\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s claims, each of the various counts in the indictment charges with specificity an offense separate and distinct from the remainder. Fairman points specifically to three pairs of counts in the indictment, claiming that each pair charges but a single offense. In each instance, however, one count in the pair charges an offense of <em>producing </em>counterfeit coins or fraudulently altering a coin. The second count in each pair charges an act of <em>distributing </em>the coins produced. Therefore, the two offenses in each pair are separate; each required proof of an element the other did not. <em>See Ianelli v. United States, </em>420 U.S. 770, 95 S.Ct. 1284, 43 L.Ed.2d 616 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>(1975); <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">As each count of the indictment alleged either a separate transaction or an offense requiring elements sufficiently distinct to meet the test of <em>Bloekburger, supra, </em>Fairman can mount no successful attack on the validity of the bill or the consecutive sentences imposed upon his conviction. Finally, his claim that the indictment alleged transactions not alluded to in a complaint filed under Fed.R.Crim.P. 3 is also merit-less; nothing in that rule or in rule 7 so limits the terms of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The judgment below is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
