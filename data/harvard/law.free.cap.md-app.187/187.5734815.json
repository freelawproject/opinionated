Following a seventeen-day trial, a jury sitting in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City found appellant liable, awarding appellees a total of $15,085,000 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">On appeal, appellant presents eight questions for our review, which we have rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">I. Did the trial court commit prejudicial error in permitting appellees\u2019 counsel to conduct an in-court demonstration using mainline ballast?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\">II. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in propounding a jury instruction on assumption of risk?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-10\">III. Did the trial court err in ruling that appellees\u2019 claims were timely as a matter of law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-11\">IV. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in refusing to allow appellant to cross-examine appellees\u2019 economist with regard to railroad industry retirement age statistics?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-12\">V. Did the trial court err in declining to instruct the jury on the apportionment of damages?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-13\">VI. Did the trial court err in excluding evidence regarding the Railroad Retirement Board Disability Benefits of Davidson and Young?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-14\">VII. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion for new trial on the ground that the jury\u2019s verdict was excessive?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>VIII. Were appellees\u2019 claims precluded by the Federal Railway Safety Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20101 <em>et seq. </em>and the regulations promulgated thereunder?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">We answer \u201cNo\u201d to questions I through IV, VI, and VIII and \u201cYes\u201d to question V. Therefore, we shall vacate the judgment of the circuit court and remand for a new trial on damages. Accordingly, we do not reach question VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">On December 22, 2004, Bickerstaff commenced this action against appellant under FELA. On February 14, 2005, Brown, Davidson, Fedorchak, Hartman, Hobgood, Short, Young, and Zientek filed similar FELA actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">On May 5, 2005, the circuit court consolidated over 50 FELA cases, all involving allegations of personal injury caused primarily by walking on the rocks, or ballast, that makes up the surfaces of appellant\u2019s rail yards. The trial judge assigned to the consolidated cases divided the claims into clusters for trial purposes. Cluster IV included appellees\u2014Bickerstaff, Brown, Davidson, Fedorchak, Hartman, Hobgood, Short, Young, and Zientek\u2014each of whom alleged injuries to one or both of his knees and one of whom, Brown, also alleged injuries to his back.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Following a seventeen-day trial beginning on March 5, 2007, and concluding on March 28, 2007, the jury returned a verdict against appellant in favor of appellees. Each appellee received an award ranging from $750,000 to $6,000,000. On March 29, 2007, the court ordered the entry of judgment in favor of appellees. After the denial of its post-trial motions, appellant timely noted this appeal on June 4, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">Appellant &amp; Its Rail Yards</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">Appellant operates rail yards in the Baltimore area and elsewhere in Maryland. A rail yard consists of rows of parallel railroad tracks where trains are parked, taken apart, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>and reconfigured into different trains. One or more mainline tracks connect the rail yard to appellant\u2019s rail network.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The surface of appellant\u2019s rail yards consists of ballast, slag,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and cinders. Railroad \u201cballast,\u201d or crushed rock, is the most common surface material and has many different functions depending on its location in the yard. Ballast supports the railroad tracks and track structures, facilitates drainage, and provides a walking surface for railroad employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Ballast is graded in different sizes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Large ballast, also termed mainline ballast or track ballast, is about 1\" to 2 3/4\" in size. Mainline ballast best supports the railroad tracks and facilitates track drainage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Small ballast, or walkway ballast, is much smaller than mainline ballast, ranging in size from 3/8\" to 1\". The presence of small ballast in the rail yards provides a relatively safer walking surface. Mainline ballast is not necessary for drainage in the yard as it is on the tracks, because railroads can construct underground drainage systems, which provide adequate drainage for the track system. When mainline ballast is used in the rail yards, it is unstable to walk on and poses a slip and fall hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Appellees</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">Bickerstaff is a 56-year old car inspector' with a left-knee condition who was still working at the time of trial. He claimed economic losses of $189,300.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">Brown is a 57-year old trainman with a right-knee condition and a herniated disk. He stopped working in August 2006. Brown claimed economic losses of $382,700.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Davidson is a 52-year old trainman with a right-knee condition. He stopped working in October 2007. Davidson claimed $612,700 in economic losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Fedorchak is a 53-year old trainman with left- and right-knee conditions who was still working at the time of trial. Fedorchak claimed economic losses of $196,600.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Hartman is a 52-year old trainman with left- and right-knee conditions who was still working at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Hobgood is a 62-year old conductor and flagman with left- and right-knee conditions. He was still working at the time of trial. Hobgood claimed economic losses of $44,400.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Short is a 55-year old conductor with a right-knee condition. He stopped working in May 2005. Short claimed economic damages of $800,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Young is a 51-year old trainman with left- and right-knee conditions who was still working at the time of trial. He claimed economic damages of $356,200.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">Zientek is a 51-year old car inspector with left- and right-knee conditions. He stopped working in February 2007. Zientek claimed economic losses of $532,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-12\">The Nature of Appellees\u2019 Work</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">Appellees\u2019 FELA actions alleged that their knee conditions (and, additionally in the case of Brown, a back condition) were caused by their work in appellant\u2019s rail yards. Each appellee had worked for appellant for approximately 30 to 35 years, mainly as a trainman or car inspector.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">Brown, Davidson, Fedorchak, Hartman, Hobgood, Short, and Young each held the position as trainman, also termed conductor, brakeman, or switchman. A trainman works in the \u201cyards\u201d and the \u201croads.\u201d In the yard, a trainman \u201cswitch[es] cars\u201d and \u201cthrow[s] switches,\u201d meaning that he separates the rail cars and moves them to different tracks within the yard for the purpose of reconfiguring the trains so that they can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>leave the yard in the appropriate order. Switching cars involves repetitive squatting and crouching. A trainman also manually ties down handbrakes, which involves repetitive climbing on rail cars. He couples air hoses, which ensures air flowing to the rear of the train for the mechanical brakes to operate, during which process the trainman repeatedly straddles the rail of the car and assumes a crouching position. During each shift, a trainman walks considerable distances, ranging from five to ten miles.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Bickerstaff and Zientek worked for appellant as car inspectors, or carmen. A car inspector inspects approximately 150 to 200 rail cars per shift to ensure that the cars are in safe operating order. Inspection of each rail car entails repetitive squatting. From a squatting position, the car inspector examines the underneath of the railroad car from several different inspection points. If further inspection is required, the car inspector may crawl underneath the railroad car, sometimes on his hands and knees. During an inspection, a car inspector may have to walk back and forth from one end of the railroad car to another. In a typical shift, a car inspector walks about 5 to 8 miles. In some of appellant\u2019s rail yards, the yard consists of about 80% large ballast.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The Injuries Sustained</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Each appellee claimed to have sustained cumulative trauma over the course of his 30 to 35 years of service working for appellant. Appellees all were diagnosed with osteoarthritis<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to one or both knees and some claimed injury to the menisci<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>in their knees. Additionally, Brown alleged a cumulative trauma injury to his back. Most appellees had undergone arthroscopic surgery on one or both knees, and many appellees had received injections into their knees of either cortisone, an anti-inflammatory, or Synvisc, a synthetic lubricant. Appellees\u2019 medical experts testified that most of the appellees will need knee replacement surgery at some point in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Appellees attributed their injuries to ergonomic risk factors for cumulative trauma injuries associated with the physical activity of trainmen and car inspectors, namely, the repetitive squatting, crouching, crawling, climbing rail cars, mounting and dismounting moving rail cars, and years of walking on mainline ballast. Appellees alleged that appellant negligently used significant amounts of large ballast, rather than small ballast, in its rail yards in violation of industry standards and appellant\u2019s own rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">On March 28, 2007, the jury returned a verdict against appellant, determining damages of a total of $19,300,000. Because FELA is a comparative negligence statute, the jury was called upon to allocate appellant\u2019s negligence and appellees\u2019 contributory negligence. The jury made the following awards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">The total amount of damages for Bickerstaff was $900,000, with 70 percent fault assigned to appellant and 30 percent to Bickerstaff. Damages awarded to Bickerstaff were $630,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-10\">The total amount of damages for Brown was $2,500,000, with 70 percent fault assigned to appellant and 30 percent to Brown. Damages awarded to Brown were $1,750,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>The total amount of damages for Davidson was $2,300,000, with 80 percent fault assigned to appellant and 20 percent to Davidson. Damages awarded to Davidson were $1,840,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">The total amount of damages for Fedorchak was $1,000,000, with 75 percent fault assigned to appellant and 25 percent to Fedorchak. Damages awarded to Fedorchak were $750,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">The total amount of damages for Hartman was $850,000, \u25a0with 90 percent fault assigned to appellant and 10 percent to Hartman. Damages awarded to Hartman were $765,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">The total amount of damages for Hobgood was $750,000, with 60 percent fault assigned to appellant and 40 percent to Hobgood. Damages awarded to Hobgood were $450,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">The total amount of damages for Short was $3,000,000, with 90 percent fault assigned to appellant and 10 percent to Short. Damages awarded to Short were $2,700,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">The total amount of damages for Young was $6,000,000, with 80 percent fault assigned to appellant and 20 percent to Young. Damages awarded to Young were $4,800,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-10\">The total amount of damages for Zientek was $2,000,000, with 70 percent fault assigned to appellant and 30 percent to Zientek. Damages awarded to Zientek were $1,400,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-11\">We will set forth additional facts and proceedings below as necessary to discuss the questions presented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">Preliminarily, we acknowledge the unique specimen of case before us. Speaking for this Court, Judge Charles E. Moylan, Jr. recently discussed the special context of a FELA action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmA\">This is no ordinary tort case, although it has some characteristics thereof. It is a FELA case, and that designation places it in a special legal province all of its own with special rules of its own. Although FELA has been on the books for a full century, since 1908, the Maryland case law dealing with it remains skimpy. In <em>CSX v. Miller, </em>159 Md.App. 123, 128-46, 858 A.2d 1025 (2004), we examined in depth its special characteristics. And see <em>Haischer v. CSX, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>381 Md. 119, 848 A.2d 620 (2004); <em>Bittinger v. CSX, </em>176 Md.App. 262, 932 A.2d 1243 (2007). In <em>CSX v. Miller, </em>159 Md.App. at 129, 858 A.2d 1025, we commented on one unusual feature of a FELA action:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">The FELA law is a hybrid. It hovers ambivalently between workers\u2019 compensation law and the common law tort of negligence. It is neither, but it partakes of characteristics of both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">In <em>Kernan v. American Dredging Co., </em>355 U.S. 426, 431\u2014 32, 78 S.Ct. 394, 2 L.Ed.2d 382 (1958), Justice Brennan recounted the provenance of FELA as a deliberate policy recognition that the railroad industry itself was better able to shoulder the cost of industrial injuries and deaths than were the industry\u2019s injured workers or their families.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">[l]t came to be recognized that, <em>whatever the rights and duties among persons generally, the industrial employer </em>had a special <em>responsibility toward his workers, </em>who were daily exposed to the risks of the business and who were largely helpless to provide adequately for their own safety. Therefore, <em>as industry and commerce became sufficiently strong to bear the burden, the law, </em>the reflection of an evolving public policy, <em>came to favor compensation of employees and their dependents for the losses occasioned by the inevitable deaths and injuries of industrial employment, </em>thus shifting to industry the \u201chuman overhead\u201d of doing business. For most industries this change has been embodied in Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts. In the railroad and shipping industries, however, the FELA and Jones Act provide the framework for determining liability for industrial accidents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">In <em>Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall, </em>512 U.S. 532, 542, 114 S.Ct. 2396, 129 L.Ed.2d 427 (1994), the Supreme Court more recently reaffirmed that energizing purpose of FELA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-10\">Cognizant of the physical dangers of railroading that resulted in the death or maiming of thousands of workers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>every year, Congress crafted a <em>federal remedy that shifted part of the </em>\u201c <em>\u2018human overhead\u2019 \u201d of doing business from employee to their employers.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">From FELA\u2019s history and its animating philosophy, this Court concluded in <em>CSX v. Miller:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">Thus, although the FELA is not a workers\u2019 compensation act, <em>the social forces that produced it and the generating spirit that drives it resonate with the language and philosophy of workers\u2019 compensation principles.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">159 Md.App. at 131, 858 A.2d 1025 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"Ag\"><em>Norfolk S. Ry. Corp. v. Tiller, </em>179 Md.App. 318, 322-24, 944 A.2d 1272, <em>cert. denied, </em>405 Md. 292, 950 A.2d 829 (2008) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Additionally in <em>Tiller, </em>we set forth the \u201cemployee-friendly standard of review\u201d applied in FELA cases. <em>Id. </em>at 324, 944 A.2d 1272. A FELA case, we recognized, \u201ccalls for an interpretive approach that is significantly different from that which ordinarily prevails in a suit for common law negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because FELA is \u201ca broad remedial statute,\u201d courts have accorded \u201ca standard of liberal construction in order to accomplish Congress\u2019 objects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 325, 944 A.2d 1272 (quotations, alterations, and emphasis omitted). In discussing the standard of review applied in FELA cases in <em>CSX v. Miller, </em>159 Md.App. 123, 145, 858 A.2d 1025 (2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>384 Md. 581, 865 A.2d 589 (2005), this Court observed that \u201cit is not hard to figure out who wins the ties and who gets the benefit of the close calls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">Courtroom Demonstration</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">During the cross-examination of appellees\u2019 railroad engineering expert, Raymond Duffany, appellant attempted to demonstrate the gradation process of ballast using mainline ballast, a baseball, and a softball with square-shaped wooden screens. Appellant intended to pass the ballast, baseball, and softball<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> through the screens to demonstrate the process by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>which ballast was graded in different sizes. Appellees objected to the demonstration, arguing that it was not substantially similar to replicate the crushing and processing of ballast in a rock quarry. The trial judge permitted appellant to demonstrate the grading process using the ballast and the screens, but refused to allow appellant to use the baseball or softball in connection with the screening process. Upon appellees\u2019 continuing objection, the court advised the parties that cross-examination may be used in response to the use of demonstrative evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">During the redirect examination of Duffany, appellees\u2019 counsel conducted a demonstration during which he put samples of mainline ballast on the courtroom floor and stepped on them. Appellant\u2019s counsel objected and the following bench conference ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: I would like to cite <em>Andreas </em>[sic] versus <em>State, </em>372 Maryland 1, 811 A.2d 282, that that demonstration definitely is not substantially similar to the real-life reality of walking in a railroad yard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">THE COURT: Well, the problem I have here is that everybody used those rocks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: I didn\u2019t walk on them, though.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-9\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: You certainly handled them and looked at them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-10\">THE COURT: I think you have to take a deep breath and deal with your recross. I may agree with you. At the moment, I am overruling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">The court overruled appellant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">At the conclusion of redirect examination, appellant\u2019s counsel did not conduct any recross examination of Duffany regarding opposing counsel\u2019s demonstration. Instead, appellant\u2019s counsel moved for a mistrial, which the court denied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-13\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: To my astonishment, Your Honor, in his redirect of ... Duffany, [appellees\u2019 counsel] demonstrated large ballast, put it on the carpet in this courtroom and proceeded to walk on it, which flew in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>face of every case he cited to the Court in his attempts not to allow the screens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">THE COURT: He did put his foot on it. I thought he was about to fall, to be honest, so I looked the other way at that point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: The jury did not\u2014for the record, I wanted to point out the alternate jurors in the second row all stood up, and it was\u2014it was sort of a\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t mean to say that I was not aware of what was going on. I just said I turned my head. What I want the record to reflect is that, under the circumstances, that the Court recognizes the concern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">[Appellees\u2019 counsel] raised issues as to the use of the rocks. My problem is that the same rocks in question [were], in fact, used by [appellant\u2019s counsel] as to be demonstrative of that which would be in the area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor, excuse me. He laid an appropriate foundation for that. And he, in fact, elicited from [appellees\u2019] own expert witness the testimony that it was a perfectly fair depiction of the screening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: .... For the record, I think it was highly prejudicial of [appellees\u2019 counsel] to step on those rocks in the presence of the jury because that does not in any way, shape or form replicate the type of walking on rocks that trainmen and car men do in a yard setting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-12\">The rocks, were only two or three or four. They were loose. They were on a carpet in a courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-13\">As Your Honor is well aware, when evidence goes back to the jury, you instruct the jury not to undertake demonstrations of that type or experiments of that type.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-14\">THE COURT: Well, that is not generally an instruction, but it may be requested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well it is often requested, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-4\">THE COURT: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: I think it was highly prejudicial and highly inaccurate and flew in the face of all the case law that [appellees\u2019 counsel] had just brought to the Court\u2019s attention not 30 minutes earlier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: Your Honor, we approached the bench with respect to the objection that [appellant\u2019s counsel] had raised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">I walked back and laid the rocks on the corner, walked away, and everybody said the Court had overruled the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">I then turned around and proceeded to do what I had attempted to do initially, assuming that the Court had overruled the objection that [appellant\u2019s counsel] had stated because, look, they are the ones that opened the rocks up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-9\">They are the ones that brought the rocks into the courtroom, not me. They are the ones that stuck them through there.

The Court observed that \u201cthe differences between the doll and the victim were not insignificant, but, rather, were substantially material to the determination of the amount of force necessary to constitute Shaken Baby Syndrome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25, 811 A.2d 282. By allowing the State to proceed with the demonstration without satisfying its burden of establishing substantial similarity, the Court explained that \u201c[t]he net effect ... was to weaken the petitioner\u2019s ability to challenge the demonstration on cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25-26, 811 A.2d 282. Without the proper foundation of similarity, the Court concluded that the in-court demonstration may have mislead the jury in their deliberation, and thereby prejudiced the petitioner. <em>Id. </em>at 26-27, 811 A.2d 282. Even considering the cautionary instruction given to the jury \u201cacknowledging that the demonstration was not an \u2018accurate reenactment\u2019 and only an opinion,\u201d the Court was not persuaded that such instruction cured \u201cany possible prejudice\u201d the petitioner may have suffered. <em>Id. </em>at 27, 811 A.2d 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>In our view, the trial judge in the instant case erred in permitting the demonstration without requiring appellees\u2019 counsel to show substantial similarity between his in-court ballast demonstration and the reality of mainline ballast in a rail yard. <em>See id. </em>at 26-27, 811 A.2d 282. Appellees failed to show any evidence\u2014let alone \u201cample evidence\u201d\u2014of the substantial similarity between the in-court demonstration of walking on large ballast and walking on ballast in a rail yard. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, the differences between walking on a small number of loose mainline ballast on the courtroom floor and the mainline ballast in a rail yard are not insignificant. <em>See id. </em>at 25, 811 A.2d 282.

Bell, </em>398 Md. 27, 33, 919 A.2d 716 (2007). Appellant has the burden on appeal not only to show error but prejudice as well. <em>Id. </em>On the showing of prejudice, the Court of Appeals has observed: \u201cPrecise standards for determining prejudice have not been established and depend upon the facts of each individual case. Prejudice can be demonstrated by showing that the error was likely to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>affected the verdict below; an error that does not affect the outcome of the case is harmless error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\"><em>Andrews </em>is not instructive on the question of error, because in <em>Andrews </em>the Court of Appeals was reviewing the trial court\u2019s error in the context of a criminal case. On review of error in a criminal trial, error is harmless only when a reviewing court \u201c \u2018is able to declare a belief, <em>beyond a reasonable doubt, </em>that the <em>error in no way </em>influenced the verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hoerauf v.

It is not the possibility, but the probability, of prejudice which is the object of the appellate inquiry.

Therefore, whereas reversal in <em>Andretvs </em>was required unless there was an absence of <em>\u201cany possible prejttdice,\u201d </em>372 Md. at 27, 811 A.2d 282 (emphasis added), we need not reverse in the instant case unless the court\u2019s error caused <em>\u201csubstantial prejudice. </em>\u201d <em>Flores, </em>398 Md. at 34, 919 A.2d 716 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we are not persuaded that the in-court demonstration substantially prejudiced appellant. We disagree with appellant\u2019s assertion that appellees\u2019 counsel\u2019s demonstration was the \u201cmost memorable\u201d and \u201cmost misleading\u201d piece of evidence on the effect that walking on large ballast has on the human body. To the contrary, appellant introduced evidence that we regard as more prejudicial to its case. During the direct examination of its ergonom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>ic expert, Dr. Stephen Wiker, appellant played a videotape of a graduate student wearing work boots and walking on mainline ballast in one of appellant\u2019s Baltimore rail yards.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As the student was walking on the ballast, he took 21 steps, rolled his foot, and tripped on the ballast.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">On cross-examination, appellees\u2019 counsel replayed the video and proceeded to question Dr. Wiker as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: You counted 21 steps when he stepped on the large rock there and you saw his foot roll?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">[DR.

Can you do the math on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-10\">[DR.

Now, I want to look at these folks sitting right here today and you tell them, if you turn your foot like that 600 times a day, you don\u2019t think it is going to cause them some problems with their knees?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-14\">[DR. WIKER]: Well, I am not saying that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-15\">Appellant points out that on redirect examination Dr. Wiker testified that the graduate student tripped because \u201che stepped on a rock when he was looking at [Dr. Wiker] to get instructions to stop so he wasn\u2019t looking down when he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>stepped on it.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> No testimony or other evidence, however, was introduced to corroborate Dr. Wiker\u2019s assertion that the student was looking at him for instructions and not looking down. Therefore, we regard the video demonstration, viewed twice by the jury, and the testimony of Dr. Wiker on cross-examination as overshadowing any prejudice that may have resulted from the in-court demonstration of appellees\u2019 counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">We also note that, despite the trial court\u2019s recommendation, appellant never questioned Duffany about the in-court demonstration on recross examination. Additionally, appellant never requested a curative instruction. In the absence of any effort on behalf of appellant at trial to assuage any prejudice resulting from the in-court demonstration by appellees\u2019 counsel, we do not conclude that appellant\u2019s claim of error on appeal substantially prejudiced appellant. Accordingly, the trial court did not commit prejudicial error by permitting appellee\u2019s counsel to conduct a demonstration using mainline ballast.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Assumption of Risk Jury Instruction A.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">FELA &amp; Assumption of Risk: Abrogation of the Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">In 1906, Congress passed FELA \u201cin part to eliminate banders common law courts erected to protect railroad companies and other common carriers from liability for their employees\u2019 workplace injuries.\u201d <em>Fashauer v. N.J. Transit Rail Operations, Inc., 57 </em>F.3d 1269, 1274 (3rd Cir.1995). For one, FELA \u201csubstituted comparative negligence for the strict rule of contributory negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). Accordingly, unlike under Maryland law, a plaintiff\u2019s negligence does not bar a claim for damages under FELA. <em>See 45 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 53 (\u201c[T]he fact that the employee may have been guilty of contributory negligence shall not bar a recovery, but the damages shall be diminished by the jury in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to such employee[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Additionally, following widespread criticism of the retention of assumption of risk as a complete defense to an employer\u2019s liability, \u201cCongress amended FELA in 1939 to eliminate the defense in cases where the injury \u2018resulted in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees\u2019 of the employer.\u201d <em>Fashauer, </em>57 F.3d at 1274 (quoting 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 54). Thereafter, the Supreme Court announced that \u201cevery vestige of the doctrine of assumption of risk was obliterated from [FELA] by the 1939 Amendment,\u201d directing that FELA cases are \u201cto be handled as though no doctrine of assumption of risk had ever existed.\u201d <em>Tiller v.

The court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">[L]adies and gentlemen of the jury, [ ][i]n any action brought against [appellant] for injury to recover damages for injuries to the said plaintiff or employee, that employee shall not be held to have assumed the risk of his employment in any case where such injury resulted in whole or in part from the negligence of any officer or supervisor of the said railroad or carrier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-10\">And no employee shall be held to have assumed the risk of his employment in any case where the violation by such railroad of any statute enacted for the safety of employees contributed to the injury or death of an employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">Appellant argues that the court erred in propounding a jury instruction on the doctrine of assumption of risk when appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>lant \u201cdid not plead or argue that it could avoid liability because [ appellees] had assumed the risks of their employment.\u201d Nor, appellant contends, did appellees present evidence to \u201ccreate an undue risk that the jury would reduce their recoveries on the impermissible theory\u201d of assumption of risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Appellees respond that \u201cthe jury was correctly instructed that assumption of risk is not a defense in a FELA case.\u201d Appellees contend that appellant \u201celicited significant testimony ... to support the giving of an instruction on assumption of the risk;\u201d <em>e.g., </em>making choices to work at a particular rail yard, to mount and dismount moving equipment at a particular speed, to take on a job involving more walking, and to retire. Furthermore, appellees assert that appellant\u2019s closing argument emphasized this evidence, thereby \u201cimproperly infer[ring] assumption of the risk in the absence of an instruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Maryland Rule 4-325(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">The court may, and at the request of any party shall, instruct the jury as to the applicable law and the extent to which the instructions are binding. The court may give its instructions orally or, with the consent of the parties, in writing instead of orally. The court need not grant a requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered by instructions actually given.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">The Court of Appeals has interpreted Rule 4-325(c) as requiring] the trial court to give a requested instruction under the following circumstances: (1) the requested instruction is a correct statement of the law; (2) the requested instruction is applicable under the facts of the case; and (3) the content of the requested instruction was not fairly covered elsewhere in the jury instruction actually given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5X\"><em>Thompson v.

In other words, a jury instruction is warranted where the charge requested was \u201cgenerated by the evidence adduced.\u201d <em>Flores, </em>120 Md.App. at 193, 706 A.2d 628 (internal quotation omitted). \u201cWhether the evidence is sufficient to generate the requested instruction in the first instance is a question of law for the judge.\u201d <em>Fleming v.

Appellant\u2019s attempt to equate the abolition of assumption of risk as a defense in FELA actions to a judicial mandate to refuse to instruct the jury on the doctrine in such cases misstates the law. An instruction that directs the jury <em>not to consider </em>assumption of risk as a defense is not unusual. When evidence is adduced at trial implicating the doctrine of assumption of risk, the trial court is charged with adequately distinguishing conduct constituting contributory negligence from conduct covered by the doctrine of assumption of risk. <em>See Jenkins v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., </em>22 F.3d 206, 212 (9th Cir.1994) (agreeing with other circuit courts of appeal that, when the evidence so requires, an instruction on assumption of risk \u201cprevent[s] the jury from considering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>the forbidden defense of assumption of the risk while allowing it to make factual findings on the issue of comparative negligence\u201d (alteration in original) (internal quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In fact, reviewing courts have found reversible error in FELA cases involving a trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on assumption of risk. <em>See, e.g., Koshorek v. Pa. R.R. Co., </em>318 F.2d 364, 369-70 (3rd Cir.1963); <em>Hamrock v. Consol. Rail Corp., </em>151 Ill.App.3d 55, 103 Ill.Dec. 736, 501 N.E.2d 1274, 1280 (1986), <em>appeal denied by, </em>113 Ill.2d 574, 106 Ill.Dec. 47, 505 N.E.2d 353 (1987). Appellate courts have also upheld a trial court\u2019s decision to propound a jury instruction on assumption of risk. <em>See, e.g., Atl. Coast Line R. Co. v. Burkett, </em>192 F.2d 941, 943 (5th Cir.1951); <em>Vandaveer v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co., </em>78 Ill.App.2d 186, 222 N.E.2d 897, 906 (1966); <em>Mo. Pac. R.R. Co. v.

Co., </em>355 Mo. 362, 196 S.W.2d 163, 169 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Contributory Negligence v. Assumption of Risk</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Because contributory negligence reduces a plaintiffs damages under FELA while assumption of risk does not, \u201ccourts have the delicate job of separating out evidence on one theory from evidence on the other.\u201d <em>Fashauer, </em>57 F.3d at 1274. When the doctrine of assumption of risk is inapplicable under the facts of a given case, \u201ccourts should spare juries intricate descriptions of opaque legal doctrines;\u201d however, when \u201cthe facts of the case present a danger of jury confusion on the issue, an assumption of risk charge should be given.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1275. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-9\">[W]hen the evidence adduced at trial presents a danger that the jury might reduce a plaintiffs recovery based on the impermissible theory of assumption of risk, then the trial judge should instruct the jury on how that doctrine differs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>from contributory negligence. But when the evidence presents no such danger, then an adequate charge on contributory and comparative negligence suffices. Of course, the most difficult part of the inquiry is determining when the facts merit an assumption of the risk instruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u201cAlthough there is some overlap between assumption of risk and contributory negligence, generally the two defenses are not interchangeable.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Burlington N.R.R. Co., </em>787 F.2d 1309, 1316 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">At common law an employee\u2019s voluntary, knowledgeable acceptance of a dangerous condition that is necessary for him to perform his duties constitutes an assumption of risk. Contributory negligence, in contrast, is a careless act or omission on the plaintiffs part tending to add new dangers to conditions that the employer negligently created or permitted to exist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-7\"><em>Fashauer, </em>57 F.3d at 1275 (quoting <em>Taylor, </em>787 F.2d at 1316). A finding of contributory negligence on the basis of an employee\u2019s \u201cknowledge that a dangerous condition in his line of duty existed and his working in that line of duty,\u201d nonetheless, is actually \u201cassumption of risk masquerading under another name.\u201d <em>Rivera v. Farrell Lines, Inc., </em>474 F.2d 255, 257-58 (2d Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 822, 94 S.Ct. 122, 38 L.Ed.2d 55 (1973). In other words, evidence of a plaintiffs \u201cknowledgeable acceptance of a dangerous condition\u201d implicates the defense of assumption of the risk, not contributory negligence. <em>Joyce v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>651 F.2d 676, 682-83 (10th Cir.1981); <em>see also Koshorek, </em>318 F.2d at 367 (\u201c[Ajssumption of risk is a matter of knowledge of the danger and intelligent acquiescence in it, while contributory negligence is a matter of some fault or departure from the standard of reasonable conduct, however unwilling or protesting the plaintiff may be.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Noting that the concept of assumption of risk \u201coften is used as an umbrella term to describe a number of discrete and dissimilar concepts\u201d in <em>Fashauer, </em>the United States Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Appeals for the Third Circuit discussed \u201cwhat theory of assumption of risk Congress sought to prohibit when it barred the defense under the FELA.\u201d <em>Fashauer, </em>57 F.3d at 1275-76. The Court elucidated: \u201cIn our view, the history behind the FELA and the Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncements in pre-and post-FELA cases makes clear that assumption of risk in the employment context refers to implied consent,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>an employee\u2019s implied consent to assume the risks entailed in employment. <em>Id. </em>at 1279. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-4\">A plaintiff\u2019s recovery under the FELA never can be reduced on the basis that he or she implicitly consented to the risk by accepting employment with the railroad or by performing a task in the manner which the employer directed. This is true regardless of whether the plaintiff acted reasonably or unreasonably. Thus, even when a jury examining a plaintiffs position objectively would conclude that he acted unreasonably in accepting employment, or performing a task at all, such unreasonable actions for FELA purposes are characterized as assumption of risk rather than contributory negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">In so holding, the Court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">[I]f no evidence of impermissible assumption of risk has reached the jury, a correct instruction on contributory negligence will do. However, if, either because of evidence introduced at trial or because of statements made by counsel in opening or closing arguments, there is a risk that the implied consent theory of assumption of the risk seeped its way into the case, the jury should be instructed that it may not find contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff ... simply because he acceded to the request or direction of the responsible representatives of his employer that he work at a dangerous job, or in a dangerous place, or under unsafe conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afv\"><em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>sufficient evidence was adduced at trial to support the giving of a jury instruction on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>assumption of risk. In reaching this conclusion, we focus our attention on the evidence appellant presented at trial regarding appellees\u2019 choice of work or work site.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Appellant elicited testimony from appellees regarding their choice to work in the rail yards with mainline ballast. For instance, appellant\u2019s counsel questioned Young as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] To your knowledge, [ ] Young, there are a number of people who have worked at Jessup for quite some time, fair to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">[YOUNG:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] And they have seniority like yourself, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">[YOUNG:] Some would, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] So if they, like yourself, they could bid into another job because they have the seniority to do that, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-11\">[YOUNG:] Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-12\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] And it is your choice, is it not, to work at Jessup?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-13\">[YOUNG:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-14\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] And it has been your choice to work at that facility in that yard on those walking surfaces for the ten years plus that you have been there, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-15\">[YOUNG:] Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-16\">Similarly, appellant elicited testimony from Hobgood that certain jobs involved less walking and he could decide the type of job he wanted to work based on his seniority.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-17\">Hartman also was questioned regarding his ability to chose his work site. Appellant\u2019s counsel questioned Hartman: \u201c[Y]ou worked primarily at Curtis Bay <footnotemark>[14]</footnotemark> for the last 30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>years?\u201d and \u201c[Y]ou work in Curtis Bay by choice?,\u201d to both of which Hartman answered in the affirmative. Appellant\u2019s counsel then revisited the topic of seniority, asking Hartman: \u201cAfter you have been at the railroad a few years, as your seniority grows, you can choose where you want to work[?],\u201d to which Hartman agreed. Appellant\u2019s counsel continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqs\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] If you get some other fellows behind you to climb up the ladder a little bit, you can choose where you want to work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\">[HARTMAN:] That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] So you can choose to work in some other yard if you didn\u2019t like working in Curtis Bay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">[HARTMAN:] Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] I gather since you have worked there for 30 years, most of your time, that yard is fine for you to work in as far as you can tell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmS\">[HARTMAN:] I am not sure I understand your question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoJ\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: You have chosen to work there, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">[HARTMAN:] Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">In closing argument, appellant\u2019s counsel highlighted the choices made by Davidson, Hobgood, Fedorchak, Bickerstaff, Young, Hartman, and Zientek with regard to their particular jobs and the yards at which they worked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-12\">All right. Choice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-13\">[ ] Davidson, he chose to work a job out of Hanover, Pennsylvania. You hear that was a little bit easier than some others and his seniority allows him to do that and that\u2019s what he chooses to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-14\">[ ] Hobgood has enough seniority he can work any job he wants and he currently chooses to work a flagman\u2019s job.... He has worked out on the road since 1979. That\u2019s the job he has chosen to do. He has really not worked in the yards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>[ ] Fedorchak, he likes to change jobs every so often, so every six months or so he goes to another job and works it. He has been in Bayview<footnotemark>[15]</footnotemark> for the last year and a half.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">[ ] Bickerstaff is a car man. He seniority [sic] to work in the car shop if he wanted to, but he likes working outside, he likes working in the yard, <em>particularly at Locust Point.</em><footnotemark><em>[16 </em>]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">[ ] Young, he has a lot of seniority. That\u2019s what makes it possible for him to work at Jessup<footnotemark>[17]</footnotemark> which is one of the most popular places to work, that that\u2019s where he chooses to work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\">[ ] Hartman, he also has a lot of seniority. And he likes Curtis Bay. So that\u2019s where he has been working most of the last 30 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-9\">[] Zientek, he has enough seniority. He went back to Brunswick.<footnotemark>[18]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">(Emphasis added). The evidence adduced and argument presented concerning appellees\u2019 choice of work or work site thus support the inference that appellees voluntarily and knowingly accepted the dangers inherent in working for appellant when they performed their jobs. Such evidence and argument increased the risk that, in the absence of an instruction, 'the jury would improperly infer that appellees had assumed the risk in performing their work. Therefore, the subject jury charge adequately, and quite appropriately, distinguished between conduct constituting contributory negligence and conduct constituting assumption of risk. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in giving a jury instruction on assumption of risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Statute of Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Appellant contends that the issue of whether the claims of six appellees, Bickerstaff, Brown, Davidson, Hobgood, Short, and Young, were time barred under 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56, the statute of limitations applicable in FELA actions, should have been submitted to the jury.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, appellant argues, the court erred in ruling that their claims were timely as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Section 56 provides: \u201cNo action shall be maintained under this act unless commenced within three years from the day the cause of action accrued.\u201d Bickerstaff was the first to file his complaint on December 22, 2004. Brown, Davidson, Hobgood, Short, and Young followed suit, filing their claims on February 14, 2005. Thus the critical date of accrual for Bickerstaffs cause of action was December 22, 2001, and the date of accrual for the actions of Brown, Davidson, Hobgood, Short, and Young was February 14, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">Trial Court\u2019s Ruling: Timely as a Matter of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">At the close of appellees\u2019 case, appellant moved for judgment based on FELA\u2019s three year statute of limitations with regard to Bickerstaff, Brown, Davidson, Hobgood, Short, and Young. The court denied appellant\u2019s motions, ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-11\">The Court feels that the issue[ ] of statute of limitations more appropriately [is] a jury question in light of the evidence that\u2019s been submitted and the argumentf ] made is that the issue as to statute of limitations as to all of those [six appellees] will be submitted to the jury for the jury\u2019s determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>At the close of all evidence, appellant renewed its motion as to Bickerstaff, Brown, Davidson, Hobgood, Short, and Young. The court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">[T]he Court notes that while [appellees] [are] not allowed to ignore medical conditions and [are] required to seek out appropriate medical treatment, the Court is reminded that case law is very clear that the mere fact that one has pain in the workday does not mean that it necessitates going to the doctor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">The Court turns it and reviews the facts and circumstances before it. There is sufficient evidence before the Court that the Court will deny the motion as to the statute of limitations as to each of said [appellees], and all other matters will go to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Appellant also presented to the court several instructions on the statute of limitations. The trial court chose not to give the instructions, instead informing the parties that appellant\u2019s motion for judgment was denied and that appellees\u2019 claims were timely filed as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Standard Applied in FELA Actions</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">In <em>Miller, </em>we set forth the standard used when analyzing the statute of limitations in FELA cases. We stated: \u201cIn evaluating limitations in a FELA context ... \u2018the standard <em>is more lenient </em>than that which applies in the ordinary action.\u2019 \u201d 159 Md.App. at 150, 858 A.2d 1025 (quoting <em>Crisman v. Odeco, Inc., </em>932 F.2d 413, 416 n. 2 (5th Cir.1991) (emphasis added in <em>Miller)). </em>When, as in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the nature of a plaintiffs injuries involve \u201ca gradually progressive and almost indiscernible decline,\u201d as opposed to a \u201cdramatic physical accident,\u201d we apply \u201cthe discovery rule\u201d to determine the accrual date of the FELA action. <em>Id. </em>at 150-51, 858 A.2d 1025.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">\u201c[T]he discovery rule fixes accrual at the time the plaintiff first becomes aware of both 1) the existence of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>injury and 2) the cause of the injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151, 858 A.2d 1025. A plaintiff is \u201cnot obliged to discover his medical condition,\u201d but \u201conce that medical condition is known to him, [he must] explore its legal implications within the limitations deadline.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151-52, 858 A.2d 1025. Further, \u201c \u2018[w]hen the specific date of injury cannot be determined because an injury results from continual exposure to a harmful condition over a period of time, the cause of action does not accrue until the injury manifests itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152, 858 A.2d 1025 (quoting <em>Rogers v. Illinois Cent. R.R. Co., </em>833 S.W.2d 426, 427 (Mo.App.1992)). Therefore, a claim in such case is deemed to accrue under FELA \u201c \u2018when the claimant becomes aware or has reason to be aware that he has been injured and is aware or has reason to be aware of the cause of his injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153, 858 A.2d 1025 (quoting <em>Rogers, </em>833 S.W.2d at 428).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">We went on to explain that in the \u201c \u2018case of actual knowledge, the cause of action accrues when the character of the condition and its cause first come together for the plaintiff.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Rogers, </em>833 S.W.2d at 428) (internal quotation omitted). The \u201cshould have known\u201d test, however, is not a \u201ccould have known\u201d test. <em>Id. </em>\u201c \u2018Rather, it requires a very substantial common-sense likelihood that a reasonably careful person would discover the existence of the injury and its cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Rogers, </em>833 S.W.2d at 428).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">In deciphering the accrual of a FELA action, the trial court has \u201conly three legal possibilities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 150, 858 A.2d 1025. When the evidence is \u201cso clear, decisive, and unequivocal\u201d that the plaintiff had the requisite awareness more than three years prior to the filing of the claim, the trial judge is charged with deciding as a matter of law that the statute of limitations has run. <em>Id. </em>When, however, the evidence is \u201cso clear, decisive, and unequivocal\u201d that the plaintiff did not have the requisite awareness until after that date, the judge must decide the issue as a matter of law in the plaintiffs favor. <em>Id. </em>Lastly, and statistically the category in which most cases fall, is the \u201c80% bulge of the bell-shaped curve where there [is] some plausible evidence pointing in each direction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>der the third scenario, \u201cthe resolution of the limitations issue [is] quintessentially a matter of fact and not a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Appellant maintains that appellant \u201cwas entitled, at the very least, to submit the question of timeliness to the jury,\u201d because there was evidence that Bickerstaff, Brown, Davidson, Hobgood, Short, and Young knew or had reason to know of their alleged knee injuries (plus back injury for Brown) and that those injuries were work-related more than three years before filing their claims. Therefore, appellant concludes that it is entitled to a new trial on whether the claims of those six appellees were timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">In its brief, appellant outlines the testimony of Bickerstaff, Brown, Davidson, Hobgood, Short, and Young showing that each individual began having knee (and in the case of Brown, knee and back) problems more than three years prior to the filing of their claims. Appellant argues that their testimony was \u201csufficient to create a jury question as to whether each of these [appellees] knew or <em>had reason to know </em>of his alleged medical condition more than three years before filing his claim\u2014especially given [appellees\u2019] affirmative duty to investigate any symptoms.\u201d (Emphasis in original). Appellant also points to the testimony of appellees\u2019 own expert that \u201cthe relationship between occupational activities and osteoarthritis is not a \u2018secret in the medical community,\u2019 \u201d and argues that, \u201cif [appellees] had sought medical care when they experienced their initial symptoms\u2014as they were required to do under the discovery rule\u2014... they would have learned about the alleged connection between their medical conditions and their employment for [appellant].\u201d Appellant concludes that Bickerstaff, Brown, Davidson, Hobgood, Short, and Young \u201cknew or had reason to know that their alleged medical conditions were allegedly work related more than three years before filing their claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Appellees respond that, \u201cin light of the evidence presented at trial, including [appellant\u2019s] persistent position that [appellees] suffer from no significant symptoms of osteoarthritis and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>to the extent they may, that such condition is entirely unrelated to their decades of railroad service, the trial court properly ruled that all six [appellees\u2019] claims were timely filed.\u201d According to appellees, appellant\u2019s \u201cextensive efforts to establish that [appellees] were not injured and that the injuries were entirely unrelated to any railroad work ... negated its statute of limitations defense.\u201d Moreover, appellees contend that appellant\u2019s argument seeks to impose \u201cthe onerous duty ... on every railroad worker\u201d to investigate, research, and seek out immediate medical treatment to discover the origin and extent of any ache or pain, and \u201cto oversell as significant that which any reasonable and rationale person would find trivial, particularly in light of the physically demanding jobs [appellees] performed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">In <em>Miller, </em>the appellee, an injured railroad employee, brought a FELA action against the railroad, the appellant, seeking to recover damages for the osteoarthritis that he developed in both knees during the course of his employment as a conductor. 159 Md.App. at 148, 858 A.2d 1025. On January 20, 1997, after the appellee awoke with a swollen left knee, he went to the emergency room at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. <em>Id. </em>His knee was x-rayed, and the appellee was prescribed aspirin and told to put ice packs on his knee for the swelling and to return to the hospital if the swelling got any worse or began to burn inside. <em>Id. </em>Following his visit to Bayview, the swelling went down and the pain went away. <em>Id. </em>The appellee had no problem with his knee for the next three and one-half years. <em>Id. </em>at 149, 858 A.2d 1025. Two days after the appellee left Bayview, an x-ray report was prepared; the report read \u201costeoarthritis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157, 858 A.2d 1025. The appellee never saw the x-ray and was never informed about it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">When questioned at trial about the existence of pain prior to his emergency room visit, the appellee testified that he had earlier pains in his knees, which he attributed to the process of aging. <em>Id. </em>The appellee had felt pain in his knees on and off since the early 1990\u2019s. <em>Id. </em>at 159, 858 A.2d 1025.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>In August 2000, the appellee\u2019s knee \u201cgave out\u201d while he was getting ready to throw a switch. <em>Id. </em>at 149, 858 A.2d 1025. Following treatment by his family doctor, the appellee returned to work, but due to continuing pain or discomfort, was referred to an orthopedic specialist, who diagnosed the appellee\u2019s condition as osteoarthritis. <em>Id. </em>The appellee filed his claim on August 13, 2001. <em>Id. </em>at 150, 858 A.2d 1025.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The \u201ccritical question\u201d before this Court in <em>Miller </em>was whether prior to August 13,1998, three years before the filing of his claim, the appellee \u201cknew or should have known both 1) that he was suffering from osteoarthritis in one or both of his knees, and 2) that the osteoarthritis was attributable to his years of pounding the ballast trail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 155, 858 A.2d 1025. We turned our attention to the appellee\u2019s 1997 visit to Bay-view, noting that if the cause of action accrued at the time of that visit, the appellee\u2019s FELA claim was time-barred. <em>Id. </em>at 155-56, 858 A.2d 1025. Dismissing the appellant\u2019s contention that the appellee should have been charged with knowledge of his osteoarthritis in 1997, we concluded that the evidence presented \u201ca jury question <em>at most. </em>\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 158, 858 A.2d 1025 (emphasis added). We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">[The appellant] purports to be aghast at [the appellee\u2019s] failure to have called Bayview back and to have insisted on learning what impression, if any, was made of his x-ray. [The appellant] strongly suggests, without quite saying so, that under the \u201cshould have known\u201d standard, [the appellee] should be charged with the knowledge of that impression. As it then proceeds to pose the accrual issue, [the appellant], without so much as a \u201cby your leave,\u201d treats [the appellee\u2019s] state of self-awareness as, indeed, charged with such knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">[The appellant] seems to posit, in that regard, some sort of intellectual or professional imperative to chase down the answer to every pending inquiry. There might, to be sure, be some such imperative churning within the reasonable operating surgeon, always fearful of malpractice suits; in the reasonable tort lawyer, always looking for an edge at the trial table; or in the reasonable national security officer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>always sensitive to the chance of a Congressional investigation. It is, at the very most, no more than a jury question, however, whether any such psychic imperative burns in the breast of the reasonable railroad worker. The reasonable railroad worker, to the extent that he thinks about it at all, might well be content to believe that a satisfactory x-ray result has been implicitly folded into the diagnosis, the prescription, and the presumptively final discharge that Bayview gave him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Although we held in <em>Miller </em>that the court did not err in refusing to grant the appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment on limitations grounds, we indicated that, under the circumstances of the case, the trial judge would not have erred if he had ruled that the appellee\u2019s claim was timely as a matter of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">Our review of the evidence satisfies us that there was, at most, a jury question as to whether [the appellee\u2019s] awareness of the medical situation was such that the cause of action accrued in January of 1997, to wit, before August 13, 1998. To the extent to which we might harbor any tinge of doubt about the existence of a genuine jury question, moreover, our tilt would be decidedly toward a ruling, as a matter of law, in favor of [the appellee] and not toward a ruling, as a matter of law, in favor of [the appellant]. Whether there might have been a ruling in favor of [the appellee], as a matter of law, however, is a moot point, for whatever arguably should have been done as a matter of law was done as a matter of fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">On slender evidence in this case, [the appellant] got the benefit of having the limitations issue treated as a jury question. It may have gotten more than it deserved.

Clinchfield Railroad Company, </em>288 F.2d 499, 500 (4th Cir.1961), the appellee, a former railroad worker, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>brought a FELA action claiming that he developed silicosis from inhaling silica during the course of his employment with the appellant, a railroad company. On appeal, the appellant complained that the district court erred in deciding as a matter of law that the appellee\u2019s claim was not time-barred. <em>Id. </em>The appellant argued that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-5\">although a medical diagnosis of silicosis was not made until August, 1956, less than three years before suit was filed, there was evidence tending to show that [the appellee] should have known his condition earlier. [The appellant] relie[d] on the fact that [the appellee] quit his job in the summer of 1954, partly at least because of shortness of breath. [The appellant] reasons that as [the appellee] came from a mining region where silicosis is fairly common, he is to be charged with knowing that shortness of breath is one of the symptoms of this disease, and hence [the appellee] had reason to know as early as 1954 that he had contracted silicosis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Because (1) the appellee had complained of several ailments, in addition to shortness of breath prior to terminating his employment with the appellant, (2) shortness of breath was indicative of medical conditions other than silicosis, and (3) no physician prior to the appellee\u2019s diagnosis intimated that the appellee had developed the disease despite the appellee\u2019s \u201cfrequent sojourns to the hospital,\u201d the Court concluded that the appellee was not reasonably expected to know of his condition. <em>Id. </em>at 503-04. Accordingly, the Court held that the district court properly refused to submit the issue of limitations to the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">The critical question before this Court in the instant case is whether Bickerstaff, Brown, Davidson, Hobgood, Short, and Young knew or had reason to know, more than three years before filing their claims, (1) that they suffered osteoarthritis and/or torn menisci to their knees and, in the case of Brown, a herniated disc to his back, and (2) that these conditions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>work-related. We first examine their testimony and other evidence on this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Bickerstaff initially experienced left knee pain in 1994 but did not seek treatment until 2004, when he saw Dr. Constantine Misoul on the advice of counsel. Bickerstaff described his initial pain as \u201c[j]ust a tingling sensation, a throbbing.\u201d Dr. Misoul testified that in 2004 Bickerstaff reported that he had been having \u201cproblems with both of his knees for ten years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Brown testified that he first experienced back pain in 2000. At that time he received pain medication from his family physician. He did not seek any medical treatment beyond his family doctor until November IB, 2004, when he saw Dr. Misoul on the advice of counsel. At the time that he saw Dr. Misoul, Brown\u2019s back was \u201csore[ ]\u201d and \u201creally bothering [him],\u201d and his right knee was \u201caching and sore.\u201d Dr. Misoul indicated that in 2004 Brown told him that he had been experiencing back and knee pain \u201con and off for many years,\u201d which Dr. Misoul understood to mean more than five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Davidson started experiencing pain in his right and left knees in approximately 1999. He described the feeling as \u201cpains stooping down, kneeling climbing, walking;\u201d he stated that his knees \u201ccreaked or popped\u201d and that he \u201chad a lot of pain.\u201d Dr. Misoul testified that, in 2004, Davidson reported that he had been having \u201cright knee difficulties for five years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Hobgood testified that he first started experiencing problems with his knees in 2001. He mentioned the knee pain to his family doctor but did not seek treatment until he was advised to do so by counsel in November 2004. Hobgood testified to having reported to Dr. William Launder in 2005 that he had knee pain from 1995 through 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">Short\u2019s knee pain began intermittently in 2001. He did not seek treatment until he was advised to see Dr. Misoul by counsel in December 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">Young testified that he began to experience knee pain in 1999. Young complained of knee problems to his family physician in 1999 and was referred to an orthopedic doctor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>who recommended arthroscopic surgery, which Young refused. Dr. Douglas Shepard, an expert witness called by appellant, testified that in 2004 Young complained of a \u201cfive-year history of bilateral or both-sided knee pain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Appellant contends that the above facts constitute \u201csome plausible evidence\u201d that the six appellees knew or should have known of their knee and/or back conditions prior to February 14, 2002, or, in Bickerstaff s case, prior to December 22, 2001. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">It is undisputed from the evidence that Bickerstaff, Brown, Davidson, Hobgood, and Short were not diagnosed with osteoarthritis, torn menisci, or a herniated disc more than three years before the filing of their claims. Appellant concedes that \u201cthe primary diagnoses, treatments, surgeries, and prognoses for [appellees\u2019] medical conditions\u201d were provided by physicians to whom appellees\u2019 counsel referred these appellees in 2004. Although Brown and Hobgood visited a family physician prior to February 14, 2002, neither man was diag-' nosed, and Brown was only prescribed pain medication. There is no other evidence that they knew or should have known that they had a medical condition to their knees or back.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The generalized aches and pains of these appellees occurring before the three year limitations period were not sufficient to charge them with \u201creason to know\u201d that they had a work-related medical injury, especially in the context of other causes, like the aging process and the rigors of working a physically demanding job.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018An employee\u2019s mere suspicion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>of an injury or its probable cause, standing alone, is not the operative standard for determining when a cause of action accrues under FELA.\u2019 \u201d <em>Miller, </em>159 Md.App. at 160, 858 A.2d 1025 (quoting <em>Gay v. Norfolk and W. Ry. Co., </em>253 Va. 212, 483 S.E.2d 216, 219 (1997)). Therefore, the trial court did not err in determining that the claims of Bickerstaff, Brown, Davidson, Hobgood, and Short were timely filed under 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Young, however, went to see his physician, was referred to an orthopedic specialist, and declined the specialist\u2019s recommended treatment, arthroscopic surgery. Thus, because a jury could infer from that evidence that Young was diagnosed with osteoarthritis or torn menisci and therefore knew or had reason to know of a knee injury, we direct our attention to the question of whether he knew or had reason to know that his medical condition was work-related.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Appellant acknowledges that Young testified that he did not learn that his medical condition was work-related until appellees\u2019 counsel referred him to a physician in 2003 or 2004. The only evidence cited by appellant to support its argument that Young should have been aware of the link between his medical condition and appellant\u2019s work conditions was Young\u2019s testimony that, in his opinion, walking on large ballast was unstable, like walking on ice. On that testimony alone, we can \u201cclear[ly], decisively], and unequivocally]\u201d conclude that Young did not know, nor should he have known, that his knee problems were work-related prior to February 14, 2002. <em>See Miller, </em>159 Md.App. at 150, 858 A.2d 1025. Therefore, the court did not err in ruling that Young\u2019s claim was timely as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Evidence of Retirement Age</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Appellant\u2019s next claim of error involves the computation of damages, namely, appellees\u2019 loss of future earnings as a result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>of their injuries. In discussing the computation of the appellee\u2019s loss of future earnings in <em>Tiller, </em>179 Md.App. at 321, 944 A.2d 1272 we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">The calculation is straightforward. Once the multiplicand of lost wages for the present year is established, the multiplier is then the number of years between the employee\u2019s current age and the age at which the employee would ordinarily have been expected to stop working if the injury had not occurred. That expectation inevitably involves some degree of speculation. A number of factors may enter into the making of what amounts to such an educated guess. One significant factor, of course, is the announced intention of the employee himself. Even if an employee is eligible to retire at age 60, he is not required to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">In the instant case, each appellee testified that, prior to his injury, he intended to continue working until age 64 or 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Appellant contends that the court abused its discretion in refusing to allow appellant to cross-examine appellees\u2019 economist, Dr. Bruce Hamilton, with regard to statistics showing that most employees in the railroad industry retire close to 60, not 65. Consequently, appellant argues that Dr. Hamilton, in predicting each appellee\u2019s future lost income, improperly accepted each appellee\u2019s testimony that he intended to work until age 64 or 65 and made \u201cno reduction for the risk of an earlier retirement.\u201d According to appellant, had the court allowed appellant to cross-examine Dr. Hamilton with the retirement-age statistics, \u201cthe jury very well could have concluded that it was \u2018reasonably certain\u2019 that some or all [appellees] would have retired earlier than they claimed during their testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Appellees counter that appellant never sought to introduce statistics on the retirement age in the railroad industry. First, appellees argue that appellant merely questioned Dr. Hamilton on cross-examination about his <em>aivareness </em>of statistics that a majority of railroad employees retired at age 60, never indicating an intention to introduce \u201csome learned treatise or other admissible source of evidence.\u201d Second, appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>lees assert that appellant \u201ccontinually referred to the subject matter of the evidence, namely that [appellees] were eligible to retire at age 60, in the cross[-]examination of [appellees] and of Dr. Hamilton, as well as, in opening statement and closing argument.\u201d (Footnote omitted). Thus, because the evidence appellant sought to admit \u201cis found extensively ... in this case,\u201d appellees submit that the excluded evidence was \u201cat best .. . entirely cumulative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u201cRulings on the admissibility of evidence must normally be left to the sound discretion of the trial judge in actions under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act.\u201d <em>Lavender v. Kurn, </em>327 U.S. 645, 654, 66 S.Ct. 740, 90 L.Ed. 916 (1946). In a FELA action tried in state courts, the trial court \u201cwill apply federal substantive law but state procedural law, including the state law of evidence.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>159 Md.App. at 182, 858 A.2d 1025; <em>see also St. Louis Sw. Ry. Co. v. Dickerson, </em>470 U.S. 409, 411, 105 S.Ct. 1347, 84 L.Ed.2d 303 (1985) (\u201cAs a general matter, FELA cases adjudicated in state courts are subject to state procedural rules, but the substantive law governing them is federal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">On cross-examination, Dr. Hamilton testified as to appellees\u2019 loss of future earnings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] Good afternoon, Dr. Hamilton.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-8\">[DR. HAMILTON:] Good afternoon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] I have a few questions for you. I want to talk about economics just a little bit and talk about assumptions some.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-10\">Certainly, to do the calculations that you just shared with all of us, you have to make some assumptions as you have said, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-11\">[DR. HAMILTON:] Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-12\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] I want to talk briefly about planned retirement age. Are you aware that the statis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>tics from the railroad retirement board show that just last year, the overwhelming majority of people that retire in the railroad industry were, in fact, 60 years old?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL:] Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">THE COURT: Approach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">(Whereupon, at the bench.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL:] Your Honor, at this juncture, these are not assumptions, these are things that are evidence before the jury in terms of ages and things like that. So if there is some statistics that Dr. Hamilton to see [sic], counsel ought to show it to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] Just asking him if he is aware of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\">THE COURT: The problem of it is it doesn\u2019t mean a hill of beans when it comes to individuals that are specifically plaintiffs before us. He is here as an economist and I will have to sustain the relevance. It is irrelevant to these plaintiffs and the information provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-11\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL:] Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-12\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] Statistics related to conductors and trainman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-13\">THE COURT: I am not even suggesting that you are wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-14\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-15\">THE COURT: You can ask the question of him, of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-16\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-17\">THE COURT: But based on the overall numbers as to the industry, it is not important because we\u2019re dealing with them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-20\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-21\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL:] Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-22\">(Whereupon, in open court.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>THE COURT: The objection is sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Preliminarily, we agree with appellees that appellant never sought to introduce any statistical evidence regarding the retirement age of the majority of railroad employees. Following appellees\u2019 objection, counsel conferred at the bench. At that time, appellees\u2019 counsel requested that appellant\u2019s counsel show Dr. Hamilton the statistics to which he was referring. Appellant\u2019s counsel responded that he just wanted to see if Dr. Hamilton was aware of the statistics and never informed the court that he had statistical evidence on hand to be admitted as evidence or to show to Dr. Hamilton. At no time thereafter did appellant\u2019s counsel attempt to admit the unidentified statistical information. Because appellant\u2019s counsel never offered to introduce any evidence, we agree with appellees that appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in preventing the introduction of evidence of the usual retirement age for railroad employees is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Furthermore, appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Tiller </em>is misguided. In <em>Tiller, </em>this Court considered the propriety of the trial court\u2019s exclusion of certain evidence concerning the computation of the loss of future earnings of the appellee, an injured railroad employee. 179 Md.App. at 321, 944 A.2d 1272. The evidence excluded by the trial court in <em>Tiller, </em>however, concerned the appellee\u2019s eligibility to retire with full benefits at age 60. <em>Id. </em>The appellant railroad sought to admit the evidence of retirement eligibility to convince the jury that the appellant would have retired at 60 despite his testimony to the contrary. <em>Id. </em>at 322, 944 A.2d 1272. We acknowledged that an \u201cemployee\u2019s eligibility for retirement benefits at a particular age ... is unquestionably relevant evidence as to the probable age at which the employee might have been expected to stop working.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326-27, 944 A.2d 1272. We held that future retirement or pension benefits, however, were inadmissible under the collateral source rule because their probative value was \u201ctoo attenuated to offset the potential misuse\u201d by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>the jury of the evidence to reduce the appellee\u2019s recovery against the appellant. <em>Id. </em>at 340, 944 A.2d 1272.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">We stated in <em>Tiller </em>that evidence of one\u2019s. eligibility to receive retirement benefits at age 60 is relevant and material. The question posed to Dr. Hamilton, however, did not bear on the appellees\u2019 eligibility to receive retirement benefits at age 60. Instead, appellant sought to question Dr. Hamilton, not with evidence but with purported statistical information that \u201cthe overwhelming majority of people that retire in the railroad industry were, in fact, 60 years old.\u201d Given that the question posed did not relate to appellees individually, the determination as to the relevance of Dr. Hamilton\u2019s answer fell within the trial judge\u2019s discretion. Therefore, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding appellant\u2019s cross examination question regarding industry retirement age statistics. <em>See Radman v. Harold, </em>279 Md. 167, 173, 367 A.2d 472 (1977) (\u201c[T]he admissibility of expert testimony is a matter largely within the discretion of the trial court and its action will seldom constitute a ground for reversal.\u201d); Miller, 159 Md.App. at 183, 858 A.2d 1025 (\u201cThe decision to admit or exclude \u2018expert\u2019 testimony is within the broad discretion of the trial court.\u201d (Internal quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Likewise, we are unpersuaded that, because the trial judge sustained appellees\u2019 objection to appellant\u2019s questioning of Dr. Hamilton regarding industry retirement statistics, the jury could not have concluded that appellees would have retired earlier than they had claimed in their testimony. Appellees\u2019 testimony regarding their intended age of retirement was not, as appellant asserts, \u201cdispositive proof on the subject.\u201d Rather, throughout the trial, the jury was repeatedly reminded that appellees were eligible to retire at age 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Apportionment of Appellees\u2019 Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Appellant contends that the trial court erroneously refused to allow the jury to apportion appellees\u2019 damages \u201camong [appellant\u2019s] own negligence, [appellees\u2019] contributory negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>gence, <em>and other causes.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Appellant submits that \u201cthere was substantial evidence that Lappellees\u2019] medical conditions\u2014even if attributable, in part, to negligence of [appellant]\u2014had other significant causes such as obesity, smoking, other pre-existing medical conditions, and age.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Appellees assert that the trial court correctly declined appellant\u2019s request to allow the jury to apportion damages, because no evidence existed that appellees suffered \u201cincapacitation, disability or pain\u201d prior to the time they began working for appellant. Moreover, even assuming error, appellees argue that the court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on apportionment of damages was harmless, because appellant argued apportionment of damages as part of its comparative negligence defense. Appellees point out that appellant \u201cstrongly <em>and successfully </em>\u201d argued the existence of other medical causation factors in closing argument. (Emphasis in original). Appellees attribute the jury\u2019s apportionment of 10% to 40% of fault to appellees\u2019 contributory negligence as proof that \u201cthe jury accepted [appellant\u2019s] position\u201d with regard to other factors causing appellees\u2019 injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">At trial, appellant requested three instructions on apportionment<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and provided the court with a proposed verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>sheet that allowed the jury to assign liability to \u201cother factors\u201d in addition to appellant\u2019s negligence and appellees\u2019 contributory negligence. The court declined to use appellant\u2019s requested instructions or verdict sheet, rejecting appellant\u2019s argument as a request for a \u201csecond reduction\u201d of the jury\u2019s damage award. Appellant noted its exception, arguing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">Essentially, we would indicate to the Court that we feel it is error in this case not to instruct the jury as to how they are permitted to apportion damages under the FELA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">We think it is clear, Your Honor, that under the FELA, the jury is entitled to apportion damages. Not only to the negligence of an individual plaintiff and the negligence of a defendant but also to other causes. And we have case law that I would like to proffer to the Court that supports that proposition and I have brought with me copies of the cases</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">We feel, Your Honor, that the jury should be instructed as to apportionment that they are entitled to make apportionment between negligence on the part of either of the parties as well as preexisting health conditions such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>preexisting arthritis, preexisting age considerations, preexisting weight problems, preexisting other health problems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">If that\u2019s the case, then what you are suggesting is that the jury is not weighing as to the damages as a result of the actual cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">The Court\u2019s position is that the jury is only to award damages if there is a cause directly related to the negligence in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">And that when they get to dealing with the actual apportionment, it is whether or not the directly related result from the negligence causes the jury to come to an amount and then the apportionment is based on the actual injury as the result of negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">The apportionment that you ask is for a second reduction of that based on something that shouldn\u2019t be in the calculation at all. That\u2019s a matter of argument by [appellant] to the jury as to he has a problem, and it shouldn\u2019t be in your calculation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-10\">It is clear that, however, the instruction that goes to this is, even if there is an existing situation and there is an aggravation of the existing situation, the calculation is based on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-11\">Your exception is noted for the record, but the Court wants to make it very clear that when you are asking for an instruction that is a reduction based on what shouldn\u2019t be calculated in the amount of damages in the first place at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-12\">Your exception is noted for the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">The verdict sheet given to the jury presented the following four questions as to each appellee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-14\">1) Do you find by a preponderance of the evidence that [appellant] was negligent and that such negligence caused or contributed to the condition complained of by [appellee]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-15\">Yes.__ No_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>If your answer is \u201cNo\u201d to Question 1, skip Questions 2-4 ....

As previously discussed, FELA provides for diminution of damages in cases in which the employee\u2019s negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>gence contributed to his own injuries. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 53.

In cases involving third-party negligence, the employee is entitled to full recovery from the employer, and the employer may bring separate indemnification and contribution action against the jointly-liable tortfeasor. <em>Id. </em>at 162, 123 S.Ct. 1210.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The <em>Ayers </em>Court, however, left undisturbed a long line of FELA case law in which courts permitted the apportionment of damages for non-negligent causes. <em>See, e.g., Sauer v. Burlington N. R.R. Co., </em>106 F.3d 1490, 1494-95 (10th Cir.1996) (upholding the jury\u2019s apportionment of damages in a FELA case and concluding that evidence of apportionment need not be precise); <em>Stevens v. Bangor &amp; Aroostook R.R. Co., </em>97 F.3d 594, 601, 603 (1st Cir.1996) (noting that apportionment is permitted under FELA when the evidence lends itself to a separation of the causes); <em>Lancaster v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co., </em>773 F.2d 807, 822-23 (7th Cir.1985) (acknowledging that apportionment is proper in FELA cases when \u201cthe tort victim is highly vulnerable to injury and the damages he suffered must therefore be discounted (multiplied) by the probability, distinctly less than one, that but for the tort he would have lived a normal life\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>480 U.S. 945, 107 S.Ct. 1602, 94 L.Ed.2d 788 (1987); <em>Evans v. United Arab Shipping Co., </em>790 F.Supp. 516, 519 (D.N.J.1992) (stating that when \u201can employer\u2019s negligence aggravated a preexisting condition ... the defendant must compensate the plaintiff only for the aggravation itself and not for the preexisting condition\u201d), <em>aff'd, 4 </em>F.3d 207 (3rd Cir.1993). Hence, FELA permits apportionment of damages for non-negligent causes of the employee\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Likewise, recent appellate cases establish that FELA permits the jury to apportion damages when the employee\u2019s damages were caused by the employer and a non-negligent factor. <em>See, e.g., Schultz v. Ne. Ill. Reg\u2019l Commuter R.R. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number><em>Corp., </em>201 Ill.2d 260, 266 Ill.Dec. 892, 775 N.E.2d 964, 974 (2002) (\u201c[I]n FELA cases, if sufficient evidence exists to indicate that an injury may have resulted from the aggravation of a preexisting condition, the jury should be instructed that if it finds for the plaintiff on the issue of liability, it should award damages only for the aggravation of the plaintiffs preexisting condition.\u201d); <em>Nichols v. Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., </em>148 P.3d 212, 216-17 (Colo.Ct.App.2006) (upholding the trial court\u2019s jury instruction on apportionment directing the jury that, if it found the employee had a preexisting-condition and negligence on the part of the railroad, to determine \u201cthe amount of damages, if any, caused <em>only </em>by the railroad\u2019s negligence.\u201d (Emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Chief among these cases is <em>Meyer. </em>In <em>Meyer, </em>the Superior Court of Pennsylvania held that the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury on the principle of apportionment of damages when the appellee had a preexisting degenerative disc condition. 865 A.2d at 868-69. The railroad maintained on appeal that, because its experts testified at trial that the employee\u2019s herniated disc injury could have been caused by his preexisting degenerative disc condition, the railroad was entitled to charge the jury on apportionment of damages. <em>Id. </em>at 862. The court reviewed controlling federal precedent, noting that \u201cwhile a tortfeasor is subject to liability for the full extent of the injury he caused, the damages should be reduced to reflect the likelihood that the pre-existing vulnerability or condition would eventually have injured the victim notwithstanding the tortfeasor\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 863. The court concluded that, in such context, \u201capportionment clearly is within the ambit of FELA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 864. Because the jury instruction \u201cdid not cover apportionment aside from a reference to comparative negligence and did not discuss the preexisting condition as a possible cause for the injury,\u201d the court concluded that it was constrained to find reversible error for the omission of such \u201cbasic and fundamental material\u201d in the jury instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Having determined that failure to instruct the jury on apportionment in a FELA case may constitute reversible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>error, we must next determine whether there was sufficient evidence adduced at trial to support appellant\u2019s request for an instruction on apportionment of damages. <em>See, e.g., Meyer, </em>865 A.2d at 866. Upon reviewing federal law on apportionment instructions in FELA cases, the court in <em>Meyer </em>concluded that a defendant need only produce \u201csome evidence to support its proposed apportionment instruction\u201d and is \u201cnot required to demonstrate an exact percentage\u201d or a \u201cmathematical proportion\u201d representing the likelihood of the causal relationship. <em>Id. </em>at 866-67, 868. <em>See also Sauer, </em>106 F.3d at 1494 (stating that the employer\u2019s evidence \u201cneed only be sufficient to permit a rough practical apportionment\u201d and dismissing the need for \u201cexpert testimony ... precisely apportioning] the injury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">When sufficient evidence is produced, \u201c[apportionment of damages is best determined by the jury, and is properly addressed by [the court] through its instructions to the jury.\u201d <em>Rust v. Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co., </em>308 F.Supp.2d 1230, 1231 (D.Colo.2003). In light of FELA\u2019s broad remedial purposes, however, if the fact finder cannot separate injuries caused or exacerbated by the employer\u2019s negligence and other non-negligence causes, the employer is liable for all of the employee\u2019s injuries. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The case <em>sub judiee </em>clearly involves damages caused by the negligence of appellant and the contributory negligence of appellees. Focusing on whether sufficient evidence was adduced at trial of other non-negligent causes of appellees\u2019 injuries, so as to necessitate a jury instruction on apportionment of damages, we review the record for evidence of these non-negligent causes as to each appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Preliminarily, expert testimony at trial set forth the major risk factors for osteoarthritis. A \u201crisk factor,\u201d as defined by Dr. Misoul, an orthopedic surgeon called by appellees, \u201cmeans something that would <em>cause or lend someone to have </em>a certain problem or condition.\u201d (Emphasis added). Dr. Misoul testified that the major risk factors for osteoarthritis are \u201cage, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>obesity, heredity or genetic factors, acute trauma or acute injury, and repetitive or cumulative trauma.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">First, according to Dr. Misoul, age is a risk factor because \u201cas you get progressively older, closer to the 70 or 80 age, then, obviously, a larger percentage of people do develop arthritic changes\u201d because of increased stress on the joints \u201cfor longer and longer periods of time.\u201d Second, obesity increases the stress on a person\u2019s joints, noting that the leg \u201ctakes two to four times [a person\u2019s] body weight of pressure\u201d with every step. Dr. Misoul testified: \u201cSo obviously, the more you weigh, the more stress is going to cross that joint and, obviously, that joint will then deteriorate faster because of the extra weight.\u201d Third, with respect to genetics, Dr. Misoul testified that \u201cthere is a small percentage of osteoarthritis ... which occurs in hereditary-type fashion.\u201d Stated otherwise, Dr. Misoul explained: \u201c[I]f you are programmed in your genes to develop arthritis, then you should show arthritis in a lot of your joints.\u201d Fourth, Dr. Misoul described acute trauma as \u201csevere injury to a joint, such as a fracture that goes through the bone and goes through the joint, a severe knee injury where you tear through the ligaments in your knee and tear up those meniscus washer-shaped cartilage.\u201d Lastly, Dr. Mi-soul testified that repetitive or cumulative trauma results from increased and constant pressure on a joint \u201cby doing certain activities ... such as kneeling, squatting and climbing, [and] carrying heavy weights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">In performing their respective jobs as employees of appellant, all appellees shared the risk factor of repetitive or cumulative trauma. They also shared one other risk factor\u2014 age. Appellees were over 50 years of age, and the evidence presented at trial showed that more than 30 percent of men over 55 years old have osteoarthritis of the knees. We shall discuss each appellee\u2019s other risk factors in turn, as noted by appellees\u2019 doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Dr. John O\u2019Hearn was called by appellees to testify as an expert in \u201cthe area of orthopedic surgery.\u201d Dr. O\u2019Hearn testified that Zientek, Hartman, and Young were in his care.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>According to Dr. O\u2019Hearn, Zientek\u2019s genu varus, or bowleggedness, constituted a risk factor for osteoarthritis. In addition, Zientek\u2019s age and obesity were risk factors for his knee problems. Neither heredity nor acute trauma, however, were risk factors in Zientek\u2019s case. Dr. O\u2019Hearn ranked Zientek\u2019s cumulative trauma as his \u201cprimary risk factor,\u201d extra weight second, and age third.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Hartman\u2019s risk factor for osteoarthritis was his age, but heredity, obesity, or acute injury were not risk factors. In Dr. O\u2019Hearn\u2019s opinion, cumulative trauma was the \u201cnumber one risk factor,\u201d while age would be \u201cnumber two,\u201d for Hartman\u2019s knee problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">According to Dr. O\u2019Hearn, Young was \u201ca little heavier than he would like to be,\u201d but obesity in his case would not be \u201ca major risk factor.\u201d Young\u2019s bowleggedness, on the other hand would \u201ceome[ ] into play.\u201d However, Young had no history of acute trauma. In sum, Dr. O\u2019Hearn testified that Young\u2019s age and weight were lesser factors for his knee condition, while Young\u2019s bowleggedness and cumulative trauma exposure were the major risk factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Dr. David Lumsden, an orthopedic surgeon, testified on behalf of appellees regarding his patient, Bickerstaff. Dr. Lumsden described arthritis as \u201cmultifactorial, meaning that there are many factors involved in contributing to it.\u201d These include \u201cwear and tear\u201d or \u201cmicrotraumatic injury,\u201d \u201c[njutritional status,\u201d \u201c[fjitness level,\u201d \u201cdegree of previous trauma,\u201d habitus, structure, and weight. In Dr. Lumsden\u2019s opinion, Bickerstaffs left knee problems were caused by \u201cmechanical stress that occurred over time as a cumulative effect.\u201d According to Dr. Lumsden, that Bickerstaff was overweight had a \u201crelatively minor\u201d effect on his knee problems. While other factors, including Bickerstaffs nutrition, may have played a role, Dr. Lumsden concluded that the \u201cprimary issue was a mechanical stress placed on him from the environment with which he worked.\u201d Dr. Misoul also testified that \u201coccupation [was] a major contributing factor to the development of the problems on the side of [Bickerstaffs] knee.\u201d Bickerstaffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>age was a \u201csmall risk factor\u201d and his weight was also a risk factor, although Dr. Misoul did not comment on the degree of risk from Bickerstaff s weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">In regard to Brown, Dr. Misoul testified that, in his opinion, \u201coccupation is a major risk factor in the development of [Brown\u2019s] low-back problems.\u201d Furthermore, Dr. Misoul concluded that \u201coccupation is a major causative factor of the arthritic changes that [were] found inside of [Brown\u2019s] knee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Dr. Misoul also testified regarding Davidson. According to Dr. Misoul, Davidson\u2019s \u201coccupation is a major contributing factor to the development of the problems he has in his knee,\u201d while his age \u201cis a very small factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">In regards to Fedorchak, Dr. Misoul concluded that \u201chis occupation is a major causative force in the development of his knee problems,\u201d while \u201c[h]is age is a very, very small factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Dr. Misoul noted that Hobgood had suffered a gunshot wound to the left leg, but his opinion was that it was not \u201csignificant to his knee problem.\u201d Dr. Misoul \u201cbelievefd] that [Hobgood\u2019s] occupation [was] a factor in the cause of his patellar femoral difficulties.\u201d Other relevant factors, however, included Hobgood\u2019s age, \u201c[h]is patellar laxity meaning he has some floppiness to his kneecaps,\u201d and \u201csome period of time [when] he was ... a runner.\u201d Dr. Misoul noted that he did not have an opinion as to \u201cwhich of the causes ... identified would be the most significant in the pathology\u201d of Hobgood\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Finally, Dr. Misoul testified concerning Short\u2019s condition. Dr. Misoul, however, did not provide an opinion regarding the cause of Short\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">In sum, in performing their respective jobs as employees of appellant, all appellees shared the risk factor of repetitive or cumulative trauma. They also shared in common one other risk factor\u2014age. In addition, several of appellees shared obesity as a risk factor. Zientek and Young had genu varus, which was also a risk factor. Hobgood had patellar laxity and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>had been a runner, both circumstances serving as risk factors.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">We conclude that this evidence was sufficient to instruct the jury on apportionment as to causes other than appellant\u2019s negligence and appellees\u2019 contributory negligence. The jury, as the fact finder, was entitled to determine what portion or percentage of damages was caused by factors other than the negligence of appellant and appellees. <em>See Rust, </em>308 F.Supp.2d at 1231. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court erred in not properly charging the jury on apportionment of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The court\u2019s error substantially prejudiced appellant\u2019s case. The jury had no opportunity to apportion damages to any causes other than appellant\u2019s negligence and appellees\u2019 contributory negligence. In fact, the verdict sheet directed the jury to apportion <em>100% </em>of appellees\u2019 damages to the negligence of the respective parties: \u201cThe total of the percentages given in your answer <em>should equal 100%. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added). For instance, in the case of Young, Dr. O\u2019Hearn testified at trial that, in his opinion, Young\u2019s knee injuries were caused 50 percent by his employment and 50 percent by his genetic bowleggedness. The jury, however, had no means of allocating any portion of Young\u2019s damages to his genetic condition. Accordingly, the jury\u2019s assignment of 80 percent fault to appellant and 20 percent to Young did not properly determine the portion of Young\u2019s damages attributable to appellant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Finally, when the court\u2019s error is coupled with the instruction that the jury could impose liability if appellant\u2019s negligence \u201cplayed any part no matter how small in bringing about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>or actually causing the injury or damages claimed,\u201d the prejudice to appellant is manifest. For these reasons we conclude that the trial court committed prejudicial error in its charge to the jury on the apportionment of damages, and thus we are constrained to vacate the judgment as to all appellees and remand for a new trial on damages.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Railroad Retirement Board Disability Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Appellant next asserts that \u201cthe trial court erred by excluding evidence of the Railroad Retirement Board disability benefits\u201d of Davidson and Young. According to appellant, such evidence is \u201cadmissible in a FELA case if the plaintiff has made a specific and direct claim of financial distress.\u201d Appellant contends that Davidson made such a claim of financial distress when he testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL:] How have you been mentally in terms of understanding that you are not going to be able to go back to work on [the] railroad?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">[DAVIDSON:] It is kind of hard, because I am worried about my bills.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-10\">On cross-examination, Davidson testified as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] As I understand your testimony this afternoon that you just gave, you\u2019ve got a couple things on your mind with respect to finances. Is that what you just told [appellees\u2019 counsel], you\u2019re concerned about paying your bills?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-12\">[DAVIDSON:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-13\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] And you are concerned about your money situation, you said, because you were planning on retiring at age 65, but now you are not going to be able to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Is that what you just said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL:] Objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">According to appellant, Young made a claim of financial distress when he testified on direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL:] Did you decide to go forward with the arthroscopic surgery at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">[YOUNG:] No, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL:] Why not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-10\">[YOUNG:] I am kind of fearful of surgery. And plus I really couldn\u2019t afford to take the time off at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-11\">On cross-examination, Young testified:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-12\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] And after those injections, you wanted to return to work at Jessup, did you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-13\">[YOUNG:] I wanted to\u2014when I was\u2014it\u2019s got a lot to do with my financial situation, too, here why I am trying to return to work. I really can\u2019t afford to be off work so long so I really did want to get back to work as soon as I thought that I could endure it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-14\">Appellant concludes that it \u201chad a right to challenge Davidson\u2019s and Young\u2019s specific and direct claims of financial distress with evidence of their [Railroad Retirement Board disability] benefits.\u201d \u201cBecause the trial court erroneously silenced [appellant] on this issue,\u201d contends appellant, the judgment in favor of Davidson and Young should be vacated and the trial court \u201cshould be instructed to conduct a new trial on damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-15\">Appellees respond that the trial court properly applied the collateral source rule to exclude evidence of any of the Railroad Retirement Board disability benefits. According to appellees, the testimony of Davidson and Young cited by appellant, when placed in context, fails to rise to the threshold necessary to be admitted under the narrow exception to the collateral source rule that requires the testimony indicate \u201ca claim of financial distress\u201d and a contention that the plaintiff \u201chas no other sufficient source of income.\u201d Appellees add that the trial court\u2019s ruling on such an evidentiary issue should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>be reversed except for a clear abuse of discretion, and that, in regard to Young,'appellant waived its alleged point of error by failing to place the issue before the trial court and failing to proffer what, if any, the Railroad Retirement Board disability benefits Young would have been entitled to. We agree with appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u201cThe collateral source rule permits an injured person to recover the full amount of his or her provable damages, \u2018regardless of the amount of compensation which the person has received for his injuries from sources unrelated to the tortfeasor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Haischer v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>381 Md. 119, 132, 848 A.2d 620 (2004) (quoting <em>Motor Vehicle Admin, v. Seidel, </em>326 Md. 237, 253, 604 A.2d 473 (1992)). Railroad Retirement Board disability benefits are a common collateral source in FELA cases, and therefore evidence of such benefits is generally inadmissible under the collateral source rule. <em>Haischer, </em>381 Md. at 132-34, 848 A.2d 620. \u201c[T]here are certain limited exceptions to the inadmissibility of collateral source evidence in FELA ... cases,\u201d however. <em>Id. </em>at 135, 848 A.2d 620. One such exception is that, \u201cif the plaintiff claims, in argument or through the introduction of evidence, that he/she is in financial distress due to the injury arising from the railroad\u2019s negligence ... <em>and has no other sufficient source of income, </em>evidence that the plaintiff is receiving Railroad Retirement benefits is admissible to rebut that claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). \u201cThe rationale for the exception is that, without it, the plaintiff may be able to paint a truly misleading picture for the jury of the extent of his/her loss and thus obtain a recovery in excess of what is warranted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 136, 848 A.2d 620. \u201cThe question then becomes whether [a plaintiff], through the argument and evidence [ ], opened the door to the admission of that evidence\u2014whether he, in fact, asserted a level of poverty that was misleading.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135, 848 A.2d 620. To answer this question, we look to whether the testimony suggests that the plaintiff \u201cwas impecunious or had no other source of income.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 136-37, 848 A.2d 620. \u201cEvidence as to [a plaintiffs] expected work-life is not only relevant, but necessary, to establish the amount of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>wage loss[J\u201d and such evidence does not open the door to collateral source evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 137, 848 A.2d 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">In the instant case, the questioning leading up to Davidson\u2019s statement that he was worried about his bills focused on Davidson\u2019s normal daily life and routines, the hobbies and activities that he enjoyed before the deterioration of his knees, and whether he enjoyed working on the railroad and with his coworkers. Finally, Davidson was asked how he had \u201cbeen mentally in terms of understanding\u201d that he would not be going back to work. Davidson\u2019s full answer was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5s\">It is kind of hard, because I am worried about my bills. I am worried about the activity I am going to be able to do when\u2014once all this is over with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">I just, mainly, I am bored. I just\u2014it is just bringing me down.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Davidson did not testify that he had no other sufficient source of income; he testified to his activities while out of work suffering from knee pain and to his feelings about those circumstances. In discussing his daily life around his house, Davidson referred to having limited mobility and suffering from pain, which prevented him from being more active. Being out of work\u2014and more or less confined to his house\u2014 resulted in Davidson being bored and worried about his bills. He did not mention hardship or neediness, nor did he complain about being destitute. In other words, Davidson was testifying to the limitations on his work and home life, and the psychological effect that had on him. He was not testifying to the fact that he lacked other sufficient sources of income. Consequently, Davidson did not paint a misleading picture of his circumstances, and thus did not open the door to evidence of his Railroad Retirement Board disability benefits. The circuit court therefore did not abuse its discretion in choosing to exclude evidence of such benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">We turn next to appellant\u2019s contention that it was erroneously precluded from introducing evidence regarding Young\u2019s Railroad Retirement Board disability benefits. We begin with the oft-cited principle that, \u201c[w]here evidence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>excluded, a proffer of substance and relevance must be made in order to preserve the issue for appeal,\u201d otherwise, \u201c[the] issue is waived on appeal.\u201d <em>Sutton v. State, </em>139 Md.App. 412, 452, 776 A.2d 47, <em>cert. denied, </em>366 Md. 249, 783 A.2d 223 (2001). \u201c[T]he question of whether the exclusion of evidence is erroneous and constitutes prejudicial error is not properly preserved for appellate review unless there has been a formal proffer of what the contents and relevance of the excluded testimony would have been.\u201d <em>Mack v. State, </em>300 Md. 583, 603, 479 A.2d 1344 (1984), <em>superseded by statute on other grounds. </em>Thus, where the \u201cissue was not preserved for appeal we are not required to review it.\u201d <em>Conyers v.

Consequently, appellant waived any argument that it was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude evidence of Young\u2019s Railroad Retirement Board disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Preclusion: The Federal Railway Safety Act</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Lastly, appellant argues that appellees\u2019 FELA claims are precluded by the Federal Railway Safety Act (\u201cFRSA\u201d), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20101 <em>et seq., </em>and the regulations promulgated thereunder. In particular, appellant relies on 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 213.103, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">Ballast; general.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-9\">Unless it is otherwise structurally supported, all track shall be supported by material which will-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>(a) Transmit and distribute the load of the track and railroad rolling equipment to the subgrade;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">(b) Restrain the track laterally, longitudinally, and vertically under dynamic loads imposed by railroad rolling equipment and thermal stress exerted by the rails;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">(c) Provide adequate drainage for the track; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">(d) Maintain proper track crosslevel, surface, and alinement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">In <em>Miller, </em>discussed <em>supra, </em>the appellant argued to this Court that the FRSA and its regulations, to wit, 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 213.103, precluded the appellee\u2019s FELA action involving personal injury from improper railroad ballast. 159 Md.App. at 161, 858 A.2d 1025. We disagreed and held that the FRSA and its regulations did not preclude the appellee\u2019s FELA suit. <em>Id. </em>at 166-67, 858 A.2d 1025. Nevertheless, \u201c[i]n order to preserve this issue for possible review by the Court of Appeals of Maryland or the United States Supreme Court,\u201d appellant contends in the instant case that this Court erred in <em>Miller </em>in concluding that the appellee\u2019s claims were not precluded by the FRSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">In <em>Miller, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">Even a surface glance at the FRSA regulation relied on by [the appellant] persuades us that it does not touch, let alone pervasively cover, the railroad yard conditions that allegedly fell short of the safe and healthy workplace environment that [the appellant] was obligated to provide for its employees. The regulation is concerned with the track and its immediately adjoining area and not with railroad yards. The obvious concern, moreover, is with the safety of the train, the prevention of derailments, and not the quality of the work place provided for employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 167, 858 A.2d 1025.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">Adopting the language of the Colorado Court of Appeals in <em>Elston v. Union Pacific Railroad Company, </em>74 P.3d 478 (Colo.Ct.App.2003), we reached the same result as that Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number><em>\u201cNothing in the language of the FRSA conflicts with or undermines the primary function of FELA. </em>Rather, the purpose of the FRSA, to promote safety in all areas of railroad operations and reduce railroad related accidents, is consistent with the goal of FELA, to promote employee safety and hold railroads liable for injuries caused by their negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\"><em>We disagree with [the] defendant that its alleged compliance with the FRSA\u2019s track safety standards precludes a finding of negligence under FELA. </em>Because walkways are not covered by the FRSA, <em>whether [the] defendant complied with these regulations is immaterial in determining whether a </em>reasonable <em>person </em>in [the] defendant\u2019s situation <em>would have provided walkways alongside its tracks.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">159 Md.App. at 170-71, 858 A.2d 1025 (quoting <em>Elston, </em>74 P.3d at 488) (emphasis added in <em>Miller).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Appellant relies primarily on <em>Norris v. Central of Georgia Railroad Company, </em>280 Ga.App. 792, 635 S.E.2d 179 (2006), a case decided after <em>Miller, </em>as authority for its claim that appellees\u2019 FELA actions are precluded by federal law and should be dismissed. In <em>Norris, </em>the appellant filed a FELA action alleging negligence on the part of the appellee, a railroad company, for maintaining an unsafe rail track consisting of mainline ballast. 635 S.E.2d at 181. The alleged negligence arose from an injury that the appellant sustained when operating a railroad switch in the appellee\u2019s rail yard. <em>Id. </em>After throwing a switch, the appellant was stung by a bee or a yellow jacket, and in reacting to the sting, tripped on ballast and injured his knee. <em>Id. </em>Following a discussion on the intersection of the FELA and the FRSA, the Court concluded: \u201cTo the extent that [the appellant\u2019s] FELA claim rests upon different ways by which [the appellee] might have supported <em>the mainline track </em>to comply with 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 213.103, the negligence claim is precluded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">The Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Norris </em>is entirely consistent with our decision in <em>Miller. </em>In <em>Miller, </em>we recognized that 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 213.103 governs the ballast along <em>the mainline track </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number><em>and not the ballast in the rail yard. See </em>159 Md.App. at 167, 858 A.2d 1025 (\u201cThe regulation is concerned with the track and its immediately adjoining area and not with railroad yards.\u201d). In <em>Norris, </em>the testimony on which the appellant relied failed to show that he stumbled on ballast not located along the mainline track. 635 S.E.2d at 183-84. Therefore, the appellant in <em>Norris </em>did not establish that his negligence claim fell outside the purview of 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 213.103. <em>Id. </em>at 184. To the contrary, in the instant case, appellees rest their FELA claims on appellant\u2019s negligence in maintaining safe walkways in the rail yards and make no mention of alternate ways in which appellant might have supported its mainline track.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Also consistent with our decision in <em>Miller </em>is <em>Hendrix v. Port Terminal Railroad Association, </em>196 S.W.3d 188 (Tex.App.2006). In <em>Hendrix, </em>the Court of Appeals of Texas considered whether the FRSA and its regulations precluded the appellant\u2019s claims for personal injuries arising out of allegations of unsafe walkway conditions and rail yard ballast that was \u201ctoo large and mixed.\u201d 196 S.W.3d at 195, 193. The appellant argued that his claims were not precluded by the FRSA. <em>Id. </em>at 393. He emphasized that (1) \u201cthe federal regulations concerning ballast deal with the safety of the track, not the safety of employees working in and around tracks,\u201d and (2) \u201che was not injured because of a track structure that was not properly supported by ballast or because the ballast did not provide proper drainage, but rather because of unsafe walkway conditions and bad footing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193 (internal quotations omitted). The appellee railroad countered, arguing that the regulations authorized by FRSA \u201cspecifically addressing ballast ... occup[y] the field with regard to the subject matter of the regulation and of rail safety,\u201d precluding, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201callegations in a FELA suit regarding the same subject matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). The Court held that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the railroad on the ground of preclusion, concluding: \u201c[T]he FRSA does not preclude, as a matter of law, any and all employee FELA claims that <em>relate to or touch </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>upon walkway conditions </em>and the size of <em>rail yard ballast.\u201d Id. </em>at 201 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">In light of the most recent case law on the issue of preclusion, we decline to reconsider our holding in <em>Miller.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY VACATED.

Appellees also contend that appellant \u201copened the door\u201d to appellees\u2019 counsel's demonstration because appellant first conducted a demonstration using the same mainline ballast. In its reply brief, appellant responds that \"standing and walking on samples of ballast scattered in the courtroom floor [did] not \u2018respond to\u2019 \" appellant's introduction of samples of ballast, comparison of that ballast to every day objects, and demonstration on that ballast to show how ballast passes through screens during the quarrying process. Appellant urges that, whereas \u201d[t]he purpose of CSXT's demonstrations was to give the jury a frame of reference so that it could differentiate between different types of ballast ....
