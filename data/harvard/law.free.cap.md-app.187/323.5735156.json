The principal issue presented on this appeal is whether a defendant has \u201cincurred\u201d attorney\u2019s fees, expenses, or costs within the meaning of Md. Rule 1-341 when the defendant\u2019s fees, expenses, and costs were paid by its liability insurance carrier.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">On August 25, 2003, appellant, Michael C. Worsham, <em>pro </em>se,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> filed a six-count complaint in circuit court against four of his neighbors, including Robert and Romualda Greenfield, appellees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The other two defendants are not involved in this appeal. The counts alleged malicious prosecution for criminal charges brought against appellant on February 5, 2000, malicious prosecution for criminal charges brought in October of 2000, defamation, false light/invasion of privacy, civil conspiracy, and aiding and abetting.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant subsequently dismissed the defamation count because it was barred by the statute of limitations. On September 30, 2004, the circuit court (Carr, J.) granted summary judgment in favor of three of the defendants, including Mrs. Greenfield. The malicious prosecution counts, as they related to malicious destruction of property over $300, and which applied solely to Mr. Greenfield, survived. In November 2004, the malicious prosecution counts went to trial, and at the close of appellant\u2019s case, the circuit court (Plitt, J.) granted Mr. Greenfield\u2019s motion for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Appellant appealed to this Court, and we affirmed the judgment of the circuit court. Appellant filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which the Court of Appeals denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">On April 27, 2006, appellees filed a motion in circuit court under Md. Rule 1-341 for attorneys fees, expenses, and costs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>The motion was supported by an affidavit filed by Thomas Patrick Ryan, a member of the law firm, McCarthy Wilson LLP. The affiant stated that the law firm had been retained by Erie Insurance Exchange (hereinafter \u201cErie Insurance\u201d) to represent appellees in the suit filed by appellant, and that the law firm had done so. The affiant further stated that attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $38,693.00 and expenses and costs in the amount of $1,571.48 had been incurred in defending appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">On September 29, 2006,- appellant filed his own motion under Rule 1-341, seeking an award of costs in the amount of $10.00 against appellees\u2019 counsel. In addition to seeking sanctions against attorneys with the McCarthy Wilson firm, appellant sought sanctions against H. Wayne Norman, Jr., an attorney who represented appellees with respect to the uninsured portion of the damages sought by appellant in his underlying complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Following a hearing, the circuit court (Plitt, J.), in an opinion and order dated February 21, 2007, denied Mr. Greenfield\u2019s motion but, finding that Mrs. Greenfield had been joined in the action without substantial justification, granted her motion. The court also concluded that the amount of fees, costs and expenses would be determined at a later hearing. The court denied appellant\u2019s motion, characterizing the portion of it directed at Wayne Norman as \u201cfrivolous and unprofessional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">On June 18, 2007, appellant filed a motion to recuse Judge Plitt from presiding over the hearing to determine the specific amount of fees incurred by Mrs. Greenfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">At all pertinent times, during the pendency of the underlying case and the Rule 1-341 motions practice, appellees were and are represented by counsel selected and paid by Erie Insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">At a July 11, 2007 hearing, Judge Plitt denied appellant\u2019s motion to recuse and then heard argument concerning the amount of an award of fees, costs, and expenses to Mrs. Greenfield. On August 29, 2007, Judge Plitt docketed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>written opinion and judgment awarding Mrs. Greenfield $3,613.13 for attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and expenses. The circuit court arrived at the amount of the award by reviewing billing records and determining the portion of fees, costs, and expenses attributable to Mrs. Greenfield\u2019s defense, prior to September 30, 2004, the date summary judgment was entered in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Appellant filed motions to alter or amend and to stay enforcement, both of which were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">As phrased by appellant, the questions are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">1. Whether the trial court erred in granting Romualda Greenfield\u2019s Motion under Rule 1-341, and awarding her a judgment of $3,613.13 for attorney\u2019s fees she admits she never paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">2. Whether the trial judge who heard the underlying criminal trial erred in not recusing himself as the judge over the subsequent civil malicious prosecution trial and Motion under Rule 1-341.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-10\">3. Whether Worsham\u2019s Rule 1-341 [sjhould have been granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-13\">Appellant contends that Mrs. Greenfield lacked standing to file a motion under Md. Rule 1-341 because all of the fees, costs, and expenses she sought, including the $3,613.13 awarded to her, were paid for by the Greenfields\u2019 insurer, Erie Insurance. Appellant argues that a party who suffered no damages cannot seek or be awarded damages that they never suffered, referring us to <em>Seney v. Seney, </em>97 Md.App. 544, 631 A.2d 139 (1993), in support of his position. Appellant adds that, under the definition of \u201cincurred\u201d used by the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>court,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mrs. Greenfield never incurred attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and expenses because she never became or was at risk of becoming liable for such fees, costs, and expenses. Appellant also claims that the trial court failed to consider the policy behind Md. Rule 1-341. He states that parties and their insurers are different entities with different motivations and that the trial court erred in equating the parties with their insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Appellant further contends that Mrs. Greenfield\u2019s motion was untimely. He notes that she waited until after Mr. Greenfield\u2019s trial, the appeal to this Court, and the denial of Mr. Worsham\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari before filing her motion. He asserts that if Mrs. Greenfield truly felt aggrieved, she should have filed the motion under Rule 1-341 before the appellate proceedings. He thus claims that Mrs. Greenfield\u2019s motion is untimely under a reasonableness standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Finally, appellant contends that there was an insufficient showing of lack of substantial justification or, if there was, the court abused its discretion in making an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Appellant does not challenge the court\u2019s methodology in determining the amount of the award, as distinguished from entitlement, which he does challenge. Appellant also does not contend that the court failed to make findings or failed to exercise its discretion. As noted above, he does contend that the findings were unsupported and that the court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Mrs. Greenfield responds that the purpose of Md. Rule 1-341 is to prevent parties and/or attorneys from abusing the judicial process by filing or defending actions without substantial justification or in bad faith. Mrs. Greenfield asserts that the focus of the Rule is on the offending party and/or attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>and Ms or her actions. As a result, she claims that whether an aggrieved party personally pays the attorney\u2019s fees or whether they are paid by a third party is irrelevant. Mrs. Greenfield states: \u201cIt does not serve the purpose of the Rule to limit its application to those instances where the litigant himself and not his insurer or some other third party paid the costs of representing him against the abusive litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">In the present case, we are asked to interpret Maryland Rule 1-341, which provides that a court, after making the necessary findings, may require the offending attorney or party to pay to the adverse party fees, costs, and expenses \u201cincurred\u201d by the adverse party.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">In <em>Greco v. State, </em>347 Md. 423, 428-29, 701 A.2d 419 (1997) (citations and footnote omitted), the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-8\">To interpret rules of procedure, we use the same principles and canons of construction as are used to interpret statutes. When construing a rule, the Court first looks to the text of the rule, giving those words their ordinary and natural meaning. When the words are clear and unambiguous, ordinarily our inquiry ends. When, however, the language of the rule is ambiguous, we look elsewhere to discern the legislative intent. It then becomes necessary to survey the surrounding circumstances in which the rale was drafted to accurately discern the intent of the Court of Appeals in promulgating that rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-9\"><em>See also Long v. State, </em>343 Md. 662, 668, 684 A.2d 445 (1996) (\u201cWe look to the rule\u2019s history to aid us in discerning the reasonable intendment of the language used in the light of the purpose to be effectuated.\u201d) (Citations omitted). \u201cYet the goal remains to give the rule its most reasonable interpretation, in accord with logic and common sense, and to avoid a construction not otherwise evident by the words actually used.\u201d <em>Greco, </em>347 Md. at 429, 701 A.2d 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>\u201cIncur\u201d has been defined as \u201cTo suffer or bring on oneself (a liability or expense).\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>771 (7th ed.1999). \u201cLiability\u201d has been defined in part, as \u201cA financial or pecuniary obligation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 925. \u201cLiable\u201d has been defined, in part, as (of a person) subject to or likely to incur (a fine, penalty, etc.). <em>Id. </em>at 927. <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>682 (1992) defines incur as \u201cto become liable for: <em>to incur debts.\u201d </em>\u201cLiable\u201d is defined as \u201clegally responsible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>781.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Appellant argues that Mrs. Greenfield did not incur fees, given the ordinary dictionary definition of the word. We disagree, and reading the Rule as a whole and in the context of its purpose, we conclude that the Rule is ambiguous as to whether a party must actually have paid the attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and expenses in order to have incurred them or whether they were paid by a collateral source. <em>See Twine v. State, </em>395 Md. 539, 550, 910 A.2d 1132 (2006) (\u201cIf a statute has more than one reasonable interpretation, it is ambiguous.\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387, 835 A.2d 1221 (2003) (\u201c[Bjefore judges may look to other sources for interpretation, first there must exist an ambiguity within the statute, i.e., two or more reasonable alternative interpretations of the statute.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Our research has uncovered no reported case law in this State determining, under Md. Rule 1-341, whether a party has incurred attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and expenses when the fees, costs, and expenses were paid by an insurer. Nevertheless, the principles discussed in the following cases, cited by appellant, are relevant to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">In <em>United States Health, Inc. v. State, </em>87 Md.App. 116, 589 A.2d 485 (1991), <em>cert. denied </em>324 Md. 69, 595 A.2d 482 (1991), the Maryland Commission on Human Relations denied United States Health\u2019s \u201cprofusion of motions\u201d to compel depositions and enforce discovery because there was no statutory authority for the relief sought. <em>Id. </em>at 119, 589 A.2d 485. United States Health then filed a series of appeals. <em>Id. </em>at 119-20, 589 A.2d 485. First, United States Health appealed to the Commission\u2019s Appeal Board, which struck the notice of appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>because an appeal did not lie from a ruling on pre-hearing discovery matters. <em>Id. </em>at 119, 589 A.2d 485. Second, it appealed to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, which dismissed the appeal because there was no final order from the Commission. <em>Id. </em>at 119-20, 589 A.2d 485. Third, it appealed to this Court, which concluded that \u201cunder no stretch of the imagination\u201d could the denial of the motions be considered a final order. <em>Id. </em>at 127, 589 A.2d 485. United States Health\u2019s claims were \u201csimply preposterous[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127, 589 A.2d 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">We also concluded that the appeal to this Court was \u201cutterly unjustified\u201d and granted the Commission\u2019s motion for an award of counsel fees under Md. Rule 1-341. <em>Id. </em>at 128, 589 A.2d 485. The Commission sought attorney\u2019s fees at a rate of $175.00 per hour, which it claimed was a reasonable hourly rate for appellate advocacy. <em>Id. </em>This Court recognized, however, that the Commission is a governmental agency represented by a salaried employee, that is, in-house counsel, who was not paid $175.00 an hour for his services. <em>Id. </em>at 129, 589 A.2d 485. After reviewing a series of federal cases, we wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7k\">It is clear that the above-cited federal cases, awarding market rate counsel fees, do so for various reasons, not the least of which is the desire to impose a penalty as a deterrence for reprehensible conduct. The language of the statute or rule under which such awards were made is broad enough to permit the award of counsel fees that are not limited to compensation. Md. Rule 1-341, however, authorizes the court only to order the offending party or attorney to reimburse the other party for the costs and expenses incurred in opposing the improper action. It does not speak of imposing sanctions, and therefore does not suggest, as does Fed. Civil Rule 11, that its purpose is to punish. Nor does it provide for an award of reasonable counsel fees, as does U.S.C. Title 42, \u00a7 1988; it provides for reimbursement of expenses, including reasonable counsel fees, actually incurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">We recognize that when in-house counsel performs legal services in prosecuting or defending a civil action the employer does incur expenses for those services, because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>salaried time spent by counsel on the case could have been spent performing other services for the employer. The fees charged by independent counsel include the attorney\u2019s overhead: rent, utilities, secretarial and other assistance, maintenance of a library, supplies, postage, etc. An agency or firm represented by in-house counsel also has expenses for logistical support for the attorneys. It may be difficult to determine and prove the actual cost and expense to the employer for each hour of its counsel\u2019s legal services in order to recover those expenses when such recovery is permitted by rule or statute. <em>But that difficulty does not permit us to ignore the fact that Rule 1-341 permits recovery for actual expenses incurred, not for an amount that would have been incurred had the party retained outside counsel who charged an amount that the Court ivould \u25a0 accept to be a reasonable fee.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">Recognizing that we might not allow recovery based upon \u201cmarket rates,\u201d appellee submitted a supplementary affidavit supporting an alternate basis for its claim. That affidavit reduces to an hourly rate counsel\u2019s annual salary and other financial benefits ($ 26.72), the cost of support staff ($ 14.82), and other administrative and operating costs ($ 8.36). The claimed expense thus computed, $ 648.70 ($ 49.90 per hour for the 13 hours spent on the appeal itself), has not been disputed by appellant and is certainly reasonable by any standard. We shall grant it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 130-31, 589 A.2d 485 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">In <em>Seney v. Seney, </em>97 Md.App. 544, 631 A.2d 139 (1993), Mr. Seney appealed an award of attorney\u2019s fees to Mrs. Seney\u2019s attorney, who had been hired on a contingency fee basis. <em>Id. </em>at 550, 631 A.2d 139. Mrs. Seney lost the case, and thus, under the contract, she was not liable for any attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, the trial court ordered Mr. Seney to pay $10,000 of Mrs. Seney\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>at 546, 631 A.2d 139. Mr. Seney noted an appeal, and we concluded that the award was improper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">This court has emphasized that Rule 1-341 is not a sanctions rule in the same sense as Federal Rule of Civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Procedure 11. It does not provide for a monetary award to punish a party that misbehaves. The Rule\u2019s purpose is to put a prevailing party in the same position as if the wrongful party\u2019s offending conduct had not occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">When a party takes money out of her pocket and gives it to the court or to her attorney because of the opposing party\u2019s substantially unjustified or bad faith actions, the court may order reimbursement of that money by the opposing party, or the opposing party\u2019s attorney, to the aggrieved party. \u201cRule 1-341 clearly permits a court to direct the payment of a sanction by the offending party, or attorney, or both of them. The rule directs, however, that payment be made to the adverse party, rather than to that party\u2019s attorney.\u201d <em>Talley v. Talley, </em>817 Md. 428, 437 n. 3, 564 A.2d 777 (1989).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">When, however, a party does not incur any expense for attorney\u2019s fees, those fees cannot be reimbursed. Mr. Evans [Mrs. Seney\u2019s attorney] took a calculated risk in entering into the contingent fee arrangement. He expected no fee for his services if he lost. He lost. Rule 1-341 does not offer him the opportunity to get from his client\u2019s opponents what he cannot get from his client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">We hold that Rule 1-341, in those rare cases when it is appropriate, only allows the court to award attorney\u2019s fees actually incurred by the moving party, and that when that party\u2019s attorney is not entitled to a fee under an agreement with the party, the court will not require that a fee be paid by an opposing party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-8\"><em>Seney, </em>97 Md.App. at 552-53, 631 A.2d 139 (footnotes and some citations omitted); <em>Beery v. Maryland Medical Laboratory, Inc., </em>89 Md.App. 81, 102, 597 A.2d 516 (1991) (\u201can award of counsel fees pursuant to Rule 1-341, despite our occasional use of the word \u2018sanction,\u2019 is not punitive but is intended merely to compensate the aggrieved party for their reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, actually incurred in opposing the unjustified or bad faith conduct\u201d). <em>See also Zdravkovich v.

While the nature of the offending conduct is relevant to the amount, the amount must be compensatory and not designed to punish the offending party. In the case before us, the fees, costs, and expenses were in fact paid on Mrs. Greenfield\u2019s behalf, and the amount of the award was premised on reimbursement of the amount paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The cases cited by appellees, while not squarely on point, are also relevant. The statutes at issue were designed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>address more specific situations, and certain types of litigation. Moreover, not all of the statutes in question addressed whether the litigation was brought or defended in bad faith. In contrast, Rule 1-341 was broadly drawn to address any case brought or defended in bad faith or without substantial justification. As we shall see in a moment, however, the scope of the Rule is very relevant to our ultimate conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Appellees rely on the following cases. <em>See Wilson v. General Services Admin., </em>126 F.3d 1406, 1408 (Fed.Cir.1997), addressing a claim for fees and expenses under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504. The statute provides, in pertinent part, that \u201can agency that conducts an adversary adjudication shall award, to a prevailing party other than the United States, fees and other expenses <em>incurred by that party </em>in connection with that proceeding, unless the adjudicative officer of the agency finds that the position of the agency was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.\u201d (Emphasis added.). The court concluded that Wilson incurred legal fees even though its insurer was responsible for paying the fees because they were incurred on Wilson\u2019s behalf. <em>Id. </em>at 1409.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">In <em>Poulard v. Lauth, </em>793 N.E.2d 1120, 1122 n. 2 (Ind.Ct.App.2003), the question was whether a defendant was entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees even though the fees were paid by an insurer. The claim was made under a so called SLAPP statute [strategic lawsuit against public participation], placing the financial burden on the party abusing the judicial system by bringing a SLAPP lawsuit. <em>Id. </em>at 1123. The statute, appearing in Ind.Code \u00a7 34-7-7-7, provided: \u201cA prevailing defendant on a motion to dismiss is entitled to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court observed that the SLAPP statute was \u201cintended to reduce the number of lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances,\u201d and upheld the award of fees. <em>Id. </em>at 1124.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>In <em>Scott v. Irmeger, </em>859 N.E.2d 1238, 1241 (Ind.Ct.App. 2007), the court concluded that a defendant may incur attorney\u2019s fees even though a third party, in that case, an insurer, pays such fees on the defendant\u2019s behalf. The statute at issue, Ind.Code \u00a7 34-50-1-6, addressed qualified settlement offers and provided that if a recipient did not accept a qualified settlement offer and the final judgment was less favorable to the recipient than the terms of the offer, the court shall award attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and expenses to the offeror upon the offeror\u2019s motion. The fees, costs and expenses were limited to those \u201cincurred\u201d after the date of the offer. The court observed that the purpose of the statute under which the fees were awarded was \u201cto provide the offering parties with leverage to encourage the other party to seriously evaluate the merits of his or her case____,\u201d and if \u201cthese parties were unable to depend on the ... statute for leverage to encourage the opposing party to evaluate the merits of the claim, the practical effect would be to undermine the entire purpose behind the ... statute.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">As alluded to earlier, the purpose of Rule 1-341 compels us to conclude that fees, costs, and expenses incurred by a party opposing a proceeding that was maintained in bad faith or without substantial justification are awardable even though paid by the party\u2019s insurer. The Rule clearly applies to \u201cany proceeding\u201d and clearly applies to parties who maintain or defend such a proceeding. <em>Bastian v. Laffin, supra </em>at 719, 460 A.2d 623. The Rule\u2019s purpose is to deter abuse of the judicial process and does so by compensating a party who opposes a party proceeding in bad faith or without substantial justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>In today\u2019s world, one in which liability insurance, which frequently includes the cost of defense, is extremely widespread and even mandated in certain situations, a contrary conclusion would result in the Rule never applying to persons maintaining a proceeding against a party who is insured but always applying to parties defending a proceeding. We do not believe that result was intended by the Court of Appeals. We are mindful of the caselaw observing that Rule 1-341 is not a sanctions rule in the same sense as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11. Thus Rule 1-341 is designed to compensate, and while entitlement to an award is based on the offending party\u2019s conduct, the amount awarded is not based on the degree of offensiveness. The purpose of the Rule is fulfilled, however, and the existing caselaw is not violated if the party receiving the award, in this instance, Mrs. Greenfield, pursues the sanction on behalf of the insurer, in this instance, Erie Insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">In certain cases, an insurer may have a contractual right, by way of subrogation or assignment, to pursue an insured\u2019s rights or compel an insured to pursue such rights on its behalf. In the case before us, we do not have a copy of the policy. Nevertheless, we conclude that the principle of equitable subrogation applies and that Mrs. Greenfield had the right to pursue the claim on behalf of Erie Insurance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For similar reasons of equity and public policy, the Court of Appeals applied the principle of equitable subrogation in an analogous situation. <em>See Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 315, 519 A.2d 202 (1987). In that case, the insured had a comprehensive general liability policy with Continental Insurance Group with a limit of $500,000 per occurrence. The insured also had an excess insurance policy with Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company that covered liability in excess of $500,000 up to its limit of $2,000,000. A former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>employee sued the insured for defamation and sought fifteen million dollars in compensatory and fifteen million dollars in punitive damages. Continental Insurance Group defended the insured but repeatedly refused to settle within its policy limits. A jury awarded the former employee one million dollars, and the former employee settled with the insured for $900,000. Continental Insurance Group paid its policy limit of $500,000, and Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company paid $400,000. <em>Id. </em>at 317, 519 A.2d 202. Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company filed an action against Continental Insurance Group, alleging bad faith refusal to settle within its policy limits. To the extent pertinent, it based its claim on equitable subrogation. <em>Id. </em>Under then existing Maryland law, the insured had a cause of action against its primary insurer for bad faith refusal to settle, and the Court of Appeals held that equitable subrogation permitted the excess insurer to pursue the insured\u2019s claim against the primary insurer. <em>Id. </em>at 319, 519 A.2d 202. Had the primary insurer not acted in bad faith, Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company would not have paid $400,000. In the case before us, Erie Insurance paid monies ($3,613.13) which it would not have paid absent appellant proceeding without substantial justification. For reasons of equity, to fulfill the purposes of Rule 1-341, we recognize the right of Erie Insurance, through its insured, to pursue a claim for fees, costs, and expenses under Rule 1-341. The award is compensatory in nature, because it reimburses the payor for monies incurred as a result of a violation of Rule 1-341.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Appellant also contends that Mrs. Greenfield\u2019s motion was untimely. Appellant argues that a reasonableness standard applies under Rule 1-341 and that the delay in filing the motion after summary judgment was granted was unreasonable. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">In <em>Litty v. Becker, </em>104 Md.App. 370, 376-78, 656 A.2d 365 (1995), the question was whether a party could seek sanctions under Rule 1-341 after judgment was entered, appealed, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>the appeal concluded. In answering in the affirmative, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-4\">[W]e believe that a trial court may entertain a motion for costs even though the principle suit had been concluded. We therefore conclude that a motion for costs pursuant to Md. Rule 1-341 is an \u201cindependent proceeding supplemental to the original proceeding and a trial court is not deprived of jurisdiction\u201d whenever costs are sought. See <em>Id. </em>Although \u201cthe only time limitation arises out of those equitable considerations that a judge may weigh in his discretion,\u201d <em>Hicks v. Southern, Maryland Health Systems Agency, </em>805 F.2d 1165, 1167 (4th Cir.1986), the judge\u2019s discretion must be exercised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court declined to consider appellants\u2019 motions because they were not filed until after the appeal had been concluded and \u201cmore than thirty (30) days after the Order of the Court of Appeals denying the Petition for Writ of Certiorari.\u201d Essentially, the trial court first concluded that it was unable to consider issues raised by appellants\u2019 motions for costs because they had not been raised prior to the appeal and were \u201ctherefore not specifically reserved as an issue collateral to those on appeal.\u201d Although this is consistent with the comments of Niemeyer and Schuett in the Maryland Rules Commentary, supra, we hold that it is precisely because a motion for costs pursuant to Rule 1-341 is an \u201cindependent proceeding supplemental to the original proceeding\u201d that it may be filed and considered by the trial court after the appeal has been concluded. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court erred in concluding that it was precluded from considering appellants\u2019 motions because they had not previously been raised or reserved for its consideration. Thus, the trial court\u2019s failure to exercise its discretion is an abuse of discretion. <em>Maus v. State, </em>311 Md. 85, 532 A.2d 1066 (1987).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">We perceive no merit in appellant\u2019s contention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Appellant\u2019s remaining contention as to issue I is that the court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous and it abused its discretion. Appellant argues that existing caselaw demonstrates that an award will be upheld only against parties who use litigation for purposes of delay, to obtain a tactical advantage in related proceedings, or when cases or statutes establish as a matter of law that the party had no legal basis for proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Even though in connection with other issues we have discussed the standard of review for an award of attorney\u2019s fees under Md. Rule 1-341, we shall repeat it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">[B]efore imposing sanctions in the form of costs and/or attorney\u2019s fees under Rule 1-341, the judge must make two separate findings that are subject to scrutiny under two related standards of appellate review. First, the judge must find that the proceeding was maintained or defended in bad faith and/or without substantial justification. This finding will be affirmed unless it is clearly erroneous or involves an erroneous application of law. Second, the judge must find that the bad faith and/or lack of substantial justification merits the assessment of costs and/or attorney\u2019s fees. This finding will be affirmed unless it was an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-7\"><em>Inlet Assocs. v. Harrison Inn Inlet, Inc., </em>324 Md. 254, 267-68, 596 A.2d 1049 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Mrs. Greenfield was named as a defendant in counts three through six, alleging defamation, invasion of privacy, conspiracy, and aiding and abetting. The circuit court observed that the only evidence relating to Mrs. Greenfield was that she came outside sometime during the altercation between appellant and Mr. Greenfield. Appellant references the application for statement of charges that he filed against Mr. Greenfield, in which he described the altercation between them, but that statement contains no reference to Mrs. Greenfield. We agree with the circuit court that there was not one scintilla of evidence that Mrs. Greenfield committed any of the torts alleged. A proceeding is not substantially justified if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>lacks any basis in law or fact. <em>Johnson v. Baker, </em>84 Md.App. 521, 529, 581 A.2d 48 (1990). Thus, the circuit court\u2019s finding that appellant lacked substantial justification for proceeding against Mrs. Greenfield was not clearly erroneous, and the court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Appellant next claims that Judge Plitt erred in denying his motion for recusal from presiding over the civil malicious prosecution trial and motions hearing under Md. Rule 1-341. Appellant asserts that this was error because Judge Plitt also presided over appellant\u2019s criminal trial. Appellant states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdQ\">The fact that a criminal trial occurred means the trial judge denied the criminal defendant\u2019s motions to dismiss. When that same judge later presides over a malicious prosecution trial involving the same underlying criminal case, the judge is being asked to rule that the same judge\u2019s own earlier decisions to allow the criminal case to go to trial were wrong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Appellant also claims Judge Plitt\u2019s \u201cbizarre and outlandish ruling\u201d against him in another case also demonstrates bias. He asserts that, in that case, Judge Plitt, \u201cfor absolutely no reason, required Worsham to produce five years [of] state and federal income tax returns in a simple case involving three telemarketing calls which were not in any real dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Mrs. Greenfield responds that there are no allegations of personal animosity or other grounds for recusal. Rather, she asserts, appellant\u2019s sole ground for recusal was that Judge Plitt had presided over appellant\u2019s criminal trial as well as other trials and hearings involving appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">In <em>South Easton Neighborhood Ass\u2019n v. Town of Easton, </em>387 Md. 468, 499, 876 A.2d 58 (2005), the Court of Appeals discussed the burden on the party seeking recusal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-10\">[T]he party moving for recusal bears a \u201cheavy burden to overcome the presumption of impartiality.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Blum, </em>373 Md. 275, 297, 818 A.2d 219, 232 (2003) quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Shaw, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>363 Md. 1,11, 766 A.2d 1028,1033 (2001). Judges \u201coccupy a distinguished and decisive position ... [requiring them] to maintain high standards of conduct.\u201d <em>Jefferson-El v. State, </em>330 Md. 99, 106, 622 A.2d 737, 741 (1993) (citations omitted). Unless grounds for mandatory recusal are met, a judge\u2019s decision not to recuse himself or herself will be overturned only upon a showing of an abuse of discretion. <em>Surratt v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>320 Md. 439, 465, 578 A.2d 745, 757-58 (1990). An abuse of discretion standard is objective\u2014\u201cwhether a reasonable member of the public knowing all the circumstances would be led to the conclusion that the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d <em>In re Turney, </em>311 Md. 246, 253, 533 A.2d 916, 920 (1987). Recognized grounds implicating possible partiality include a significant financial interest in a party or outcome, a prejudicial relationship as an attorney with a party or counsel for a party, or a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party. Md. Rule 16-813, Canon 3C.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">In the present case, the fact that Judge Plitt presided over other cases and proceedings involving appellant did not require his recusal. <em>See generally Boyd v. State, </em>321 Md. 69, 76, 581 A.2d 1 (1990) (information acquired by trial judge from prior judicial proceedings involving co-defendants is not personal knowledge or bias requiring disqualification); <em>Nash v. State, </em>69 Md.App. 681, 686, 519 A.2d 769 (1987) (where trial judge presided over earlier, related trial involving the same defendant, \u201ceven where judge is to be the fact finder, there is no <em>per se </em>rule requiring recusal\u201d). In addition, appellant failed to demonstrate any personal bias by Judge Plitt. He, therefore, failed to meet the heavy burden to overcome the presumption of impartiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Appellant next asserts that the circuit court erred in denying his motion for $10.00 filed under Md. Rule 1-341. He asserts that the importance of his motion was to deter the Greenfields from making their own bad faith motions and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>highlight under the Rule how a party must incur fees. On appeal, appellant\u2019s argument is limited to an assertion that Mr. Greenfield\u2019s motion for fees, costs, and expenses was filed in bad faith or without substantial justification. He explains that Mr. Greenfield\u2019s motion was in bad faith because he did not personally incur any fees and also because appellant\u2019s claim against him survived summary judgment. Regarding the requirement that a party incur fees, appellant recognizes that, because he represented himself, ordinarily, he would not be considered to have incurred attorney\u2019s fees. That is why, he claims, he sought only $10.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Here, Mr. Greenfield\u2019s motion under Md. Rule 1-341 presented a colorable claim. As we have just discussed, a party may move under Rule 1-341 even though its fees, costs, and expenses were paid by its insurance carrier. In addition, although some of the malicious prosecution counts against Mr. Greenfield survived the motion for summary judgment, at the close of appellant\u2019s case, the court granted Mr. Greenfield\u2019s motion for judgment. Moreover, the circuit court concluded that Mr. Greenfield had an \u201carguable\u201d basis for filing the charges against appellant, out of which grew appellant\u2019s malicious prosecution counts against Mr. Greenfield. As a result, the court did not err in concluding that there was no showing that Mr. Greenfield had proceeded in bath faith or without substantial justification.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED;</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b348-10\">. Md. Rule 1-341 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-11\">In any civil action, if the court finds that the conduct of any party in maintaining or defending any proceeding was in bad faith or without substantial justification the court may require the offending party or the attorney advising the conduct or both of them to pay to the adverse party the costs of the proceeding and the reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, incurred by the adverse party in opposing it.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b349-7\">. Appellant is a member in good standing of the Maryland bar. Appellant lias represented himself throughout these proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b349-8\">. This complaint grew out of an altercation between appellant and Mr. Greenfield, after which appellant and Mr. Greenfield filed an application for statement of charges against each other. The State filed charges, but they were later nolle pressed. The State's Attorney's Office subsequently brought additional charges against appellant, specifically, second degree assault and malicious destruction of property. At the ensuing trial, the jury acquitted appellant of malicious destruction of property. The jury hung on the assault charge, and the court declared a mistrial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b349-9\">. The malicious prosecution counts were filed against Mr. Greenfield only. All other counts were filed against all named defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b352-9\">. The circuit court stated that \"Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary defines incur as: \u2018to run into, to become liable or subject to.\u2019 Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 5th Edition, defines incur as: \u2018to have liability cast upon one by an act or operation of law, as distinguished from contract, where the party acts affirmatively. To become liable or subject to.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b360-8\">. It appears, however, that Indiana awards attorney's fees, costs, and expenses in situations in which Maryland does not, at least in the Rule 1-341 context. For example, in <em>Beeson v. Christian, </em>594 N.E.2d 441, 443 (Ind.1992), the Supreme Court of Indiana upheld an award of attorney\u2019s fees even though the defendant's attorney testified that he would not charge his client any fees for the work done on the appeal. This is contrary to <em>Seney, </em>a Rule 1-341 case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b361-6\">. Appellant did not object to the failure to pursue sanctions in the name of or to the use of Erie Insurance; thus any objection on that basis is not before us. See Md. Rule 2-201. Erie Insurance is the real party in interest, by virtue of being subrogated to the rights of its insured, and could have pursued the claim in its own name.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
