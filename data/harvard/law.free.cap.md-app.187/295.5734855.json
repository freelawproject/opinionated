In the early morning hours of February 17, 2005, just south of Havre do Grace, Maryland, the Decedent was working as an Electric Traction Lineman for appellee/cross-appellant, National Railroad Passenger Corporation (\u201cAmtrak\u201d), as a member of a five-man crew headquartered out of Amtrak\u2019s Perryville Maintenance of Way Base. At approximately 3:56 a.m., the Decedent sustained severe electrical burns on approximately 60 percent of his body when he was on top of a catenary maintenance vehicle and came in contact with the energized pantograph.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Decedent was transferred by a Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>State Police Medivac crew to the Johns Hopkins Bayview Burn Center, where he passed away on February 21, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Appellant/cross-appellee, Michele Collins (\u201cCollins\u201d), the Decedent\u2019s surviving spouse, filed suit under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (\u201cFELA\u201d), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51 <em>et seq., </em>and the Locomotive Inspection Act (\u201cLIA\u201d), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20701 <em>et seq., </em>asserting claims of negligence and strict liability, respectively, against Amtrak. After a five-day trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Amtrak.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">On appeal, Collins presents three questions for our review, which we have rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">1. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in not instructing the jury that assumption of risk is not a defense to a claim arising under the FELA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">2. Did the trial court err in granting partial summary judgment in favor of Amtrak on Collins\u2019 claim arising under the LIA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">3. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in not admitting statements from a transcript of a conversation between Amtrak employees?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">We answer \u201cNo\u201d to each question and, accordingly, shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">The Decedent began working for Amtrak in November 1997 as an Electric Traction Lineman at Amtrak\u2019s Mid-Atlantic Division-South, which covered the Baltimore and Perryville area. Such work entailed maintenance and construction of the overhead catenary system, substations, and supply stations along Amtrak\u2019s Northeast Corridor. Normally, about 12,000 volts of electricity travel through the catenary system, powering the trains along Amtrak\u2019s Northeast Corridor.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Crews of Amtrak employees, each directed by a \u201cgang-foreman,\u201d maintain the catenary system. The Decedent was a member of a five-man crew, or \u201cgang,\u201d designated D-126, headquartered at Amtrak\u2019s Perryville Maintenance of Way Base. The gang worked during the hours of 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., Monday through Friday.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">One means of maintaining the catenary system requires measuring the alignment of the overhead contact wire using a catenaiy maintenance vehicle (\u201cCat Car\u201d). The Cat Car is a diesel-powered rail car and is used to take alignment readings usually under a de-energized catenary system. The roof of the Cat Car is equipped with a pantograph, which is raised to the overhead contact wire of the catenary system to assist in taking alignment readings of the wire. When attached to an energized contact wire, however, the pantograph collects power, becoming part of the energized catenary system.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After being detached and lowered from the energized contact wire, the pantograph is de-energized. When it is not in use, the pantograph is secured with an automatic hold-down latch. Additionally, in the Decedent\u2019s gang, the pantograph was tied down with a rope as an added means of securing it in the lowered position.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">On February 16, 2005, the Decedent\u2019s crew started to work at about 10:00 p.m. In addition to the Decedent, the gang included Thomas Boone, the Gang Foreman; George Breder, the Cat Car Operator; Jack Backert, an Electric Traction Lineman; and Bryan Marshall, an Electric Traction Lineman Trainee.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Initially, the crew was assigned to perform routine catenary maintenance work on a section of the catenary system. The Decedent was designated the \u201cA-man\u201d at the start of this shift. As the A-man, it was the Decedent\u2019s responsibility to coordinate the removal of power in the area where the crew worked. Prior to performing their work, the pantograph was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>raised, attaching it to the contact wire, which was de-energized at the time. At approximately 2:40 a.m. on February 17, 2005, the crew was asked to leave the area. A Norfolk-Southern freight train broke down near the crew\u2019s work site, necessitating that the track occupied by the Cat Car be cleared, so that the railroad could be opened to service the disabled freight train. Boone lowered the pantograph and Collins tied it down. The power to the catenary lines was then restored.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The crew was diverted to the Aberdeen area, where they stayed for about 45 minutes until they were requested to conduct further alignment readings of the catenary system. The readings were to be taken over the distance of about 1500 feet, or five catenary poles (\u201ccat poles\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the work was going to be done under energized catenary wires, Boone conducted a safety briefing before the crew set out to complete the readings.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">After the alignment readings were finished, the crew observed a bright flash, followed by an explosion and a thump on the Cat Car roof. Boone testified that he immediately took a head count and did not see the Decedent. He explained that, \u201c[j]ust from hearing the explosion and seeing the sky light up, [he] knew what it was.\u201d Boone ran to the top of the Cat Car where he found the Decedent lying \u201cbetween the pantograph and the railing of the [Cat Car]\u201d with his body \u201cin flames\u201d and \u201cscreaming for help.\u201d Boone proceeded to put out the flames on the Decedent\u2019s body with a fire extinguisher. According to Boone, the Decedent\u2019s clothes \u201chad been burned completely off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">It was later determined that at approximately 3:56 a.m. the Decedent sustained severe electrical burns on approximately 60 percent of his body when he came in contact with the energized pantograph while on top of the Cat Car. The Decedent had climbed on top of the roof of the Cat Car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>without direction from the gang or Boone and without the knowledge of any of his gang members. Amtrak\u2019s Accident Investigation Report stated, and the testimony at trial confirmed, that, other than to tie down the pantograph, there was no reason for the Decedent to have gone on top of the Cat Car at that particular time. Because the members of the gang were in the cabin of the Cat Car at the time that the Decedent went up on the roof, there were no eyewitnesses to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">Lowering the pantograph requires communication between the A-man and the Cat Car Operator. Two methods of lowering the pantograph were used by crews in the Mid-Atlantic Division-South: (1) While at the top of the steps or on the roof, the A-man would yell to the Cat Car operator to lower the pantograph; or (2) the A-man would stomp on the roof of the Cat Car near the pantograph above the Cat Car Operator\u2019s controls.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The second method required the A-man to straddle a removable railing located on the Cat Car roof. Evidence of the Decedent\u2019s injuries suggested that he was in this position at the time that he sustained his injuries, because the Decedent suffered severe burn marks in his right wrist and groin area, which was consistent with straddling (and thus contacting) the movable railing and simultaneously contacting the energized pantograph with his right wrist. Burn marks were also found on the removable railing.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Following the accident, the Decedent was transported by a Maryland State Police Medivac crew to the Johns Hopkins Bayview Burn Center where he passed away on February 21, 2005, at approximately 2:15 p.m. following the removal of life-support systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\"> Collins filed suit under the FELA and LIA, asserting claims of negligence and strict liability, respectively, against Amtrak.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>FELA and LIA are remedial and humanitarian statutes that impose two separate types of liability to protect the safety of railroad employees. FELA permits railroad workers to recover for injuries caused by the negligence of their employers or fellow employees. LIA, on the other hand, imposes an absolute duty on railroad carriers to ensure that their locomotives are both properly maintained and safe to operate. Because LIA does not create an independent cause of action, such a claim must be brought under FELA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFu\"><em>Matson v. Burlington N. Santa Fe R.R., </em>240 F.3d 1233, 1235 (10th Cir.2001) (citations omitted) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">On June 5, 2006, Amtrak filed a motion for partial summary judgment on Collins\u2019 claim arising under the LIA, asserting that the Cat Car is not a locomotive and thus the LIA is inapplicable to Collins\u2019 claim under that statute. On July 14, 2006, the court granted Amtrak\u2019s partial motion for summary judgment on the LIA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">A five-day jury trial was conducted from August 14 to 18, 2006, and resulted in a verdict in favor of Amtrak. This timely appeal followed. We will set forth additional facts and proceedings below as necessary to discuss the questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Assumption of Risk Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">In 1906, Congress passed the FELA \u201cin part to eliminate barriers common law courts erected to protect railroad companies and other common carriers from liability for their employees\u2019 workplace injuries.\u201d <em>Fashauer v. N.J. Transit Rail Operations, Inc., </em>57 F.3d 1269, 1274 (3d Cir.1995). The FELA \u201csubstituted comparative negligence for the strict rule of contributory negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). Following \u201cwidespread criticism\u201d of the retention of assumption of risk as a complete defense to an employer\u2019s liability, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Congress amended the FELA in 1939, \u201celirninat[ing] the defense in cases where the injury \u2018resulted in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees\u2019 of the employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 54). Thereafter, the Supreme Court announced that \u201cevery vestige of the doctrine of assumption of risk was obliterated from [the FELA] by the 1939 Amendment,\u201d directing that FELA cases are \u201cto be handled as though no doctrine of assumption of risk had ever existed.\u201d <em>Tiller v. Atl. Coast Line R.R. Co., </em>318 U.S. 54, 57, 64, 63 S.Ct. 444, 87 L.Ed. 610 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">In the instant case, Collins proposed that the jury be instructed that assumption of risk is not a defense in a FELA action. The proposed instruction stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">45 U.S.C. \u00a7 54 of The Federal Employer\u2019s Liability Act provides in pertinent part</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">In any action brought against any common carrier under or by virtue of any of the provisions of this chapter to recover damages for injuries to ... any of its employees, such employees shall not be held to have assumed the risks of his employment where such injury ... resulted in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents or employees of such carrier....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">Assumption of the risk is not a proper defense in a FELA action and as such it may not be considered in any way in reaching your decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">(Alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Amtrak\u2019s counsel excepted to the proposed instruction, and the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-10\">[COLLINS\u2019 COUNSEL]: ... Here, comparative negligence is certainly an issue. We believe that because of the potential overlap with assumption of risk and contributory comparative negligence, that it\u2019s imperative that the jury be given sort of the upper parameters of what actions are appropriate to be considered, and clearly there is a difference. I understand legally it is an issue that is complicated, but nonetheless, it\u2019s the law, and I think that they should be instructed and we ought to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>able to argue that whatever actions on the record, any evidence\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\">THE COURT: But the Court is not intending to instruct at all on assumption of the risk. That\u2019s not injected in any way into the case. So to give that instruction, I thought .it would just further muddy the waters potentially of the jurors\u2019 understanding of what they were or were not being asked to decide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">[COLLINS\u2019 COUNSEL]: And I understand that, Your Honor, and I understand and in cases I have felt that the issue of instructing on assumption of the risk is a danger because it\u2019s not even in the case, okay. But here, I think it\u2019s potentially, depending on how the jury interprets facts, it is potentially\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">THE COURT: I\u2019m not going to allow anybody to argue assumption of the risk. That isn\u2019t in the case. There\u2019s not going to be any argument that would potentially confuse the jury based on the instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">[COLLINS\u2019 COUNSEL]: But I think it could be because, and also it\u2019s not only what is argued, but it\u2019s the inferences that the jury may draw on their own. In other words\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">THE COURT: The jurors are going to come in and say, well, I know that there are two doctrines. One is assumption of the risk. The other is contributory/comparative negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">[COLLINS\u2019 COUNSEL]: No, but what I think\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-10\">THE COURT: You got rid of all those people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-11\">[COLLINS\u2019 COUNSEL]: What might happen is that they could say they believe [the Decedent] was standing there, he knew that the [pantograph] was energized and he took, you know, the classic voluntarily assuming, getting close to the [pantograph] to do his job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-12\">THE COURT: But here\u2019s my point. First, is it a correct statement of law, I don\u2019t have any argument with that, but obviously I\u2019m not, you know, I\u2019m not giving pedestri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>an instructions and other instructions that are inapplicable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-4\">I think that both counsel understand and can argue the portion that pertains to the comparative/contrib and keep that as clear as possible, so I\u2019m going to deny that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Collins argues that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that assumption of risk is not a defense in a FELA case. Collins contends that, whereas the instruction is a correct statement of law and was not fairly covered by the other instructions given, whether such an instruction was proper \u201cturns upon whether there was evidence before the jury upon which an inference could be drawn that [the decedent] assumed the risk of his injuries.\u201d According to Collins, \u201cthere was ample evidence from which the jury could have, and most likely did, improperly draw the conclusion that [Collins] should not recover because [the Decedent] assumed the risk of the incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Amtrak counters that the court properly denied Collins\u2019 request, because \u201cthe evidence and arguments of counsel did not raise the defense of assumption of risk.\u201d Instead, Amtrak asserts that the evidence and argument at trial \u201cfell well within the category of comparative negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Maryland Rule 2-520 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">(a) When given. The court shall give instructions to the jury at the conclusion of all the evidence and before closing arguments and may supplement them at a later time when appropriate. In its discretion, the court may also give opening and interim instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">(c) How given. The court may instruct the jury, orally or in writing or both, by granting requested instructions, by giving instructions of its own, or by combining any of these methods. The court need not grant a requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered by instructions actually given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ap\">Accordingly, a court may decline to give a requested instruction in the event that the instruction is \u201csuperfluous,\u201d \u201cconfus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>ing,\u201d or \u201cinapplicable to the'case at hand.\u201d <em>S. Mgmt. Corp. v. Mariner, </em>144 Md.App. 188, 198-99, 797 A.2d 110 (2002). At issue in the case <em>sub judice </em>is whether instructing the jury on assumption of risk is applicable to the evidence generated at trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Because contributory negligence reduces a plaintiffs damages under the FELA while assumption of risk does not, \u201ccourts have the delicate job of separating out evidence on one theory from evidence on the other.\u201d <em>Fashauer, </em>57 F.3d at 1274. When inapplicable under the facts of a given case, \u201ccourts should spare juries intricate descriptions of opaque legal doctrines,\u201d such as the doctrine of assumption of risk; however, when \u201cthe facts of the case present a danger of jury confusion on the issue, an assumption of risk charge should be given.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1275. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">[Wjhen the evidence adduced at trial presents a danger that the jury might reduce a plaintiffs recovery based on the impermissible theory of assumption of risk, then the trial judge should instruct the jury on how that doctrine differs from contributory negligence. But when the evidence presents no such danger, then an adequate charge on contributory and comparative negligence suffices. Of course, the most difficult part of the inquiry is determining when the facts merit an assumption of the risk instruction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">\u201cAlthough there is some overlap between assumption of risk and contributory negligence, generally the two defenses are not interchangeable.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Burlington N. R.R. Co., </em>787 F.2d 1309, 1316 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">\u201cAt common law an employee\u2019s voluntary, knowledgeable acceptance of a dangerous condition that is necessary for him to perform his duties constitutes an assumption of risk. Contributory negligence, in contrast, is a careless act or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>omission on the plaintiffs part tending to add new dangers to conditions that the employer negligently created or permitted to exist.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><em>Fashauer, </em>57 F.3d at 1275 (quoting <em>Taylor, </em>787 F.2d at 1316); <em>accord Jenkins v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., </em>22 F.3d 206, 210 (9th Cir.1994); <em>Rivera v. Farrell Lines, Inc., </em>474 F.2d 255, 257 (2d Cir.1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 822, 94 S.Ct. 122, 38 L.Ed.2d 55 (1973). A finding of an employee\u2019s contributory negligence on the basis of \u201cthe strength of [the employee\u2019s] knowledge that a dangerous condition in his line of duty existed and his working in that line of duty\u201d nonetheless, is actually \u201cassumption of risk masquerading under another name.\u201d <em>Rivera, </em>474 F.2d at 257-58. In other words, evidence of a plaintiffs \u201cknowledgeable acceptance of a dangerous condition\u201d implicates the defense of assumption of the risk, not contributory negligence. <em>Joyce v. Atl. Richfield Co., </em>651 F.2d 676, 682-83 (10th Cir.1981); <em>see also Koshorek v. Pa. R.R. Co., </em>318 F.2d 364, 367 (3d Cir.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Noting that the concept of assumption of risk \u201coften is used as an umbrella term to describe a number of discrete and dissimilar concepts,\u201d the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit discussed in <em>Fashauer </em>\u201cwhat theory of assumption of risk Congress sought to prohibit when it barred the defense under the FELA.\u201d 57 F.3d at 1275-76. The Court elucidated: \u201cIn our view, the history behind the FELA and the Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncements in pre- and post-FELA cases makes clear that assumption of risk in the employment context refers to implied consent,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>an employee\u2019s implied consent to assume the risks entailed in employment. <em>Id. </em>at 1279. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">A plaintiffs recovery under the FELA never can be reduced on the basis that he or she implicitly consented to the risk by accepting employment with the railroad or by performing a task in the manner which the employer directed. This is true regardless of whether the plaintiff acted reasonably or unreasonably. Thus, even when a jury examining a plaintiffs position objectively would conclude that he acted unreasonably in accepting employment, or performing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>task at all, such unreasonable actions for FELA purposes are characterized as assumption of risk rather than contributory negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1280. In so holding, however, the Court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq0\">[W]hen reasonable alternatives besides quitting or refusing to perform the task in an unsafe way are available, a plaintiff is charged with acting with due care and will be held responsible for acting unreasonably. In such circumstances when the plaintiff unreasonably assumes a known risk, his fault in that regard is negligence and his damage award may be subject to apportionment. Examples of evidence of contributory negligence include failing to follow specific safety instructions reasonably calculated to protect the employee from the injury that occurred; failing to report a defect when the evidence establishes that such reporting would be productive; and failing to act prudently in performing the task.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-5\"><em>Id. </em>(first emphasis added) (second emphasis in original) (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Based on the aforementioned principles,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apu\">if no evidence of impermissible assumption of risk has reached the jury, a correct instruction on contributory negligence will do. However, if, either because of evidence introduced at trial or because of statements made by counsel in opening or closing arguments, there is a risk that the implied consent theory of assumption of the risk seeped its way into the case, the jury should be instructed that it may not find contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff ... simply because he acceded to the request or direction of the responsible representatives of his employer that he work at a dangerous job, or in a dangerous place, or under unsafe conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-7\"><em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">Right of Refusal</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Collins argues that a jury instruction on assumption of risk was necessary because \u201cAmtrak relied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>heavily upon the argument that [the Decedent] could have declined to perform the work in question if he thought it was dangerous,\u201d an Amtrak policy \u201creferred to repeatedly ... as the \u2018Right of Refusal.\u2019 \u201d According to Collins, \u201c[t]he explanation of this right and Collinsf] failure to exercise the right could clearly have been interpreted as a \u2018voluntary, knowledgeable acceptance of a dangerous condition.\u2019 \u201d We disagree and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Preliminarily, we set forth a summary of the evidence adduced at trial relating to Amtrak\u2019s Right of Refusal. Amtrak elicited testimony from several witnesses that if the Decedent felt unsafe working under an energized line, he could have exercised his right of refusal <em>and still done the alignment readings, but under a de-energized line. </em>Boone testified that, had anyone felt unsafe, they had the right to refuse, agreeing that any member of the crew, including the Decedent, \u201ccould have said I want to work with the power off <em>and they would have ivorked with the power off.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Gerald Nangle, Amtrak\u2019s Director of Electrical Traction Maintenance, who was responsible for the day to day operation and maintenance to Amtrak\u2019s electric traction between Washington and Boston, testified that the Right of Refusal is that \u201c[a]ny member of the engineering department has the right to refuse work that they feel is unsafe.\u201d When asked whether any member of the crew could have, \u201cconsistent with Amtrak policy, said Pm not doing this job <em>under energized </em>[sic]. We are going to call dispatch or whoever we have to call <em>and work under de-energized wire?,\u201d </em>Nangle responded: \u201cYes, they could have.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">During his testimony, Breder agreed that any member of the crew, once he learned that the job would be conducted under an energized line, had the right of refusal. According to Breder, Amtrak\u2019s Right of Refusal \u201cis basically if you don[\u2019]t feel something is safe you bring it up and we try to make it safe <em>in order to do the job.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Breder described Boone as the type of foreman who would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>listen to an objection to a procedure and \u201csay, you know thank you for bringing that up[.] I didn[\u2019]t notice that, or I didn[\u2019]t know that you would hesitant [sic] in doing this, <em>then we would do another way [sic] or make it safe\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Backert testified that there were no exceptions to the Right of Refusal and stated that, during his fifteen plus years working for Amtrak, he never knew of any employee who had been disciplined for exercising his Right of Refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Amtrak elicited additional testimony that neither the Decedent nor any member of the crew exercised his Right of Refusal on the night of the accident. Nangle testified that, on the night of but before the accident, the entire crew, including the Decedent, decided to do the alignment readings under an energized line. According to Nangle, the crew \u201cindicated that they had discussed the job quite thoroughly and they were all quite aware of the situation, the catenary being energized and the pantograph being up and also being energized.\u201d Boone testified along the same lines, stating that the crew, including the Decedent, agreed that the alignment readings could be done <em>safely </em>under an energized wire.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">In his closing argument, Amtrak\u2019s counsel discussed the Right of Refusal in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">I\u2019m sure you\u2019re tired of this phrase. Most of you probably know it before I even put it up\u2014[R]ight of [R]efusal. Had any member of the crew, including [the Decedent], had they said no one can do this job under energized wire, you can do the job under de-energized wire, everyone testified that\u2019s what they would have done. It\u2019s all (inaudible). That was their choice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">You heard unrefuted testimony that his right of refusal has been exercised. No one\u2019s ever been disciplined at Amtrak for exercising a [R]ight of [R]efusal. You want to talk about insubordination, insubordination is when you don\u2019t do your job. In other words, the crew\u2019s next job is to do the trolley assignment, so they\u2019d say, well, that\u2019s fine, but we\u2019re tired and want to go home early. That\u2019s insubordination. That\u2019s easy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Right of [RJefusal has to do, clearly, with the method of work. Amtrak, that company, I\u2019m going to talk about that a bit at this point, empowers its employees with this right. I can\u2019t emphasize that enough because that\u2019s what set things in motion, sort of. We\u2019re going to get to what caused this, but no one exercised the [RJight of [R] efusal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Contrary to Collins\u2019 contention, Amtrak\u2019s reference to the Right of Refusal was not for the purpose of arguing that the Decedent had the right to refuse to work under an energized wire, thereby implying that he voluntarily accepted working under a known dangerous condition. <em>Cf. Taylor, </em>787 F.2d at 1316 (\u201cThe employee who enters the workplace for a routine assignment in compliance with the orders and directions of his employer or its supervising agents, who by such entry incurs risks not extraordinary in scope, is not contributorily negligent, but rather is engaging in an assumption of risk.\u201d). Instead, Amtrak used the Right of Refusal to show a safer alternative to conducting the catenary alignment readings under an energized wire, namely, doing the same job under a de-energized wire. Working under an energized line was not necessary for the Decedent and the crew to perform the alignment readings. In fact, about 99% of the time the crew performed the readings under a de-energized wire, and there was no advantage in terms of electrical engineering practices to taking readings under an energized line versus a deenergized line. Thus, under the circumstances of this case, the Right of Refusal was used to suggest a reasonable alternative, <em>\u201cbesides quitting or refusing to perform the task in an unsafe way,\u201d see Fashauer, 57 </em>F.3d. at 1280 (emphasis added), thereby raising the issue of contributory negligence, not assumption of the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Furthermore, focusing precisely on the \u201ctheory of assumption of risk Congress sought to prohibit when it barred the defense under the FELA,\u201d it is clear that the evidence adduced does not show that the Decedent impliedly consented to \u201cperform! ] a task in the manner which [Amtrak] directed.\u201d <em>See Fashauer, 57 </em>F.3d at 1279-80. The crew did not receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>an order from Amtrak requiring them to conduct the readings under an energized wire. Rather, the crew decided that it would be safe to proceed under the energized system. <em>Cf. Green v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., </em>269 Ill.App.3d 1075, 207 Ill.Dec. 599, 647 N.E.2d 1092, 1099 (1995) (stating that, where the employee was complying with his supervisor\u2019s instructions and there was no alternative way for him to do his job, the evidence could have led the jury to believe the employee had assumed the risk).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Our review of the record reveals that none of the evidence adduced at trial with respect to Amtrak\u2019s Right of Refusal, nor the argument of counsel, expressly or implicitly injected assumption of risk into the trial. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in refusing to give Collins\u2019 proposed jury instruction on assumption of risk because of Amtrak\u2019s policy on Right of Refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">On the Roof of the Cat Car</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Collins also argues that the circuit court should have instructed the jury on assumption of risk because, absent that. instruction, \u201cthe jury may well have concluded that the sole cause of the incident was Collins\u2019 decision to proceed to the top of the [Cat Car] despite his knowledge of the danger, which resulted in a finding of no negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Amtrak adduced evidence at trial that the Decedent was aware that the pantograph was energized when he went on top of the Cat Car presumably to tie down the pantograph. Nangle testified that there was no business-related reason for the Dee\u00e9dent to approach and get close enough to touch the pantograph while it was raised and connected to the energized contact wire. He testified that a red bar, located about 22 inches away from the pantograph, was positioned \u201cto warn you of possible danger on the other side the that bar. That the pantograph could be energized.\u201d He further testified that, had the Decedent kept a safe distance from the energized pantograph and waited for it to come down to the latched position, the accident would not have happened. There was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>also testimony from multiple witnesses that the Decedent violated Amtrak safety rule 2.202, a rule that \u201crequires a worker to be three feet away from the catenary system when it is energized.\u201d Boone testified that the decedent never told him that he was going on the roof of the Cat Car or why he was going up there. All of this evidence tended to show that the Decedent departed from the standard of care and acted unreasonably under the circumstances, thus implicating the defense of contributory negligence and not assumption of risk. <em>See Joyce, </em>651 F.2d at 682-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Moreover, there was a reasonable alternative available to the Decedent \u201cbesides quitting or refusing to perform the task in an unsafe way.\u201d <em>See Fashauer, </em>57 F.3d at 1280. Nangle testified to \u201cthe normal procedure\u201d where the A-man is positioned at the top of the stairs and yells to the operator, who is generally located at the bottom of the steps, to lower the pantograph. Nangle also testified that, even if the A-man was on the roof of the Cat Car when he yelled to the operator, the A-man would be about 15 to 20 feet from the pantograph and out of any danger of electrical injury. Boone testified to the same procedure, explaining that the Decedent should have been positioned at the top of the stairs of the Cat Car to call down to the operator to lower the pantograph. Breder testified that the A-man did not have to be on the roof to see that the pantograph was lowered. He explained that there was no visual obstacle between the Decedent and the pantograph once the Decedent got onto the roof and that the Cat Car roof was lighted at night.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">In light of the evidence adduced that (1) the Decedent violated the standard of care, (2) there was a reasonable alternative in instructing the operator to lower the pantograph, and (3) no crew member ordered the Decedent to go onto the roof of the Cat Car and somehow get close to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>pantograph, we conclude that the doctrine of assumption of risk was not implicated by the evidence elicited at trial pertaining to the Decedent\u2019s decision to go onto the roof of the Cat Car when the pantograph was energized.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Locomotive Inspection Act</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Congress enacted the Boiler Inspection Act (\u201cBIA\u201d) in 1911 to promote \u201c \u2018the safety of employees and travelers upon railroads by compelling common carriers engaged in interstate commerce to equip their locomotives with safe and suitable boilers and appurtenances....\u2019\u201d <em>Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, </em>459 F.Supp. 136, 143 (W.D.Va.1978) (quoting H.R. Doc. No.1974, 61st Cong., 3rd Sess. 1 (1911)). \u201cThe [BIA] is now known as the [LIA], 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20701 <em>et seq., </em>but the latter act incorporated substantive provisions of the former. Thus, the cases construing the former are still controlling as to the latter.\u201d <em>Bittinger v. CSX Transp. Inc., </em>176 Md.App. 262, 281 n. 5, 932 A.2d 1243, <em>cert. denied, </em>402 Md. 356, 936 A.2d 852 (2007). Presently, the LIA provides, in pertinent part: \u201cA railroad carrier may use or allow to be used a locomotive or tender on its railroad line only when the locomotive or tender and its parts and appurtenances ... are in proper condition and safe to operate without unnecessary danger of personal injury[.]\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20701. Unlike the FELA, contributory negligence is not a defense under the LIA and cannot reduce a plaintiffs recovery. <em>Garcia v. Burlington N. R.R. Co., </em>818 F.2d 713, 715 (10th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">On July 14, 2006, at a hearing on Amtrak\u2019s partial motion for summary judgment on Collins\u2019 LIA claim, the court ruled in Amtrak\u2019s favor, finding as a matter of law that the Cat Car was not a locomotive within the meaning of the LIA. The court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">I[ am] considering the evidence even most favorable to [Collins] ..., considering the case law as presented and argued, considering the use to which this catenary car was being put at the time of the injury to [the Decedent], it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>the fact that they had couplers and buffers I do not believe is sufficient under the use for which it was being put at the time of the injury to qualify it as a locomotive under the [LIA], The motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of the [LIA] will be granted as I find no genuine dispute.... I do not find a genuine dispute as to material fact on the definition of locomotive for which this catenary car was being used at the time of the injury. And I[ will] sign an order to that effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Collins complains that the circuit court erred in granting Amtrak\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, because whether the Cat Car constituted a locomotive under the LIA was a factual determination that should have been reserved for the jury. Amtrak responds that summary judgment was proper on Collins\u2019 claim under the LIA, because Collins \u201cdid not develop, and could not develop, any evidence to demonstrate that the Cat Car was a locomotive, as is required for a claim under the LIA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Whether summary judgment was granted properly under Rule 2-501 is a question of law. <em>Walk v. Hartford Cas. Ins. Co., </em>382 Md. 1, 14, 852 A.2d 98 (2004). Consequently, we review a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Id. De novo </em>review requires us to determine whether the trial court was legally correct. <em>Id. </em>In so doing, \u201cwe independently review the record to determine whether there exists any genuine issue of material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, \u201c[w]e review the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and construe any reasonable inferences which may be drawn from the facts against the movant,\u201d here, Amtrak. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">In <em>Garcia, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit addressed the issue of whether an Electromatic Tamper, a railroad maintenance vehicle designed to align tracks, was a locomotive under the LIA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 818 F.2d at 714-15. Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>viewing the case law that addressed the same issue but in the context of other vehicles, the Court noted that courts \u201chave consistently held that a vehicle will be a locomotive only if it is used as a locomotive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">The Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">A study of the cases reveals two requirements: first, the vehicle must operate on railroad tracks; and second, it must perform a locomotive function.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">Numerous courts have held that vehicles that push or pull railroad cars along railroad tracks are locomotives. Even if the pushing and pulling is only along the tracks within the railroad\u2019s own yard, the vehicle is acting as a locomotive and, thus, is a locomotive under the [LIA].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-7\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">In applying the two requirements, the Court in <em>Garcia </em>determined that the Tamper fulfilled the first requirement because it operated on railroad tracks while at the job site and moving to and from the job site. <em>Id. </em>Turning to the second requirement, the Court recognized that the Tamper involved only the pushing and pulling of its own \u201cbuggies,\u201d \u201ca projector buggy which is pushed along the track and a receiver buggy permanently installed on the rear of the Tamper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 715-16. The Court differentiated the pushing and pulling of the Tamper\u2019s buggies, which the Tamper did only when performing \u201cits own particular functions\u201d at the work site, from the pushing and pulling of railroad cars normally done by a locomotive. <em>Id. </em>at 716. The Tamper, the Court pointed out, did not push or pull anything to and from the job site. <em>Id. </em>at 720. Although recognizing that the LIA \u201cshould be liberally construed,\u201d the Court concluded that the Tamper was not a locomotive for purposes of the LIA, explaining that the LIA\u2019s coverage \u201ccannot be extended indefinitely.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>In the instant case, it is clear that the Cat Car satisfies the first requirement of a locomotive\u2014it operates on railroad tracks. With regard to the second requirement, however, we conclude that the Cat Car does not perform a locomotive function. There is no evidence in the record that Amtrak used the Cat Car to push or pull railroad cars along railroad tracks at the time of the accident or at any other time that it was employed in Amtrak\u2019s service. <em>Cf. Balt. &amp; Ohio Ry. Co. v. Jackson, </em>353 U.S. 325, 329, 77 S.Ct. 842, 1 L.Ed.2d 862 (1957) (\u201cHere <em>at the time of the injury </em>it is admitted that petitioner was putting the motor track car to locomotive uses in pulling a hand car used to haul material, tools, and equipment.\u201d (Emphasis added)). In fact, on the night and early morning in question, the Cat Car was operating as a maintenance vehicle, used by the crew to take electrical alignment readings. The Cat Car was neither attached to another car, nor was it pulling any other car.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Collins bases her claim that the Cat Car is a locomotive under the LIA on the fact that it is \u201cself-propelled and equipped with couplers and buffers\u201d and \u201cis specifically designed to pull a companion on-track cable reel railer.\u201d She also points out that the Cat Car was equipped with locomotive-style headlights and mirrors. The fact, however, that the Cat Car was designed to perform a locomotive function or was capable of operating as a locomotive does not meet the requirement that it actually performed such function.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>therefore conclude that the trial court did not err in granting Amtrak\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Admission of Redacted Transcript</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">During trial, Collins sought to introduce a transcript of an audio transmission between a train dispatcher and Charles Duld, a management employee of Amtrak, recorded on the morning of the Decedent\u2019s death. Amtrak, through a motion in limine, sought to exclude the transcript from evidence. In particular, Amtrak requested that one statement from the transcript be excluded\u2014Duld\u2019s response to learning that the Decedent and his crew were working under energized wires. The trial court admitted the transcript, but not the challenged statement. The redacted statement followed the train dispatcher\u2019s response to Duld\u2019s question: \u201cDid they ever ask for the power to be removed?\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">TRAIN DISPATCHER: No, there was no plate request up, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">[DULD]: Ok. Jesus, that\u2019s unbelievable. So, those guys went in there and never asked for any power out?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Collins argues that, by ordering the redaction of that language from the transcript without explanation or any \u201cbasis for differentiation between the portion of the statement excluded and the portion admitted,\u201d the trial court abused its discretion. Amtrak responds that, \u201c[although the trial judge did not fully explain its reasons for excluding [the statement],\u201d the judge properly excluded the statement in the transcript. Amtrak posits several reasons that the exclusion was appropriate: (1) \u201cthe statement was inadmissible as it was solely commentary and opinion evidence from a lay witness who was not called at trial;\u201d (2) the statement was irrelevant; and (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>the court recognized that Duld\u2019s comment was ambiguous and Duld did not testify to explain his statement. Even assuming error, Amtrak contends that such error was harmless, because there was ample evidence introduced at trial that the practice of working under an energized line was unusual, which was the same fact that the redacted statement tended to prove.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">In making its ruling, the trial court decided that the transcript was admissible under Rule 5-803(a)(4) or (a)(1), as an exception to the hearsay rule, but stated that the redacted statement fell outside of the rule.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The redacted statement, the court noted, \u201cgoes over the line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Even assuming that the redaction of the statement at issue was error, we conclude that such error was harmless, and thus the trial court did not abuse its discretion. <em>Flores v. Bell, </em>398 Md. 27, 33, 919 A.2d 716 (2007). The redacted statement, namely Duld\u2019s response, \u201cJesus, that\u2019s unbelievable. So, those guys went in there and never asked for any power out?,\u201d suggests that it was unusual and rare for a crew to be working under an energized wire. We agree with Amtrak that \u201c[tjhere was ample evidence on this point from other sources.\u201d Breder, the Cat Car operator on the morning of the accident, testified that 99% of the time his crew worked under a deenergized wire and described working under an energized wire as a \u201crare occurrence.\u201d Nangle testified that the percentage that electric traction employees worked under an energized line versus a de-energized line prior to the Decedent\u2019s accident was \u201cminimal but it is done,\u201d and agreed that work was done under a de-energized line 90 to 99% of the time.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Collins, however, argues that the redacted portion should have been admitted because the excluded response was relevant to demonstrate that the practice of working under an energized wire \u201cwas viewed as very questionable by those Amtrak employees outside of the Mid-Atlantic Division-South.\u201d The redacted statement, Collins asserts, implies that the \u201cother areas of Amtrak <em>never </em>engaged in the practice,\u201d thereby supporting Collins\u2019 contention that \u201cthe activity should <em>never </em>have been allowed.\u201d (Emphasis in original). There was, however, evidence at trial that other areas of Amtrak did not engage in the practice of working under an energized wire. Nangle testified that, based on an internal investigation, the Mid-Atlantic Division-South was the only division that did catenary line maintenance under an energized line. Furthermore, the Amtrak Investigation Committee Report, prepared by Amtrak management following the Decedent\u2019s accident, stated that the \u201cMid-Atlantic Division South-including the Perryville and Baltimore Cat Car gangs\u2014is the only area in the Northeast Corridor that manually ties-down pantographs <em>or checks catena'll alignment with the pantograph raised under an energized wire.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Because the record already contains sufficient evidence of Collins\u2019 alternative interpretation of the redacted statement, we again conclude that any assumed error was harmless. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the redacted transcript of the conversation between Duld and the train dispatcher.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.

Co., </em>818 F.2d 713, 715 (10th Cir.1987), the Court cited to <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fort Worth &amp; Denver City Railway Co., </em>21 F.Supp. 916, 918-19 (N.D.Tex.1937), in which it was determined that a crane used to unload boulders at a railroad construction site was a locomotive because it pushed or pulled cars loaded with boulders to and from the construction location. The <em>Garcia </em>Court, however, opined: \"When the crane was performing its specialized function of lifting boulders and placing them under the tracks, it was not a locomotive. However, it was a locomotive when it performed the separate function of pushing or pulling railroad cars to and from the job site.\" 818 F.2d at 720. Thus the same vehicle can be a locomotive under the LIA at certain times and cannot be a locomotive at other times, depending on what function it is actually performing. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>there was no evidence in the record that the Cat Car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>ever pulled a companion on-track cable reel trailer, and, even if it did, there was no evidence that the cable reel trailer was not integral to the Cat Car\u2019s \u201cspecial work site function,\u201d and thus not a locomotive. <em>See id. </em>at 720.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b343-6\">. Collins argues that the court found that \u201cthe statement as a whole satisfied the requirements of admissibility found in Maryland Rule 5-803(a)(4) &amp; (a)(1), but nevertheless excluded the stated language without further explanation.\u201d We read the court's ruling as admitting all the statements in the transcript under Rule 5-803 but excluding the redacted portion as not within Rule 5- 803.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\">. The statement also implied that there was a safer alternative available to the crew, namely, requesting the power be turned off and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>working under a de-energized line. Again, there was ample evidence on that point.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
