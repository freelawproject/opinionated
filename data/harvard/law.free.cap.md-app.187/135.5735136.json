The State and Gaumer, appellants, opposed WBAL\u2019s motion. Appellants Teresa and Hugh Brown (the \u201cBrowns\u201d), the parents of Josie Brown, filed a motion under Rule 16-1009 to seal or limit inspection of the record (the \u201cMotion to Seal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>The State and Gaumer appeal the circuit court\u2019s October 23, 2007, Opinion and Order granting WBAL\u2019s motion to access and copy the DVD and the audiotape (the \u201cOrder\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Browns appeal the court\u2019s denial of the Motion to Seal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this Court, WBAL has filed a motion to dismiss the State\u2019s and Gaumer\u2019s appeals, and has agreed to the further redaction of the DVD and audiotape.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The appeals have been consolidated and we have condensed and reframed the questions presented as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">I.

We shall, however, remand to the circuit court with instructions to amend the. respective orders to reflect a further redaction of the subject exhibits in accordance with WBAL\u2019s representations before this Court.'<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Gaumer was convicted of first-degree murder and first-degree rape of Josie Brown by a jury sitting in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. We need not set out the details of the crime in this Opinion. It is sufficient to state that Gaumer\u2019s videotaped confession (\u201cthe DVD\u201d) and his separate audiotaped confession (\u201cthe audiotape\u201d) are disturbingly graphic, and that concerns raised, especially by the Browns, are understandable.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">During Gaumer\u2019s trial, the State introduced the DVD and the audiotape into evidence. Several news reporters submitted informal requests to the court to copy the DVD, which the court denied without prejudice. On May 15, 2007, the day of Gaumer\u2019s sentencing, a WBAL reporter requested copies of certain trial exhibits. On May 16, 2007, WBAL, through counsel, submitted a letter to the court in support of its request to obtain copies of the exhibits. In addition, on May 17, 2007, a number of news organizations requested full copies of the DVD. In regard to these media requests, we refer to the statement of facts in the Opinion and Order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule \u00a7 4-322(a), this Court ordered that the DVD and the audiotaped confession be returned to the custody of the Baltimore County Police along with other exhibits. Noting that the exhibits had been returned to the custody of the Baltimore County Police, the Court denied [WBAL\u2019s] request [for copies of the exhibits] ... William Toohey, the Department\u2019s Director of Media Relations, provided a written response denying this request, stating that, \u201csince Judge Norman denied the request of the media to have a copy of the DVD, their attorneys should appeal [that] decision, and we will await a final decision ... before releasing the DVD requested.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">On May 23, 2007, WBAL filed the Motion for Access. Gaumer appealed his conviction on June 5, 2007 (the \u201cCriminal Appeal\u201d), and, on June 8, 2007, the State filed a response in opposition to the Motion for Access. Gaumer did not file a written response. Based on the Criminal Appeal, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>record was transferred by the circuit court to this Court one week before the August 18, 2007, hearing on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The circuit court granted WBAL\u2019s Motion for Access and ordered that WBAL be provided with copies, or, at its expense, to have copies made of the requested trial exhibits with the exception of photographs depicting Gaumer in the company of people other than his family. The State immediately filed a motion to stay. The court granted a temporary motion to stay the court\u2019s order pending a further hearing. The State and Gaumer appealed the Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">On November 8, 2007, the Browns filed the Motion to Seal. WBAL filed an opposition in response. Following a hearing on February 29, 2008, the circuit court, by its March 5, 2008, order denied the Browns\u2019 Motion to Seal and granted WBAL \u201cpermission to copy portions of the DVD and the audiotape, as requested in their Motion\u201d as well as permission to \u201ccopy photographs of the [defendant, depicted alone or with family members only.\u201d It extended its earlier stay pending the outcome of an appeal. The Browns appealed this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Gaumer\u2019s criminal conviction was affirmed by this Court on December 22, 2008. His petition for <em>certiorari </em>was denied by the Court of Appeals on April 10, 2009.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We are not aware of any further proceedings challenging his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">I. WBAL\u2019s Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">WBAL contends that neither the State nor Gaumer is entitled to appeal the Order and has moved to dismiss their appeals (the \u201cMotion to Dismiss\u201d). WBAL argues that the circuit court\u2019s order adjudicated all of its interests in the case, but as to the State and Gaumer, it was neither a final judgment nor an appealable collateral order, and that even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>it were an appealable order, the State would not have the right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">A. Final, Appealable Order 1. Final Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Maryland Code (1978, 2006 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 12-801 Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJ\u201d) provides that \u201c[t]he right of appeal exists from a final judgment entered by a court in the exercise of original, special, limited, [or] statutory jurisdiction, unless in a particular case the right of appeal is expressly denied by law.\u201d To qualify as a final judgment, the judgment must be \u201c \u2018so final as to determine and conclude rights involved, or deny the appellant means of further prosecuting or defending his rights and interests in the subject matter of the proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Quillens v. Moore, </em>399 Md. 97, 115, 923 A.2d 15 (2007) (quoting <em>Cant v. Bartlett, </em>292 Md. 611, 614, 440 A.2d 388 (1982)). The Court of Appeals has recognized three defining attributes of a final judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">(1) it must be intended by the court as an unqualified, final disposition of the matter in controversy, (2) unless the court properly acts pursuant to Md. Rule 2-602(b), it must adjudicate or complete the adjudication of all claims against all parties, and (3) the clerk must make a proper record of it in accordance with Md. Rule 2-601.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-8\"><em>Rohrbeck v. Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. 28, 41, 566 A.2d 767 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Here, all of the defining attributes of a final judgment are present. The court clearly intended its ruling to be final and complete, with no qualifications. The interests of the State and Gaumer in the underlying criminal case, subject to Gaumer\u2019s appeal to this Court, were concluded by the rendering of a verdict and pronouncement of Gaumer\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There was, therefore, no reason to invoke Maryland Rule 2-602(b) because the Order adjudicated all of the claims pending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>in the proceeding.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The docket entry of October 24, 2007, confirms that the clerk properly recorded the judgment in accordance with Md. Rule 2-601.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Even though a ruling governing access matters in a criminal case might not always be a final judgment as to the State and the criminal defendant, the Order was a final judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">2. Collateral Order</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Although we have held that the Order qualified as a final judgment in this case, we will address, alternatively, WBAL\u2019s argument that the Order was not an appealable collateral order. We do so because access issues are often likely to arise under circumstances where the underlying criminal case is not complete. As WBAL points out, \u201corders governing access matters do not adjudicate the only interests that the parties have in the case, and they rarely if ever complete the adjudication of all claims against all parties.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">To qualify as an appealable collateral order, the order must:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>(1) conclusively determine!] the disputed question, (2)re~ solve! ] an important issue, (3) resolve! ] an issue that is completely separate from the merits of the action, and (4) ... be effectively unreviewable if the appeal had to await the entry of a final judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-5\"><em>Ehrlich v. Grove, </em>396 Md. 550, 563, 914 A.2d 783 (2007) (quoting <em>Pittsburgh Corning Corp. v. James, </em>353 Md. 657, 660-61, 728 A.2d 210 (1999)). A qualifying collateral order is immediately appealable. <em>See Hudson v. Hous. Auth., </em>402 Md. 18, 25-26, 935 A.2d 395 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Even if the Order did not qualify as a final order, it would qualify as an immediately appealable collateral order for both the State and Gaumer. By permitting WBAL to copy portions of the audiotape and the DVD, the court conclusively determined the disputed and important issue presented by the Motion for Access. That determination resolved an issue that was completely separate from the merits of the underlying criminal action, i.e., whether Gaumer was guilty of the crime charged and, if so, his punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The Order was effectively unreviewable in an appeal from the final judgment in Gaumer\u2019s criminal case. <em>See Mann v. State\u2019s Attorney for Montgomery County, </em>298 Md. 160, 164-65, 468 A.2d 124 (1983) (holding that an order granting the media the right to interview a defendant in a capital murder case was unreviewable upon appeal in the criminal trial, and therefore immediately appealable as a collateral order, because the review on appeal would have been too late to cure any damage to the defendant from what was said in the interview). As WBAL notes, \u201csince the [the Order] was entered after [Gaumer] noted an appeal of his conviction, [Gaumer] may not be able to contest the Order through that appeal or claim that the trial court\u2019s decision infected the conviction in some way.\u201d We agree that the grant of the Motion for Access could not have been considered an error in the criminal case because the criminal trial had been concluded before the Order was issued. In fact, WBAL did not make its formal request until the day of Gaumer\u2019s sentencing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>When the Order granting the Motion for Access was issued, the appeal in the criminal case had been filed and the time for appeal had passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">B. The State\u2019s Right to Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">WBAL argues that the State may not appeal the Order because its right to appeal in a criminal proceeding is limited by CJ \u00a7 12-302(c).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals has stated, \u201c[t]he State\u2019s right to appeal in criminal cases [is] based entirely on statute[, and,] [u]nless the issue presented may be properly categorized as one of the actions enumerated in [CJ \u00a7 12-302(c)], the State has no power to seek appellate review.\u201d <em>State v. Manck, </em>385 Md. 581, 597-98, 870 A.2d 196 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The State, however, has the same right under CJ \u00a7 12-301 as other parties to appeal in a civil proceeding. <em>See, e.g., State v. Hicks, </em>139 Md.App. 1, 6, 773 A.2d 1056 (2001) (\u201cBecause a petition for a writ of <em>coram nobis </em>is a civil proceeding, the State is not limited to the circumstances described in CJ \u00a7 12-302(c).\u201d). Moreover, \u201c[s]imply because a motion is filed in a court that exercises criminal jurisdiction\u201d does not mean \u201cthat the proceeding arising from the motion must, <em>ipso facto, </em>be criminal in nature[.]\u201d <em>State v. Strickland, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>42 Md.App. 357, 359, 400 A.2d 451 (1979). In <em>Strickland, </em>the State was permitted to appeal a circuit court\u2019s grant of a motion for the a return of seized money because the motion was \u201cmore akin to a replevin, a civil action, than criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We stated, <em>id. </em>at 360, 400 A.2d 451:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">We think Strickland\u2019s petition, even though filed in the criminal case, was a request that the court determine title to personal property. As such, regardless of what Strickland chooses to call it, that aspect of the case is civil, not criminal, and it matters not one whit that the money was introduced as evidence in a trial for violation of a criminal statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">We hold that the proceeding in the circuit court to recover money that was introduced into evidence, in a bribery trial, was civil in nature, and that the State has the right to appeal an order of court directing that the money be paid over to the briber.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">We are also guided in this analysis by the Court of Appeals\u2019 explanation in <em>News American Division, Hearst Corp. v. State, </em>294 Md. 30, 40, 447 A.2d 1264 (1982), that there are at least three separate judicial avenues available to the press to oppose an order issued in a criminal case that it believes infringes upon its First Amendment rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">1. By an application to an appellate court for review, by extraordinary writ, of the action of the order-entering court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">2. By appearing before the order-entering court in the case in which the order is entered, with further review on direct appeal by the press from an adverse determination in that forum; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">3. By applying to another trial court, or to the order-entering court in a separate civil action, for an injunction or declaratory judgment, with further review by direct appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">The <em>Hearst </em>Court stated that intervention in the criminal case was more appropriate than pursuing the issue in another court. <em>Id. </em>at 41, 447 A.2d 1264. In that case, a newspaper was granted leave to intervene in a criminal case and to be heard in opposition to the defense counsel\u2019s request for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>order to prohibit prosecutors from discussing the case with the media. <em>Id. </em>Hearst appealed the circuit court\u2019s decision to order those involved in the case to refrain from making extrajudicial statements. The defendant cross-appealed the court\u2019s order to allow Hearst to intervene. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">This Court held that Hearst was not permitted to intervene in a criminal case, but the Court of Appeals granted <em>certiorari </em>and affirmed the intervention. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals explained that a \u201cquest for an order in a separate case\u201d would have been \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d because it would be \u201c \u2018an incongruous and dangerous situation [if] one Circuit Court judge of this State could paralyze the entire administration of justice in the law courts thereof, both civil and criminal, byway of injunction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41-42, 447 A.2d 1264 (quoting <em>Kardy v. Shook, </em>237 Md. 524, 533, 207 A.2d 83 (1965)). In concluding that intervention was appropriate, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">A procedure under which the press appears by motion in the criminal case when an order restricting pretrial publicity is requested, or has been entered, has the advantage of initially presenting the issues to the trial judge for his consideration in the circumstances of the particular case. The trial judge is in a better position than an appellate court to evaluate matters which may be rapidly unfolding before him and in the community in which the criminal case is pending. The trial judge is also the one who must initially consider how effective alternative methods of protecting the fair trial right of the accused might be under the circumstances. Allowing the press to appear by motion in the criminal case also furnishes the trial court with the benefit of argument by an advocate of First Amendment interests. Typically the request for a restrictive order will be made by the defense and there is little incentive on the part of the State to oppose it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 44-45, 447 A.2d 1264.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">WBAL does not rest its position in this case on the First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Amendment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It states, instead, that \u201c[w]hile the \u2018special and compelling reason\u2019 standard established by the Rules has parallels to the test applied to First Amendment access questions, the source of the standard is the Maryland Rules, not the First Amendment.\u201d Notwithstanding the basis for WBAL\u2019s claim, the issues presented are sufficiently similar to a First Amendment claim to apply the <em>Hearst </em>Court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Although the Motion for Access was made post-trial, we are persuaded that intervention in the criminal trial was a viable and appropriate judicial avenue to gain access to the court records that are presumed \u201copen to the public for inspection and copying and for which access has been denied.\u201d Rule 16-1002(a); Rule 16-1003. By intervention, the issues would be presented \u201cto the trial judge for his consideration in the circumstances of the particular case ... with the benefit of argument by an advocate of [the intervener\u2019s] interests.\u201d <em>Hearst, </em>294 Md. at 42, 447 A.2d 1264. Certainly the trial judge was in the best position to evaluate the request and balance any competing interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Although the Motion for Access was filed in the criminal proceeding, the relief sought was civil in nature and could have been sought in \u201ca separate civil action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30, 447 A.2d 1264. Therefore, we hold that the State\u2019s right to appeal in this case was not limited by CJ \u00a7 12-302(c). The Motion to Dismiss is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">II. Order Granting the Motion for Access A. Circuit Court\u2019s Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">After WBAL filed the Motion for Access in the circuit court, the case record was transferred to this Court pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Criminal Appeal. The State and Gaumer argue that, under Rule 16-1011, transfer of the record to this Court one week prior to the hearing divested the circuit court of jurisdiction to consider the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Rule 16\u20141 Oil (a) (1)\u2014(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">(a) If, upon a request for inspection of a court record, a custodian is in doubt whether the record is subject to inspection under the Rules in this Chapter, the custodian, after making a reasonable effort to notify the person seeking inspection and each person to whom the court record pertains, shall apply in writing for a preliminary judicial determination whether the court record is subject to inspection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">(1) If the record is in an appellate court or an orphan\u2019s court, the application shall be to the chief judge of the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-8\">(2) If the record is in a circuit court, the application shall be made to the county administrative judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">In regard to statutory interpretation, the Court of Appeals in <em>Barbre v. Pope, </em>402 Md. 157, 172-73, 935 A.2d 699 (2007), explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-10\">We begin our analysis by first looking to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole to ensure that \u201c \u2018no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u2019 \u201d Further, whenever possible, an interpretation should be given to the statutory provisions which does not lead to absurd consequences. If the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions and our analysis ends. If however, the language is subject to more than one interpretation, it is ambiguous, and we resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, and statutory purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An\">(Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">We have stated that \u201c[t]he same fundamental principles of statutory construction apply to the interpretation of a rule[,]\u201d <em>Hoang v. Hewitt Avenue Associates, LLC, </em>177 Md.App. 562, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>588, 936 A.2d 915 (2007), and that the \u201ccardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intention.\u201d <em>Chesapeake Bank of Maryland v. Monro Muffler/Brake, Inc., </em>166 Md.App. 695, 723, 891 A.2d 384 (2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>392 Md. 726, 898 A.2d 1005 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Rule 16-1011(a) states that, \u201c[i]f ... a <em>custodian </em>is in doubt whether the record is subject to inspection under the Rules in this Chapter, the <em>custodian ... </em>shall apply in writing for a preliminary judicial determination whether the court record is subject to inspection.\u201d (Emphasis added.) For the purposes of the Rule, the \u201ccustodian\u201d is \u201cthe clerk of a court[ ] and any other authorized individual who has physical custody and control of a court record.\u201d Rule 16\u20141001(f). According to its plain language, Rule 16-1011(a) applies to requests for inspection of a court record made to a clerk or physical holder of the record, and, if a custodian is in doubt as to whether the court record is subject to inspection, the custodian may apply for a \u201cpreliminary judicial determination.\u201d The Rule does not apply to proceedings filed to compel access, and the transfer of the case record to this Court in the Criminal Appeal did not divest the circuit court of jurisdiction to decide the pending Motion for Access.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\"> The Court of Appeals has made clear that a circuit court retains fundamental jurisdiction in cases where an appeal is pending so long as the exercise of that jurisdiction does not \u201cpreclude[ ] or hamper[ ] the appellate court from acting on the matter before it,\u201d and \u201c[a]ny post-judgment ruling by a circuit court that [precludes or hampers judicial review] may be subject to reversal on appeal, but it is not void <em>ab initio </em>for lack of jurisdiction to enter it.\u201d <em>Jackson v.

According to the State, dissemination of the exhibits could \u201champer\u201d this Court\u2019s consideration of the issues in Gaumer\u2019s criminal appeal by affecting a potential jury if anew trial should be granted.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">In its post-trial Order, the court \u201cdid not re-decide the merits of the case or rule upon any of the issues pending\u201d before this Court on appeal. <em>Cottman, </em>395 Md. at 741, 912 A.2d 620. As we discuss below, the impact of media dissemination of the DVD and the audiotape on a potential jury pool can be an appropriate factor to consider in deciding whether to deny or grant a motion for access, but it does not affect the court\u2019s fundamental jurisdiction to consider the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">We hold that the circuit court had jurisdiction to consider WBAL\u2019s motion, and was not bound to refrain from exercising that jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">B. Abuse of Discretion</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">We will only disturb a circuit court\u2019s discretionary decisions when it has abused its discretion. In explaining the abuse of discretion standard, the Court of Appeals in <em>King v. State, </em>407 Md. 682, 697, 967 A.2d 790 (2009), recently cited this Court\u2019s analysis in <em>North v. North, </em>102 Md.App. 1, 13-14, 648 A.2d 1025(1994):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-10\">\u201cAbuse of discretion\u201d is one of those very general, amorphous terms that appellate courts use and apply with great frequency but which they have defined in many different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>ways. It has been said to occur \u201cwhere no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court,\u201d or when the court acts \u201cwithout reference to any guiding rules or principles.\u201d It has also been said to exist when the ruling under consideration \u201cappears to have been made on untenable grounds,\u201d when the ruling is \u201cclearly against the logic and effect of facts and inferences before the court,\u201d when the ruling is \u201cclearly untenable, unfairly depriving a litigant of a substantial right and denying a just result,\u201d when the ruling is \u201cviolative of fact and logic,\u201d or when it constitutes an \u201cuntenable judicial act that defies reason and works an injustice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">There is a certain commonality in all these definitions, to the extent that they express the notion that a ruling reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard will not be reversed simply because the appellate court would not have made the same ruling. The decision under consideration has to be well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what that court deems minimally acceptable. That kind of distance can arise in a number of ways, among which are that the ruling either does not logically follow from the findings upon which it supposedly rests or has no reasonable relationship to its announced objective. That, we think, is included within the notion of \u201cuntenable grounds,\u201d \u201cviolative of fact and logic,\u201d and \u201cagainst the logic and effect of facts and inferences before the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">(Alterations in original) (Internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The State, the Browns, and Gaumer argue that the court abused its discretion in granting the Motion for Access and in denying the Motion to Seal. More particularly, the State and the Browns contend that, in the context of this case, the protection of the victims\u2019 rights outweighs the rights of the public to access court records. Gaumer contends that the Order violated his fair trial rights. All appellants contend that transcripts of the DVD and the audiotape, which had been released in full, were sufficient to satisfy the Access to Court Records Rules. We address each contention in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>1. Victims\u2019 Rights</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">The State and the Browns contend that the court abused its discretion by not recognizing that the Browns\u2019 rights under Article 47 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights outweighed the media\u2019s right to access and copy the court records. Article 47(a) provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a] victim of crime shall be treated by agents of the state with dignity, respect, and sensitivity during all phases of the criminal justice process.\u201d More specifically, a victim has to be informed of the \u201ccriminal justice proceeding\u201d and \u201cupon request and if practicable, to be notified of, to attend, and to be heard\u201d at such a proceeding as such rights \u201care implemented and the terms \u2018crime[,]\u2019 \u2018criminal justice proceeding[,]\u2019 and \u2018victim\u2019 are all specified by law.\u201d Article 47(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The circuit court, in making its determination to grant the Motion for Access, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">The Court is mindful that people do.not willingly choose to become victims of violent crimes and that, if the victim\u2019s family were subjected to such broadcasts, they would be reminded of the tragedy that the Defendant has visited upon them. However, if either the DVD or audiotape are broadcast, now or in the future, the victim\u2019s family can choose not to receive those broadcasts. The audiotape and those portions of the DVD sought by the media do not identify the victim\u2019s family members, so their identities would not be compromised by releasing the DVD and audiotape for copying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">Against the understandable concerns for the victim\u2019s family, the Court must also weigh the significant public interest in fully disclosing what transpired in court. The public has a legitimate interest to ensure that its judicial and criminal justice systems are fair and effective. One of the best ways to ensure public confidence in its judicial system is to permit public access to its operations. The Petitioner seeks copies of certain portions of the DVD and audiotape to broadcast to the public. Any member of the public who attended the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>trial would have seen and heard, in their complete form, the DVD and audiotape when they were played to the jury. ... Given what the victim\u2019s family has had to endure because of the Defendant\u2019s crime, concerns that a media broadcast of the DVD and/or the audiotape might have a greater negative impact on them is speculative at best. Considering the facts of the pending matter, public interest in the full disclosure of judicial proceedings, and Maryland Rule \u00a7 16-1000[sic] <em>et seq., </em>the Court finds that there is no \u201ccompelling need\u201d to prohibit the media from obtaining copies of the DVD and audiotape.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">The Browns argue that airing the recordings of the \u201cgraphic details of [the] murder\u201d would cause \u201cextreme damage[,]\u201d \u201cextreme distressL,]\u201d and \u201csubstantial and irreparable harm\u201d to them and especially to Josie Brown\u2019s daughter, now age 11, who has so far \u201cbeen shielded\u201d from the \u201chorrific facts\u201d of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The State argues that \u201cthe victim\u2019s family\u2019s interests in lessening harmful and painful publicity should be a significant factor in assessing whether copies of criminal exhibits should be handed out after the trial[,]\u201d and, \u201cbecause the trial court gave short shrift to the family\u2019s right to privacy, it abused its discretion.\u201d It states that \u201cthe trial court improperly dismissed the concerns for invasion of the family\u2019s privacy that would accompany the publication of [ ] Gaumer\u2019s murder confessions, suggesting that the family could simply ignore any broadcast.\u201d It also argues that there was nothing \u201cspeculative\u201d about the \u201cgreater negative impact\u201d that airing the recordings would have on the Browns in comparison to what they have already endured.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Maryland courts have not previously addressed the interplay between Article 47 and a court\u2019s discretion to limit or seal a case record, but, in <em>State v. Broberg, </em>842 Md. 544, 565-66, 677 A.2d 602 (1996), the Court of Appeals ruled that Article 47 does not \u201cpreclude [a] trial judge from exercising discretion regarding the admission of photographic evidence.\u201d Similarly, we hold that Article 47 did not preclude the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>judge from exercising discretion regarding access to and the copying of exhibits at issue in this case. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">In <em>Cianos v. State, </em>388 Md. 406, 413, 659 A.2d 291 (1995), the Court of Appeals stated that \u201ctrial judges <em>must </em>give appropriate consideration to the impact of crime upon the victims.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The Court also stated that \u201cArticle 47 \u2018represents the strong public policy that victims should have more rights and should be informed of the proceedings, that they should be treated fairly, and in certain cases, that they should be heard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hoile v. State, </em>404 Md. 591, 605, 948 A.2d 30 (2008) (quoting <em>Lopez-Sanchez v. State, </em>388 Md. 214, 229, 879 A.2d 695 (2005)). Additionally, the General Assembly has demonstrated a sound commitment to the rights of victims in criminal cases with legislation speaking to the rights of victims in numerous statutes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Rules 16-1001, <em>et seq., </em>clearly reflect the common law presumption of the openness of court records that, as a general rule, can only be overcome by a \u201cspecial and compelling reason[.]\u201d Rule 16-1009(d)(4)(A); <em>See Baltimore Sun Co. v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>359 Md. 653, 660-61, 755 A.2d 1130 (2000); <em>Group W Television v. State, </em>96 Md. App. 712, 716, 626 A.2d 1032 (1993); <em>Baltimore Sun v.

We explained the balancing process required to seal a court record as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">In engaging in this difficult balancing process, the trial court will obviously find some interests of more importance in some cases than others, depending on the nature of the crime, defendant, victim, and report itself. If, upon completion of this process, the court concludes that one or more compelling interests served by maintaining the confidentiality of all or part of the report outweigh the First Amendment right of access to it, then the court may seal all or part of the report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">Finally, in making its determination, \u201c[t]he court should consider alternatives to a broad seal, including the option of redacting portions of pleadings or transcripts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 247, 607 A.2d 565 (quoting <em>Baltimore Sun Co. v. Colbert, </em>323 Md. 290, 306, 593 A.2d 224 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">Under the Rules, a court record that is presumed to be open for inspection and copying may be sealed only for special and compelling reasons. The Rules favor access, but they do not deny discretion to the trial judge to seal or to limit access. In the exercise of that discretion, the nature of the balancing process remains essentially the same. Accordingly, even if we were to assume that all of the asserted rights or interests are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>of equal importance at the beginning of the balancing process, the particular circumstances of each case, including the crime, the defendant, the victim, and the posture of the case, will cause some interests to rise and others to fall in importance during the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Contrary to the State\u2019s assertion, the court did not improperly dismiss the Browns\u2019 privacy concerns. The court clearly recognized those concerns in the difficult process of balancing their interests against the public\u2019s right of access to court records. The court considered the Browns\u2019 argument that they will be \u201cirreparably harmed\u201d by the airing of the \u201chorrific facts\u201d of Josie Brown\u2019s murder, but found the argument \u201cspeculative\u201d in light of the fact that WBAL did not seek those portions of the confession that contain the \u201chorrific facts\u201d of the murder and that extensive coverage of the murder trial had already occurred. In the court\u2019s view, because full transcripts of both the DVD and the audiotape were already released, the airing of redacted versions of the DVD and the audiotape sought by WBAL could hardly have much more of a negative impact on the Browns then what they had already endured.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Article 47 requires due consideration of the impact of crimes upon the victims in \u201call phases of the criminal justice process.\u201d It does not, however, provide victims with an absolute right to veto a request to access and copy court records. The issue remains one of balancing competing interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">In light of the circumstances and the applicable rules and principles involved, we cannot say that the decision in this case was unreasonable or so far removed from any imaginable center mark that it was untenable. Nor can we say that, in its balancing of the competing interests, the court did not treat the Browns with \u201cdignity, respect, and sensitivity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">WBAL addresses the merits of the Browns\u2019 arguments, but asserts an \u201calternative basis\u201d for affirming the circuit court. It questions the Browns\u2019 standing to file the Motion to Seal and challenges the filing of the Motion to Seal as a collateral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>attack on the Order. Our review of the record indicates that the circuit court, in denying the Motion to Seal, did not consider the standing, collateral attack, or res judicata arguments raised by WBAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">The Browns filed the Motion to Seal on behalf of their daughter, as the \u201cvictim\u2019s representative,\u201d and \u201cindividually,\u201d on behalf of themselves, and as \u201cgrandparents and next best friend\u201d of their granddaughter. Rule 16\u20141009(a)(1)(A) permits \u201ca party to an action in which a case record is filed, including a person who has been permitted to intervene as a party, and a person who is the subject of or is specifically identified in a case record\u201d to file a motion \u201cto seal or otherwise limit inspection of a case record filed in that action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">According to WBAL, the Browns\u2019 standing to file the Motion to Seal is \u201csomewhat unclear.\u201d They are not parties to the criminal trial and they and their granddaughter are not \u201cidentified or referred to in the records at issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The Browns contend that the victim, Josie Brown, was identified in the records at issue and that they have standing as the \u201cvictim\u2019s representative[s].\u201d In addition, they assert that, as family members of the victim, they are also victims of the crime, and they are entitled to rights under Article 47. Both parties recognize the Browns as victims and as the \u201cvictim\u2019s representativefsj\u201d in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The term \u201cvictim\u2019s representative\u201d is a statutory designation that provides certain specified rights. Victims and deceased victims\u2019 representatives are provided with the right to notification, the right to be present at certain proceedings, and, in some circumstances, the right to be heard in the criminal trial, in addition to the right to apply for leave to appeal the denial of specified rights. <em>See, e.g., </em>CP \u00a7 11-103, \u00a7 11-302, \u00a7\u00a7 11-402-11-403. The right to notice may extend to \u201csubsequent proceedings\u201d defined in CP \u00a7 11\u2014503(a), and may include \u201cany other postsentencing court proceeding.\u201d These rights, which serve to implement Article 47, do not, however, make a victim or the victim\u2019s representative a party to the criminal action. <em>See Cianos v. State, </em>338 Md. 406, 410-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>11, 659 A.2d 291(1995); <em>Lopez-Sanchez v. State, </em>388 Md. 214, 224, 879 A.2d 695 (2005). Neither the Rules nor the statutory pro visions cited only generally by the Browns as CP Title 11 create automatic standing for the purpose of participating in an access dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">In our view, intervention would have been appropriate under the Rules to protect the privacy interests of the Brown family in this case, and WBAL concedes that the Browns would have succeeded on a motion to intervene. We agree that the Browns would have had sufficient interest to justify intervention for the purposes of either filing a motion to seal or limit access or to oppose WBAL\u2019s Motion for Access.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Nevertheless, it is not necessary to decide the standing issue to reach the merits in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">We have held that the State was entitled to appeal the grant of the Motion for Access and, in its brief, the State addresses the Browns\u2019 concerns. Therefore, there is one party on each side of the access dispute with standing, making it unnecessary to address the standing issue in order to decide the case on the merits. <em>See, e.g., Garner v. Archers Glen Partners, Inc., </em>405 Md. 43, 949 A.2d 639 (2008); <em>Sugarloaf Citizens Assn. v. Ne. Maryland Waste Disposal Auth., </em>323 Md. 641, 594 A.2d 1115 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">In addition, WBAL has stated in its brief that it acknowledged in the trial court that it \u201cwould not object to the Browns filing a brief <em>amicus curiae </em>in this appealf.]\u201d Were we to dismiss their appeal on the basis of lack of standing to file the Motion to Seal or were we to treat the Motion to Seal as a collateral attack on the Order, we would, under the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>stances, permit the Browns to participate in this appeal as <em>amicus curiae. </em>Rule 8-511.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">2. Fair Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Gaumer argues that the court abused its discretion by granting the Motion for Access in violation of his right to receive a fair trial. To support his contention, he cites a number of cases where trial courts refused to allow the media to have access to court records, including <em>Group W., </em>96 Md.App. at 712, 626 A.2d 1032; <em>United States v. Beckham v. Post-Newsweek Stations, </em>789 F.2d 401 (6th Cir.1986); <em>Belo Broad. Corp. v. Clark, </em>654 F.2d 423 (5th Cir.1981); <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>672 F.2d 1289 (7th Cir.1982); and <em>United States v. Webbe, </em>791 F.2d 103 (8th Cir.1986). The State adds that \u201cthe trial court erroneously ruled that a defendant\u2019s \u2018right to a fair trial is not a factor to weigh\u2019 in the analysis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">In each of the cited cases, the media sought and were denied copies of audio and/or videotapes in a criminal trial. As Gaumer noted, in each case, \u201cfuture proceedings were anticipated because the individual was facing separate but related untried charges, a jury had failed to reach a unanimous verdict, or because other individuals faced future trials arising from the same event.\u201d According to Gaumer, in those cases the court held that \u201ceither the defendant\u2019s or the other potential defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment fair trial rights outweighed the interest in copying and disseminating at least a portion of the disputed evidence, or that a trial judge did not abuse discretion in so concluding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">An essential factor distinguishing this case from those cited by Gaumer is that his criminal trial had concluded when WBAIj filed its Motion for Access. In the cases cited, either the jury was still sitting in the criminal trial or another defendant\u2019s trial was pending at the time the media sought the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">According to Gaumer, \u201cfuture proceedings\u201d could occur in his case, and \u201c[r]elease of highly dramatic audio and video depictions of experienced detectives\u2019 interrogations of a col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>lege student with no experience with the criminal justice system carries a real potential for tainting a future jury pool.\u201d Even if the Criminal Appeal were pending, we would not find this argument particularly persuasive.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Instead, we find instructive the view of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, as articulated in <em>In re NBC, </em>209 U.S.App.D.C. 354, 653 F.2d 609, 614 (D.C.Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">In <em>NBC, </em>the court addressed the risk of post-trial access to court records causing prejudice in the event of a retrial. In that case, the trial court based its denial of a broadcaster\u2019s application for access to court records on the defendants\u2019 interest in securing a fair and impartial jury should the case be retried. In its analysis of the issue, the court stated, <em>id. </em>at 615:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">Protecting the rights of [the defendants] in the event of new trials is a perfectly valid consideration, but our decision in <em>[United States v. Mitchell, </em>551 F.2d 1252 (D.C.Cir.1976), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, Nixon v. Warner Communications, </em>435 U.S. 589, 98 S.Ct. 1306, 55 L.Ed.2d 570 (1978)] makes it clear that restricting the common law right to inspect and copy judicial records is rarely the proper protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">In discussing their decision in <em>Mitchell, </em>the <em>NBC </em>court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">[T]he trial court abused its discretion in refusing to release the tapes [in evidence] merely to avoid the risk of causing possible prejudice at a \u201chypothetical\u201d second trial. [We] doubted whether the risk of potential prejudice at a hypothetical second trial could ever justify infringing upon the common law right of access to judicial records. [We] noted that this argument, taken to its logical conclusion, could result in the tapes never being released since any conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>is always subject to the possibility of successful collateral attack. More importantly, however, [we] found that the risk of prejudice was not sufficiently grave in that case to justify the district court\u2019s action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-5\"><em>Id. </em>(internal footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Here, the court considered Gaumer\u2019s right to receive a fair trial in its analysis but concluded that, based on the post-trial posture of the proceedings, it was no longer a factor to be weighed in deciding whether WBAL was to receive the copies it requested. A concern for Gaumer\u2019s fair trial rights in a speculative future trial can be a valid consideration, but it is a concern that pales in the light of the public\u2019s interest in access to court records and a consideration that would rarely overcome the right to access and copy court records.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Therefore, it was not unreasonable, in this case, for the circuit court to conclude:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">The Defendant has already been tried, convicted and sentenced and, although the matter is currently pending on appeal, he was afforded and received his right to a fair trial. Since the Defendant\u2019s trial has been concluded, the court\u2019s concerns for the Defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial is not a factor to weigh in deciding whether to allow the Petitioner to received the copies of the evidence they requested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">3. Sufficiency of Transcripts</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">The State, Gaumer, and the Browns argue that, if the court is required to allow the media access to the records at issue, copies of the full transcripts of the DVD and the audiotape, already received by WBAL, are sufficient, and compliance with the Access to Court Records Rules does not demand actual copying of the DVD and the audiotape.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>As noted, Rule 16-1001(c) defines a case record, in part, as \u201ca document, information, or other thing that is collected, received, or maintained by a court in connection with one or more specific judicial actions or proceedings.\u201d Rule 16\u20141006(f) specifically refers to \u201caudio, video, and digital recording[s]\u201d as case records, and, as case records, the DVD and the audiotape are court records that are open to the public for inspection, unless the court expressly orders otherwise. Rule 16-1001(e); Rule 16-1002. A person entitled to inspect a court record is entitled to have a copy or printout of the court record, which may be in paper form or, subject to certain conditions, in electronic form. Rule 16-1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The State argues that \u201cproviding the trial exhibits in the form of printed transcripts adequately serves the interest in providing access to judicial proceedings, and satisfies the rules governing access to and inspection of court records.\u201d Gaumer argues that, because WBAL has received a transcript of the videotaped confession, \u201cany obligation to provide \u2018copies\u2019 \u201d has been satisfied. The Browns argue that \u201cWBAL has received a copy of the transcripts and had the opportunity to observe the confession played at trial and report on the events of the proceedings. WBAL has all the information it needs.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">As appellate courts frequently comment when referring to a \u201ccold record,\u201d a. transcript ordinarily reflects only the words spoken, and not how they were said or the physical actions and reactions of the participants present. The circuit court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">One of the best ways to ensure public confidence in its judicial system is to permit public access to its operation. [WBAL] seeks copies of certain portions of the DVD and audiotape to broadcast to the public. Any member of the public who attended the trial would have seen and heard, in their complete form, the DVD and audiotape when they were played to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">In short, a transcript of the DVD and audiotape is not a copy.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">In <em>Group W., </em>we stated that \u201c[ultimately, the decision to permit copying of exhibits is best left to the sound discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>of the trial court, and the trial court is to exercise its discretion in light of the relevant facts and circumstances of the particular case.\u201d 96 Md.App. at 720, 626 A.2d 1032 (citing <em>Nixon, </em>435 U.S. at 589, 98 S.Ct. 1306). Here, the circuit court, under Rule 16-1009, had the discretion to determine what level of copying was appropriate. In exercising that discretion, the court considered the fact that the media had already received the full transcripts of the DVD and the audiotape. In balancing the public\u2019s right to access court records with Gaumer\u2019s fair trial concerns and the Browns\u2019 privacy and victims\u2019 rights concerns, the court\u2019s decision to permit copies of the redacted DVD and audiotape, in addition to the transcripts, was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">In conclusion, we deny WBAL\u2019s Motion to Dismiss the State\u2019s and Gaumer\u2019s appeals. We hold that the circuit court had jurisdiction to consider the Motion for Access and that it did not abuse its discretion by granting the Motion for Access or by denying the Motion to Seal. We shall, however, remand the case to the circuit court for further redaction of the DVD and audiotape as agreed to by WBAL in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS 1/4 TO APPELLANTS; 3/4 TO APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b162-9\">. The circuit court granted WBAL access to copy certain photographs depicting Gaumer with family members. Because appellants have not disputed WBAL\u2019s right to those photographs, we address only the DVD and audiotaped confessions in this Opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b162-10\">. The circuit court\u2019s March 5, 2008, order denied the Browns' Motion to Seal and granted WBAL permission to copy portions of the DVD and audiotape as requested in the Motion for Access. For this reason, we sometimes refer to both the October 23, 2007, order and the March 5, 2008, order as \"the Order.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b162-11\">. WBAL requests those portions of the DVD that correspond to page 2-20 (ending at \"hitting her back\u201d), 41-52 (ending at \"everything like that\u201d), 62-65, 90-94 (ending at \u201cstronger than the average person\u201d), 97-105 (ending at \"did this to me\u201d), and 107-118 of the transcript of Gaumer\u2019s confession.

The Browns asked: \"Whether the media has a constitutional right to obtain a copy of defendants [sic] DVD and audiotape confession?\" Similarly, the State argues that \"fnjeither the common law right of access to court records nor the First Amendment should deter courts from protecting against the oppressive use of judicial records.

It appears that the Browns were aware of the Motion for Access, but, perhaps relying on the State, did not intervene at that time. It is questionable whether intervention would be permitted after appeal of the grant of the Motion for Access, and, therefore, there may be merit to WBAL's collateral attack argument. On the other hand, WBAL seems to recognize that the \u201cparticular circumstances here might pose a closer question than other examples of collateral attacks on court orders.\u201d Because the issue was not fully developed below or within the briefs, we will not decide the case on this alternative basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b184-9\">.
