The court imposed a total sentence of 35 years. In 2007, Williams filed a Motion to Correct Illegal Sentences (\u201cMotion to Correct\u201d). From the denial of his Motion to Correct, Williams presents two questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-10\">I. Did the trial court err by imposing sentences for first degree assault that exceeded the sentences that the court could have imposed for robbery, which was <em>nolle prossed </em>by the State,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon, of which Williams was acquitted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-11\">II. Did the trial court err by imposing upon Williams separate sentences for burglary and assault?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">For the reasons that follow, we shall vacate Williams\u2019s sentence of 25 years for first degree assault of Rochelle Ambrose (\u201cAmbrose\u201d), and remand with instructions that he be re-sentenced on that count to no more than twenty years. In all other respects, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">On August 18, 2001, Ambrose was inside her home, \u201csitting on [her] bed [and] talking on [her] phone[.]\u201d The door to Ambrose\u2019s home \u201cwas unloeked[,] because [her] son [David B. (\u2018David\u2019), who was eight years old] was playing\u201d outside. After Ambrose heard someone running up her stairs, Williams and another man entered her room and put \u201cguns in [her] face.\u201d Williams \u201ctold [Ambrose] to drop the phone\u201d and asked: \u201cWhere is the stuff?\u201d After Ambrose told Williams: \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about[,]\u201d Williams ordered the other man to \u201cgo outside and get [Ambrose\u2019s] son[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">After the other man brought David to Ambrose\u2019s room, Williams and the other man pointed their guns at Ambrose and David. Williams asked: \u201cWhere is it?\u201d Ambrose again stated: \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about[.]\u201d After Ambrose began to cry, Williams told her to \u201cshut up[,]\u201d and hit her in the side of her head with the handle of his gun. On Williams\u2019s order, the other man taped Ambrose and David\u2019s mouths, hands, and feet with duct tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">As the other man went downstairs and through Ambrose\u2019s things, Williams, pointing his gun at Ambrose and David, went through the things in her room. About ten to fifteen minutes later, the man downstairs \u201chollered\u201d to Williams: \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go.\u201d Removing Ambrose\u2019s driver\u2019s license and Social Security card from her purse, Williams told Ambrose: \u201cIf I hear anything about you calling the police, I\u2019m going to kill your son[.]\u201d Taking a fan from Ambrose\u2019s room, Williams and the other man exited her home through a sliding door.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">\u201c[F]umbling with [her] hands until [she] was able to break out\u201d of the duct tape, Ambrose untaped herself and David. After waiting three days because she \u201cwas scared that something was going to happenL,]\u201d Ambrose called police.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Williams was subsequently charged with robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon, simple robbery, first degree assault of David, first degree assault of Ambrose, burglary, theft, and handgun offenses. At Williams\u2019s trial, the State, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>prior to jury deliberations, dismissed the charge of simple robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">After deliberating, the jury convicted Williams of first degree assault of David, first degree assault of Ambrose, and first degree burglary. The jury acquitted Williams of robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon and two handgun offenses. At sentencing, the court imposed a sentence of 25 years for first degree assault of David, a concurrent sentence of 25 years for first degree assault of Ambrose, and a consecutive sentence of ten years for first degree burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">On October 22, 2007, Williams filed the Motion to Correct. He contended that his sentences for first degree assault were illegal because they \u201cexact[ed] a more severe and unanticipated penalty than that which could have been imposed if the prosecution ... had been successful in proving robbery.\u201d Because \u201cthe [\u2018jflagship crime[\u2019] governing the sentence to be imposed ... was [simple] robbery[,]\u201d Williams claimed, \u201cthe maximum possible sentence that could be imposed [for] Williams\u2019 [s] conviction[s] of assault was ... ten years[.]\u201d Williams further asserted that because \u201cthe elements of the assaults are included in the burglary[,]\u201d his sentence for burglary was required to merge with his sentences for assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">On December 10, 2007, the court denied the Motion to Correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">Williams contends that the court erred in imposing a sentence of 25 years for each count of first degree assault, because the sentence \u201cplaced [Williams] in a worse position than if he had been convicted of either of the greater offenses\u201d of simple robbery or robbery with a dangerous or deadly weapon. \u201cHad the jury ... convicted ... Williams of robbery with a dangerous [or deadly] weapon,\u201d he claims, \u201cthe ... court could have sentenced him to up to [twenty] years for the offense[,]<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but could not have imposed separate sentences for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>the assaults of ... Ambrose and her son, the latter offenses being incidental to, and included within, the former.\u201d \u201c[H]ad the jury convicted ... Williams only of simple robbery,\u201d he asserts, \u201cthe maximum sentence [that he] could have received was [fifteen] years[.]\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Williams maintains that \u201cthe fact that [he] was fortunate enough not to be convicted of the greater offenses should not have been to his detriment.\u201d <em>See Simms v. State, </em>288 Md. 712, 723, 421 A.2d 957 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">In <em>Simms, </em>the Court of Appeals addressed the question of \u201cwhether, when a defendant is charged with a greater offense and a lesser included offense which carries a higher maximum penalty, and when he is <em>acquitted </em>of the greater and convicted of the lesser, [he can] properly receive a more severe sentence than could have been imposed had he been convicted of the greater charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 719, 421 A.2d 957 (emphasis in original). Simms was tried on charges of assault with intent to rob and simple assault, which, \u201cunder the prosecution\u2019s evidence and theory of the case, ... were based upon the same acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 715, 421 A.2d 957. After Simms was convicted of simple assault, but acquitted of assault with intent to rob, the court sentenced Simms to twelve years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 716-17, 421 A.2d 957.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">On appeal, Simms \u201ccontended that because the maximum punishment for assault with intent to rob [was] ten years, [his] sentence of twelve years for the lesser included offense of simple assault was improper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 717, 421 A.2d 957. Vacating Simms\u2019s sentence, the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AU6\">To uphold the twelve year [sentence] under these circumstances would be to sanction an extreme anomaly in the criminal law. It would permit [Simms] to be punished more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>severely because of an acquittal on a charge. He would have fared better if he were less successful or had pled guilty to the greater charge of assault with intent to rob.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">Furthermore, Simms ... received something more severe than the maximum for which he was prosecuted. When the State decided to charge assault with intent to rob as well as simple assault based on the same acts, and to proceed to trial on both charges, the State was ... seeking a conviction carrying a maximum possible sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment. ... Under these circumstances, it is unfair to permit the State to exact a more severe and unanticipated penalty than that which could have been imposed if the prosecution had been wholly successful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 723-24, 421 A.2d 957 (citations omitted). <em>See also Dixon v. State, </em>364 Md. 209, 248-49, 772 A.2d 283 (2001) (where, after first trial, court imposed sentence of ten years for greater offense of attempted voluntary manslaughter and twenty years for lesser included offense of first degree assault, and State dismissed charge of attempted voluntary manslaughter at retrial, court\u2019s sentence of twenty years for first degree assault after retrial was illegal, because court was required to merge original first degree assault conviction into conviction for attempted voluntary manslaughter).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">We reach a similar conclusion here. Although the maximum punishment for robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon is twenty years, Williams was sentenced to 25 years for first degree assault of Ambrose, a lesser included offense of robbery of Ambrose with a dangerous and deadly weapon. <em>See Gerald v. State, </em>137 Md.App. 295, 312, 768 A.2d 140 (2001) (merging a conviction for first degree assault into a conviction for robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon). Because Williams received something more severe than the maximum for which he was prosecuted, it would be unfair to permit the State to exact a more severe and unanticipated penalty from him than that which could have been imposed if the State had been wholly successful. <em>See Simms, </em>288 Md. at 724, 421 A.2d 957. Hence, we vacate Williams\u2019s sentence for first degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>assault of Ambrose, and direct the court on remand to re-sentence Williams on that count to no more than twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The State contends that, because \u201cthere was evidence from [which] the jury could infer that [Ambrose] was assaulted in the first degree based on conduct separate and distinct from the conduct that established the ... robbery\u201d with a dangerous and deadly weapon, the offenses do not merge. This contention is unpersuasive. Williams\u2019s charging document is ambiguous as to the particular act for which he was charged with first degree assault of Ambrose. <em>See Gerald, </em>137 Md.App. at 312, 768 A.2d 140 (a conviction for first degree assault merges into a conviction for robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon when the charging document is ambiguous as to the particular act alleged to have constituted first degree assault). Moreover, the court did not instruct the jury as to \u201chow the assault and robbery charges related to one another, how they differed, and what the jury needed to find to convict under both charges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). In light of the court\u2019s failure to give curative instructions, and the ambiguity of Williams\u2019s charging document, we must resolve the question of whether the charges of robbery and assault of Ambrose were based upon the same conduct in Williams\u2019s favor. <em>Id. </em>(\u201c[A]ny ambiguity in [a charging document] or as to how the jury understood the charges must be resolved in [the defendant\u2019s] favor.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Although we agree with Williams that we are required to merge his conviction for first degree assault of Ambrose into the offense of robbery of Ambrose with a dangerous and deadly weapon, we do not agree that we are required to merge his convictions for first degree assault into the offense of simple robbery. \u201cIn Maryland, the required evidence test is usually used to determine whether two offenses arising out of the same act merge.\u201d <em>Marquardt v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 95, 148, 882 A.2d 900 (2005) (citations omitted). \u201cThe focus is on the [\u2019]elements of each offense; if all of the elements of one offense are included in the other offense, so that only the latter offense contains a distinct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>element or distinct elements, the former merges' into the latter.[\u2019]\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>307 Md. 501, 517, 515 A.2d 465 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Here, Williams was charged with first degree assault, which can be committed in two ways: by \u201cintentionally causing] or attempting] to cause serious physical injury to another[,]\u201d or by \u201ccommit[ting] an assault with a firearm[.]\u201d Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2000 Supp.), Art. 27, Section 12A-1, <em>recodified as </em>CL Section 3-202(a). Williams was also charged with simple robbery, which, at the time, we defined as \u201cthe felonious taking and carrying away of the personal property of another, from his person or in his presence, by violence or putting in fear ... or, more succinctly, as larceny from the person, accompanied by violence or putting in fear[.]\u201d <em>West v. State, </em>312 Md. 197, 202, 539 A.2d 231 (1988) (citations omitted). <em>Accord Martin v. State, </em>174 Md.App. 510, 516, 922 A.2d 598 (2007). Neither the element of an intentional cause or attempt to cause serious physical injury nor the use of a firearm is included in the offense of simple robbery. Hence, Williams\u2019s convictions for first degree assault do not merge into the offense of simple robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">We further conclude that Williams\u2019s conviction for first degree assault of David does not merge into the offense of robbery of Ambrose with a dangerous and deadly weapon. Because each of these offenses were committed against a different victim, they are separate and distinct. <em>See Borchardt v. State, </em>367 Md. 91, 148, 786 A.2d 631 (2001) (\u201c[T]he unit of prosecution for the crime of robbery is the individual victim from whose person or possession property is taken by the use of violence or intimidation.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1104, 122 S.Ct. 2309, 152 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2002). Moreover, because Williams took nothing in which David had ownership, custody, or a legal interest, Williams did not rob David. <em>See Miles v. State, </em>88 Md.App. 248, 259, 594 A.2d 634 (1991) (\u201cIn order to be the victim of a robbery, a person must therefore either own, have custody of, or otherwise have a legal interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>in the property.\u201d). Hence, we do not vacate Williams\u2019s sentence for first degree assault of David.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Williams contends that the court \u201cerred in imposing separate sentences\u201d for his convictions for first degree assault and first degree burglary. Conceding that the offenses do not merge under the required evidence test, <em>see Marquardt, supra, </em>164 Md.App. at 148, 882 A.2d 900, he claims that the court \u201cshould have merged the offenses under the rule of lenity[,j because the convictions arose out of a single transaction!;,] and there is no indication by the General Assembly of an intent to punish a defendant separately for the offenses in such a situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">In <em>Marquardt, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">The required evidence test is the threshold standard for determining when two offenses merge, but, in addition,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">we have applied as a principle of statutory construction the \u201crule of lenity,\u201d which \u201cprovides that doubt or ambiguity as to whether the legislature intended that there be multiple punishments for the same act or transaction [\u2018 \u201c]will be resolved against turning a single transaction into multiple offenses.[\u201d \u2019 \u201d]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\"><em>Williams, </em>323 Md. [312,] 321, 593 A.2d 671 [(1991) (quoting <em>White v. State, </em>318 Md. 740, 744, 569 A.2d 1271 (1990) (quoting <em>Bell v. United States, </em>349 U.S. 81, 84, 75 S.Ct. 620, 99 L.Ed. 905 (1955))) ].... \u201c[I]f we are unsure of the legislative intent in punishing offenses as a single merged crime or as distinct offenses, we, in effect, give the defendant the benefit of the doubt and hold that the crimes do merge.\u201d <em>Monoker v. State, </em>321 Md. 214, 222, 582 A.2d 525 (1990) [ (citations omitted)]. The relevant inquiry when applying the rule of lenity is \u201cwhether the two offenses are \u2018of necessity closely intertwined\u2019 or whether one offense is \u2018necessarily the overt act\u2019 of the other.\u201d <em>Pineta v. State, </em>98 Md.App. 614, 620-21, 634 A.2d 982 (1993) (quoting <em>[John</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number><em>son] v. </em>State, [56 Md.App. 205, 215, 467 A.2d 544 (1983)]) (emphasis in Pineta).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-5\"><em>Marquardt, </em>164 Md.App. at 149-50, 882 A.2d 900 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Here, Williams committed first degree burglary when he broke and entered Ambrose\u2019s home with the intent to commit theft or a crime of violence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because the burglary was complete before Williams assaulted Ambrose and David, the burglary was not an \u201covert act\u201d of the assaults. <em>Id. </em>at 150, 882 A.2d 900. Moreover, the language of the statutes defining the offenses does not indicate any \u201cdoubt or ambiguity as to whether the legislature intended that\u201d the offenses be punished distinctly. <em>Id. </em>at 149, 882 A.2d 900.
