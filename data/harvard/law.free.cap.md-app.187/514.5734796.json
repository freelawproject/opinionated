Montgomery County (the \u201cCounty\u201d or the \u201cEmployer\u201d), appellant, claimed that after the work-related event, but before benefits were awarded, the Employee sustained a non-work related injury that she failed to disclose. On that basis, pursuant to Md.Code (2008 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-310.2 of the Labor and Employment Article (\u201cL.E.\u201d), the County filed a \u201cRequest for a Hearing for Referral to the Maryland Insurance Fraud Division.\u201d After an evidentiary hearing, the Commission determined there was insufficient evidence of fraud, and declined to refer the matter to the Division. Thereafter, the County sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The Claimant moved to dismiss, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Commission\u2019s Order was not appealable. The circuit court agreed and dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">This appeal followed. The County presents one question for our review, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-10\">When an employer seeks reimbursement of workers\u2019 compensation benefits based on its belief that an employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>wrongfully obtained those benefits, is the Commission\u2019s determination subject to review in the circuit court as a final order of the Commission? <footnotemark>[1]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">For the reasons that follow, we shall reverse and remand to the circuit court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Valerie Willis, a former Montgomery County Police Officer, injured her left knee during a training exercise on July 20, 2001. Despite the injury, Ms. Willis continued to work. She injured her knee again during \u201ca shooting scenario\u201d in August 2001, for which she did not seek medical treatment. Rather, she cared for her knee herself while continuing to work. Then, on December 31, 2001, appellee injured her knee for a third time. On this occasion, however, the injury was not work-related. Appellee was diagnosed with a ruptured anteri- or cruciate ligament (\u201cACL\u201d), for which she underwent surgery on January 30, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">On January 26, 2002, a few days before appellee\u2019s first surgery, Willis\u2019s direct supervisor, Corporal Ed Shropshire, filed with the Commission an \u201cEmployer\u2019s First Report of Injury or Illness\u201d for appellee. He listed July 20, 2001, as the date the Employer had been notified of appellee\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">On March 4, 2002, the Claimant signed a form titled \u201cEmployee\u2019s Claim Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission,\u201d in which she represented that she had twisted her left knee during a training exercise on July 20, 2001, and that she had given notice to Lieutenant Rodney Hill on that date. Appellee filed a \u201cCorrected Claim\u201d with the Commission on April 21, 2002, indicating that she injured both her left knee and her back on July 20, 2001. The claim listed July 21, 2001, as the \u201c1st day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>unable to work,\u201d and reflected that Willis returned to work on July 26, 2001. Neither the initial claim nor the corrected claim referred to the incident of December 31, 2001. Nor did the County have any records pertaining to the December 2001 occurrence. According to the County, the claim was \u201caccepted\u201d but \u201cno medicals were forthcoming.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">On June 4, 2002, the Commission issued an Order, finding that Willis sustained an accidental injury \u201carising out of and in the course of employment\u201d on July 20, 2001. But, the Commission ordered that the claim for compensation \u201cbe held pending until such time as the nature and extent of the claimant\u2019s disability, if any, can be determined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Appellee had a second knee surgery on September 26, 2005, to repair a torn meniscus in the left knee, for which the County paid the medical expenses. Willis was awarded temporary total disability (\u201cTTD\u201d) from September 1, 2005, through February 23, 2006.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In April 2006, appellee sought TTD benefits dating to 2002. According to the County, at that point it obtained medical records for the period prior to June 2002, which \u201crevealed an intervening event that was non work related.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">On November 20, 2006, through the Montgomery County Self-Insured Fund, appellant filed with the Commission a form titled \u201cRequest For A Hearing For Referral To Maryland Insurance Fraud Division\u201d (the \u201cPetition\u201d). The preprinted form stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">This form may be filed by any party at any time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">The Commission shall refer the case on the person named below to the Insurance Fraud Division in the Maryland Insurance Administration where the Commission finds, after a hearing, that a party requesting the referral has carried the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>dence that the named person knowingly affected or knowingly attempted to affect the payment of compensation, fees, or expenses under Title 9 of the Labor Law by means of a fraudulent representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">The undersigned alleges that the person named below violated section 9-310.2(a) of the Labor &amp; Employment Article and requests a hearing before the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The Commission held an evidentiary hearing on the Petition on April 17, 2007. The Employer\u2019s attorney represented that the matter concerned a claim of \u201cFraud.\u201d Explaining \u201cthe basis of the fraud,\u201d the County\u2019s lawyer said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">[I]n May of 2002, ... [appellee] indicated that she twisted her knee on the job in July of 2001, the claim was accepted at that time. No medicals were forthcoming. The medicals we had, that we later received very soon thereafter, was June 24th, 2002 and beyond. So the claim was accepted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">Then in April of 2006, she made a claim for T.T.D. back in 2002, a back claim for temporary total disability. At that point, we were able to secure the medicals predating June of 2002. Those medicals revealed an intervening event that was non work related. That was the first time that the County was aware that there was a non work-related accident on or about December 30th or 31 st of 2001. And then we also found at that time that she had a surgery, an ACL reconstruction, related to that incident in January of 2002. That surgery was never paid for by the County, but a subsequent surgery of 9/26/2005 was paid by the County and the T.T.D. related to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-9\">And that\u2019s the basis of the fraud that we were never informed of the\u2014and there was no treatment from July of 2001 until January of 2002, until the intervening event. And the County was unaware and never informed of the intervening event.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">Willis testified that she injured herself while on duty on July 20, 2001, while carrying a bullet proof shield. She recalled that she planted her foot, twisted, heard a popping sound, and could not walk for fifteen or twenty minutes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>According to appellee, she promptly notified her supervisor, Lieutenant Rodney Hill, but she did not file a claim for compensation at that time. She explained that she did not miss work because she had three days off and treated her knee while at home, with ibuprofen and ice. As a result of her knee injury in July 2001, Willis was temporarily placed on light duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Appellee recounted that she sustained a second injury while on duty in August 2001:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">[W]e were doing a shooting scenario where we were required to jump up out of the car, run up to the range and engage bad guys, for lack of a better term. When I hit the cement where I had to kneel behind a barrier, my left leg went out from underneath me in a slipping motion and I fell to the ground ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Willis did not seek medical treatment at that time, nor did she miss work. Again, she self-treated with ice and ibuprofen.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Then, on December 31, 2001, Willis injured her knee for a third time, when she jumped off a pick-up truck while \u201cat church.\u201d She was not on duty at the time. Willis recounted that she \u201chopped off\u2019 the truck and her \u201cknee twisted,\u201d which caused \u201cexcruciating pain, extreme swelling.\u201d Willis sought medical attention from her primary care physician, Dr. David Harding, on January 2, 2002. The next day, she was seen by Dr. Sheldon Mandel, an orthopaedic surgeon. His report reflects that Willis only mentioned her injury of December 31, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">According to appellee, shortly after her third knee injury, she spoke with her supervisor, Lieutenant Hill. As a result of that conversation, Willis consulted Dr. David Higgins, an orthopaedic surgeon, on January 17, 2002, and an attorney. As noted, she filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim on March 4, 2002, pertaining to her injury of July 20, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Dr. Higgins diagnosed appellee with a torn ACL, a torn medial meniscus, and a torn lateral meniscus. He performed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>knee surgery on appellee on January 30, 2002. Willis did not ask the County to pay for the surgery, nor did.it do so.</p>\n<p id=\"Aca\">On cross-examination, the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-4\">[EMPLOYER\u2019S COUNSEL]: And the first time you went to the doctor for your knee problems was on January 2nd, 2002; is that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">[EMPLOYEE]: That is correct. That was Dr. Harting [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">[EMPLOYER\u2019S COUNSEL]: And, at that point, you gave a history of jumping off of the truck; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0Y\">[EMPLOYEE]: That\u2019s correct. My knee was so swollen, I couldn\u2019t get a pair of jeans on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">[EMPLOYER\u2019S COUNSEL]: And when you saw [Dr. Mandel on January 3, 2002], you told him about the truck incident [which occurred December 31, 2001] and denied any prior injuries; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">[EMPLOYEE]: He didn\u2019t ask me about any prior injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">* * \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-10\">[EMPLOYER\u2019S COUNSEL]: When you were evaluated by Dr. [Clifford] Hinkes, or [sic] an independent medical examination on March the 31st, 2006 at the request of the County, you told him that you did not have any prior\u2014any subsequent\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-11\">[EMPLOYEE]: He never asked me that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHF\">[EMPLOYER\u2019S COUNSEL]: And you never told him of the December 2001 injury; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-12\">[EMPLOYEE]: I never told him. He never asked me. He asked me what pain I was having that day and what my issues were at that time, and that\u2019s what I told him about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Avm\">[EMPLOYER\u2019S COUNSEL]: You had another surgery to your knee in September of 2005?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-13\">[EMPLOYEE]: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-14\">[EMPLOYER\u2019S COUNSEL]: And you claim that that was related to your accident in July of 2001; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AN-\">[EMPLOYEE]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>[EMPLOYER\u2019S COUNSEL]: In April of 2006, you sought temporary partial disability for the period that you were off of work in 2002; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">[EMPLOYEE]: That\u2019s probably one of the times we asked for that ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Notably, Dr. Higgins\u2019s report of January 17, 2002, reflects that Willis reported the injuries she sustained in July, August, and December of 2001. Dr. Higgins stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">HISTORY: The patient is a 42-year-old Montgomery County police officer with complaints of left knee pain with multiple injuries, the first being in July 2001, on the job as a police officer. She had a minimal amount of swelling with pain that gradually resolved. She had another injury at the end of August 2001, with reoccurrence of her twisting injury and she had resolution on the pain with minor swelling. The third injury was on 12/31/01, when she jumped down out of a pickup truck and had another twisting injury to her left knee. She had pain and swelling. This was the most amount of swelling she has had over the three injuries. Dr. Higgins also wrote a letter to appellee\u2019s attorney, dated March 14, 2002, stating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-8\">I am writing concerning Ms. Valerie Willis\u2019s left knee injury. She sustained her first injury in 07/01 while on duty as a police office [sic] when she sustained a twisting injury to her left knee. She did have swelling at that time. It is my opinion within a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Ms. Valerie Willis tore her left knee anterior cruciate ligament while on duty as a police officer with a twisting injury in 07/01. She had continued symptoms since that initial injury in 07/01. I hope this clears up any confusion concerning her knee injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">On March 31, 2006, Dr. Clifford Hinkes evaluated Willis at the request of the County. His report chronicled appellee\u2019s medical care between 2002 and 2006.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Joan Fitzwater, a Senior Workers\u2019 Compensation Adjuster for The Schaffer Companies, Ltd., was one of several people who handled appellee\u2019s compensation claim for the County. At the time of the hearing, she had worked for The Schaffer Companies for two years, and worked the previous ten years \u201cfor the predecessor adjusting companies for the County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Ms. Fitzwater stated that it was not until 2006 that the County received appellee\u2019s medical records for any period prior to June 2002. She related that the adjusting company asked for those records because appellee\u2019s attorney was seeking a period of TTD, and the company did not have documentation to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Michael B. Willis, appellee\u2019s husband, had worked as a police officer for the Montgomery County Police Department for 23 years. He testified that he learned in late July or early August of 2001 that his wife had injured her knee in July 2001. Mr. Willis recalled that from July 2001 through the end of December, his wife would \u201cperiodically complain that [her knee] was swollen. You could see her limp from time to time, depending upon the weather ... It was apparent that she was in discomfort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">At the time of the hearing, Rodney Hill worked as an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore County. In July 2001, he was a Lieutenant with the Montgomery County Police Department, and in the \u201csupervisory chain of command of Officer Valerie Willis .... \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He recalled that Willis made \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>comment\u201d after her initial injury in July 2001, although he did not remember \u201ctoo much specific detail as to ... what exactly it was she said .... \u201d The following exchange is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aol\">[EMPLOYEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Did she report to you at all that day [i.e., July 21, 2001] whether or not she had injured her left knee?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-4\">[HILL]: I vaguely\u2014again, I vaguely remember her telling me she had been injured. If she said it was the left knee, at this point\u2014I definitely remember her saying she injured herself. I can remember saying, okay, and pretty much from what I recall, that was that. After that I remember having a subsequent conversation with her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">[EMPLOYEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: When was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">[HILL]: It might have been a few weeks, might have been about a month. It wasn\u2019t that long afterwards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APG\">[EMPLOYEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: And what was the nature of that conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">[HILL]: She was assigned to the desk. I just happened to be going by the desk and saw some plain clothes. I said, what are you doing at the desk? She said, well, remember I injured my knee ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-8\">She had mentioned to me a subsequent injury as well ... I said, well, did you take care of the paperwork, necessary paperwork? She said, what are you talking about? I said, you have to do your first report of injury and you have to do your worker\u2019s compensation. I went into all the detail about it ... now, I take off my lieutenant hat and put on my lawyer hat. You need to protect yourself. You need to do X, Y, and Z and make sure you do this. Probably said it 200 times, you know, get your worker\u2019s compensation lawyer, do this, do that, protect yourself. You have a legitimate injury, you know. I said, that\u2019s why the law is in place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">Appellant\u2019s counsel asked Hill if he was aware that \u201cfunction code 350\u201d requires an employee to report an injury immediately to a supervisor. Hill stated that he was aware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>and he also knew that it was a supervisor\u2019s \u201cresponsibility to insure the completion of all the required reports prior to the end of [their] tour of duty.\u201d However, he clarified that he was not Ms. Willis\u2019s direct supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">On May 1, 2007, the Commission issued an Order that stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Hearing was held in the above claim at Beltsville, Maryland on April 17, 2007 on the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">1. Fraud</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">2. Penalties and Fees</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">The Commission finds on the first issue presented that no fraud on the part of the claimant or her counsel has been proven. The Commission finds on the second issue presented that no fees, costs or penalties are appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-9\">It is therefore, this 1 st day of May, 2007, by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission ORDERED that the above-entitled claim be reset only upon request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">Thereafter, on May 17, 2007, the County sought judicial review in the circuit court, pursuant to L.E. \u00a7 9-737. Appellee filed a \u201cPre-Trial Statement\u201d on November 16, 2007, asserting that the Commission \u201cwas correct in its findings and the Claimant committed no fraud arising out of her accidental personal injury on July 20, 2001.\u201d The County subsequently filed a \u201cPre-Trial Statement of The Petitioner,\u201d in which it averred that Ms. Willis \u201cobtained benefits without properly disclosing an intervening injury of December 30-31, 2001.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AuA\">On December 21, 2007, Willis filed a Motion for Summary Judgment/To Dismiss, arguing, pursuant to L.E. \u00a7 9-737, that the Order of the Commission was not appealable because the decision\u2014not to refer the case to the Division\u2014did not grant or deny a benefit to appellant under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. She also averred that the County failed to \u201callege facts sufficient to prove that [appellee] made a fraudulent representation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">In its opposition to Willis\u2019s motion, the County asserted, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>The Commission did not find fraud, and therefore declined to make the referral set forth in Labor &amp; Employment Article, \u00a7 9-310.2. Had the Commission found that the Claimant \u201cknowingly affected or knowingly attempted to affect the payment of compensation, fees or expenses ... by means of a fraudulent representation,\u201d the Commission would have referred the matter to the Insurance Fraud Division. Necessarily, the Commission would have also ordered the Claimant to reimburse the County for the benefits that she knowingly obtained and to which she was not entitled. This would be done pursuant to \u00a7 9-310.1. That Section is not discretionary'\u2014the statute says that, if the County establishes that she knowingly obtained benefits to which she is not entitled, \u201cthe Commission shall order the person to reimburse .... \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-4\">If the Commission had found fraud, not only would the referral of \u00a7 9-310.2 take place but the reimbursement of \u00a7 9-310.1 would have been ordered. Therefore, the Commission\u2019s decision denied the County of a benefit, and is a \u201cfinal order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">In addition, \u00a7 9-737 states that an \u201cemployer ... or any other interested person aggrieved by a decision of the Commission ... may appeal from the decision of the Commission provided the appeal was filed within thirty days after the date of mailing the Commission\u2019s Order.\u201d As a party that was aggrieved by the Commission\u2019s decision, the County is entitled to this appeal. The simply [sic] statutory language provides for such judicial review. Under these circumstances, the County is entitled to appeal the decision of the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The court held a hearing on January 24, 2008. The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">THE COURT: [A]s I read [L.E. \u00a7 ] 9-310.1, I understand it to be that the County would have been entitled to recover monies improperly paid to your client if fraud had been found. Why is that not a benefit under the act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>[EMPLOYEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. For two reasons. One, it\u2019s a separate section. And actually 9-310.1 never mentions fraud. It\u2019s a completely different standard. [L.E. \u00a7 ] 9-310[.l] is just if they knowingly obtain benefits to which they are not entitled. There\u2019s nothing about a fraudulent representation or anything else ... the decision in this case was to not refer this case to the insurance division, fraud division. That does not in any way address benefits</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-4\">THE COURT: So if there\u2019s a finding of fraud, it doesn\u2019t follow by necessity that the\u2014Would it be the Commission that would order this back payment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\">[EMPLOYEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: It doesn\u2019t necessarily follow that. They [i.e., the County] would have to raise that under the separate section----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">THE COURT: So if the decision is, okay, I find fraud, I\u2019m going to refer it, there is no award of a benefit is your argument.

And the standard is preponderance of the evidence, \u201ca person knowingly affected or knowingly attempted to affect the payment of compensation, fees or expenses by means of a fraudulent representation.\u201d By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>necessity, if they were to find that: 310.1 says, \u201cif it is established by a preponderance of the evidence that a person has knowingly obtained benefits under this title to which the person is not entitled, the Commission shall order the person to reimburse the insurer.\u201d It\u2019s not may. It\u2019s not discretionary with the Commission. So, if they find that there is a referral, they\u2019ve already found that there\u2019s a preponderance of the evidence that she knowingly affected or knowingly attempted to affect payment of compensation by means of a fraudulent representation. If they find that, then under 310.1, they shall order the reimbursement so it\u2019s tied together.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Without citation to any authority, the County\u2019s lawyer insisted that the County could not obtain reimbursement under L.E. \u00a7 9-310.1 unless it first proceeded under \u201cwhat the Commission terms their \u2018referral statute,\u2019 \u201d i.e., L.E. \u00a7 9-310.2. Appellant\u2019s counsel said: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any case law on it. It just doesn\u2019t come up that often. However, I mean, all I have is the language of the statute that says if you got [that] to which you\u2019re not entitled, the Commission shall order reimbursement.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">You have to file for fraud and the Commission decides really both issues together. Now we\u2019ve lost both issues. I understand that. The Commission decided no referral. It didn\u2019t say anything about reimbursement because they didn\u2019t have to. That\u2019s part of that decision. The Commission makes you go through that. If we were to say that failure ... to decide that is not appealable\u2014... if we were to say that refusing to refer the case is not appealable, then this can never be appealable because the Commission always decides the referral issue first. And if they find no referral, then they\u2019re not going to order reimbursement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">By Opinion and Order dated January 25, 2008, the circuit court granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, upheld the Commission\u2019s Order of May 1, 2007, and dismissed the appeal.

In its view, appellee\u2019s \u201comission of the December [2001] injury from the information she submitted [in 2002] with her claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits directly impacted the finding of [a] causal relationship between her work-related injury in July 2001 and the surgery she underwent in 2005, along with the accompanying temporary total disability benefits.\u201d It argues that the Commission\u2019s denial of the County\u2019s request for referral to the Division is subject to judicial review \u201cas a final order of the Commission,\u201d because it \u201cis a final substantive disposition of the case.\u201d In this regard, the County relies on L.E. \u00a7 9-737, which permits an appeal by an employer who is aggrieved by a decision of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">According to the Employer, the circuit court improperly applied a \u201cnarrow interpretation\u201d of L.E. \u00a7 9-737 that \u201ceffec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>tively adds language to the statute by relying upon the grant or denial of a benefit, rather than the aggrievement of a party.\u201d It argues: \u201cNot only does the statute fail to limit judicial review to grants or denials of benefits to an employee, but the cases interpreting [L.E. \u00a7 9-737] support the ability of the employer to obtain judicial review.\u201d The County elaborates: \u201cThe reference to a \u2018benefit\u2019 as part of the appealable order has served as a mechanism to distinguish a final decision from the various interim decisions that the Commission may make regarding procedural or other issues.\u201d So long as a decision is \u201cequivalent\u201d to the grant or denial of a benefit, argues appellant, it satisfies the requisites for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Moreover, appellant suggests that its Petition concerned benefits; it contends that it was entitled to\u2014and sought\u2014 reimbursement of workers\u2019 compensation benefits that appellee \u201cwrongfully obtained.\u201d The County asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">[Bjenefits had been awarded and paid to the employee. The challenge to the propriety of that award had an effect on whether the employee could retain those benefits or would have to reimburse the County for some or all of the compensation paid. When the Commission determined that the employee had not obtained the workers\u2019 compensation benefits wrongly, that decision was a final order that disposed of the pending issues before the Commission and had the effect of granting the benefits that the County questioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">Further, the County argues:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">[T]he Commission\u2019s determination that no fraud occurred created a direct impact on the employer\u2014absent the finding of fraud, the employee keeps the benefits awarded, even though they may have been wrongfully obtained through the incomplete information available to the County. The Commission\u2019s decision was not in the County\u2019s favor, and the County has the right to challenge that decision in the Circuit Court. The evaluation of the evidence under the fraud section necessarily accompanies the analysis of the evidence for purposes of ordering a reimbursement of bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>fits. The Circuit Court should have heard testimony and argument on appeal from the Commission in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Noting that L.E. \u00a7 9-310.1 (regarding reimbursement) and L.E. \u00a7 9-310.2 (regarding fraud) are interrelated, with similar \u201cevidentiary thresholds,\u201d the Employer asserts: \u201cAlthough the County filed a form requesting a hearing for referral to the Maryland Insurance Fraud Division, this did not limit the scope of the issue before the Commission in a manner that excluded consideration of the reimbursement provision of the law.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">[T]he same testimony and evidence could lead the Commission to find fraud or to determine that, although fraud was not shown, the benefits were wrongfully obtained by virtue of omitting evidence that affected the finding of causation .... Once the Commission determined to hold a hearing, it was obligated to refer the matter to the Insurance Fraud Division if the evidence established that a misrepresentation had been made and was the basis for an award. Similarly, the Commission was obligated to order reimbursement if the evidence established that the benefits were wrongfully obtained. No particular filing was required to preserve this particular aspect of the Commission\u2019s authority, and it is properly before this Court as one of the aspects of the case that is subject to review by the Circuit Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The Employee insists that the Commission\u2019s Order was not reviewable because it did not grant or deny a benefit, as contemplated under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. She characterizes as \u201csimplistic\u201d appellant\u2019s position that \u201cthe word \u2018benefit\u2019 merely serves \u2018as a mechanism to distinguish a final decision from the various interim decisions\u2019 .... \u201d Appellee elaborates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-8\">In fact, the decision of the Commission that formed the basis of this appeal was not based at all on either party seeking benefits. The Claimant was not seeking specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>benefits and the County was not denying specific benefits or seeking back specific benefits. The sole issue raised by the County was the request that the Commission refer the matter to another state agency!]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">In a footnote, appellee points out that, even if the issue raised by the County concerned L.E. \u00a7 9-310.1, \u201cno evidence was introduced at the hearing as to what benefits were \u2018knowingly obtained\u2019 [to] which the claimant was not entitled. As such, another hearing would have been necessitated to determine those benefits subject to reimbursement. This would leave the first hearing having not granted or denied a benefit from which the claimant could have appealed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">We reject the County\u2019s argument that an action under L.E. \u00a7 9-310.2 (referral to the Division) is tantamount to an action under L.E. \u00a7 9-310.1 (reimbursement). Nor would an action under L.E. \u00a7 9-310.2 necessarily determine the question of entitlement to reimbursement, so as to constitute the grant or denial of a benefit. Nevertheless, we agree that the Commission\u2019s decision was a final, appealable order, from which the County had the right to seek judicial review. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">In analyzing appellant\u2019s attempt to characterize its claim under L.E. \u00a7 9-310.2 as an action under L.E. \u00a7 9-310.1, we consider the well settled principles of statutory interpretation. \u201cThe overarching rule is that, in construing statutes, our primary goal is always to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision ...\u201d <em>Opert v.

To be sure, L.E. \u00a7 9-310.1 and L.E. \u00a7 9-310.2 are interrelated. Yet, the provisions are not synonymous. A request under L.E. \u00a7 9-310.2 for a referral to the Division is clearly not the same as a request for reimbursement of benefits wrongfully obtained by the employee, as set forth in L.E. \u00a7 9-310.1. If the County\u2019s position were correct, there would have been no reason for the Legislature to enact two distinct statutory provisions; one of the provisions necessarily would be rendered superfluous, which is at odds with the principles of statutory construction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Our construction of these two provisions is strengthened by the observation that the text of L.E. \u00a7 9-310.2 is broader than the text of L.E. \u00a7 9-310.1. Under L.E. \u00a7 9-310.2, the Commission is required to refer the matter to the Division, even if the claimant never actually obtained any benefits by fraud, so long as the evidence establishes a knowing <em>attempt </em>to do so. In contrast, under L.E. \u00a7 9-310.1 the employer would be entitled to recover the disputed benefits paid to the claimant only upon a finding that benefits were <em>actually but wrongfully obtained. </em>In other words, L.E. \u00a7 9-310.1 does not include conduct that amounts to attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Therefore, we are not persuaded by appellant\u2019s back door attempt to cast this matter as an action to recover benefits paid to appellee. Appellant\u2019s claim under L.E. \u00a7 9-310.2 was not an action to recover benefits under L.E. \u00a7 9-310.1, merely because appellant could have sought to recover benefits if it had prevailed under L.E. \u00a7 9-310.2. Moreover, appellant is mistaken in its contention that if it had prevailed under L.E. \u00a7 9-310.2, it automatically would have been entitled to prevail under L.E. \u00a7 9-310.1, because the scope of \u00a7 9-310.2 is broader than \u00a7 9-310.1. This is not the end of our analysis, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>As noted, the right to judicial review of a decision by the Commission is governed by L.E. \u00a7 9-737.

It stated that a final order \u201cmeans an order or award made by the Commission in the matter then before it, determining the issues of law and of fact necessary for a resolution of the problem presented in that particular proceeding <em>and </em>which grants or denies some benefit under the [Workers\u2019 Compensation] Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). Notably, it can include an interim order, under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">In <em>Havenner, </em>the Commission found that the employee\u2019s back injury was sustained in the course of his employment, and awarded him temporary total disability benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 327, 364 A.2d 95. The employer-insurer noted an appeal, alleging that the Commission had \u201c... not justly considered all of the facts ... and .. . [had] misconstrued the law and facts .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328, 364 A.2d 95. The employee claimed that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter because the Commission\u2019s order \u201cwas interlocutory \u2018and not a final order.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting the employee). The circuit court agreed with the employer-insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">On appeal, we considered whether \u201can award of [TTD is] a \u2018final\u2019 order\u201d for purposes of the right to judicial review. <em>Id. </em>at 327, 364 A.2d 95. We held that the award of TTD was a final, appealable order, because the decision determined all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>issues then before the Commission, and it conferred a benefit on the claimant. <em>Id. </em>at 332, 364 A.2d 95. The Court\u2019s analysis, <em>id. </em>at 328-29, 331, 364 A.2d 95, provides guidance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvV\">Unquestionably, Md. Ann.Code art. 101, \u00a7 56 [predecessor to L.E. \u00a7 9-737] confers the right upon a \u201c... person feeling aggrieved by any decision of the Commission to appeal to the circuit court of the county\u201d ... having-jurisdiction over the place where the accident occurred or over the person appealing from such decision .... \u201d The Court of Appeals, however, has, by rule, made it perspicuous that only \u201cfinal action\u201d of the Commission is appealable. Md. Rule B1 a [predecessor to Rule 7-201],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\">The obvious question then is what is meant by \u201cfinal action\u201d or \u201cfinal order,\u201d as that term is applied to appeals to the circuit court from decisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">In <em>Liggett &amp; Meyers Tobacco Company v. Goslin, </em>163 Md. 74, 160 A. 804 (1932), the Court, referring to Md. Ann.Code art. 101, \u00a7 56 a said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">\u201c... [T]he appeal allowed by the statute ... is not from the findings or opinion of the commission but from its \u2018decision.\u2019 And by \u2018decision\u2019 is obviously meant the order by which it disposes of the case.\u201d 163 Md. at 78, 160 A. at 806.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">This Court, in <em>Flying </em>\u201cA\u201d <em>Service Station v. Jordan, </em>[17 Md.App. 477, 302 A.2d 650 (1973) ], stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">\u201cA <em>decision of the Commission which an aggrieved party is entitled to have reviewed by a Court must be an operative order which has the effect of granting or denying some benefit under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation law. </em>Most often, such a decision is reached by giving effect to multiple findings, but it is the ultimate decision or order, not each individual finding, which is the basis for judicial review. Obviously, in a review of the correctness of a decision or order, each finding that contributed to the final result is examined, and one incorrect finding may make the result incorrect. But the appeal is from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>result, rather than from each of its separate elements.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). 17 Md.App. at 480-81, 302 A.2d at 653.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><em>Big Vein Coal Co. [v. Leasure, </em>192 Md. 435, 64 A.2d 563 (1949) ] was concerned with the appeal from an order of the Commission granting leave to file an amended claim. The Court of Appeals held that such an order was interlocutory and went on to restate the law that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">\u201cThe judgment must be final before this Court has any jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Statutory provisions for appeal from, or review of, orders of administrative tribunals have generally been construed as applicable, not to interlocutory orders, but only to final orders.\u201d 192 Md. at 437, 64 A.2d at 564.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">There can be no serious question but that the Commission in the <em>Big Vein </em>case did not pass an operative order which had the effect of granting or denying some benefit under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act to either Big Vein or the claimant, Leasure. The granting of the privilege to file an amended claim did not adjudicate any issue of law or fact. At most, it merely set the stage for an orderly presentation of the evidence to the Commission of the entire claim and not a fragmented part thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">Although the remedy of permanent disability is yet to be determined, temporary total or temporary partial disability awards are independent rights arising from the common remedy of workmen\u2019s compensation which continue until the claimant reaches maximum improvement ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">The Court was undoubtedly mindful of the economic impact of a decision that would have held to the contrary. It said, <em>id. </em>at 331-32, 364 A.2d 95:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-9\">Under Maryland law, payments of compensation made pursuant to an award of the commission, even though reversed on appeal, may not be recovered from the claimant, <em>St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co. v. Treadwell, </em>263 Md. 430, 283 A.2d 601 (1971). To hold that an award of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>temporary disability (total or partial) may not be appealed would subject an employer-insurer to the hazard of paying an award which might amount to a large sum of money and render the employer-insurer unable to recover the expenditure if the courts determine the award was erroneous ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">In our view, the cases since <em>Havenner </em>that refer to the grant or denial of \u201cbenefits,\u201d in the context of appealability, are not controlling here, because of the particular statutory provision at issue in this case, enacted a few years ago. As we shall see, the cases discussed below recognized that workers\u2019 compensation cases generally concern the grant or denial of benefits, and demonstrate that if a decision is not essential to the disposition, it is not appealable. Conversely, a final, substantive decision of the Commission is appealable, as is an interim decision, if it pertains to an award or denial of a benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">In <em>Murray Int'l Freight Corp. v. Graham, </em>315 Md. 543, 555 A.2d 502 (1989), Graham hauled freight for Murray International Freight Corporation (\u201cMurray\u201d). Although the Commission determined that Graham was an employee of Murray, it determined that he did not sustain an accidental injury in the course of his employment, and denied his compensation claim. <em>Id. </em>at 546, 555 A.2d 502. Graham did not appeal. Instead, he filed suit against Murray to recover workers\u2019 compensation premiums that the company deducted from his pay. <em>Id. </em>The District Court entered judgment for Graham and the trucking company appealed, alleging that Graham was an independent contractor and not an employee. The circuit court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals considered whether Murray was collaterally estopped from relitigating the Commission\u2019s determination of Graham\u2019s employment status, <em>i.e., </em>whether he was an independent contractor or an employee of Murray. <em>Id. </em>at 545, 555 A.2d 502. The Court held that collateral estoppel did not bar Murray\u2019s claim, because \u201cthe fact-finding sought to be relitigated was not essential to the Commission\u2019s decision,\u201d and Murray could not have appealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>from the Commission\u2019s order denying Graham\u2019s request for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 552, 555 A.2d 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">The <em>Murray </em>Court quoted <em>Havenner, </em>33 Md.App. at 332, 364 A.2d 95, for the proposition that, for \u201cpurposes of appealability,\u201d a final order is \u201c \u2018an order or award made by the Commission in the matter then before it, determining the issues of law and of fact necessary for a resolution of the problem presented in that particular proceeding and which grants or denies some benefit under the Act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 553, 555 A.2d 502 (emphasis omitted). It explained that \u201c[a] \u2018benefit\u2019 ... means a grant of an award under Article 101 [predecessor to L.E. Title 9], or something equivalent thereto ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 553 n. 6, 555 A.2d 502. The Court held that a \u201cdetermination of the employment issue was not necessary to a \u2018resolution of the problem presented\u2019 by Graham\u2019s compensation claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, it was not a final order as to that issue, and the employer could not appeal from the Commission\u2019s finding that Graham was Murray\u2019s employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\"><em>Paolino v. McCormick &amp; Co., </em>314 Md. 575, 579, 552 A.2d 868 (1989), also provides guidance. Paolino, an employee of McCormick &amp; Company (\u201cMcCormick\u201d), injured her back and petitioned the Commission for benefits. The Commission awarded her permanent partial disability payments. <em>Id. </em>at 577, 552 A.2d 868. Thereafter, Paolino had a spinal fusion and sought temporary total disability for the period of her hospitalization. <em>Id. </em>at 578, 552 A.2d 868. McCormick opposed the claim, stating that Paolino no longer worked for McCormick and that her claim was time barred. The Commission denied the claimant\u2019s request, despite its determination that limitations did not bar her claim. <em>Id. </em>Paolino sought judicial review in the circuit court, and McCormick cross-appealed as to limitations. The circuit court granted partial summary judgment for Paolino on limitations, but later rejected her appeal of TTD, and entered a judgment for McCormick. Nevertheless, McCormick appealed the limitations issue to this Court, which found in its favor. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>The Court of Appeals remanded with instructions for this Court to dismiss the appeal. It quoted <em>Havenner </em>for the proposition that an appealable, final order of the Commission must grant or deny a benefit under the Workers\u2019 Compensation law. <em>Id. </em>at 583, 552 A.2d 868. In its view, the Commission\u2019s ruling as to limitations did not confer a \u201cbenefit,\u201d and therefore that finding was not appealable. The Court concluded that the limitations issue \u201cwas an interlocutory determination that disposed of nothing in a final sense; it merely kept alive Paolino\u2019s temporary total disability claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584, 552 A.2d 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">More recently, in <em>Griggs v. C &amp; H Mech. Corp., </em>169 Md.App. 556, 905 A.2d 402 (2006), C &amp; H Mechanical Corporation (\u201cC &amp; H\u201d) and its insurer sought judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision to deny its motion for a rehearing as to an order awarding benefits to an employee, Griggs. The employee filed a motion to dismiss. <em>Id. </em>at 562, 905 A.2d 402. After the circuit court denied the motion, Griggs appealed. <em>Id. </em>He argued that the \u201cpetition for judicial review should have been dismissed because (1) it challenge^] only the Commission\u2019s ... denial of appellees\u2019 motion for a reheaiing, rather than the ... order awarding workers\u2019 compensation; (2) the [denial of the motion for rehearing] [was] not a final appealable order because it [did] not grant or deny some benefit under the workers\u2019 compensation laws; and (3) it [was] too late to petition for review of the ... decision [granting him workers\u2019 compensation benefits].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 563, 905 A.2d 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">This Court rejected Griggs\u2019s argument. <em>Id. </em>We were of the view that a challenge to the Commission\u2019s denial of the motion for rehearing was also a challenge to the award of benefits to Griggs. <em>Id. </em>at 564, 905 A.2d 402. The Court held that an employer is entitled to judicial review of the circuit court\u2019s denial of its request for a rehearing concerning an order of benefits to the employee. <em>Id. </em>We reasoned that \u201cboth the statutes and case law make clear that the \u2018decision\u2019 being challenged on appeal is the final substantive disposition of the workers\u2019 compensation claim.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>The cases discussed above must be reconciled with L.E. \u00a7 9-737, titled \u201cJudicial Review,\u201d and considered in the context of the issues involved in those cases. L.E. \u00a7 9-737 expressly permits an employer \u201caggrieved by a decision of the Commission\u201d to appeal, without any limitation restricting the right of appeal to cases granting or denying \u201cbenefits.\u201d As we have said, to the extent that the Commission makes a decision not essential to the ultimate disposition, such as in <em>Paolino </em>and <em>Murray, </em>such decisions are not final and appealable. In contrast, the award or denial of compensation benefits, even on a temporary basis, is appealable. But, these cases do not necessarily foreclose an appeal under the circumstances attendant here, concerning a statute enacted long after the decisions were rendered in <em>Havenner, </em>33 Md.App. 326, 364 A.2d 95, <em>Murray, </em>315 Md. 543, 555 A.2d 502, and <em>Paolino, </em>314 Md. 575, 552 A.2d 868. By its terms, the Legislature conferred a statutory right on the Commission to refer fraud cases to the Division, pursuant to L.E. \u00a7 9-310.2. The Commission\u2019s denial of the employer\u2019s request for a referral to the Division fully and finally resolved the question of whether the employer showed, by a preponderance of evidence, that Willis \u201cknowingly affected or knowingly attempted to affect the payment of compensation, fees, or expenses ... by means of a fraudulent representation ....\u201d Moreover, L.E. \u00a7 9-737 is not ambiguous, and thus we need not look beyond the statute to glean the legislative intent. <em>Bd. of License Comm\u2019rs for Charles Co. v. Toye, </em>354 Md. 116, 122, 729 A.2d 407 (1999); <em>see Kaczorowski v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513, 525 A.2d 628 (1987) (stating that when a statute is not ambiguous, we generally will not look beyond its language). The plain language of L.E. \u00a7 9-737 allows an aggrieved employer to note a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">Notably, when the Legislature enacted L.E. \u00a7 9-310.1 and L.E. \u00a7 9-310.2, it did not signal an intent to preclude judicial review of decisions rendered by the Commission under those provisions. <em>Cf. Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park and Planning Comm\u2019n v. Anderson, </em>395 Md. 172, 188, 189, 909 A.2d 694 (2006) (concluding that a not guilty finding under the Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Enforcement Officer\u2019s Bill of Rights is not appealable by the agency because \u00a7 3-108(a)(3) of the Public Safety Article \u201cexpressly states that \u2018[a] finding of not guilty terminates the action,\u2019 \u201d and noting: \u201cIf the Legislature intended for \u2018not guilty\u2019 findings to be reviewable, it could have included language to express that intention, rather than stating that the action is terminated.\u201d). Indeed, the denial of the right to judicial review would come close to vesting unchecked power in the Commission with respect to matters under L.E. \u00a7 9-310.2, and could potentially thwart the underlying legislative purpose of that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">We are mindful that \u201cthe Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is to be construed as liberally in favor of injured employees as the Act\u2019s provisions will permit so as to effectuate its benevolent purpose as remedial social legislation.\u201d <em>Lovellette v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>297 Md. 271, 282, 465 A.2d 1141 (1983). <em>See also Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund v.

These sections were intended to protect employers/insurers and the public by helping to assure the integrity of the workers\u2019 compensation system. As we have said, that purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>would be thwarted without judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision, whether the decision happened to grant or deny a referral request based on alleged fraud. An interpretation of L.E. \u00a7 9-737, to permit judicial review of decisions under L.E. \u00a7 9-310.2, does not run counter to the benevolent purpose of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">For these reasons, we shall reverse the decision of the circuit court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED.
