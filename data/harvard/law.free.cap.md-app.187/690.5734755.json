Lab. &amp; Empl. \u00a7 9-632 (1991, 2008 Repl.Vol.) entitles appellant, Larry D. Holmes, Sr., to pursue the claim of his deceased spouse, Patricia L. Holmes, for permanent disability benefits under the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the \u201cAct\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that might have been awarded to her had she not died prior to entry of an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A7m\">The facts of the case are undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">On November 3, 1999, Mrs. Holmes suffered an injury in the course of her employment with Wal Mart Stores, Inc., one of the appellees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On December 9, 1999, she filed a claim for compensation with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d). The Commission awarded Mrs. Holmes temporary total disability benefits. On or about November 28, 2006, Mrs. Holmes attained the maximum amount of medical improvement from her work-related injuries; in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>normal course of events, she would have applied to the Commission for an award of either permanent partial or permanent total disability benefits. However, before she could do so, Mrs. Holmes died, on December 4, 2006, from causes not related to her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">On May 7, 2007, Mrs. Holmes\u2019 attorney filed a post-mortem issue seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>permanent disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">On September 19, 2007, the Commission held a hearing on the nature and extent of Mrs. Holmes\u2019 permanent disability. At the hearing, both parties agreed that the appellant\u2019s right, if any, to pursue the claim of his deceased spouse is controlled by \u00a7 9-632 of the Act, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">(b) <em>hi </em>general.\u2014If a covered employee dies from a cause that is not compensable under this title, the right to compensation that is payable under this Part IV of this subtitle and unpaid on the date of death survives in accordance with this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-8\">(c) <em>Surviving </em>dependents.\u2014-If there are surviving dependents of the covered employee, the right to compensation survives to the surviving dependents as the Commission may determine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-9\">(d) <em>No swviving dependents; obligation to support surviving </em>spouse.\u2014If there are no surviving dependents of the covered employee and, on the date of death, the covered employee had a legal obligation to support a surviving spouse, the right to compensation survives jointly to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-10\">(1) the surviving spouse of the covered employee; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-11\">(2) the surviving minor children of the covered employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-12\">(e) <em>No surviving dependents or obligation to support surviving </em>spouse.\u2014If there are no surviving dependents and, on the date of death, the covered employee did not have a legal obligation to support a surviving spouse, the right to compensation survives only to the surviving minor children of the covered employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-13\">Appellant was the only witness at the hearing. He testified without contradiction that he and Mrs. Holmes had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>married in 1969, that they separated some time thereafter, but that they had reconciled and lived together at their residence as husband and wife for approximately three years prior to Mrs. Holmes\u2019 death. He stated that, during that period of time, he and his wife combined his income with her workers\u2019 compensation benefits to meet their living expenses. Appellant testified that his monthly income was approximately $1,100 and that Mrs. Holmes\u2019 benefits amounted to $380 per week. Finally, Mr. Holmes testified that, at the time of her death, Mrs. Holmes had no source of income, was in very poor health, and was unable to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">The parties stipulated to the Commission that appellant was not a \u201cdependent\u201d of Mrs. Holmes for the purposes of \u00a7 9-632(c)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that Mrs. Holmes had no surviving minor children. Since appellant\u2019s contention that he was entitled to pursue his late wife\u2019s claim was based solely upon \u00a7 9-632(d), the issue before the Commission was whether appellant had demonstrated that Mrs. Holmes had a legal obligation to support him at the time of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Appellant argued to the Commission that his late spouse had a legal obligation to support him at the time of her death based upon Maryland\u2019s criminal non-support statute, Md.Code Ann. Fam. Law \u00a7 10-201 (1984, 2006 Repl.Vol.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant contended that Maryland recognizes a general obligation of spouses to support one another. For their part, appellees asserted that the term \u201clegal obligation to support ...\u201d was intended by the legislature to be limited to court-ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>alimony or support payable pursuant to a separation agreement or other contract. Appellees contended that any other interpretation of the term would render other portions of \u00a7 9-632(d) superfluous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-4\">Had the legislature intended for the right of survival to flow to a surviving spouse automatically under subsectionf ](d), there would be no need to include the language mandating a legal obligation to support the surviving spouse at the time of death. The legislature could have merely stated that if there are no surviving dependents of the covered employee, the right of compensation survives jointly to 1) the surviving spouse and 2) the surviving minor children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The Commission determined that any right to further benefits did not survive Mrs. Holmes\u2019 death. The Commission\u2019s decision stated that \u201cinsufficient evidence was presented to establish that the claimant [i.e. Mrs. Holmes] had a legal obligation to support her surviving spouse.... Therefore, the right to compensation does not survive in this claim; and the issue of permanency is moot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Appellant filed a timely petition for judicial review. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The arguments to the circuit court were, in essence, elaborations of the parties\u2019 respective contentions to the Commission. In rendering its decision, the circuit court characterized F.L. \u00a7 10-201 as pertaining only to \u201creally criminal non-support issues\u201d and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">So I think it\u2019s a very interesting legal issue, I think it\u2019s a very close legal issue. But, unfortunately, there are no cases exactly on point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-8\">But having considered the provisions of the\u2014or the provisions of the Code as well as that case<footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark> the Court will conclude in this case that pursuant to 9-632 that Mrs. Holmes did not have an obligation to\u2014a legal obligation to support her husband.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Accordingly, the circuit court denied appellant\u2019s motion and granted the motion of appellee, thus affirming the decision of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Appellant filed a timely appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">QUESTIONS PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Appellant presents two issues in his brief, which we have consolidated and reworded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-8\">Did the circuit court err in affirming the decision of the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission that Patricia L. Holmes\u2019 right to compensation did not survive her death because she did not have a \u201clegal obligation to support a surviving spouse\u201d on the date of her death? <footnotemark>[6]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we hold that \u00a7 9-632(d) provides that a deceased worker\u2019s right to permanent partial disability benefits survives to his or her spouse unless the surviving spouse has agreed to or has been adjudicated to have given up his or her right of support.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">Section 9-745(b) of the Act provides that decisions of the Commission are presumptively correct on appeal and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>a party challenging a decision of the Commission has the burden of proof to demonstrate error. However, as we recently noted, the presumption of correctness afforded to decisions of the Commission extends to questions of fact but not of law. <em>Simmons v. Comfort Suites Hotel, </em>185 Md.App. 203, 211, 968 A.2d 1123 (2009) (citing <em>Beyer v. Decker, </em>159 Md. 289, 291, 150 A. 804 (1930), <em>Board of Education v. Spradlin, </em>161 Md.App. 155, 173, 867 A.2d 370 (2005), and <em>Symons v. R.D. Grier &amp; Sons Co., </em>10 Md.App. 498, 500, 271 A.2d 398 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">The circuit court granted summary judgment on the basis that, in light of the uncontested facts, Mrs. Holmes\u2019 right to compensation did not devolve upon appellant pursuant to \u00a7 9-632. Review of a decision to grant summary judgment is <em>de novo. O\u2019Connor v. Baltimore County, </em>382 Md. 102, 110, 854 A.2d 1191 (2004); <em>Hines v. French, </em>157 Md.App. 536, 549-50, 852 A.2d 1047 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">In reaching its decision, the circuit court interpreted and applied both \u00a7 9-632 and F.L. \u00a7 10-201. When an appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s \u201cinterpretation and application of Maryland constitutional, statutory or case law, [the appellate court] must determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusions are \u2018legally correct\u2019 under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review.\u201d <em>Schisler v. State, </em>394 Md. 519, 535, 907 A.2d 175 (2006) (citing <em>Garfink v. Cloisters at Charles, Inc., </em>392 Md. 374, 383, 897 A.2d 206 (2006); <em>Gray v. State, </em>388 Md. 366, 374-75, 879 A.2d 1064 (2005); <em>Nesbit v. GEICO, </em>382 Md. 65, 72, 854 A.2d 879 (2004); and <em>Walter v. Gunter, </em>367 Md. 386, 392, 788 A.2d 609 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">\n<em>The Parties\u2019 Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Since appellant conceded that he was not dependant upon Mrs. Holmes when she was injured, his right to enforce her claim for permanent disability benefits rests upon \u00a7 9-632(d) of the Act. Appellant argues that the \u201cplain language\u201d of the statute provides that when a claimant who is under a legal obligation to support a surviving spouse dies, her claim survives to the spouse and the claimant\u2019s minor children, if any. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Since the Act does not provide a definition of \u201ca legal obligation to support a surviving spouse,\u201d appellant looks to F.L. \u00a7 10-201. In his brief, he states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\">Section 10-201(a) of the Family Law Article ... states: \u2018A spouse may not willfully fail to provide for the support of the other spouse, without just cause.\u2019 Section 10-201(b) provides that a violation of subsection (a) is a misdemeanor. Hence, if the willful failure to provide spousal support is a crime, then it is a \u2018legal obligation\u2019 for a spouse to provide for the support of the other spouse, if the spouse is capable of providing support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Appellant cites <em>Pitsenberger v. Pitsenberger, </em>287 Md. 20, 24, 410 A.2d 1052 (1980), and <em>Cruickshank-Wallace v. County Banking and Trust Co., </em>165 Md.App. 300, 333, 885 A.2d 403 (2005), as support for his position that spouses in Maryland have a legal obligation to support one another. He concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9y\">The plain language of the statute <em>sub judice, </em>\u2018legal obligation to support a surviving spouse,\u2019 therefore must be construed to include the existing obligation each spouse has to support the other in a marriage, unless modified by proper agreement between the spouses or by a court order, as reflected both in legislative policy and by common sense. Furthermore, if the plain language of the statute is given any other meaning other than the plain, clear and unambiguous meaning stated above, thereby denying the existence of the basic legal mutual support obligation of spouses as a result of marriage, then the illogical and absurd result would be a separating/divorcing spouse claiming that he/she does not have a \u201clegal obligation\u201d to provide any support since he/she never had such a \u201clegal obligation\u201d to provide support during the marriage. Construing \u201clegal obligation to support a surviving spouse\u201d in a way that excludes the basic spousal obligation of one spouse to support the other, as Appellee urges, would have an unintended legal effect and consequence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Appellees argue that the term \u201csupport,\u201d when used in-reference to the legal obligations to provide the same, \u201ctradi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>tionally means those monetary amounts legally required to be paid under a judgment, decree, or order issued by a court ... for the support and maintenance of another.\u201d Since there was no evidence that Mrs. Holmes was a party to any agreement requiring her to pay support to her husband and since there was no court order requiring her to do so, appellees argue that she was under no legal obligation to support appellant at the time of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Appellees note that, at common law, a husband was legally obligated to support his wife at a level suitable to her station in life, but they contend that this obligation was terminated by the Court of Appeals in <em>Condore v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>289 Md. 516, 582-38, 425 A.2d 1011 (1981). They point out that in <em>Condore, </em>the Court of Appeals stated that the General Assembly had the authority to enact a statute creating a reciprocal liability for necessaries but that the legislature has declined to do so. Equating (although not explicitly) the doctrine of necessaries with an obligation to support a spouse, appellees suggest that the legislature\u2019s failure to enact a statute providing for a reciprocal version of the common law doctrine of necessaries indicates that there is no inherent obligation of spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Appellees argue that appellant\u2019s reliance upon F.L. \u00a7 10-201 is erroneous, as that statute is \u201creally a criminal nonsupport statute intended to criminalize voluntary impoverishment,\u201d which does not create a mutual, affirmative obligation. They contend that \u201cthere is no legislative history to support [ajppellant\u2019s position that the General Assembly intended to have compensation benefits survive to a surviving spouse under \u00a7 9-632(d) solely by virtue of marriage itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Since there are no disputes of material fact in this case, our efforts are focused upon the proper construction and application of \u00a7 9-632(d). In <em>Whack v. State, </em>338 Md. 665, 672, 659 A.2d 1347 (1995), the Court of Appeals explained that the goal of a court interpreting a statute is to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>ascertain and effectuate legislative intent. <em>See, e.g., Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 260, 647 A.2d 1204 (1994); <em>Mustafa v. State, </em>323 Md. 65, 73, 591 A.2d 481 (1991). We first examine the primary source of legislative intent, the words of the statute, giving them their ordinary and natural meaning. <em>See, e.g., Parrison v. State, </em>335 Md. 554, 559, 644 A.2d 537 (1994); <em>Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 145, 626 A.2d 946 (1993); <em>Richmond v. State, </em>326 Md. 257, 262, 604 A.2d 483 (1992). If the meaning of the language is unclear or ambiguous, \u201cwe must consider \u2018not only the literal or usual meaning of the words, but their meaning and effect in light of the setting, the objectives and purpose of the enactment,\u2019 in our attempt to discern the construction that will best further the legislative objectives or goals.\u201d <em>Gargliano v. State, </em>334 Md. 428, 436, 639 A.2d 675 (1994) (quoting <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 75, 517 A.2d 730 (1986)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Our first step is to determine whether the phrase \u201clegal obligation to support a surviving spouse\u201d is ambiguous. We conclude that it is. Statutory language is ambiguous when it is \u201creasonably capable of more than one meaning.\u201d <em>Liverpool v. Baltimore Diamond Exchange, </em>318 (2001) (citing <em>Webster v. State, </em>359 Md. 465, 480, 754 A.2d 1004 (2000)). The Act does not define \u201clegal obligation.\u201d Appellant argues that the phrase \u201clegal obligation to support a surviving spouse\u201d was intended to embrace all married persons except for those who, by contract or court order, are relieved of the obligation of spousal support. Appellee contends that the statutory language was intended to extend only to those married persons who are obligated by contract or court order to provide for a spouse\u2019s support. Section 9-632, at least arguably, supports both interpretations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>In light of the statute\u2019s ambiguity, we turn to the legislative history of \u00a7 9-682 to consider the context in which the statute was enacted in order \u201c \u2018to discern the construction that will best further the legislative objectives or goals.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gargliano v. State, </em>384 Md. at 436, 639 A.2d 675 (quoting <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. at 75, 517 A.2d 730). In so doing, we bear in mind that the Act is remedial. While the Act is not intended to \u201cenrich persons who were strangers to the injured party and who were not directly affected by his loss of earning capacity,\u201d <em>Cambridge Mfg. Co. v. Johnson, </em>160 Md. 248, 253, 153 A. 283 (1930), <em>accord Hood v. Alltrista Corp., </em>143 Md.App. 124, 132, 792 A.2d 1179 (2002), if we determine that appellant is in a class intended to be benefitted by the Act, any ambiguities are to be liberally construed in his favor. <em>Bowen v. Smith, </em>342 Md. 449, 454, 677 A.2d 81 (1996); <em>Ankney v. Franch, </em>103 Md.App. 83, 105, 652 A.2d 1138 (1995), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>341 Md. 350, 670 A.2d 951 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">\n<em>Legislative History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The legislative history of \u00a7 9-632 was traced by Judge Wilner for the Court of Appeals in <em>Meadowood v. Keller, </em>353 Md. at 173-84, 725 A.2d 563. The Court began its analysis by noting that, in its current form, the Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao6_\">provides for benefits for a number of different kinds of disabilities arising from job-related injuries and diseases, among which are weekly monetary benefits for temporary disability (both partial and total), permanent disability (both partial and total), hernia, and death. Benefits for disability and hernia are awarded to the injured employee; by virtue of \u00a7\u00a7 9-632, 9-640, and 9-646, however, the right to collect those benefits survives if the employee dies before they are paid in full from a cause that is not itself compensable under the Act. Tn that event, the remaining benefits payable under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>the award are paid to the employee\u2019s surviving dependents or, if there are no such dependents, to other persons designated in those sections. Death benefits obviously cannot be awarded to the employee but are instead awarded to persons who were dependent on the deceased employee, in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 9-678 through 9-686.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 173-74, 725 A.2d 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The Court stated that, while the initial version of the Act \u201cprovide[d] a death benefit for dependents of employees who died as the result of a compensable accident\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">The initial workers\u2019 compensation law (1914 Md. Laws, ch. 800) did not contain a survival provision with respect to the various disability benefits payable to employees. That omission was consistent with the general rule noted by Professor Larson that a workers\u2019 compensation award \u201cis a personal one, based upon the employee\u2019s need for a substitute for his lost wages and earning capacity.\u201d 4 Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, \u00a7 58.42 (1998). As we pointed out in <em>Cambridge Mfg. Co. v. Johnson, </em>160 Md. 248, 253, 153 A. 283 (1931), it was not the intent of the 1914 Legislature \u201cto enrich persons who were strangers to the injured party and who were not directly affected by his loss of earning capacity\u201d or \u201cto create an insurance to the injured party, which upon his death would form a part of his estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 178, 725 A.2d 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">The General Assembly addressed the issue of the survival of claims for benefits for hernias and disabilities several times in the period between 1914 and 1947. <em>Id. </em>at 178-84, 725 A.2d 563. We will summarize the changes pertinent to the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">By Chapter 456 of the Laws of 1920, the General Assembly amended the Act to provide for survival of the right to collect benefits for permanent partial disability upon the death of the claimant. In contrast to the death benefits, which were then and are now payable only to dependents, the benefits survived to the deceased worker\u2019s estate. 1920 Md. Laws 772. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>notion that a right to benefits would survive to a decedent\u2019s estate, and thus potentially to his creditors, was inconsistent with the conceptual underpinnings of the Act and the Court of Appeals gave the statutory provision an extremely narrow construction in <em>Cambridge Mfg. Co. v. Johnson, </em>160 Md. at 255-56, 153 A. 283 (holding that the survival provision did not extend to permanent total disability claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The legislature revisited the issue of survival in 1945 when it enacted Chapters 336 and 462 of the Acts of 1945. Between them, the two statutes provided for the survival of unpaid permanent total disability benefits, extended the survival provision to hernia benefits and provided that a deceased claimant\u2019s dependants, as opposed to the claimant\u2019s estate, were the primary beneficiaries of the survival provisions. 1945 Md. Laws 303, 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Chapter 895 of the Laws of 1947 was the next pertinent amendment to the Act. Chapter 895 eliminated a rebuttable presumption in the Act that wives, children and other close family members were dependent upon the deceased worker for purposes of determining their eligibility to share in a death benefit. <em>Havre De Grace Fireworks Co. v. Howe, </em>206 Md. 158, 162, 110 A.2d 666 (1955). In addition, while Chapter 895 maintained the provision that the survival benefits would be payable primarily to dependants of the deceased employee, it eliminated the provision that the deceased employee\u2019s estate would be the secondary beneficiary and instead provided that the benefits would be payable to the decedent\u2019s spouse and surviving minor children, subject to certain limitations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-7\">If any employee dies from any cause or causes not compensable under this Article, the right to any compensation payable [for claims arising from permanent total disabilities, permanent partial disabilities or hernias] shall survive to his surviving dependents as the Commission may determine, if there be such surviving dependents, and if there be none such, then to his wife and children under twenty-one years of age <em>if there ivas, at the time of his death, a legal obligation on the part of said employee to support his wife, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>and if there was no such obligation, then to his children under the age of twenty-one, if any, alone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">1947 Md.

The provisions dealing with both the survival of employee benefits and the right to death benefits remained in the same section\u2014eventually \u00a7 36 of Article 101\u2014until 1991, when, through the enactment of the Code Revision [of the] Labor and Employment Article, the long, convoluted \u00a7 36, which was then twelve printed pages in length, was mercifully split into several different sections.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYH\"><em>Meadowood, </em>353 Md. at 183, 725 A.2d 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">One of former \u00a7 36\u2019s progeny is \u00a7 9-632 of the current Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While the language of the current \u00a7 9-632 is gender neutral,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it is otherwise substantively the same as that of former \u00a7 36 after the 1947 amendments.

In <em>Dudley v. Montgomery Ward, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">Generally, a husband has a duty to support his wife and if he fails to do so will be liable to pay one who furnishes the wife necessaries even though the couple are living apart voluntarily or without the fault of the wife. We need not discuss or decide the theories variously relied on to impose this liability on the husband. One view\u2014apparently the Maryland view, <em>see McFerren v. Goldsmith-Stern Co., </em>137 Md. 573, 113 A. 107\u2014is that the wife becomes an agent of the husband to pledge his credit....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">Hi H: * \u2756 \u2756 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">Whatever its sound basis, this liability of the husband arises and continues by reason of the marital tie, <em>McFerren v. Goldsmith-Stern Co., supra; Winchester v. Winchester, </em>138 Md. 95, 113 A. 584. When that tie is severed by a court or when the wife misbehaves to a point which would permit the husband to obtain its severance, his obligation to pay for supplied necessaries terminates completely. <em>Kerner v. Eastern Hospital, </em>210 Md. 375, 379, 381-82, 123 A.2d 333, flatly so held in a recognition of and obedience to the long and well established rule of law to that effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">255 Md. at 251-52, 257 A.2d 437. (Footnote and some citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">We turn again to the pertinent provisions of the Act. The 1947 amendments provided that a deceased worker\u2019s right to benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-11\">shall survive to his surviving dependents as the Commission may determine, if there be such surviving dependents, and if there be none such, then to his wife and children under twenty-one years of age if there was, at the time of his death, a legal obligation on the part of said employee to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>support Ms wife, and if there was no such obligation, then to his children under the age of twenty-one, if any, alone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">1947 Md. Laws 2130. By 1947, it was clearly established that a deceased worker\u2019s survivors would be considered dependents only if they actually relied in whole or in part upon the deceased worker for support, <em>e.g., Meyler v. Baltimore, </em>179 Md. 211, 215, 17 A.2d 762 (1941); <em>State Ind. Acc. Com. v. Downton, </em>135 Md. 412, 416, 109 A. 63 (1919). A legal obligation to support, in the absence of actual support, did not constitute dependency for the purposes of the Act. <em>Harvey v. Roche &amp; Son, </em>148 Md. 363, 369-70, 129 A. 359 (1925); <em>Downton, </em>135 Md. at 416, 109 A. 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Against this backdrop, the purpose of the 1947 amendments to the Act becomes clear. The General Assembly intended to protect three potentially overlapping classes of beneficiaries, i.e. dependants, wives, and minor children, and to prioritize their respective claims. If a worker supported his wife, she would be his dependant and her eligibility for benefits would be determined by what is now \u00a7 9-632(c). If he failed to support his wife, regardless of his legal obligation to do so, she was not his dependant. What is now \u00a7 9-632(d) provided that the right to benefits would survive to her unless her own misconduct had relieved her husband of the obligation of support. This interpretation is consistent with what was then \u00a7 42 of the Act, which prohibited a wife who had deserted her husband from receiving a death benefit.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">When the statutory predecessor to \u00a7 9-632(d) was enacted in 1947, Maryland law recognized that husbands generally had an affirmative, enforceable legal obligation to support then-wives, an obligation that arose \u201cby reason of the marital tie.\u201d <em>Dudley v. Montgomery Ward, supra, </em>255 Md. at 249, 257 A.2d 437. We conclude that, when the General Assembly used the term \u201ca legal obligation on the part of said employee to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>support his wife,\u201d it intended to describe this duty, as opposed to a specific requirement imposed by court order or written agreement.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">We now consider whether changes to the law since 1947, specifically, Maryland\u2019s adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment, should cause us to construe the statutory language differently today.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">\n<em>The Equal Rights Amendment and Subsequent Developments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">On November 7, 1972, the voters of this State ratified Article 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which provides \u201cEquality of rights under the law shall not be abridged or denied because of sex.\u201d Appellees contend that the concept of a unilateral obligation of a husband to support his wife is inconsistent with the Equal Rights Amendment and that this obligation was abolished by <em>Condore v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>289 Md. at 530, 425 A.2d 1011. Appellees read <em>Condore </em>too broadly.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\"><em>Condore </em>was an appeal of a judgment entered against a widow for medical bills associated with her husband\u2019s last illness. At that time, the doctrine of necessaries was codified as Article 45, \u00a7 21. The plaintiff in the case, Prince George\u2019s County, took the ' position at trial that the Equal Rights Amendment \u201cmodified the existing common law of Maryland to impose upon wives a duty to support husbands mirroring the obligations of husbands to support their wives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>519, 425 A.2d 1011. The Court of Appeals stated that the circuit court held that Maryland\u2019s ERA</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-4\">expanded the \u2018equal rights concept\u2019 to require acceptance by women of \u2018the burdens as well as the benefits of such expansion.\u2019 In granting summary judgment for the County, the [circuit] court said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-5\">\u2018[I]n Maryland at the present time the wife is as responsible for her husband\u2019s necessities, such as medical expenses, as would the husband be responsible for the wife\u2019s necessities.....\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 520, 425 A.2d 1011.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">After reviewing authority from Maryland and other jurisdictions, the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-8\">In view of the principles espoused in these cases, we think the common law doctrine of necessaries is predicated upon a sex-based classification which is unconstitutional under the ERA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 530, 425 A.2d 1011.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">The Court of Appeals then considered <em>Jersey Shore Medical Center-Fitkin Hospital v. Estate of Baum, </em>84 N.J. 137, 417 A.2d 1003 (1980). In that case, the Supreme Court of New Jersey held that New Jersey\u2019s version of the doctrine of necessaries violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and an analogous provision of the New Jersey state constitution. The New Jersey court considered a variety of possible remedies before settling upon the creation of a new cause of action, on a prospective basis, that one spouse would be liable for the obligations of the other for necessaries to the extent that the assets of the spouse who incurred the debt were insufficient to satisfy it. <em>Condore, </em>289 Md. at 529, 425 A.2d 1011. Instead of attempting to fashion a new common law remedy imposing liability upon wives for their husband\u2019s necessaries, the Court deferred to the legislative branch:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-11\">[What] best serves the societal need is, we think, a matter of such fundamental policy that it should be determined by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>legislature.<footnotemark>[12]</footnotemark> Consequently, rather than judicially expand the common law doctrine by creating a new reciprocal liability upon the wife, we conclude that the ancient necessaries doctrine, violative as it is of the ERA, is no longer part of the common law of this State <em>and that neither the husband nor the wife is liable, absent a contract, express or implied, for necessaries such as medical care supplied to the other.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-5\"><em>Id. </em>532-33, 425 A.2d 1011 (emphasis added). <em>Condore\u2019s </em>holding was limited to the doctrine of necessaries which, as both the Court of Appeals and this Court have noted, was a remedy, not a substantive right. <em>Ewell v. State, supra, </em>207 Md. at 292, 114 A.2d 66; <em>accord Dudley v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., supra, </em>255 Md. at 251, 257 A.2d 437; <em>Cruickshank-Wallace v. County Banking, supra, </em>165 Md.App. at 324, 885 A.2d 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\"><em>Cruickshank-Wallace </em>is instructive. That case involved a lender\u2019s action to recover money allegedly fraudulently transferred by an insolvent husband to his wife. The wife (\u201cBonnie\u201d) contended the transfers were not fraudulent because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-8\">William [the husband] received fair consideration for his transfer of the tax refunds to her because she used the money to satisfy <em>his </em>legal obligation to support <em>her and their children, </em>i.e., for \u2018family support.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 327, 885 A.2d 403 (emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">In analyzing this contention, this Court reviewed the Maryland law of spousal and family support as it existed prior to passage of the Equal Rights Amendment and cases that followed its adoption, including <em>Condore </em>and <em>Rand v. Rand, </em>280 Md. 508, 510, 374 A.2d 900 (1977), which held that Maryland\u2019s common law rule that a father had the primary obligation to support a minor child violated the amendment, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>well as the General Assembly\u2019s responses to the changes in Maryland law wrought by the ERA, including enactment of F.L. 10-201. <em>Cruickshank-Wallace, </em>165 Md.App. at 323-27, 885 A.2d 403. This Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\">When William conveyed the tax refunds to Bonnie, they were living in an intact family with their children. They both had an equal and complete obligation to support the children that was joint and several. Their situation was not as it was for parents pr <em>e-Rand, </em>when the father had a primary duty of support. Moreover, both William and Bonnie had a legal obligation not to willfully fail to support the other, if capable of rendering support. Their situation was not as it was <em>pre-Condore, </em>when it was the husband\u2019s sole and non-reciprocal legal duty to support his wife by furnishing necessaries for her and their children. Rather, Bonnie had the same obligation to support the children and to support herself and William as he had to support Bonnie, the children, and himself. The payment of household expenses and support of the children was as much Bonnie\u2019s duty as it was William\u2019s duty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 335, 885 A.2d 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\"><em>Cruickshank-Wallace </em>makes it clear that the obligation to support is now mutual. F.L. \u00a7 10-201 criminalizes the wilful failure of one spouse to provide support to the other without just cause. The sanction itself necessarily implies the existence of an underlying duty. The current mutual obligation of spousal support may not be an exact reciprocation of a husband\u2019s obligation to support his wife that existed before adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment. For the purposes of deciding this case, it is not necessary for us to define the limits of that duty; instead, it is sufficient to observe that the duty to support still arises \u201cby reason of the marital tie.\u201d <em>Dudley v. Montgomery Ward, supra, </em>255 Md. at 249, 257 A.2d 437. The changes in the law of spousal and marital support occurring since \u00a7 9-632(d)\u2019s predecessor was enacted in 1947 do not persuade us that the legislative intent manifest in \u00a7 9-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>682(d) should be disregarded.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The analysis in Part I of this opinion addresses the principal arguments of the parties. In their brief, appellees raise two additional contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">First, they state that, assuming <em>arguendo, </em>that F.L. \u00a7 10-201 creates a duty of spousal support, \u201cin order for a spouse to be convicted under \u00a7 10-201, the spouse must have the means or capacity to obtain the resources or income in order to provide support.\u201d They point out that Mrs. Holmes was in poor health and her temporary disability benefits had expired shortly before her death. They assert that these facts \u201cnullified any legal obligation she had to support the [appellant.\u201d The argument is not convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">As we have noted above, Mrs. Holmes\u2019 right to pursue benefits survives to appellant because he was her spouse. In addition, while the evidence before the Commission indicated that Mrs. Holmes\u2019 right to benefits for temporary partial disability had expired a few days prior to her death, it is also undisputed that Mrs. Holmes had the right to pursue a claim for additional benefits when she died. In the context of eligibility for a death benefit, the Court of Appeals has held that a temporary interruption in support did not preclude a finding of dependency if there was a reasonable probability that support would be renewed. <em>Maryland House of Condec</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number><em>tion v. Jenkins, </em>228 Md. 146, 151-52, 178 A.2d 892 (1962). Since the Act is to be applied liberally to benefit the persons whom the Act is intended to benefit, <em>Bowen v. Smith, supra, </em>342 Md. at 454, 677 A.2d 81, and appellant falls into that category, we conclude that appellant\u2019s right to pursue Mrs. Holmes\u2019 claim is not defeated because, approximately two weeks before her death, her benefits lapsed and she had not yet applied for an additional award.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">Finally, appellees argue that an interpretation of \u00a7 9-632 that results in compensation \u201calways surviving to the covered spouse\u2019s surviving spouse, except for those situations where the surviving spouse has agreed to or has been adjudicated to have given up his or her right of support\u201d is inconsistent with the general principles of legislative drafting used by the General Assembly in the Act: \u201c[wjhen drafting the Act, the legislature chose to explicitly outline the exceptions to each statutory provision ... or to include the language \u2018except as otherwise provided.\u2019 \u201d The argument is not persuasive. The language in question became part of the Act in 1947. It is conceivable that the General Assembly could have used different language at that time, but the intent of \u00a7 9-632(d), when interpreted in the context of its legislative history, is clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">We now turn to the question of the proper appellate disposition. Appeals from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission follow one of \u201c \u2018two alternate modalities,\u2019 \u201d <em>Simmons v. Comfort Suites Hotel, </em>185 Md.App. at 224, 968 A.2d 1123 (quoting <em>Board of Education v. Spradlin, </em>161 Md.App. 155, 166, 867 A.2d 370 (2005), quoting in turn <em>S.B. Thomas, Inc. v. Thompson, </em>114 Md.App. 357, 364, 689 A.2d 1301 (1997)). This Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\">The first modality is an \u201cunadorned administrative appeal\u201d pursuant to L.E. \u00a7 9-745(c) and (e), which is referred to as an appeal \u201con the record of the Commission.\u201d <em>[Spradlin </em>] at 167-68, 170, 867 A.2d 370. With this type of appeal, \u201cno new evidence is taken nor is any fresh fact-finding engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>in. The determination of whether the decision of the Commission was free from error will entail only an examination of the record of the proceedings before the Commission.\u201d <em>[Spradlin </em>] at 170, 867 A.2d 370----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\">The second modality, by contrast, is the \u201cessential trial <em>de novo,\u201d </em>or the \u201cadministrative appeal plus,\u201d under L.E. \u00a7 9-745(d). <em>Spradlin, </em>161 Md.App. at 171, 867 A.2d 370. Subsection (d) provides that the court should, \u201c[o]n a motion of \u25a0 any party,\u201d \u201csubmit to a jury any question of fact involved in the case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-6\"><em>Simmons, </em>185 Md.App. at 224-25, 968 A.2d 1123.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">The proceeding before the circuit court in this case was an \u201cunadorned administrative appeal.\u201d There were no factual disputes between the parties. Neither party elected to submit issues to a jury pursuant to \u00a7 9-745(d) and, in the arguments to the court below, both parties relied exclusively on the record developed before the Commission. Thus, a remand for a trial is unnecessary. <em>Compare Simmons, </em>185 Md.App. at 225-26, 968 A.2d 1123 (reversing the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment which, in turn had reversed a decision of the Commission favorable to employee but remanding the case for trial since employee had elected trial by jury.)</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">We have determined that \u00a7 9-632(d) provides that a deceased worker\u2019s right to permanent partial disability benefits survives to his or her spouse if the deceased worker had a legal obligation to support his or her spouse. This obligation derives from the marital status and exists unless the surviving spouse has agreed to or has been adjudicated to have given up his or her right to support. We have noted that the Act specifically prohibits a spouse who has deserted a deceased worker from obtaining a death benefit and we express no opinion as to whether benefits would survive under \u00a7 9-632(d) to a spouse who had deserted the deceased worker. Desertion is not an issue in this case. Thus, the circuit court erred in granting appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment and in denying appellant\u2019s motion for the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>TIIE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY IS REVERSED AND THE CASE IS REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

The current Act\u2019s survival provisions for permanent total disability, \u00a7 9-640, and hernias, \u00a7 9-646, are identical to \u00a7 9-632. <em>Meadowood, </em>353 Md. at 174, 725 A.2d 563.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b726-9\">. In the session immediately following ratification of the Maryland Equal Rights Amendment (Article 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights), the legislature enacted Chapter 218 of the Laws of 1973. The preamble to that act recited that it was passed \"to make the provisions of [Section 36] relating to payment of compensation to wives upon the death of an employee applicable to a spouse of either sex.\" Volume I 1973 Md. Laws 580. The act substituted the words: \"legal obligation to support his or her spouse\u201d for the phrase \"legal obligation to support his wife\" in the subsection of \u00a7 36 pertaining to permanent total disabilities. However, despite the language of the preamble, chapter 580 did not modify the corresponding language of Section 36 pertaining to permanent partial disabilities. We can only assume that this was an oversight on the legislature's part. The provisions of the Act pertaining to the survival of claims for permanent partial disabilities did not become gender neutral until the Act was recodified as Title 9 of the Labor and Employment Article in 1991 by Chapter 8 of the Laws of 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b729-8\">. This provision, in one form or another, had long been pari of the Act and originated at a time when a wife enjoyed a rebuttable presumption of dependency. <em>See Harvey v. Roche &amp; Son, </em>148 Md. at 368-69, 129 A. 359. It survives today as \u00a7 9-680(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b730-9\">. Since 1947, several cases, including <em>Mullan Construction Co. v. Day, supra, </em>218 Md. 581, 586, 147 A.2d 756; <em>Mario Anello &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Dunn, </em>217 Md. 177, 180, 141 A.2d 731 (1958); <em>Havre De Grace Fireworks Co. v. Howe, </em>206 Md. 158, 164, 110 A.2d 666 (1955); and <em>Toadvine v. Luffman, </em>14 Md.App. 333, 336, 286 A.2d 790 (1972) utilized the term \"legal or moral obligation to support\u201d in analyzing questions pertaining to death benefit issues. None of these cases involved deceased employees who were under a specific court order of support or who were parties to written agreements for support. Thus the Court of Appeals and this Court appear to have equated the term \"legal obligation to support\u201d with an obligation to support a wife or child arising out of the marital or parental status.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[12]\">\n<p id=\"b732-9\">12. Since <em>Condore, </em>the General Assembly has declined to adopt legislation creating a cause of action to permit third parties who supply necessaries to one spouse to recover against the other. <em>Cruickshank-Wallace v.

Marital misconduct is no longer an absolute bar to support upon separation or divorce. <em>See Freedenburg v. Freedenburg, </em>123 Md.App. 729, 745-46, 720 A.2d 948 (1998); <em>see also </em>F.L. \u00a7 11-103. However, as noted previously', \u00a7 9-680(a) of the Act provides that a surviving spouse who deserts a deceased employee for more than one year prior to the occurrence of the injury or deserts the spouse after the occurrence of the injury is not entitled to payment of a death benefit. Marital misconduct is not an issue in the instant case and we express no opinion as to whether a right to disability or hernia benefits would survive to a spouse who had deserted the deceased employee at the time of the employee\u2019s injury or at the time of the employee's death.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
