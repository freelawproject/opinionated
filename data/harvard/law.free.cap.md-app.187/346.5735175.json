Margolis, M.D. and Stephen D. Martin, M.D. in their care and treatment of Dr. Orr in the days just prior to and during the delivery of the twins.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">After an eight day trial, the Honorable Terrence J. McGann presiding, the jury returned a verdict in favor of appellees. The jury found that neither Dr. Margolis nor Dr. Martin committed a breach of the standard of care when providing treatment to Dr. Orr. Accordingly, the circuit court entered judgment in favor of appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Appellants appealed and present five questions for our review, which we have rephrased slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>1. Did the trial court fail to properly instruct the jury on causation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\">2. Did the trial court err in admitting evidence regarding an \u201camniotic fluid embolism?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">3. Did the trial court err in excluding evidence regarding Dr. Martin\u2019s handling of the \u201cCode?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">4. Did the trial court err in denying appellants\u2019 request to add an additional expert witness two months after the deadline for designating expert witnesses, but prior to the commencement of discovery regarding experts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">5. Did the trial court err in permitting the jury to begin deliberations at approximately 7:00 p.m. on a Friday evening after two weeks of evidence in a medical malpractice trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Appellees Dr. Martin and Greater Washington Anesthesiology filed a cross-appeal, which presents one issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">Did the trial court err by failing to grant appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss because plaintiffs\u2019 Certificates of Merit failed to attest to a departure from the standards of care that proximately caused the decedent\u2019s death?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court. Accordingly, we will not address the issue raised by appellees in their cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">Factual And Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">On November 6, 2002, Dr. Orr was admitted to Shady Grove Adventist Hospital. Dr. Orr was 43 years old and approximately 27 weeks pregnant with twins. She had preeclampsia<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and gestational diabetes, and she was experiencing pre-term labor. On November 9, 2002, her membranes ruptured (her \u201cwater broke\u201d). Upon the recommendation of her physicians, Dr. Orr consented to and underwent a Cesarean section attended by, among others, Dr. Margolis, an obstetrician, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Dr. Martin, an anesthesiologist. The delivery of the first twin occurred at approximately 6:54 p.m., and the second twin was delivered at about 6:56 p.m. Very soon after the second twin\u2019s delivery, it was noted that Dr. Orr was unresponsive and subsequently in cardiac arrest. A \u201ccode\u201d was called by the nurses present, and resuscitative measures were undertaken.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Unfortunately, Dr. Orr suffered brain injury. On November 11, 2002, life support was withdrawn, and on November 12, 2002, Dr. Orr died. The twins survived.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">On November 4, 2005, nearly three years after Dr. Orr\u2019s death, appellants filed a claim with the Health Care Alternative Dispute Resolution Office of Maryland (\u201cHCADRO\u201d), in accordance with the Health Care Malpractice Claims statute, Md.Code (2002), \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-01 to -10 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d). In their claim, appellants alleged that appellees failed to adhere to the required standards of care in their treatment of Dr. Orr, and that those failures were the proximate cause of her death. Specifically, the appellants alleged that the appellees \u201cfailed to adhere to the required standard of care\u201d by their \u201cfailure to properly and carefully: 1. assess and monitor [Dr.] Orr\u2019s condition prior to surgery, 2. treat [Dr.] Orr prior to surgery, and 3. monitor [Dr.] Orr\u2019s progress during her cesarean section surgery ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Pursuant to CJP \u00a7 3-2A-04(b), a claim filed with the HCA-DRO must include a certificate of qualified expert attesting that the health care provider departed from standards of care and that such departure was the proximate cause of the alleged injury. In this case, appellants filed two certificates. The first certificate was by Kris Sperry, M.D., a Board Certified Pathologist, who stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">It is my opinion that [Dr.] Orr died due to irreversible brain damage and associated failure of other organ systems, all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>which were caused by hypoxia and severe acidosis. It is also my opinion that she did not sustain an amniotic fluid embolus during the cesarean section she underwent to deliver her twin sons, and that an amniotic fluid embolus played no role in causing the hypoxia and acidosis that culminated in her death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">The second certificate of merit was by Dr. Stephanie Mann, a Board Certified Obstetrician-Gynecologist. Dr. Mann stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">It is my opinion from reviewing [Dr. Orr\u2019s] records that the Health Care Providers, each of them, violated the standard of care.... It is my belief that these physicians violated the appropriate standard of care in numerous ways, including failing to recognize the pulmonary problem that [Dr. Orr] was suffering from and not treating her appropriately under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Dr. Mann\u2019s certificate did not attest that any breach of the standard of care caused Ms. Orr\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">On May 7, 2007, the HCADRO Director issued an Order finding that appellants had satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 3-32A-01 by filing a valid Certificate of Qualified Expert and an appropriate accompanying report. It further ordered that the certificates of merit were \u201csufficiently detailed such that they are recognized by this Body as appropriate Reports of Attesting Experts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Appellants subsequently filed a complaint in the circuit court under the Wrongful Death Act of Maryland, Md.Code (2002), CJP \u00a7\u00a7 3-901-904. In their complaint, appellants alleged that Dr. Margolis and Dr. Martin failed to properly and carefully: \u201c1. Assess and monitor [Dr.] Orr\u2019s condition prior to surgery\u201d; \u201c2. Treat [Dr.] Orr prior to surgery\u201d; and \u201c3. Monitor [Dr.] Orr\u2019s progress during her cesarean section surgery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">On May 22, 2006, the circuit court issued a Scheduling Order, which required, among other things, that appellants identify their expert witnesses by November 8, 2006. On that date, appellants filed their \u201cexpert witness designation,\u201d which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>named the following three liability experts: Stephanie Mann, M.D., \u201coffered as an expert in the area of obstetrics and gynecology, standard of care, causation, and damages\u201d; Jeffrey Cocozzo, M.D., \u201coffered as an expert in the area of [anesthesiology], standard of care, causation, and damages\u201d;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Kris Sperry, M.D., \u201coffered as an expert in the area of forensics, causation, and damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">On January 19, 2007, appellants filed a \u201cMotion for Leave to Add Expert Witness,\u201d seeking permission to add a second anesthesiologist. The circuit court denied appellants\u2019 motion, as well as appellants\u2019 Motion for Reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">On February 15, 2007, appellees filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the Certificates of Qualified Expert filed by Dr. Mann and Dr. Sperry were deficient in that they failed to attest that appellees violated the standard of care in their treatment of Dr. Orr and that any such violations were the proximate cause of Dr. Orr\u2019s death. The circuit court denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Appellees filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude any evidence or testimony by appellant\u2019s expert, Dr. Cocozzo, that Dr. Martin violated the standard of care in handling the code to resuscitate Dr. Orr. Appellees argued that the claims alleged against Dr. Martin involved his conduct prior to the calling of the code, and that no expert had opined that Dr. Martin had violated the standard of care in his handling of the code or that the handling of the code caused Dr. Orr\u2019s death. Subsequent to the filing of this motion, and less than two weeks before the scheduled trial date, Dr. Cocozzo filed an errata sheet that purported to clarify some of his deposition testimony related to this issue. As discussed in more detail, <em>infra, </em>the trial court granted appellees\u2019 motion to strike the errata sheet filed by Dr. Cocozzo, and it granted appellees\u2019 motion <em>in limine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>The trial began on September 4, 2007. In their appellate brief, appellants summarize the evidence they presented as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\">Mr. Livingstone claimed that on November 6, 2002 (three days prior to her admission to the delivery room) Tracy Orr had developed pulmonary edema in addition to pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes. Pulmonary edema is a life threatening condition and in this case was not recognized as such and was not properly treated by Appellees Drs. Margolis and Martin. Mr. Livingstone alleged at trial that the Appellees\u2019 failure to properly treat Dr. Orr\u2019s pulmonary edema was a substantial factor of her death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">Mr. Livingstone also alleged that upon Dr. Orr\u2019s admission to the delivery room with a severely compromised respiratory system the Appellees did not properly monitor Tracy Orr, such that she developed an even worse respiratory condition eventually resulting in a respiratory arrest. This respiratory arrest, according to Mr. Livingstone, led to a cardiac arrest in the operating room during the delivery of Dillon and Ryan Livingstone. Both the respiratory and cardiac arrests were neither timely nor properly treated as required by the applicable standards of care, and these negligent acts by the Appellees were substantial factors to the subsequent death of Tracy Orr.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Appellants\u2019 statement of facts provides no record references regarding where such facts can be found. Our review of the record extract provided by the parties has revealed little testimony from appellants\u2019 experts regarding any violation of the standard of care. And appellants have not provided the complete transcript of the trial in the record on appeal. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8^411(a)(l) (appellant\u2019s responsibility to order the transcript \u201cof (A) all the testimony or (B) that part of the testimony that the parties agree, by written stipulation filed with the clerk of the lower court, is necessary for the appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">A review of the limited record before us, including closing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>argument of counsel,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> indicates that appellants\u2019 argument at trial regarding Dr. Margolis was that he failed to follow the requisite standard of care by failing to properly treat Dr. Orr\u2019s pulmonary edema prior to delivery, and he failed to get an arterial blood gas to determine why her oxygen levels were not higher. With regard to Dr. Martin, it appears that appellants alleged that he violated the standard of care by conducting an inferior \u201cpresurgery anesthesia assessment\u201d and by failing to timely recognize, in the midst of surgery, that Dr. Orr was not getting enough oxygen. At oral argument before this Court, when pressed to identify specifically how appellees breached the standard of care, appellants\u2019 counsel responded that both Dr. Margolis and Dr. Martin (1) failed to recognize timely the pulmonary problem Dr. Orr was experiencing, and (2) failed to \u201cgive her more oxygen.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">The record extract is sparse with respect to testimony from appellees\u2019 witnesses regarding the standard of care. As discussed, <em>infra, </em>however, a review of the appellees\u2019 closing argument indicates that there was extensive direct and cross-examination on this issue, and appellees vigorously argued that neither doctor breached the standard of care in their care and treatment of Dr. Orr.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Appellees also presented extensive evidence regarding the cause of Dr. Orr\u2019s death. Appellees presented expert testimony that Dr. Orr died from an amniotic fluid embolism (\u201cAFE\u201d), an unpredictable \u201cobstetrical catastrophe\u201d befalling a pregnant woman. Dr. Gary Hankins was accepted as an expert in the area of obstetrics, gynecology and amniotic fluid embolism. Dr. Hankins testified that, in his opinion, after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>second baby\u2019s amniotic sac ruptured, amniotic fluid entered Dr. Orr\u2019s circulation through the incision of the uterus, which was made to perform the Cesarean section. The amniotic fluid entered Dr. Orr\u2019s circulation in the uterus at approximately 6:55 p.m., and it caused \u201cher oxygenation to plummet.\u201d Without an exchange of oxygen, she became hypoxic. The lack of oxygen caused Dr. Orr\u2019s uterus to turn from pink to blue, and it caused her to lose consciousness. Dr. Hankins testified that the process was accelerated in Dr. Orr because she had preexisting pulmonary issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Dr. Hankins explained that \u201cvasoactive compounds,\u201d such as the prostaglandins, in the amniotic fluid \u201ccause blood vessels to squeeze down ... constrict.\u201d The constriction of the blood vessels results in changes in the pressure gradient between blood flow and air flow in the air sacs where gas exchange is taking place, a process called shunting. The shunting process results in de-oxygenated blood returning to the heart from the lungs, rather than oxygen rich blood. As a result, de-oxygenated blood is then pumped to the tissues of the rest of the body. As the body reacts to oxygen deprivation, organs in the body shut down.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Dr. Hankins noted that the evidence showed that Dr. Orr\u2019s uterus changed color within 15 to 30 seconds. He explained that \u201csomething really drastic and catastrophic happened to [Dr. Orr] in a really short window of time.\u201d In his opinion, the evidence showed that Dr. Orr suffered an AFE.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Dr. James Pepple, an anesthesiologist at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, testified that, in his opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical probability, Dr. Orr suffered an AFE, and, as a consequence, she had a \u201csudden cardiac arrest with change in blood pressure, change in color to require resuscitation and to require intubation and CPR [Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation].\u201d He further testified that an AFE is \u201cvery unpredictable\u201d and \u201cunpreventable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Dr. Joseph Ernest, an obstetrician, testified that Dr. Orr had \u201ca very common presentation\u201d of AFE, including a \u201cvery dramatic respiratory event.\u201d He explained that, when amniot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>ic fluid gets into the maternal blood, \u201c[i]ts almost as if [the woman] ... has a significant allergic or anaphylactic reaction to some component that\u2019s on the fetal cells.\u201d That results in \u201ca very dramatic change in her oxygen level in her blood,\u201d which has \u201cvery profound effects.\u201d He noted that was what happened with Dr. Orr; \u201cher vital signs dramatically changed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Dr. Ernest explained the process as a constriction of the blood vessels in the lungs, so no matter how much oxygen the woman is given, there is \u201cno blood flowing through the lungs to pick [the oxygen] up and take it to the body.\u201d That affects the brain and the heart. Ultimately, the patient suffers from disseminated intravascular coagulation (\u201cDIC\u201d), where blood vessels in the body dilate and \u201cget very leaky.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He testified that the events that occurred in this case during the delivery of the babies \u201cwere so sudden and so catastrophic and so fit the picture of an amniotic fluid embolus.\u201d In particular, Dr. Ernest noted that the testimony that Dr. Orr\u2019s uterus was pink at the time of delivery of the first baby, but had turned blue two minutes later with the delivery of the second baby, was consistent with an AFE.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Dr. Bruce Goldman, a pathologist, reviewed a photomicrograph of a slide of lung tissue from Dr. Orr.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Dr. Goldman concluded that \u201cfetal cells derived from amniotic fluid\u201d were circulating in Dr. Orr\u2019s blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">At the conclusion of the eight-day trial, the jury was provided with a special verdict sheet, which required a specific finding as to each defendant on the issues of negligence, causation and damages. The jury rendered a verdict in favor of appellees, finding that neither Dr. Margolis nor Dr. Martin had violated the standard of care. As such, the jury did not reach the issues of causation and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Additional facts will be set forth as necessary in the discussion of the individual issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Jury Instructions On Causation</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Appellants\u2019 first contention is that the trial court erred in instructing the jury with regard to causation. The trial court instructed the jury that, if it found \u201cthat the doctor\u2019s conduct was a violation of the duty of care owed to the patient,\u201d it must determine, \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence, whether this failure has been shown to a reasonable medical probability to have caused Tracy Orr\u2019s death.\u201d The court then gave the following instruction on the issue of causation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">Causation: for the plaintiff to recover damages, the defendant\u2019s negligence must be a cause of the plaintiffs injury. There may be more than one cause of an injury; that is, several negligent acts may work together. Each person whose negligent act is a cause of an injury is responsible. You are instructed that the plaintiffs need only prove the most likely cause of Tracy Orr\u2019s death. The plaintiffs are not required to negate or exclude every other possible cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">However, if there are two or more causes, either of which could have resulted in Tracy Orr\u2019s death, one of which[,] for which[,] the defendant is responsible, and the others for which the defendant is not, then the plaintiffs have to prove, by evidence more likely so than not, that the acts for which the defendant is responsible, in fact, caused the death. Likewise, the evidence must not leave the causal connection a matter of conjecture. The evidence must be something more than consistent with the plaintiffs\u2019 theory as to how the death occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-10\">Where proof of causal connection is equally balanced, or the facts are as consistent with one theory as another, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>plaintiffs have not met the burden which the law casts upon them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-4\">If the evidence shows that an injury may have resulted from one of several causes, but only one of the causes can be attributed to the defendant\u2019s negligence, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim must fail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Appellants contend that the trial court\u2019s instruction was erroneous for two reasons: (1) it failed to instruct the jury that causation could be established through the substantial factor test; and (2) although the first paragraph of the instruction advised that appellants needed to prove that appellees\u2019 negligence was <em>a </em>cause of Dr. Orr\u2019s death, the remainder of the instruction misstated the law and \u201celevated the burden upon Mr. Livingstone to prove <em>the </em>cause of Tracy Orr\u2019s death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Appellees advance three arguments why the court\u2019s instruction does not require reversal of the judgment below. First, they argue that, because appellants did not object to the causation instruction promptly after jury instructions were given, the issue has not been preserved for appellate review. Second, they contend that the jury instruction was proper. They note that the first paragraph of the jury instruction defining causation was taken directly from the Maryland Civil Pattern Jury Instructions (\u201cMPJI\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Appellees further point out that the Wrongful Death Act, CJP \u00a7 3-902, states that \u201can action may be maintained against a person whose wrongful act causes the death of another.\u201d Based on this language, they argue that the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d test is not a proper causation instruction in a Wrongful Death action, and the instruction given by the trial court was proper pursuant to Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Third, appellees argue that, even if the instruction was error, it was harmless error. Appellees point to the special verdict sheet, which shows that the jury found that appellees did not violate the standard of care in treating Dr. Orr, and therefore, it did not reach the question of causation. Under these circumstances, they argue, any error in the instruction regarding causation is now moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Starting first with the preservation argument, which appellees set forth in a footnote, the record reflects that, after the court instructed the jury, it asked both counsel if they had any \u201cadditions, corrections or anything that needs to be put on the record.\u201d Appellants\u2019 counsel responded: \u201cNo, your Hon- or.\u201d Under these circumstances, where appellants did not object to the causation instruction after the court instructed the jury, appellees contend that the issue is not preserved for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">To be sure, Maryland Rule 2-520(e) requires that objections to the court\u2019s instructions be made by a party \u201con the record promptly after the court instructs the jury.\u201d This Court, however, has noted that there are exceptions to this rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArH\">[Ujnder certain well-defined circumstances, when the objection is clearly made before instructions are given, and restating the objection after the instructions would obviously be a futile or useless act, we will excuse the absence of literal compliance -with the requirements of the Rule. We make clear, however, that these occasions represent rare exceptions and that the requirements of the Rule should be followed closely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-6\"><em>Haney v. Gregor, </em>177 Md.App. 504, 518, 936 A.2d 388 (2007) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Here, appellants made clear prior to the court\u2019s instructions to the jury that they objected to the causation instructions that the court planned to give. On the last day of trial, prior to the court\u2019s instructions to the jury, there was an extended discussion regarding the proposed causation instruction. Counsel clearly stated his objection to the court\u2019s decision not to instruct regarding the substantial factor test. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>court stated that appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s objection was \u201cduly noted,\u201d and that counsel could put something else on the record but it was \u201cnot a debating contest.\u201d Under these circumstances, any further objection at the conclusion of the instructions regarding the failure to instruct on the substantial factor test would have been a futile or useless act. Accordingly, we find that appellants have preserved this issue for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">With respect to appellants\u2019 second argument on appeal, appellants contend that, not only did the court fail to instruct on the substantial factor test, but the actual instructions given were misleading. Although appellants take no exception to the first paragraph of the instructions on causation, they argue that the second through sixth paragraphs are incorrect statements of the law because they state that appellants needed to show <em>the </em>cause, rather than <em>a </em>cause, of Dr. Orr\u2019s death. We did not find this argument raised in the discussion with the court prior to jury instructions. Other than the argument regarding the substantial factor test, counsel\u2019s sole objection was to the fourth and fifth paragraphs, and counsel\u2019s argument was that they addressed the burden of proof rather than causation. Counsel did not suggest, as he does on appeal, that any portion of the proposed instructions were incorrect statements of law, but rather, he argued that they did not belong with the instructions on causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The record indicates that there was an earlier discussion in chambers and that appellants had submitted a written memorandum, but there is no transcript of the discussion in chambers and we do not have in the record the written memorandum submitted. We have not found anything in the record to show that the argument raised on appeal, that the instruction improperly stated that appellants must show that appellees\u2019 negligence was <em>the </em>cause of Dr. Orr\u2019s death, was raised in the trial court. Accordingly, this argument is not preserved for our review. <em>See Fearnow v. Chesapeake </em>&amp; <em>Potomac Tel.

An appellate court can affirm a trial court\u2019s decision not to give an instruction, even if it was error to do so, if the appellant cannot show prejudice due to the failure to give the instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 227, 884 A.2d 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">In the <em>Landon </em>case, Mr. Landon sued Dr. Zorn, contending that she failed to diagnose that he was suffering from necrotizing faciitis, or flesh eating bacteria, and, as a result of the failure to diagnose his condition, Mr. Landon\u2019s right leg had to be amputated. <em>Id. </em>at 211, 884 A.2d 142. Dr. Zorn, however, had requested that Mr. Landon undergo additional testing, including a CAT scan, but Mr. Landon refused, and he was discharged against medical advice. <em>Id. </em>at 212-13, 884 A.2d 142. Mr. Landon argued that he was never advised of any potential risks involved if he refused the CAT scan. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>228, 884 A.2d 142. He requested that the court include, in its instruction on contributory negligence, an instruction that a plaintiff cannot be found guilty of contributory negligence if he is not made aware by the physician of the consequences of his actions. <em>Id. </em>at 226, 884 A.2d 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">The Court of Appeals stated that Mr. Landon, as the complaining party, had the burden to show both error and prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 227, 884 A.2d 142. The Court stated: \u201c[Ajssuming <em>arguendo, </em>that the special instruction was a correct statement of the law, we would still affirm the trial court\u2019s decision because the Landons can show no prejudice by the failure of the court to give the requested instruction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">In the present case, the jury was presented with a special verdict sheet. The first question on the verdict sheet stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">1. Do you find the Plaintiffs have proven by a preponderance of evidence that Dr. Zorn breached the standard of the care of a reasonably competent emergency medicine physician?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">The jury answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question. The verdict sheet instructed the jury that if the answer the first question was \u201cNo,\u201d they were to go no further. Consequently the jury did not reach any of the remaining questions, including the one regarding contributory negligence. The Landons, therefore, can show no prejudice as a result of the court\u2019s denial to give the requested instruction. The trial court\u2019s decision not to give the requested instruction is affirmed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq6\"><em>Id. </em>at 227-28, 884 A.2d 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">The analysis in <em>Landon </em>is applicable in this case. Here, as in <em>Landon, </em>the jury was presented with a special verdict sheet. The verdict sheet set forth, in part, questions for the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">1. (A) Do you find that Richard Margolis, M.D., committed a breach in the standard of care when providing care to Tracy Orr on November 9, 2002?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-10\">Yes_No_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>[If yes proceed to 1(B) if no skip to question 2]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-4\">(B) Do you find that the standard of care breach by Richard Margolis, M.D. was a proximate cause of Tracy Orr\u2019s death?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">Yes_No _</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">2. (A) Do you find that Stephen Martin, M.D., committed a breach in the standard of care when providing care to Tracy Orr on November 9, 2002?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">Yes_No_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">[If yes proceed to 2(B) if no proceed to question 3 on the following page if you answered yes to 1(B)]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-9\">(B) Do you find that the standard of care breach by Stephen Martin, M.D. was a proximate cause of Tracy Orr\u2019s death?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-10\">Yes_No_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-11\">[If yes proceed to 2(C) on the following page, if no to BOTH 1(B) and 2(B) then STOP, if yes to 1(A) and/or 1(B) then proceed to question 3 on the following page]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">The jury here answered \u201cno\u201d to questions 1(A) and 2(A), <em>ie., </em>they found that neither Dr. Margolis nor Dr. Martin committed a breach in the standard of care when providing-care to Dr. Orr. Thus, the jury did not proceed to determine the question of causation. Accordingly, similar to <em>Landon, </em>appellants cannot show prejudice as a result of the trial court\u2019s refusal to give their requested \u201csubstantial factor\u201d instruction when giving its instructions on causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">Appellants, however, argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-14\">The appellees\u2019 theory of the case was that an amniotic fluid embolism was the cause of Tracy Orr\u2019s death, and, importantly, that this \u201ccause\u201d of death was evidence that disputed the Appellants\u2019 theory of negligence. Simply put, if the jury were to believe that an amniotic fluid embolism was a cause of Tracy Orr\u2019s death, then the jury may not have even entertained evidence related to negligence and may have instead determined that an AFE was responsible for Tracy Orr\u2019s death. In that case, the Appellants could be preju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>diced even though the jury did not reach the causation question on the special verdict form because they would not have even considered the question of negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">We have carefully reviewed the record here, and it does not support appellants\u2019 argument. The jury was clearly advised that it had to decide two separate issues: (1) the issue whether the doctors breached the standard of care; and (2) if the answer to the first question was yes, and only in that instance, the issue whether the breach of the standard of care caused Dr. Orr\u2019s injuries. Not only did the special verdict sheet clearly set out this two step process, defense counsel also appropriately separated the issue of the standard of care and the issue of causation in their closing arguments to the jury. It was made abundantly clear to the jury that the jury had to determine whether there was a violation of the standard of care before it addressed the issue of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">For example, counsel for Dr. Margolis explained in his closing argument that the first issue for the jury was whether Dr. Margolis committed a breach in the standard of care. If the answer was no, \u201cthat\u2019s your verdict.\u201d Counsel explained that the jury needed to decide the issue of causation only if he was not able to persuade the jury on the standard of care issue. And counsel spent the majority of his time arguing that appellants had not provided any evidence that Dr. Margolis was negligent in his care of Dr. Orr. Counsel for Dr. Margolis concluded his argument by stating: \u201cI ask you not to go past question 1A [involving whether there was a violation of the standard of care] because .... [u]nder the evidence, [this is] a compelling case to find that [Dr. Margolis] did not breach a standard of care and [what he did] was appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Similarly, counsel for Dr. Martin spent a significant amount of his closing argument on the issue of standard of care. Counsel argued that, contrary to appellants\u2019 claims, the evidence showed that Dr. Martin \u201cconducted a perfectly appropriate anesthesia assessment,\u201d and that Dr. Orr\u2019s oxygen saturation levels remained at levels at which appellants\u2019 expert agreed there would not be a violation of the standard of care. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Counsel pointed to the testimony of appellants\u2019 expert, Dr. Cocozzo, that if Dr. Orr\u2019s oxygen saturation levels were kept above 90, then there was no violation of the standard of care. He further pointed to Dr. Cocozzo\u2019s testimony that a pink uterus indicated that oxygen saturation levels had not fallen below that level. Counsel then pointed to the evidence at trial that Dr. Orr\u2019s uterus was pink until the time when the second twin was delivered, when the uterus turned blue. Counsel argued: \u201c[I]f the uterus and blood is pink up to 6:56, Dr. Martin didn\u2019t do anything wrong and [appellants\u2019] theory that she suffered a cardiac arrest because she wasn\u2019t getting enough oxygen is out the window.\u201d Counsel further argued that the evidence showed that the babies were not deprived of oxygen, which further indicated that Dr. Orr was properly oxygenated.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Counsel for Dr. Martin concluded his argument in the same way as did counsel for Dr. Margolis, by referring to the standard of care. Counsel\u2019s last words to the jury were as follows: \u201cWhen you get to the question that says, \u2018Did Dr. Martin violate the standard of care?\u2019 I ask you to write, \u2018No, he did not.\u2019 Mark the box for no. He deserves that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Counsel for Shady Grove Adventist Hospital referenced the closing argument of counsel for Dr. Martin regarding why the evidence did not show that Dr. Martin was negligent, and he stated that he would not repeat this argument. He spent much of his time on the issue of causation, but he clearly advised the jury that there were two separate issues: (1) whether there was a violation of the standard of care; and (2) whether a violation of the standard of care was a cause of the death of Dr. Orr.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The record does not support appellants\u2019 suggestion that the jury \u201cmay not have even entertained evidence related to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>negligence and may have instead determined that an AFE was responsible for Dr. Orr\u2019s death.\u201d The central component of the doctors\u2019 defense was that appellants had not shown that they violated the standard of care. The jury clearly found on the verdict sheet, in accordance with the extensive argument by appellees, that neither doctor violated the standard of care. In compliance with the instructions on the verdict sheet, as well as the closing argument, the jury did not reach the issue of causation. As such, appellants cannot show prejudice based on the court\u2019s instruction on causation. Accordingly, even if the causation instruction was erroneous, there would be no ground to reverse the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Exclusion of AFE Testimony &amp; Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">On August 31, 2007, four days prior to the start of trial, appellants filed a motion <em>in limine </em>seeking to exclude any reference, argument, or evidence related to AFE. On the day trial was scheduled to begin, after hearing argument from counsel, the trial court denied the motion. Appellants contend that this ruling was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">During the hearing on the motion <em>in limine, </em>counsel for appellants argued that AFE is \u201ca defense mechanism that\u2019s been made up\u201d when doctors made a mistake and are trying to \u201cget out of it.\u201d At trial, however, all of appellants\u2019 experts agreed that AFE was an appropriate diagnosis in the appropriate case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, appellants have not pursued their argument that AFE is not a valid diagnosis, and they limit their appellate complaint to the argument that there was \u201cno factual predicate upon which the Appellees\u2019 experts could link their testimony in <em>this </em>case,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>\u201cthat an AFE occurred and killed Dr. Orr.\u201d Accordingly, they argue that the expert testimony on this point should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Appellees set forth three responses to this argument. First, they argue that \u201cthe jury\u2019s verdict in favor of the appellees on the issue of standard of care rendered moot all issues concerning the admission of evidence regarding amniotic fluid embolism as the cause of the decedent\u2019s death.\u201d Second, they contend that appellants failed to preserve their objection' to the introduction of AFE evidence by failing to object when the. evidence was introduced at trial. Third, appellees maintain that their experts\u2019 opinions on AFE were supported by a sufficient factual basis, and therefore, the trial court made no error in denying appellants\u2019 motion <em>in limine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">We will address first the preservation argument. In their briefs filed in this Court, appellants did not deny that they failed to object when the subject of AFE was introduced at trial. Rather, they argued that an objection was not necessary, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">If a party cannot appeal from a court\u2019s order denying an <em>in limine </em>motion, then there is no reason to file an <em>in limine </em>motion with the trial court, and instead, objections should simply be heard at the time of trial. This defeats the purpose of an <em>in limine </em>motion, which assists in creating an orderly trial practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Appellants have not referred us to any case that supports this argument.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Maryland case law is clear regarding the procedure required to preserve for appellate review a ruling excluding evidence based on a motion <em>in limine. </em>In order for a party to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>preserve a ruling on a motion <em>in limine </em>which seeks to exclude the admission of evidence at trial, the party challenging the admission must object at the time the evidence is actually offered. <em>Reed v. State, </em>353 Md. 628, 637, 728 A.2d 195 (1999). <em>Accord Ditto v. Stoneberger, </em>145 Md.App. 469, 481, 805 A.2d 1148 (2002) (\u201cA denial of a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence ... does not preserve an evidentiary issue for appeal. Rather, the party who made the motion to exclude evidence must make a contemporaneous objection at the time the evidence is introduced at trial.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Indeed, this case illustrates why an objection at trial was necessary. The trial judge ruled that he was denying the motion <em>in limine </em>\u201cat this point,\u201d stating: \u201cwhat I\u2019m hearing, there\u2019s only one reason to believe, number one, that it\u2019s a legitimate, recognized condition.\u201d The court stated that \u201cmaybe there will be a battle of the experts as to whether or not it is. And that\u2019s going to be a jury decision.\u201d In its ruling, however, the court stated that there was another issue, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cis there evidence that this woman had that condition? That\u2019s something that a jury is going to have to decide if, in fact, they have qualified expert or experts, they lay a foundation and they give that opinion.\u201d Thus, the court made clear that appellees\u2019 experts were still required to lay a sufficient factual foundation for their opinions that an AFE occurred in this case. Appellants never objected at trial, however, that the experts should not be permitted to testify because they did not have a sufficient factual basis for their opinion. Under these circumstances, appellants have failed to preserve this issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Even if we were to consider the issue on its merit s, we would find no basis for reversal. Initially, as set forth in the facts, <em>supra, </em>Dr. Hankins and Dr. Ernest described the factual basis for their opinion that Dr. Orr suffered an AFE. This testimony satisfied the requirement of Md. Rule 5-702 that there be a \u201csufficient factual basis\u201d to support the expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Moreover, as set forth in the brief for Dr. Margolis, Capital Women\u2019s Care, and Adventist Healthcare, Md. Rule 5-103 provides that \u201c[e]rror may not be predicated upon a ruling that admits or excludes evidence unless the party is prejudiced by the ruling.\u201d Here, as set forth in argument one, the jury never reached the issue of causation. Thus, even if the issue was preserved, and even if the evidence of AFE was admitted improperly, appellants could not show prejudice with regard to the admission of this evidence regarding causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Exclusion of Evidence Regarding Dr. Martin\u2019s Handling of the Code</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Appellants\u2019 third claim of error is based on the circuit court\u2019s ruling excluding testimony from appellants\u2019 expert, Jeffrey Cocozzo, M.D., that Dr. Martin \u201cwas negligent in his handling of the \u2018code,\u2019 which refers to the time during which resuscitation efforts were undertaken to revive Dr. Orr.\u201d Appellants contend that Dr. Cocozzo disclosed such an opinion in his deposition, and the trial court erred in finding to the contrary and in excluding his testimony on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Appellees, not surprisingly, argue that the trial court properly granted their motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude this evidence. They contend that criticism of Dr. Martin\u2019s handling of the code was not raised by appellants in their claim filed with HCADRO, in their complaint filed with the circuit court, or in the depositions of appellants\u2019 experts, Dr. Mann, Dr. Sperry or Dr. Cocozzo. Rather, appellees assert that appellants focused their allegations on the care and treatment of Dr. Orr prior to and during the Cesarean section up until the point of Dr. Orr\u2019s arrest, at which time the code was called. They argue that Dr. Cocozzo never testified in his deposition that Dr. Martin violated the standard of care in his care and treatment of Dr. Orr after the arrest and during the running of the code. Appellees assert that, had the trial court allowed Dr. Cocozzo\u2019s testimony criticizing Dr. Martin\u2019s care and treatment of Dr. Orr post-arrest, it would have \u201cconstituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>precisely the sort of unfair surprise which the discovery process was intended to avoid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Appellants do not dispute that, prior to Dr. Cocozzo\u2019s deposition, no expert had opined that Dr. Martin violated the standard of care in his care and treatment of Dr. Orr after the arrest and during the running of the code. They contend, however, that Dr. Cocozzo set forth in his deposition the theory that \u201cDr. Martin failed to timely and properly administer certain medications and this failure was a proximate cause of a hypoxic episode that ultimately culminated in severe brain damage leading to Dr. Orr\u2019s subsequent death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Thus, to resolve this issue, we look to Dr. Cocozzo\u2019s deposition, which was taken on July 19, 2007, less than two months before the start of trial. During his deposition, Dr. Cocozzo, an anesthesiologist, testified that Dr. Martin breached the standard of care in treating Dr. Orr as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">[M]y opinions as far as below standard of care would be the fact that there wasn\u2019t any preop anesthesia order. Sorry, any preop anesthesia record. There was no\u2014and the anesthesiologist appears to have been basically not really aware or not really vigilant as far as about her deteriorating or the severity of her condition, you know, during the procedure which led to her respiratory arrest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Dr. Cocozzo suggested that if Dr. Orr had been given more oxygen prior to crashing at around 6:56 p.m., she would not have suffered an acute respiratory arrest. Dr. Cocozzo opined that Dr. Martin violated the standard of care in the minutes before Dr. Orr arrested by failing to recognize a decline in her respiratory function that led to her cardiac arrest and by failing to take steps to avert the arrest. In response to questioning by counsel for Dr. Martin, Dr. Cocozzo testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">Q: Would you agree with me that if there was no deterioration in her respiratory status <em>prior </em>to arrest, that Dr. Martin did not deviate from standards of care?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">A: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>(Emphasis added). Up to this point, Dr. Cocozzo had not given any opinion critical of Dr. Martin\u2019s actions after Dr. Orr suffered cardiac arrest.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">Near the close of the examination, the following occurred: [COUNSEL FOR DR. MARTIN]: Okay. Have we now discussed all of the criticisms you have of Dr. Martin\u2019s care? [DR. COCOZZO]: Yeah, I think we have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">[COUNSEL FOR DR. MARTIN]: Do you have any other opinions in any way that Dr. Martin breached the standard of care in any other fashion that we haven\u2019t already talked about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">[DR. COCOZZO]: Just hold on one second. At this time, no.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Counsel for appellants then examined Dr. Cocozzo, over objection, about the appropriate time to start medication or narcotics on a patient who is suffering a respiratory arrest. Dr. Cocozzo stated that \u201cobviously giving the drugs as soon as possible is the best. So if you have a code, within, you know, one, two, three minutes, obviously is\u2014is preferential to start giving the emergency medications.\u201d When asked, however, whether it was a violation of the standard of care to \u201cfall outside\u201d of that range of time, Dr. Cocozzo did not answer in the affirmative. Rather he stated that \u201cits hard to put an actual time limit on starting medications, but you certainly want to start them as quickly as you can.\u201d Dr. Cocozzo did not testify that Dr. Martin violated the standard of care in his actions after Dr. Orr\u2019s arrest, nor did he testify that these actions caused Dr. Orr\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">On August 28, 2007, approximately five weeks after Dr. Cocozzo\u2019s deposition and less than 2 weeks prior to trial, Dr. Martin and Greater Washington Anesthesia filed a motion <em>in limine </em>seeking to exclude any evidence or testimony that Dr. Martin breached the standard of care in his resuscitation efforts or the management of the code. Appellees asserted that the motion should be granted because none of appellants experts, including Dr. Cocozzo, had opined in deposition testimony or otherwise that the resuscitation efforts or code were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>mishandled or that anyone had deviated from the standards of care during the resuscitation and code. Appellees further asserted that no one had opined that any alleged mishandling of the resuscitation efforts and code contributed to or caused Dr. Orr\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">On August 24, 2007, one day after appellees\u2019 motion <em>in limine </em>was filed, appellees received a fax of a document entitled \u201cErrata sheet,\u201d which was submitted by Dr. Cocozzo, and which purported to clarify his deposition testimony. In particular, Dr. Cocozzo changed his answer to this question by counsel for Dr. Martin:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">Do you have any other opinions in any way that Dr. Martin breached the standard of care in any other fashion that we haven\u2019t already talked about?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">In the deposition, Dr. Cocozzo answered the question: \u201cAt this time, no.\u201d In the errata sheet, he changed the answer to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASA\">Yes I do. Dr. Martin had a serious delay in responding to the arrest with medications. It was approximately 7-8 mins, from the arrest till the first dose of epinephrine was given and approximately 9-10 mins before the first dose of atropine was given.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Appellees filed a motion to strike Dr. Cocozzo\u2019s errata sheet for several reasons. First, they argued that the errata sheet did not comply with the rule permitting changes to a transcript of a deposition.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Second, they argued that this errata sheet constituted a \u201cnew opinion on the eve of trial that will entirely change the focus of the allegations from events before the delivery to events after the delivery.\u201d They stated that the new opinion should be excluded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYU\">because this extremely late designation has deprived these defendants of the opportunity to discover the basis and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>grounds for this new opinion and prepare an effective cross-examination. With trial starting in just several days, there is simply no time available to properly re-depose Dr. Cocozzo, understand the basis of his new opinions, communicate this information to this party\u2019s experts and client, allow Defendants\u2019 experts and client to educate this counsel on these new issues, and allow for a thoughtful response to this new and conveniently raised opinion. Importantly, the new opinion on the \u201cerrata\u201d sheet does not state the basis or provide a summary of the grounds for the new opinion, as required by Scheduling Order, defendants\u2019 Interrogatories and Maryland [Rjules. In short, this new opinion constitutes nothing less than trial by ambush and should not be sanctioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\">Finally, they alleged that the new opinion should be excluded because the opinion is irrelevant and inadmissible unless Plaintiff offers expert testimony establishing a causal link between the alleged standard of care deviation and [Dr.] Orr\u2019s death. No where in Dr. Cocozzo\u2019s \u201cerrata\u201d sheet or his original deposition does Dr. Cocozzo opine that, more likely than not, had the resuscitative drugs been administered earlier that [Dr.] Orr\u2019s tragic death would have been avoided. Without this essential piece of evidence, Dr. Cocozzo\u2019s conveniently new found opinion is neither relevant nor admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">On August 31, 2007, four days prior to the start of trial, the court held a hearing on the motion <em>in limine </em>and the motion to strike the errata sheet. After hearing argument, the court granted the motions, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">I\u2019m going to grant that motion. I think it\u2019s clear, if you look at Dr. Cocozzo\u2019s deposition, he does not address at any time a breach of a standard of care after the plaintiff went into arrest. Even with the prodding of [appellees\u2019] counsel, he still was, well, you know, uh\u2014uh\u2014bobbing and weaving-saying it should be as soon as possible. He never once said there is a particular time of which you have to give the meds, the sooner the better. And, furthermore, your doctor, he\u2019s the plaintiffs\u2019 doctor, had all of the documentation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>all of the records long, months, maybe years before this deposition, and he clearly was on notice of when these medications were given. He was clearly on notice that he was being called upon to talk and discuss about any violation of a breach of standard by Dr. Martin. He had every opportunity. In fact, [appellees\u2019 counsel] went through each period of time in the whole sequence to ask him, up until this point are all the indications that [Dr. Orr\u2019s] okay? Up until this point, up until\u2014I mean, he went over very thoroughly. He had every opportunity. This is July 19, 2007, that\u2019s pretty much the eve of a medical malpractice case. Let\u2019s face it, we\u2019re not talking about putting together a little fender bender. And then to get to the errata sheet, I\u2019m not going [to] even rule that it\u2019s late. But if isn\u2019t late, it\u2019s darn close. It\u2019s on the last possible day. It\u2019s not signed, the rule requires it. The reason that he\u2019s changing his opinion or adding an opinion is not indicated, which the rule requires. Those are violations, those are specific violations. They don\u2019t give the Court discretion by themselves. It would be unfair to the defense at this time to have the defense come in and offer a theory on damages and on liability of what happens because the meds were given late. And I\u2019ve read all of the depositions, and it\u2019s completely blind sided by this. And so I\u2019ll grant the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">Our review of the record is in accord with that of the trial court. We reject appellants\u2019 assertion that the \u201cthe issue of whether the Code was handled appropriately was an issue in this case from the moment that Dr. Martin was deposed. There was no surprise to any party that this was an issue.\u201d Dr. Cocozzo\u2019s errata sheet did not, as appellants\u2019 argue, clarify Dr. Cocozzo\u2019s opinion. Rather, as appellees assert, the errata sheet was in direct contradiction to his original testimony, upon which appellees had prepared their defense. As the trial court found, it would have been unfair to the defense to allow appellants to adduce evidence of this new theory of negligence in this medical malpractice case when it was not disclosed until several days before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>After oral argument, appellants alerted this Court to the subsequent decision of <em>Marcantonio v. Moen, </em>406 Md. 395, 959 A.2d 764 (2008). In that medical malpractice case, the plaintiff alleged that the medical providers \u201cnegligently failed to diagnose and treat [the plaintiffs] endometrial and ovarian cancer....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399, 959 A.2d 764. After their depositions, the plaintiffs experts submitted affidavits \u201cconfirming]\u201d their opinions regarding the cause of the plaintiffs death. <em>Id. </em>at 400, 959 A.2d 764. The circuit court struck the affidavits on the ground that they materially contradicted the experts\u2019 deposition testimony in violation of Maryland Rule 2-501(e). <em>Id. </em>at 402, 959 A.2d 764. Maryland Rule 2-501(e)(l) provides that a party may file a motion to strike an affidavit or other statement under oath if it contradicts a prior sworn statement of that person making the affidavit. Maryland Rule 2-501(e)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">(2) If the court finds that the affidavit or other statement under oath materially contradicts the prior sworn statement, the court shall strike the contradictory part unless the court determines that (A) the person reasonably believed the prior statement to be true based on facts known to the person at the time the prior statement was made, and (B) the statement in the affidavit or other statement under oath is based on facts that were not known to the person and could not reasonably have been known to the person at the time the prior statement was made or, if the prior statement was made in a deposition, within the time allowed by Rule 2-415(d) for correcting the deposition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In <em>Marcantonio, </em>the plaintiffs expert, Dr. Hutchins, testified in his deposition that he was not going to give an opinion regarding the cause of the plaintiffs death. 406 Md. at 400-401, 959 A.2d 764. In his subsequent affidavit, however, he expressed an opinion that the defendant\u2019s failure to properly diagnose the plaintiffs condition and begin immediate treatment was the proximate cause of plaintiffs death. <em>Id. </em>Defense counsel argued that this was a material contradiction because the expert did the .exact opposite of what he said at the deposition that he was not going to do. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>The Court of Appeals held that the affidavit did not materially contradict the doctor\u2019s deposition testimony within the meaning of Rule 2\u2014501(e). <em>Id. </em>at 409, 959 A.2d 764. The Court found that the expert\u2019s affidavit did not \u201cmake a factual assertion that irreconcilably contradict[ed] his prior sworn testimony,\u201d but rather, it appeared to supplement the testimony he provided at deposition. <em>Id. </em>at 413, 959 A.2d 764. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-4\">At deposition, counsel asked Dr. Hutchins if he was going to be rendering an opinion as to causation and Dr. Hutchins responded no. It is quite conceivable that Dr. Hutchins did not intend to render an opinion as to causation at the time of his deposition, and yet later decided to offer one. Although Dr. Hutchin\u2019s affidavit is inconsistent with the intention he expressed at his deposition; it is not factually contradictory to, or irreconcilable with, his deposition testimony. Dr. Hutchins did not state at deposition that he <em>could not </em>render an opinion as to causation or that it was <em>unlikely </em>that the Medical Providers\u2019 failure to diagnose [plaintiffs] cancer caused her death. Thus, we conclude that it was not a material contradiction for Dr. Hutchins to at one point indicate that he did not intend to do something, and then later in spite of his earlier inclination to do that thing he did not originally intend to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">This case is not helpful to appellants. The trial court here did not exclude the errata sheet or testimony on the basis of Rule 2-501(e). Rather, the judge excluded evidence that Dr. Martin violated the standard of care in his handling of the code because it would have been unfair to allow this new claim to be asserted for the first time several days before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">In this regard, we find Judge Wilner\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Marcantonio </em>to be instructive. Judge Wilner stated that, although he agreed that the striking of the affidavit in that case could not be justified by Rule 2-501(e), \u201cthere was clearly another ground upon which, had it been argued, the Court could, and probably should, have\u201d excluded the affidavit. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>at 417, 959 A.2d 764. Judge Wilner stated that these affidavits, which established a proximate cause of the plaintiffs death for the first time, \u201cdecisively changed the legal landscape.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 418, 959 A.2d 764. Judge Wilner explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aje\">[W]ithout the affidavits, the plaintiff had failed to establish the proximate cause of Ms. Schaefer\u2019s death and therefore had failed to establish their cause of action. With the affidavits, a sufficient case <em>has </em>been made to avoid summary judgment. The problem, of course, was that, with discovery having been closed four months earlier and with the defendants reasonably believing that Dr. Hutchins would not be offering an opinion to causation, the defendants were essentially ambushed two weeks before the hearing on their motion, without any explanation and without any ability, prior to the hearing, to conduct further discovery as to the basis for Hutchins\u2019s new opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">As Judge Wilner observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">That kind of practice is exactly what scheduling and discovery orders are designed to prevent. The belated offering of new opinions from previously deposed experts is no different than a party\u2014plaintiff or defendant\u2014coming up with new experts after discovery has been closed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 419, 959 A.2d 764. Excluding that kind of evidence \u201cis a matter of basic fairness and of assuring that litigation is pursued in an efficient and professional manner.\u201d <em>Id. Accord Hill v. Wilson, </em>134 Md.App. 472, 485, 760 A.2d 294 (2000) (It is \u201cespecially crucial\u201d for the trial court to exclude evidence not disclosed by discovery when the disclosure is \u201c \u2018on the eve of trial ... [where] the injury inherent in failure to make discovery is unfair surprise.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Beck v. Beck, </em>112 Md.App. 197, 209, 684 A.2d 878 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">In the present case, allowing Dr. Cocozzo to express his opinion that Dr. Martin violated the standard of care with respect to his conduct after Dr. Orr arrested, when there had been no testimony to this effect prior to the filing of the errata sheet, would have \u201cambushed\u201d appellees days before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>scheduled trial. The trial court properly exercised its discretion in striking the errata sheet and in precluding appellants from offering evidence that Dr. Martin mishandled the code. <em>See Hill, </em>134 Md.App. at 489, 760 A.2d 294 (appellate courts may not reverse the decision of a trial judge to impose sanctions for a failure of discovery unless there is an abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Exclusion of Second Anesthesiology Expert</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Appellants\u2019 fourth contention is that the trial court erred by denying their request, after their initial designation of experts, to add an additional expert in the field of anesthesiology. To put this claim in perspective, it is necessary to set forth the chronology of events leading to the court\u2019s ruling on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">On May 22, 2006, the circuit court issued a scheduling order pursuant to Rule 2-504.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Scheduling Order provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">This Order is your official notice of dates and required Court appearances. <em>ANY </em>MODIFICATIONS OF THIS SCHEDULING ORDER MUST BE REQUESTED BY WRITTEN MOTION AND FILED <em>BEFORE </em>THE COMPLIANCE DATE(S). The motion must provide good cause to justify the requested modification. Stipulations between counsel shall not be effective to change any deadlines absent court approval. Failure to appear or comply with all terms may result in dismissal, default judgment, refusal to let witnesses testify, refusal to admit exhibits, the assessment of costs and expenses, including attorney fees, or other sanctions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>The scheduling order required the appellants to identify their expert witnesses by November 8, 2006, the appellees to identify their expert witnesses by December 22, 2006, and that discovery be completed on March 7, 2007. The scheduling order further provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-4\">Compliance with identification of experts requires one to provide in writing, in the manner set forth in rule 2-402(f)(1), the names of the experts to be called as witnesses along with the substance of their testimony including findings, opinions and reasons therefor. Copies of all reports must be attached.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">On November 8, 2006, appellants designated the following three liability experts,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and the summary and grounds of their opinions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">1. Stephanie Mann, M.D.: \u201cDr. Mann is offered as an expert in the area of obstetrics and gynecology, standard of care, causation, and damages. Dr. Mann is expected to testify within a reasonable degree of medical probability that the defendants violated the applicable standard of care, and said violations are a proximate cause of Tracy Orr\u2019s death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">2. Jeffrey Cocozzo, M.D.: \u201cDr. Cocozzo\u2019s is offered as an expert in the area of [anesthesiology], standard of care, causation, and damages. Dr. Cocozzo is expected to testify within a reasonable degree of medical probability that the defendants violated the applicable standard of care, and said violations were a proximate cause of Tracy Orr\u2019s death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">3. Kris Sperry, M.D.: \u201cDr. Sperry is offered as an expert in the area of forensics, causation, and damages. Dr. Sperry is expected to testify within a reasonable degree of medical probability as to causation of the death of Tracy Orr.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">On January 19, 2007, more than two months after the deadline for designating experts, appellants filed a \u201cMotion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>For Leave To Add Expert Witness,\u201d seeking to designate a second expert in the field of anesthesiology. In support of their motion, appellants stated that appellees had identified \u201cmore than a dozen expert witnesses, including three anesthesiologists.\u201d They noted that they had identified one anesthesiologist, and they wished to \u201cadd a second.\u201d They further stated: \u201cNo discovery has taken place of any experts at this time and Defendants clearly cannot be prejudiced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">The sole basis for appellants\u2019 request to add another expert witness after the deadline was that appellees had a greater number of expert witnesses. Appellants did not proffer any other reason for needing a second anesthesiology expert, nor did they include in their motion a summary and grounds of any opinions that a second anesthesiology expert would testify to at trial.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">On February 2, 2007, GWAPC and Stephen Martin, M.D. filed an opposition to the motion, arguing that appellants were not advising them timely of the basis of their claims. Appellees GWAPC and Stephen Martin, M.D. stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">The Statement of Claim was filed by Plaintiffs in the Health Care Alternative Dispute Resolution Office on November 4, 2005, just several days before the statute of limitations was about to expire.... Other than generally alleging negligence, the Statement of Claim does not provide any insight or detail regarding how Dr. Martin allegedly breached the standard of care. Likewise, when the claim was waived from Health Claims and suit re-filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, the Complaint failed to disclose any meaningful description of how the care of any of the Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>dants failed to comply with the standard of care. To date, Plaintiffs have failed to disclose any meaningful information with regards to what they contend Defendants Martin and GWAPC did that failed to comply with the standard of care and how these alleged failures caused Dr. Orr\u2019s unfortunate death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Appellees argued that the May 2006 scheduling order required appellants\u2019 expert designations to be filed by November 7, 2006. The filing on that date, according to appellees, was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">woefully inadequate in that it fails to even try to comply \u25a0with the requirements of Md. Rule 2-402(f)(l).<footnotemark>[18]</footnotemark> Plaintiffs expert designation does not identify any opinion held by these experts, nor does it describe a summary of the grounds or basis for each opinion. Despite requests by defense counsel seeking a designation in compliance with the Maryland Rules and the Scheduling Order, Plaintiffs have utterly failed and refused to provide a meaningful designation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Appellees argued that the motion t\u00f3 add another expert two and one-half months after the time for expert designation should be denied because it was long after the time required by the scheduling order and because appellants failed \u201cto present \u00e1ny evidence of good cause for the late designation.\u201d They argued that the reason proffered by appellants, that defense counsel had more experts than the appellants, did not amount to good cause. By order dated March 21, 2007, the circuit court denied appellants\u2019 motion for leave to add experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Two months later, in May 2007, appellants filed a motion for reconsideration of the court\u2019s order denying their request to add a second anesthesiology expert. Appellants listed the experts they previously had designated and the experts designated by appellees, again comparing the numbers of experts designated by each side. Appellants stated that expert discovery had not yet commenced, with the exception of the deposition of one expert, and that the parties had \u201cagreed to a consent motion extending discovery.\u201d Therefore, appellants argued, there would be no prejudice to appellees. Although appellants stated that the \u201ctestimony that would be offered by Dr. Goldstein is critical\u201d to the case, they did not proffer in the motion the opinion that Dr. Goldstein would render, why his testimony was \u201ccritical\u201d to the case, or how this opinion would differ from that of the first anesthesiology expert they had timely identified.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">Appellees opposed the motion for reconsideration, noting that appellants \u201chave not offered any reason to justify ignoring the Scheduling Order,\u201d and that they \u201cfailed to offer good cause to allow the late designation.\u201d By order dated June 29, 2007, the trial court denied appellants\u2019 motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Appellants contend that the trial court erred in denying their request to add a second anesthesiology expert, noting that their initial request was made seven months in advance of trial and prior to the commencement of expert discovery. Appellants further note that their motion for reconsideration was filed about the same time that the parties submitted a consent motion modifying the trial court\u2019s scheduling order. Thus, they argue, appellees would have had adequate time to depose the new expert. Under these circumstances, appellants assert that the trial court abused its discretion in denying their request to add another expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Appellees contend that the circuit court properly exercised its discretion in precluding appellants from adding another expert witness under the circumstances here. Appellees note that appellants\u2019 request to add the second anesthesiology expert was made more than two months after the date set forth in the scheduling order, and it \u201cfailed to provide any information regarding the subject matter on which Dr. Gold-stein was expected to testify, the substance of his findings, the opinions on which he was expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each opinion, all of which are required by Rule 2\u2014402(f)(i )(A).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Moreover, appellees contend that appellants failed to establish \u201cgood cause\u201d for the late designation of the second anesthesiology expert. Appellees assert:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">The <em>only </em>purported basis set forth in Appellants\u2019 single page motion seeking to add a new expert was that Appellants, despite the severity of the case, the length of time the case had been pending and the number of parties sued, <em>chose </em>to retain and offer just one expert in the field of anesthesiology at the time their expert designation was due. When the multiple defendants identified their experts, a total of three anesthesiology experts were identified. Appellants argue that their <em>choice </em>to identify just one expert in the field of anesthesiology somehow morphed into good cause for them to identify an additional expert after Appellees\u2019 expert designation. Judge McGann did not abuse his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>discretion by concluding this sole basis offered by Appellants did not amount to good cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">(Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The Court of Appeals has stated that \u201c[t]he principal function of a scheduling order is to move the case efficiently through the litigation process by setting specific dates or time limits for anticipated litigation events to occur.\u201d <em>Dorsey v. Nold, </em>362 Md. 241, 255, 765 A.2d 79 (2001). In <em>Helman v. Mendelson, </em>138 Md.App. 29, 47, 769 A.2d 1025, <em>cert. denied, </em>365 Md. 66, 775 A.2d 1216 (2001), this Court stated that \u201cgood faith compliance with scheduling orders is important to the administration of the judicial system and providing all litigants with fair and timely resolution of court disputes.\u201d A scheduling order does not \u201cenlarge or constrict the scope of discovery,\u201d but rather, it sets \u201ctime limits on certain discovery events.\u201d <em>Rodriguez v. Clarke, </em>400 Md. 39, 60, 926 A.2d 736 (2007) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">With respect to sanctions for violation of a scheduling order, the Court of Appeals has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">Just as there are sanctions for the violation of discovery rules, sanctions are available for the violation of directives and scheduling orders, although they are not specified in any rule.... Apart from any actual prejudice that may be suffered by the party in not receiving the information in a timely fashion, or that may be suffered by the court if trial has to be postponed, the court is demeaned by noncompliance with its order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-8\"><em>Dorsey, </em>362 Md. at 256-57, 765 A.2d 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">This Court has upheld a trial court\u2019s ruling excluding expert testimony when the expert was not identified until after the deadline set in the scheduling order. <em>See Shelton v. Kirson, </em>119 Md.App. 325, 332, 705 A.2d 25 (no abuse of discretion in excluding testimony of expert designated 12 months after the deadline), <em>cert. denied, </em>349 Md. 236, 707 A.2d 1329 (1998). <em>See also Naughton v. Bankier, </em>114 Md.App. 641, 653, 691 A.2d 712 (1997) (abuse of discretion to <em>allow </em>expert witness to testify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>when not identified until one year past the deadline and one business day before trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">In looking at the propriety of a sanction for a violation of a scheduling order, the reasons given for noncompliance, and the need for an exemption from the time deadlines imposed, are significant. In <em>Maddox v. Stone, </em>this Court stated: \u201c \u2018[W]hile absolute compliance with scheduling orders is not always feasible from a practical standpoint, we think it quite reasonable for Maryland courts to demand at least substantial compliance, or, <em>at the barest minimum, </em>a good faith and earnest effort toward compliance.\u2019 \u201d 174 Md.App. 489, 499, 921 A.2d 912 (2007) (quoting <em>Naughton, </em>114 Md.App. at 653, 691 A.2d 712). A party\u2019s \u201cgood faith substantial compliance with a scheduling order is ordinarily sufficient to forestay\u201d the exclusion of \u201ca key witness because of a party\u2019s failure to meet the deadlines in its scheduling order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 501, 691 A.2d 712. Ultimately, however, \u201c \u2018the appropriate sanction for a discovery or scheduling order violation is largely discretionary with the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Admiral Mortgage, Inc. v. Cooper, </em>357 Md. 533, 545, 745 A.2d 1026 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">A trial court\u2019s discretionary rulings will be disturbed only upon a finding of an abuse of discretion. <em>Wilson v. Crane, </em>385 Md. 185, 199, 867 A.2d 1077 (2005). \u201c[A]n abuse of discretion should only be found in the extraordinary, exceptional, or most egregious case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This standard has been summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">\u201cThere is an abuse of discretion \u2018where no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court[ ]\u2019 ... or when the court acts \u2018without reference to any guiding principles.\u2019 An abuse of discretion may also be found where the ruling under consideration is \u2018clearly against logic and effect of facts and inferences before the court[ ]\u2019 ... or when the ruling is \u2018violative of fact and logic.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">\u201cQuestions within the discretion of the trial court are \u2018much better decided by the trial judges than by appellate courts, and the decisions of such judges should only be disturbed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>where it is apparent that some serious error or abuse of discretion or autocratic action has occurred.\u2019 In sum, to be reversed \u2018the decision under consideration has to be well removed from any center mark imagined by the reviewing court and beyond the fringe of what that court deems minimally acceptable.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 198-99, 867 A.2d 1077 (quoting <em>In re: Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>347 Md. 295, 312-13, 701 A.2d 110 (1997)) (other internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Nonetheless, we will \u201creverse a decision that is committed to the sound discretion of a trial judge if we are unable to discern from the record that there was an analysis of the relevant facts and circumstances that resulted in the <em>exercise </em>of discretion.\u201d <em>Maddox, </em>174 Md.App. at 502, 921 A.2d 912. Thus, \u201cthe record must reflect that the judge exercised discretion and did not simply apply some predetermined position.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502, 921 A.2d 912. <em>See also Nelson v. State, </em>315 Md. 62, 70, 553 A.2d 667 (1989) (\u201cThe discretion is broad but it is not boundless. If the judge has discretion, he must use it and the record must show that he used it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">In this case, there is no contention that the trial court did not exercise its discretion in denying appellants\u2019 motion. Appellants allege that the court abused its discretion, but they do not allege that it failed to exercise its discretion. Indeed, the trial court\u2019s June 29 order denying the motion for reconsideration makes clear that the court considered the facts of the case in rendering its decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">Having Considered the Plaintiffs Motion for Reconsideration of the Court\u2019s Order Denying Plaintiff\u2019s Motion to Add Expert, and the Defendants\u2019 opposition thereto, this Court finds that unlike <em>Maddox v. Stone </em>there was no \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the Court\u2019s scheduling Order in naming David Goldstein, M.D. as an expert. <em>See </em>174 Md.App. 489, 921 A.2d 912 (2007); <em>see also Rodriguez v. Clarke </em>[400 Md. 39, 926 A.2d 736 (2007)]. Furthermore, the Court considered in its earlier ruling that the Plaintiff has already named an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>anesthesiologist and that the Defendants has [sic] named more experts than Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Thus, the issue here is whether the court abused its discretion in denying appellants\u2019 request to name a second expert in the field of anesthesiology. As noted, that request was made approximately two months after the scheduling order deadline for the identification of appellants\u2019 experts. This fact, by itself, is not dispositive because, as appellants note, trial was not scheduled to begin for seven months and discovery regarding the experts was ongoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">What is significant, however, is that appellants offered no good cause for their late designation of a second anesthesiologist. This Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">When a trial court permits a party to deviate from a scheduling order without a showing of good cause, such action by the trial court would be \u201con its face, prejudicial and fundamentally unfair to opposing parties, and would further contravene the very aims supporting the inception of Rule 2-504 by decreasing the value of scheduling orders to the paper upon which they are printed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-7\"><em>Faith v. Keefer, </em>127 Md.App. 706, 711, 736 A.2d 422 (1999) (quoting <em>Naughton, </em>114 Md.App. at 654, 691 A.2d 712). <em>Accord Shelton, </em>119 Md.App. at 332-33, 705 A.2d 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Here, the sole basis set forth in appellant\u2019s motion to add a new expert after the deadline for designating experts was that appellees had named more expert witnesses than appellants, including three anesthesiologists for appellees as opposed to one anesthesiologist designated by appellants. Even on appeal, appellants rely on that reasoning. In their brief they state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">Had the trial court permitted Mr.' Livingstone to amend his expert designation, the end result would simply bring the number of anesthesiology experts identified by' Mr. Livingstone to two: still one fewer than the number of anesthesiology experts offered by appellees. And even if the trial court had permitted Mr. Livingstone to add Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Goldstein, the Appellees would still have identified thirteen experts to Mr. Livingstone\u2019s five.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">We cannot find an abuse of discretion in the denial of a request to add an expert after the time designated in the scheduling order when the sole basis for the request is that the other side has designated a greater number of experts. Certainly, appellants must have anticipated, in a medical malpractice case against multiple defendants, the possibility that multiple experts would be listed by the defendants. Appellants have not explained why, if the number of experts was so important, they did not initially designate more experts. And, other than referring to the numbers of experts designated by each party and stating that Dr. Goldstein\u2019s testimony was \u201ccritical,\u201d appellants did not indicate in their motion why it was necessary to have Dr. Goldstein testify.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">In <em>Maddox, </em>174 Md.App. at 508, 921 A.2d 912, this Court found an abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s exclusion of an expert witness based on the failure to disclose the expert\u2019s report until 34 days after the deadline in the scheduling order. This Court held that a sanction excluding a key witness, without whom there is no claim, \u201cshould be reserved for egregious violations of the court\u2019s order, and should be supported by evidence of willful or contemptuous or otherwise opprobrious behavior on the part of the party or counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 507, 921 A.2d 912.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">In this case, when appellants filed their motion to designate Dr. Goldstein as an expert witness, they already had designated an expert in the field of anesthesiology. Appellants did not explain why they did not initially designate Dr. Goldstein as an expert, why Dr. Goldstein was a key witness, or why, when they already had an expert in the field of anesthesiology, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>was necessary to designate another anesthesiologist as an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">It may be that another judge would have allowed appellants, in this serious medical malpractice case, to designate another expert witness seven months prior to trial. That, however, is not the test. <em>See Aventis Pasteur, Inc. v. Skevofilax, </em>396 Md. 405, 425, 914 A.2d 113 (2007) (\u201c[A] ruling reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard will not be reversed simply because the appellate court would not have made the same ruling.\u201d) (quoting <em>North v. North, </em>102 Md.App. 1, 14, 648 A.2d 1025 (1994)). <em>Accord Dehn v. Edgecombe, </em>384 Md. 606, 628, 865 A.2d 603 (2005). In light of appellants\u2019 failure to proffer why the additional expert was necessary to his case, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Jury Deliberations On Friday Evening</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The jury began deliberations on Friday, September 14, 2007, at approximately 7:00 p.m. and it returned a verdict approximately three hours later.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Appellants contend that the trial court erred in allowing the jury to begin deliberations at approximately 7:00 p.m. on a Friday evening after eight days of trial testimony in a complicated medical malpractice action. They contend that \u201cthe trial court should have required the jury to come back on Monday morning to deliberate, to assure that the jury was faithful to its oath to consider <em>all </em>of the evidence presented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Appellants cite no authority in support of their contention. We could dispose of their argument on this ground alone. <em>See Anderson v. Litzenberg, </em>115 Md.App. 549, 577-78, 694 A.2d 150 (1997) (refusing to address argument because appellants failed to cite any legal authority to support their contention of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>error). We will, however, exercise our discretion to address this claim. As explained below, we find it to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">A similar argument was made, and rejected, in <em>Bever v. State, </em>4 Md.App. 436, 243 A.2d 634 (1968). In that case, defense counsel requested a continuance of a criminal trial because the trial would not begin until 3:24 p.rri., asserting that the jurors were probably tired, irritated, and ready to go home after spending the day in the courthouse doing nothing. <em>Id. </em>at 437, 243 A.2d 634. The trial judge asked the jury if the timing of the case \u201cwould in any way be prejudicial in reaching a decision in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438, 243 A.2d 634. The jury did not indicate any problem with proceeding, and the judge denied the request for a continuance. <em>Id. </em>The trial ended at 7:31 p.m., and the jury returned a guilty verdict within seventeen minutes. <em>Id. </em>at 438-44, 243 A.2d 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">On appeal, Bever argued that he did not receive a fair trial due to the late hour of the trial, and, in support of that argument, he pointed to the fact that \u201cthe jury deliberated only seventeen minutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439, 243 A.2d 634. This Court rejected that argument, stating: \u201cIt cannot be presumed here from the length of the jury\u2019s deliberation that they did not properly fulfill their sworn duty.\u201d Noting that it was within the trial court\u2019s discretion whether to grant a continuance, the Court stated: \u201cWe have no difficulty in finding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion and that the appellant was not denied a fair trial by the case being then tried.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438, 243 A.2d 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The same reasoning applies here. As in <em>Bever, </em>the trial court inquired of the jury whether it objected to beginning deliberations on Friday evening:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, what I\u2019m prepared to do is have you retire into the jury room with your notes and everything else and begin your deliberations, and furnish you with a menu pretty soon ... and I will bring you dinner ... and let you get started and see where you are. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m inclined to do, unless there\u2019s any strong objection to that. Would you all prefer to do that?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>No objection by any juror is reflected in the record. There was no abuse of discretion in allowing the jury to begin deliberations on Friday evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Moreover, there is nothing in the record to support appellants\u2019 suggestion that the jury rushed through the evidence. Although this was a relatively lengthy trial, the jury deliberated for close to three hours. And as noted, the jury concluded that appellees did not violate the standards of care in their treatment of Dr. Orr, and therefore, they did not reach the issues of causation and damages. Thus, the jury did not need to address several issues that consumed a substantial portion of the trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Finally, we note that, after the reading of the verdict, the trial judge granted an unidentified juror\u2019s request to say something on the record. The juror addressed Mr. Livingstone and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">JUROR: But we\u2019ve been talking a lot about this tonight and, you know, it\u2019s a very tough case. A very tough decision. You know, both sides did a great job putting on their case, and you know, ultimately nobody wins and we just really want to express our condolences to you and say how sorry we are and, this was a very difficult decision for us. And we hope you know that we were thoughtful and weighed the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The record does not support appellants\u2019 argument that the jury was rushed in their deliberations or that they failed to be faithful to their oath to consider all the evidence. This claim is devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">Appellees Cross Appeal\u2014Sufficiency of the Certificates</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">Appellees Dr. Martin and Greater Washington Anesthesia and Pain Consultants, P.C. filed a cross-appeal in which they allege that the Certificates of Merit filed by Dr. Mann and Dr. Sperry failed to attest that appellees violated any standard of care in their treatment of Dr. Orr and that any such violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>was a proximate cause of Dr. Orr\u2019s death as required by CJP \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(l). Appellees contend that the circuit court erred in denying their motion to dismiss on these grounds. Because we are affirming the judgment of the circuit court in favor of appellees on all issues, we will not address this issue raised by appellees in their cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-10\">.

Although not argued in their brief, at oral argument appellants' counsel suggested that they did object to the admission of evidence of AFE at trial.

The court sustained the objection to the question \"as phrased.\" When the question was rephrased, and Dr. Hankins gave his opinion that the second twin's amniotic fluid entered Dr. Orr\u2019s circulation at around 6:55 p.m., no objection was made.
