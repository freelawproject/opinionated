By the time the petition was filed, Saifu resided with his parents and had relocated to another state. The petition was not served upon him until he was arrested six years later, and there was no evidence that Saifu or his parents were aware of the petition until it was served. On September 28, 2007, when Saifu was 21 years old, the State, appellant, moved for the circuit court, sitting as the juvenile court, to waive juvenile jurisdiction and transfer this matter to adult court for criminal prosecution pursuant to Maryland Code (1973, 2006 Repl.Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Article (\u201cCJ\u201d), \u00a7 3-8A-07(e). The State\u2019s motion was denied after a hearing, and Saifu\u2019s motion to dismiss the juvenile petition was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The State appealed the juvenile court\u2019s rulings, and raises the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">Did the juvenile court err in declining to transfer Saifu K.\u2019s case to adult court pursuant to Section 3-8A-07 of the Juvenile Causes subtitle and dismissing the case?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">We answer \u201cno\u201d to that question and affirm the judgment of the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">The facts giving rise to this appeal were well summarized by Circuit Court Judge Ronald B. Rubin as follows in his written opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\">The relevant facts are simple and largely undisputed, albeit unusual. The Respondent [Saifu] was born on February 8, 1986, making him now over 21 years old. The alleged offenses occurred between September and December, 2000, making the Respondent 14 years old at the time of the alleged offenses. According to the Petition [filed by the State on September 13, 2001], during the later part of 2000, the Respondent committed rape in the second degree ... (and related offenses) upon a minor female.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-10\">On March 26, 2001, Child Protective Services received a report of child sexual abuse of a 6 year old, Nichole K. The Respondent, Saifu K., was the cousin of the alleged victim and was residing temporarily in the victim\u2019s home in Maryland at the time of the events in question. The victim disclosed the incidents in March 2001, after the Respondent returned to his home in Staten Island, New York.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-11\">Thereafter, a joint investigation was initiated by Child Protective Services and the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office for Montgomery County. The State\u2019s Attorney had an address for the Respondent in New York, and two telephone numbers. The State left messages on the voice mail recordings for both telephone numbers, and sent correspondence to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Staten Island address. When no response was received, the case was forwarded to the Department of Juvenile Services, which authorized the filing of a juvenile Petition. The Petition was filed on September 13, 2001. The Petition that was sent to the Respondent\u2019s Staten Island address by regular mail contained an incorrect zip code and incorrect apartment number.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">A Preliminary Inquiry was held on October 3, 2001, and the Respondent did not appear. The Preliminary Inquiry was continued to October 17, 2001, and when the Respondent failed to appear, the Court issued a Writ of Attachment. Several status hearings were held thereafter and the issuance of the Writ was reaffirmed on those occasions. The State periodically, albeit unsuccessfully, attempted to locate the Respondent and his family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">In May 2007, the State obtained additional information and the Respondent was arrested in New Jersey. After extradition to Maryland, the Writ was served on September 28, 2007. The Court held a Preliminary Inquiry that day and detained the Respondent. A petition to waive this matter to adult criminal court, under \u00a7 3-8A-07 of the' Courts Article, was filed on September 28, 2007. The Court held a hearing on October 1, 2007, continued the Respondent\u2019s detention, but ordered the State and the Attorney General (on behalf of the Department of Juvenile Services) to brief certain issues. A waiver hearing was set for October 26,2007.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">At the waiver hearing, the State argued that, under C J \u00a7 3-8A-07(e), the juvenile court had no authority to take any action other than waiving jurisdiction to the circuit court for criminal prosecution. The specific subsection upon which the State bases its argument reads: \u201cThe court has exclusive original jurisdiction, but only for the purpose of waiving it, over a person 21 years of age or older who is alleged to have committed a delinquent act while a child.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>The juvenile court disagreed with the State\u2019s contention that CJ \u00a7 3-8A-07(e) made the waiver of juvenile jurisdiction mandatory. The court noted that, under CJ \u00a7 3-8A-06(a), because the offenses were alleged to have been committed when Saifu was only 14, and were not offenses that were punishable by death or life imprisonment, the court could not have waived juvenile jurisdiction if Saifu had been brought before the court prior to his 21st birthday.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court observed that the legislature \u201chas decided that persons of a certain age, when they engage in conduct that would be unlawful if done by an adult, do not commit crimes but instead commit \u2018delinquent acts.\u2019 Such persons are not to be punished but, instead, are to be afforded \u2018treatment, guidance and rehabilitation.\u2019 <em>See, e.g., Smith v. State, </em>399 Md. 565, 580-81, 924 A.2d 1175 (2007); <em>Lopez-Sanchez v. State, </em>388 Md. 214, 247-M9, 879 A.2d 695 (2005) (Wilner, J., concurring); <em>In re Franklin P., </em>366 Md. 306, 329-30, 783 A.2d 673 (2001).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The court pointed out that, under CJ \u00a7 3-8A-03(a)(l), and subject to certain statutory exceptions not applicable to the present case, a juvenile court \u201chas exclusive original jurisdiction over ... a child who is alleged to be delinquent,\u201d as the State alleged with respect to Saifu in the petition that was filed in the present case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This conclusion is supported by CJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>\u00a7 3-8A-05(a), which provides: \u201cIf a person is alleged to be delinquent, the age of the person at the time the alleged delinquent act was committed controls the determination of jurisdiction under this subtitle.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See In re Darren M., </em>358 Md. 104, 112, 747 A.2d 612 (2000) (\u201cIn making a jurisdictional determination based on age, the age of the person at the time he or she allegedly committed the acts underlying the charges generally controls.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The State timely noted an appeal of the juvenile court\u2019s decision to deny the State\u2019s petition to waive jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">As we noted above, at the time Saifu allegedly committed the delinquent acts, from September to December of 2000, the provision that is now CJ \u00a7 3-8A-07 was codified at CJ \u00a7\u00a7 3-806 and 3-807, Md.Code (1973, 1998 Repl.Vol.). More specifically, what is now CJ \u00a7 3-8A-07(e) was then CJ \u00a7 3-807(b); the language of that particular subsection is unchanged. Accordingly, hereinafter we shall refer to former CJ \u00a7\u00a7 3-806 and 3-807 instead of CJ \u00a7 3-8A-07. Similarly, as to other statutes in the Juvenile Causes subtitle that are relevant to this case, we note that the provisions that are now CJ \u00a7\u00a7 3-8A-03, -05, and -06 were then codified at CJ \u00a7\u00a7 3-804, -805, and -817, respectively, and we shall refer to the three older equivalent statutes hereinafter. In September 2000, those three were codified in the 1998 Replacement Volume. But they were then amended effective October 1, 2000, at which point they were codified at Maryland Code (1973, 1998 Repl. Vol., 2000 Supp.) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Because these amendments did not make any changes material to the case <em>sub judice, </em>for simplicity\u2019s sake, we shall quote the version of all five statutes found in the 1998 Replacement Volume.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>We consider several sections of the Juvenile Causes subtitle pertinent to our conclusion that CJ \u00a7 3-807(b) did not mandate waiver of the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction. In general, CJ \u00a7 3-804 described the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction; \u00a7 3-805(a) established that the age of the alleged offender at the time of the alleged offense controlled jurisdictional issues; \u00a7\u00a7 3-806 and 3-807 provided for termination of the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction; and \u00a7 3-817 established the circumstances for waiver of the juvenile court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction. We quote excerpts of the former language of the Juvenile Causes subtitle, as published in Md.Code (1973, 1998 RepLVol.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-4\">Section 3-804.

The petition alleging the delinquen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>cy shall be considered a charging document for purposes of detaining the child pending a bail hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">Although waiver of the juvenile court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction was permitted under certain circumstances set forth in CJ \u00a7 3-817, none of those circumstances is present in Saifu\u2019s case. The State does not contend that any provision other than CJ \u00a7 3\u2014807(b) supports waiver of the juvenile court\u2019s exclusive original jurisdiction in Saifu\u2019s case. But the State nevertheless argues that waiver of jurisdiction was required by that subsection. The State argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-5\">It is the State\u2019s position that, when read in context of the Section 3\u20148[07] waiver proceeding in Saifu K.\u2019s case, the clear language of Section 3-8|17](a)(l), allowing for waiver of one \u201c15 years old or older,\u201d relates to the age of the individual at the time that the issue of waiver is generated before the court. In contrast to the juvenile court\u2019s finding that Saifu K., because he was 14 years old at the time of the acts in question, could not have been waived, Section 3-8[07] provides no statutory support for eliminating eligibility for waiver where Saifu K. was 21 years old when he appeared before the juvenile court. As argued in the lower court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2\">The age of the person at the time of the offense is only relevant to a determination of where the case starts (original jurisdiction), not to where it ends up (waiver to adult court or not). If the legislature wanted the Court to look at the age of the child at the time of the offense, it would have specifically stated so, like the legislature did in enacting Section 3-8[05](a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">... Thus, in Saifu K.\u2019s case, the juvenile court was called upon to address and apply solely the factors set forth in Section 3-8[07], upon Saifu K.\u2019s extradition to and availability in Maryland in 2007, where Saifu K. was not a \u201cchild\u201d appearing before the juvenile court, but, rather, \u201ca person 21 years of age or older.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">At the outset, we reject the State\u2019s argument that CJ \u00a7 3-805(a) is of limited relevance to the resolution of the issue presented in this case. The plain language of CJ \u00a7 3-805(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>unambiguously stated that \u201cthe age of the person at the time the alleged delinquent act was committed <em>controls </em>the determination of jurisdiction <em>under this subtitle.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The legislature would have been hard-pressed to make it any plainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Moreover, in a case with very similar facts that was decided under an earlier version of the Juvenile Causes subtitle, the Court of Appeals rejected an argument that was very similar to the State\u2019s present argument that CJ \u00a7 3-807(b) mandated waiver to the criminal court if the person alleged to have committed the delinquent act was 21 by the time the juvenile petition came before the court. In <em>In re Appeals No. 1022 &amp; 1081, </em>278 Md. 174, 359 A.2d 556 (1976), the Court of Appeals affirmed the juvenile court\u2019s dismissal of two petitions that alleged the respondents had committed delinquent acts when they were 17 years old. The respondents were each 18 years of age by the time their petitions came before the juvenile court. At that time, CJ \u00a7 3-807(b) read: \u201cThe [juvenile] court has exclusive original jurisdiction, but only for the purpose of waiving it, over an adult who is alleged to have committed a delinquent act while a child.\u201d The Court of Appeals held there was \u201cno ambiguity in the statute,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 178, 359 A.2d 556, and held that the plain language of that statute did not require the juvenile court to waive its jurisdiction and permit the State to prosecute the 18-year-old respondents in criminal court. The Court stated, <em>id. </em>at 179, 359 A.2d 556:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">Nothing in \u00a7 3-807(b) purports to authorize or require the juvenile court to waive its jurisdiction without first determining that waiver is appropriate in light of the statutory criteria set forth in \u00a7 3-817. Under \u00a7 3-807(b), the court has jurisdiction, \u201cbut only for the purpose of waiving it,\u201d over the adult offender. There is no indication that waiver under this provision is mandatory. Such an interpretation would enable the State to postpone the institution of juvenile proceedings until after the child reaches age 18, thus defeating the discretionary waiver hearing set forth in \u00a7 3-817, and defeating also the purpose of the Juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Causes Act, which is, in part, \u201c[t]o remove from children committing delinquent acts the taint of criminality and the consequences of criminal behavior.\u201d Section 3-802(a)(2). We believe, therefore, that a waiver hearing held with respect to an adult who had allegedly committed delinquent acts must be conducted according to the same standards that would have been applicable if the State proceeded against him while still a child, and that a mandatory waiver is not contemplated by \u00a7 3-8Q7(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">We perceive no rational basis for adopting a different construction of the similar language that appeared in the 2000 version of CJ \u00a7 3-807(b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When read in the context of the statutory scheme of the Juvenile Causes subtitle, former CJ \u00a7 3\u2014807(b) does not support the State\u2019s argument that the character of a juvenile offense that could not have been prosecuted in the criminal court because of the juvenile\u2019s age when the act was committed could be transformed into a criminal act that the State could prosecute in adult criminal court should the State wait until the respondent turns 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Our conclusion that <em>In re Appeals </em>still controlled the construction of CJ \u00a7 3\u2014807(b) as of 2000 is not altered by the fact that the General Assembly revised the overall \u201cpurposes\u201d of the Juvenile Causes subtitle in 1997 to adopt a philosophy of \u201crestorative justice.\u201d Prior to the 1997 revision, CJ \u00a7 3-802 had declared that one of the purposes of the Juvenile Causes subtitle was \u201c[t]o remove from children committing delinquent acts the taint of criminality and the consequences of criminal behavior.\u201d That language was removed in 1997. 1997 Md. Laws, Chap. 532. At the time of the alleged offenses in this case, the purposes of the Juvenile Causes subtitle were set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>forth in Md.Code (1973, 1998 Repl.Vol.), CJ \u00a7 3-802 as follows: <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-4\">Section 3-802. Purposes and construction of subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">(\u0430) <em>Purposes of </em>subtitle.\u2014The purposes of this subtitle are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">(1) To ensure that the juvenile justice system balances the following objectives for children who have committed delinquent acts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">(1) Public safety and the protection of the community;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">(ii) Accountability of the child to the victim and the community for offenses committed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-10\">(iii) Competency and character development to assist children in becoming responsible and productive members of society;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-11\">(2) To hold parents of children found to be delinquent responsible for the child\u2019s behavior and accountable to the victim and the community;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-12\">(3) To hold parents of children found to be delinquent or in need of assistance or supervision responsible, where possible, for remedying the circumstances that required the court\u2019s intervention;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-13\">(4) To provide for the care, protection, and wholesome mental and physical development of children coming within the provisions of this subtitle; and to provide for a program of treatment, training, and rehabilitation consistent with the child\u2019s best interests and the protection of the public interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-14\">(5) To conserve and strengthen the child\u2019s family ties and to separate a child from his parents only when necessary for his welfare or in the interest of public safety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-15\">(\u0431) If necessary to remove a child from his home, to secure for him custody, care, and discipline as nearly as possi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>ble equivalent to that which should have been given by his parents; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">(7) To provide judicial procedures for carrying out the provisions of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">(b) <em>Construction of </em>subtitle.\u2014This subtitle shall be liberally construed to effectuate these purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">According to bill analyses issued by the House Judiciary Committee, the 1997 amendment \u201cchange[d] the purpose of juvenile justice law from that of protectiveness of children committing delinquent act[s] to one that requires that children be held responsible for their behavior and accountable to the victim and the community for offenses committed.\u201d The juvenile justice system would thereafter \u201cincorporate! ] the philosophy of restorative justice and balance! ] principles of public safety, accountability, and competency development.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">We do not infer from this revision of general purposes that the legislature intended to alter the prior judicial construction of CJ \u00a7 3-807(b). We are aware of no specific indication that the legislature had such an intent. To the contrary, in 2001, the legislature re-enacted CJ \u00a7\u00a7 3-806 and 3-807 together, virtually unchanged, as CJ \u00a7 3-8A-07, renumbering CJ \u00a7 3-807(b) as CJ \u00a7 3-8A-07(e), without any change to the text of that subsection. 2001 Md. Laws, Chap. 415. We view such action as continuing the General Assembly\u2019s acquiescence in the construction given to the predecessor statute by the Court of Appeals in <em>In re Appeals. See Hoile v. State, </em>404 Md. 591, 628, 948 A.2d 30 (2008) (\u201cThe General Assembly is presumed to be aware of this Court\u2019s interpretation of its enactments and, if such interpretation is not legislatively overturned, to have acquiesced in that interpretation.\u201d (quoting <em>Williams v. State, </em>292 Md. 201, 210, 438 A.2d 1301 (1981))).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Moreover, the statutory construction in <em>In re Appeals </em>was based upon the plain language of the statute, even though the Court did make reference to a purpose of the former Juvenile Causes Act that was no longer applicable as of 2000. When the statute was read in 2000, the plain language of CJ \u00a7 3-807(b) still produced the same statutory construction as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Court of Appeals had given its predecessor in 1976, particularly when read in the context of the entire statutory scheme and in light of CJ \u00a7\u00a7 3-805(a), 3-807(a), and 3-817(a). Notwithstanding the 1997 shift in the purposes of the Juvenile Causes subtitle, in 2000, CJ \u00a7 3-805(a) still specified that \u201cthe age of the person at the time the alleged delinquent act was committed controls the determination of jurisdiction under this subtitle.\u201d CJ \u00a7 3-807(a) still provided that \u201c[a] person subject to the jurisdiction of the court may not be prosecuted for a criminal offense committed before he reached 18 years of age unless jurisdiction has been waived.\u201d And CJ \u00a7 3-817(a) did not permit waiver of jurisdiction for a person who was under the age of 15 at the time the alleged delinquent act was committed unless the offense was one that, \u201cif committed by an adult, would be punishable by death or life imprisonment.\u201d There was no indication in any of these statutory provisions that waiver of the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction became mandatory\u2014without regard to the waiver considerations set out in CJ \u00a7 3-817\u2014once the alleged offender reached the age of 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Although the charges against the juvenile offenders were dismissed by the court in <em>In re Appeals No. 1022 &amp; 1081, </em>it is not a foregone conclusion that the waiver hearing conducted pursuant to former CJ \u00a7 3-807(b) (or the modern CJ \u00a7 3-8A-07(e)) for an adult brought before the juvenile court after reaching the age of 21 would result in non-waiver and dismissal. In Saifu\u2019s case, the juvenile court correctly based its refusal to waive upon the fact that Saifu\u2019s age at the time of the alleged offense would have precluded waiver if he had appeared before reaching the age of 21. For offenders accused of committing offenses for which juvenile jurisdiction is waivable, the result of a waiver hearing might be otherwise. But in a case such as Saifu\u2019s, in which the court could not have waived jurisdiction before he reached the age of 21, CJ \u00a7 3-807(b) did not authorize, let alone require, the juvenile court to waive jurisdiction after the respondent reached the age of 21. Accordingly, the juvenile court did not err in denying the State\u2019s motion to waive the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction and in dismissing the petition in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY IS AFFIRMED.

The statutory analysis in this case is complicated by the fact that the General Assembly recodified the provisions of the Juvenile Causes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>subtitle shortly after the time of the alleged offenses. The juvenile court referred to the current code sections, as did the parties in their briefs.

Pursuant to 2001 Md. Laws, Chap. 415, CJ \u00a7\u00a7 3-806 and 3-807 were redesignated \u00a7 3-8A-07.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b421-8\">. The jurisdictional waiver provisions currently set forth in CJ \u00a7 3-8A-06(a) were codified in Md.Code (1973, 1998 Repl.Vol.), CJ \u00a7 3-817(a) at the time of the alleged olfenses in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b421-9\">. The exclusive jurisdiction provision currently set forth in CJ \u00a7 3-8A-03(a) was codified in Maryland Code (1973, 1998 Repl.Vol.), CJ \u00a7 3 - 804(a) at the time of the alleged offenses in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b422-8\">.

Like the current definition section of the subtitle\u2014CJ \u00a7 3-8A-01(c)\u2014 in 1976, CJ \u00a7 3~801(c) defined \u201cadult\u201d to mean a person 18 years or older. Later in the year that <em>In re Appeals </em>was decided, the legislature amended CJ \u00a7 3\u2014807(b)\u2014adopting the language that currently appears in CJ \u00a7 3-8A-07(e)\u2014to read: \"The court has exclusive original jurisdiction, but only for the purpose of waiving it, over a person 21 years of age or older who is alleged to have committed a delinquent act while a child.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b430-16\">. These same purposes currently appear in CJ \u00a7 3-8A-02, with one addition. Current \u00a7 3-8A-02(a)(7) now provides that one of the purposes is: \"To provide to children in State care and custody: (i) A safe, humane, and caring environment; and (ii) Access to required services; ....\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
