The dispute involves construction pursuant to a building permit, and a revised building permit, issued in 2006 by the Montgomery County Department of Permitting Services (\u201cDPS\u201d). The initial permit, which was issued on August 2, 2006, authorized Ms. Longo to construct an addition to a residential property located at 10234 Parkwood Drive in Kensington, Maryland (\u201cProperty\u201d). Ms. Longo sought to expand the footprint of the existing one story residence, add a second story onto the expanded living area, and add an attached garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">After construction began on the Property, Ms. Placek filed several complaints with DPS regarding alleged permitting violations. In October 2006, DPS issued a stop work order. Ms. Longo filed a revised site plan, which DPS approved, and the stop work order was lifted. In November 2006, DPS issued another stop work order. Ms. Longo submitted a second revised site plan, as well as a revised building permit application. DPS approved the revisions to the site plan, lifted the stop work order, and issued a revised building permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">On November 9, 2006, Ms. Placek noted an appeal to the Board of Appeals for Montgomery County (\u201cBoard\u201d). Ms. Placek appealed the issuance of the revised building permit and the rescission of the stop work orders. Following a hearing, the Board concluded that DPS erred in lifting the stop work orders, and it ordered DPS to reinstate the stop work orders \u201cinsofar as they concern the retention of existing exterior walls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Ms. Longo filed a Petition for Judicial Review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The circuit court reversed the Board\u2019s order, concluding that the Board did not have jurisdiction to consider Ms. Placek\u2019s appeal because neither the decision to lift a stop work order nor a revision to a building permit is an appealable decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">Ms. Placek appealed to this Court, and she presents two issues for our review, which we have rephrased slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-5\">1. Did the Board of Appeals have jurisdiction to review decisions made by the Department of Permitting Services in issuing a revised building permit and in lifting two stop work orders?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">2. Does the record before the Board of Appeals contain substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding that DPS erred in lifting the stop work orders?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">The County also noted an appeal from the circuit court\u2019s order, and it raises essentially the same issues for our review. With respect to the first issue, however, although the County contends, as did Ms. Placek, that the Board of Appeals had jurisdiction to hear the appeal from the decision of DPS to lift the stop work orders, it does not agree with Ms. Placek that the issuance of a revised building permit was an appealable event.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Ms. Longo filed a cross-appeal, presenting two issues for our review, which we have rephrased slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\">3. Did the Board err in finding that Ms. Placek has standing to appeal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-10\">4. Did the County lose its right to appeal to this Court based on the inconsistent positions it has taken before the Board and before this Court?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court and remand the case to that court to affirm the decision of the Board of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">In June 2006, Ms. Longo, as a managing member of 10234 Parkwood Drive, LLC, acquired the Property, a single family home. On June 9, 2006, Ms. Longo filed an application for a residential building permit with DPS, requesting permission to build a two story addition to the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">DPS has developed a \u201cCode Interpretation/Policy\u201d (\u201cthe Policy\u201d) to \u201cestablish definitions for the terms \u2018alteration\u2019, \u2018addition\u2019, and \u2018new construction\u2019 when applied to existing single-family dwellings.\u201d The definitions provided are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">A. ALTERATION\u2014a modification to a building which does not change the footprint or floor area of an existing building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">B. ADDITION\u2014a modification to an existing building which changes the footprint or floor area provided that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">\u2022 The construction must not, at time of application, exceed the existing footprint, by more than 100%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">\u2022 At least 50% of the existing first floor exterior walls, in their entirety, (measured in linear feet) and comprising the footprint of the existing building and must remain as exterior walls. The determination of first floor exterior walls is that it must have its finished floor surface entirely above grade.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-10\">\u2022 Any increase in building height is subject to current zoning standards and may occur provided that the construction is within the above criteria.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-11\">C. NEW CONSTRUCTION\u2014any change to an existing building which exceeds the definition of an alteration or addition as stated above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">Thus, to qualify as an addition, and as relevant here, construction to a home had to meet two requirements. First, the construction could not exceed the existing footprint by more than 100% (\u201c100% Footprint Rule\u201d). Second, at least 50% of the existing first floor exterior walls had to remain exterior walls (\u201c50% Wall Retention Rule\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>The plans Ms. Longo submitted with her building permit application stated that the footprint of the existing house was 956 square feet and the footprint of the addition would add an additional 955 square feet to the footprint of the house. The plans showed that there would be additions to the back of the house, but that the front and side walls would remain. On August 2, 2006, the County issued Ms. Longo a permit to add a second story addition to the Property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">On October 9, 2006, Ms. Placek called DPS to report alleged permit violations. DPS records indicate that Ms. Placek made the following complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">Construction\u2014started not following the rules by displaying their buidling [sic] permit. There is a port-a-potty out in the street and she believes that [a permit is required]. The addition is really over 100% of the footprint of the home. It should be considered as a NEW home. There should be at least two walls left standing in order to allow it to be allowed as an addition and one of the second walls has been down [] partially and you can see the studs. They are rebuilding it. The caller wants to be contacted asap on the outcome of this complain[t]. //Keep caller information anonymous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">On October 11, 2006, Mark Nauman, an inspector with the Montgomery County Building Construction Division, inspected the Property. He issued a stop work order and a notice of violation, concluding that the \u201cexisting footprint has at least been doubled in size and the existing structural exterior walls have been demolished more than 50% not allowing them to be utilized as the intact exterior walls of the finished project.\u201d Mr. Nauman subsequently informed Ms. Longo that she should apply for a new house permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Instead of applying for a new house permit, Ms. Longo submitted a revised site plan, which indicated: \u201cGARAGE DOOR ELIMINATED TO MAINTAIN 50% EXTERIOR WALL POLICY.\u201d On October 13, 2006, after consulting with the County Attorney regarding the 50% Wall Retention Rule, DPS lifted the stop work order and voided the notice of violation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">On November 2, 2006, DPS issued a second stop work order based on calculations performed by Ms. Placek, which indicated that the addition is \u201ctoo large to be an addition.\u201d Susan Scala-Demby, Zoning Manager for DPS, sent an email to Ms. Placek stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">We reviewed the calculations you did on the size of the addition and it is indeed too large to be an addition. We will place a stop work order on the property today and we will direct the builder to file for a new construction permit. The addition permit will be revoked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">On November 6, 2006, Ms. Longo filed a revision to her initial building permit application and a second revised site plan. The revised site plan reduced the size of the garage from 22 feet by 11 feet to 21.8 feet by 10.7 feet. On November 6, 2006, DPS issued a revised building permit. The revised building permit included the following notation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AU\">two story addition\u20141st 1444/2nd 1696\u2014\u201cRevision to permit 10/12/06\u201d Removing garage door and making it into a carport. * * * * * * * *DO NOT ISSUE WITHOUT TALKING TO SUSAN SCALA-DEMBY FIRST* ******** Revision submitted for structural/to meet 100% code on 11/6/06* * revising front wall of garage 11 sqft</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">The stop work order was lifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">On November 9, 2006, Ms. Placek filed an appeal to the Board of Appeals from \u201crevision of residential building permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>for an addition and rescission of stop work order placed as a result of violating conditions for a permit for an addition.\u201d Ms. Placek stated that the reason for her appeal was \u201cdamage to [her] property and dangerous precendent [sic] set for future decisions regarding what may be allowed under a permit for an \u2018addition.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">On January 16, 2007, Ms. Longo, 10234 Parkwood Drive, LLC, and the County filed a Joint Motion for Summary Disposition, arguing that (1) the revision of a building permit was not an appealable event, (2) Ms. Placek did not have standing to bring the appeal, and (3) the building permit was properly issued to Ms. Longo..</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">On February 8, 2007, Ms. Placek filed an opposition motion. She argued that the Joint Motion for Summary Disposition should be denied because (1) there were material facts in dispute; (2) she had standing to bring the appeal; (3) the lifting of a stop work order and the issuance of a revised permit are appealable orders; and (4) DPS improperly issued Ms. Longo a permit for an addition instead of for new construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">A hearing was held on February 28, 2007, and the Board denied the Joint Motion for Summary Disposition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Board concluded that Ms. Placek had standing to bring this appeal because she lived six houses away from the Property and her house would be affected by runoff from the development of the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">The Board also concluded that the DPS decision to lift the stop work order and the permit re-vision were appealable orders. It reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">In the instant case, unlike <em>Hawk,</em><footnotemark><em>[4]</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Board finds that the permit violations that gave rise to the issuance of the stop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>work orders, and led to the subsequent permit revisions (if the facts are viewed in the light most favorable to the Appellant), go straight to the heart of DPS\u2019 determination that this construction was in fact an addition and not new construction. These permit revisions arguably impacted the continuing validity of the original building permit, and the Board finds that it is this interim change in facts that differentiates this case from <em>Hawk.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">The Board further concluded that there were genuine disputes of fact, and, therefore, it denied the motion for summary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">A three day hearing before the Board of Appeals commenced on March 14, 2007, and continued on May 2, 2007, and on June 6, 2007. Susan Scala-Demby, Zoning Manager for DPS, testified that DPS issued a permit to Ms. Longo on August 2, 2006, for construction of a two story addition to the Property. She testified that Ms. Longo\u2019s building application and site plans were reviewed under the DPS \u201caddition policy,\u201d and the changes reflected in the site plans were authorized under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">DPS reviewed the site plans for compliance with the 50% Wall Retention Rule. The plans indicated that the front wall and the left wall were being retained. Although acknowledging that removal of a door and the chimney from the front wall left a large gap, Ms. Scala-Demby stated that these changes constituted an \u201c[alteration of the wall,\u201d not removal of the wall. She explained that \u201c[t]hey were making a modification. They were taking out the chimney and fireplace and modifying that wall. Just the same way as you cut out a doorway or you enlarge windows.\u201d She explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">If the wall was 16 feet, we wanted 16 feet of wall left. You could however alter that wall. You could put in new \u25a0windows. You could put in a door. Because if you\u2019re doing an addition that comprises a good portion of your house, the typical applicant wants to have all the same windows around the house.... So we allow them to make changes to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>front wall or to any wall that remains as long as they do not tear down all of that wall.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Ms. Scala-Demby testified that the front, left, and right wall all could be considered to meet the 50% Wall Retention Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Ms. Longo testified that she is a member of 10234 Park-wood Drive, LLC, which acquired the Property in June 2006. That same month, Ms. Longo applied for the building permit to build a second story addition on the Property. She testified that the first stop work order \u201chad to do with the retention of walls and whether or not there was sufficient retention of the exterior walls.\u201d According to Ms. Longo, the blueprints \u201cdisclosed clearly\u201d the changes to the front wall, which included removing the chimney. After the stop work order was issued, Ms. Longo and her husband met with staff from DPS. In that meeting, the County Attorney advised that \u201cthere would be absolutely no question about exterior walls if we removed the garage door.\u201d Mr. Bell, from DPS, advised Ms. Longo \u201cas to what language [she] could put on the revision when [she] came back.\u201d Ms. Longo testified that, folio-wing this meeting, she submitted a \u201cvoluntary\u201d revision to her building permit application as a \u201csuper precaution,\u201d which included a note that \u201cGARAGE DOOR ELIMINATED TO MAINTAIN 50% EXTERIOR WALL POLICY.\u201d She testified that, after DPS approved the revised building permit, it lifted the stop work order.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">With respect to the second stop work order, Ms. Longo testified that \u201ccomplaints coming in from [Ms. Placek] led to an inspector coming out to the property.\u201d She testified that \u201cthe issues at hand from the second inspection, I believe, were that studs had been removed and that we were over in terms of the square footage allowed for an addition.\u201d Ms. Longo indicated that the inspector did not find a zoning violation, but, \u201cto be even more cautious,\u201d she submitted another revision to the building permit to \u201cshrink the size of the garage\u201d by nine square feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">On November 6, 2006, DPS approved the site plan, and it noted next to its approval: \u201cRevision To Decrease Size of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Addition To 100% Or Less of Existing Footprint.\u201d DPS lifted the stop work order.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">Lynn Gallagher, Ms. Longo\u2019s architect, testified as an expert witness in architecture. Ms. Gallagher testified that she designed the architectural plans for the Property. To comply with the 50% Wall Retention Rule, Ms. Gallagher designed the plans to retain the front wall and the left wall. She testified that she \u201ccould have\u201d considered the right wall as an \u201cexterior wall\u201d for purposes of this rule, but she \u201cdidn\u2019t need to go beyond there\u201d because she \u201calready had 50 percent\u201d based on the front and left wall. Ms. Gallagher testified that the front wall should count towards the 50% Wall Retention Rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">The wall itself, a wall in the plane in that plane is still there. It\u2019s always been there. You\u2019re allowed to change window openings. You\u2019re allowed to change door openings. Historically, this is nothing that\u2019s a surprise to the permitting people because it\u2019s shown very clearly as a difference from the existing to the proposed. There\u2019s no doubt in anybody\u2019s mind that we were going to change window openings, and we were going to change door openings. That\u2019s been the policLy] all along. That you are allowed changes, even though they might include changing headers. They include changing materials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">I believe the first floor exterior wall does remain. The permitting department, zoning, have all verified that, and said that it met their criteria. And I\u2019ve been doing it for a very long time, and it\u2019s not cropped up before as a problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">In reaching this conclusion, Ms. Gallagher emphasized that the Policy does not mention anything about the structural system of a wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Mark Nauman, an Inspector III with Montgomery County\u2019s Department of Permitting Services, Division of Building Construction, testified that he worked in Complaints Investiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>tions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mr. Nauman investigated a complaint for the Property and issued a stop work order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-5\">When I arrived at the house I, my observations were that more than 50 percent of the existing exterior walls had been demolished, and it appeared that the footprint of the existing house had at least doubled. So my actions were to post a stop work order and issued [sic] a notice of violation which I did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Mr. Nauman did not take any measurements, but instead, he \u201cpaced it off\u2019 to determine that \u201cthe footprint of the new stuff exceeded the existing structure by at least 100 percent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">With respect to the condition of the exterior walls, Mr. Nauman testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">My observations were that that front wall structure had been demolished to the point where a new wall had to be built behind it to support the second floor structure.... The right wall of the house was now enclosed behind a garage and a habitable space above the garage, which helped in my determination that more than 50 percent of the exterior walls were now in a demolished state and unable to be used as exterior walls in the finished product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-10\">I had determined as can be observed by the photographs here that a substantial portion of the front wall had been removed, and according to the wording of the regulation, the wall was supposed to remain in tact [sic] and be utilized in its entirety as a finished exterior wall. And obviously, that was not able to take place because of the overall extent of the demolition of the wall. It had been a structural wall. It was no longer capable of being a structural wall, and it would require substantial rebuilding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Mr. Nauman also observed that \u201c[a] new studded wall was built behind the original structural masonry wall to support the second floor and roof load above it,\u201d which extended \u201cthe full length of the front wall of the existing house.\u201d Mr. Nauman did not review the building plans before investigating the complaint, but he explained: \u201cI always err in [sic] the side of caution and post a stop work order and issue a notice of violation and place the burden upon the builder to prove otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">Alter Mr. Nauman issued the stop work order, he received a phone call from Ms. Longo and advised her that \u201cthe remedy for this would be to apply for a new house permit and that the current permit would be voided, as revisions are not granted for this kind of a situation.\u201d Mr. Nauman informed Mr. Bell and Ms. Scala-Demby about the situation because, as an employee who works in the Building Construction Division, this issue \u201cwas falling under a zoning ordinance\u201d and they were the individuals who would make a final determination about what would happen. Mr. Nauman learned two days later that \u201cthe situation had been rectified through Bobby Bell,\u201d and his \u201cstop work order had been lifted, and notice of violation was voided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Bobby Bell, a Permitting Specialist Ii with Montgomery County\u2019s Department of Permitting Services, testified that he conducted the zoning plan review for the Property. Following Mr. Nauman\u2019s issuance of a stop work order and a notice of violation, Mr. Bell met with the County Attorney, and they concluded that the construction on the Property did not violate the 50% Wall Retention Rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">We discussed the condition of the wall that was left, talking about the front wall. And we also discussed the right wall, the garage structure. But it really boiled down to focusing on the front wall, and it was decided then that the front wall was f\u00edne, it was within policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">1 think it was kind of a mutual agreement [between Mr. Bell and the County\u2019s attorney] that it was in compliance. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>require you to maintain the wall in its entirety, it\u2019s linear length. It doesn\u2019t preclude you from going in and enlarging windows, relocating doors, that kind of thing as long as that wall remains at it\u2019s [sic] linear length. It does not preclude you from putting a load bearing wall or studding behind it to support the second story. That wall still, in our opinion, has remained in tact [sic] and it still counted towards the 50 percent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Mr. Bell did not believe that the stop work order was lifted with a written order.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Pete Hrycak, an Inspector with the County\u2019s Department of Permitting Services, testified that he inspects and investigates \u201cland use complaints\u201d and \u201cdevelopment standards.\u201d Pursuant to a request from his supervisor, Mr. Hrycak posted a stop work order at the Property, which he believed was \u201cin relation to the two remaining walls issue.\u201d Other than posting the stop work order, he had \u201cvery limited involvement\u201d with the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">At the end of the hearing, Ms. Placek advised the Board that she \u201cwas going to testify regarding standing.\u201d In response, the Board Chair stated: \u201cI believe we ruled on that. We would not have proceeded had we not found standing. And I think since you are the next door neighbor, it\u2019s clear that you have an interest.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">Ms. Placek, Ms. Longo, and the County presented closing arguments. The County supported DPS\u2019 decision to lift the stop work and requested that the Board deny Ms. Placek\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board issued an oral opinion, concluding that Ms. Longo did not violate the 100% Footprint Rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-10\">I think [the County\u2019s attorney] said it clearly that it may be close, but you\u2019ve got to draw the line somewhere. And one thing that has been consistent throughout, and I would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>actually add my own back of the envelope calculation to that, we have calculations about the existing footprint that all land within 947 square feet. Exhibit 23, Mr. Bell\u2019s calculation of the revised plant,] showed it at 946.92 square feet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-4\">When I add that calculation, I came up to 947.2 square feet, so in all cases we\u2019re looking at a difference of 300ths of a square foot. And so even though it has been close, consistently the calculation of the footprint of the addition has been, by whatever small amount, smaller than the calculation for the footprint of the existing house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-5\">And so for that reason, I would find, although it is extremely close, and frankly, if the laugh test were the test, I would have a lot of questions. However, the bright line as to the 100 percent requirement and the number of calculations we\u2019ve had, all of which are verifiable through examination of the plans, show that the footprint of the addition is, in fact, smaller than the footprint of the house. And I just want to clarify and sort of summarize the testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The Board concluded, however, that DPS erred in lifting the stop work order because Ms. Longo failed to retain 50% of the existing first floor exterior walls on the Property. The Board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">[Tjhere can be no question given a plain reading of [the Policy] that the front wall does not count as an existing wall remaining in its entirety. And because we had very clear testimony from Ms. Scala-Demby that with regard to a given length of wall, all of it is in or all of it is out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">In this case, all of the front wall would be out in terms of counting towards the 50 percent. So what you\u2019re left with are the two side walls which are 25 foot 10 in length, and when you add that up, you have 51 foot 8 inches of lineal wall remaining, and with 125 lineal feet total of the original exterior walls, you wound up with 41 percent of the walls remaining and that doesn\u2019t meet the 50 percent test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-9\">So for that reason, I would recommend that we grant the appeal and I would commend DPS for the very thorough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>review that they did on being alerted to the possibility that there was a problem. However, it is clear from the lack of consistent testimony about how this 50 percent standard is applied that it would be a stretch for the Board to surmise that there is a consistent practice at DPS as far as interpreting [the Policy], which leaves us with interpreting the clear language or the plain language, I should say, of the regulation which requires that at least 50 percent of the existing first floor exterior walls in their entirety, which was clearly, and I think the structural integrity measure is important there, but not necessarily dispositive, measured in linear feet and comprising the footprint of the existing building and must remain as exterior walls. I think, in fact, that\u2019s a pretty clear standard and applying that standard, it is also clear that the front wall, none of it remains as an exterior wall.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">On October 30, 2007, the Board of Appeals issued a written opinion setting forth its factual findings and conclusions of law. The Board made the following factual findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">1. The Property, known as 10234 Parkwood Drive in Kensington, is an R-60 zoned parcel identified as Lot ,18, Block 4 in the Parkwood subdivision. The size of the Property is approximately 8,803 square feet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">2. On June 9, 2006, Intervenor Jodi Longo applied to DPS for a building permit to construct a two-story addition at the subject Property. Building Permit No. 423918 was issued on August 2, 2006, for the requested addition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-7\">3. On October 9, 2006, the Appellant called DPS to complain about several aspects of the construction at the subject Property, alleging that the Intervenors had not properly displayed their building permit, that there was a port-a-porty on site which required permits, and that Intervenors needed to apply for a new construction permit (1) because it appeared that the addition was more than 100 percent larger than the footprint of the existing structure, and (2) because one of the two walls which needed to be maintained if the construction were to be permitted as an addition had come down and had visible studs. The Proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>ty was inspected on October 11, 2006 by DPS inspector Mark Nauman. Mr. Nauman issued a stop work order/notice of violation for non-compliance with the spirit of the zon[ing] code, noting that it appeared that the existing footprint had at least been doubled in size and that the existing structural exterior walls had been demolished more than 50 percent, not allowing them to be utilized as the intact exterior walls of the finished project. On October 13, 2006, the case was closed after the permit holder reached agreement with DPS\u2019 zoning office and complied with permit revisions. See Exhibit 6, page 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-4\">A second stop work order/notice of violation was issued November 2, 2006, following a complaint concerning the studs in the front wall and the overall square footage of the addition. This stop work order was lifted by DPS on November 6, 2006. See Exhibit 11 at page 6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">4. Building Permit No. 423918 was revised on October 12, 2006, to reflect the removal of the garage door and conversion of the proposed garage into a carport. This permit was again revised on November 6, 2006, as follows: \u201cRevision submitted for structural/to meet 100% code on 11/6/06 * * revising front wall of garage 11 sq ft.\u201d See Exhibit 16(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">5. The Appellant filed this appeal to the Board of Appeals on November 9, 2006, asserting that the stop work orders should not have been lifted, the October 12, 2006, and November 6, 2006, revisions to the Building Permit should not have been accepted, and that DPS should require the permit applicant (Intervenors) to reapply for a building permit as a new house and meet all associated requirements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The Board concluded that the renovations to the Property did not comply with the 50% Wall Retention Rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-8\">[The Policy] also requires that \u201c[a]t least 50 percent of the existing exterior first floor walls, in their entirety, (measured in linear feet) and comprising the footprint of the existing building\u201d must remain as exterior walls. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Board finds, as evidenced by consistent testimony from DPS zoning officials, that the wall on the right side of the house, between the garage and the first floor living space, is an exterior wall, should be treated as remaining in its entirety, and should be counted towards the 50 percent requirement in [the Policy]. Indeed, Ms. Scala-Demby testified that the right side wall of the house was considered exterior, despite the garage/carport, because it separated the conditioned living space of the house from the unconditioned space of the garage. She went on to explain that \u201cexterior wall\u201d in this sense means an exterior wall of the finished first floor of the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-4\">Similarly, the Board finds that unchallenged and consistent testimony and evidence of record indicates that the exterior wall on the left hand side of the house is remaining in its entirety, and should be counted towards the 50 percent requirement. In addition, the Board finds that the plans show and testimony indicates that the rear wall of the original house was incorporated as an interior wall of the renovated house, and could not be counted toward the 50 percent requirement. Given that the plans show that the front and rear walls of the existing, rectangular house were longer than the side walls, and given testimony which indicated that walls are counted in their entirety (they\u2019re either all in, or they\u2019re all out), the Board concludes that in order [to] meet the 50 percent wall retention requirement of [the Policy], the front wall would need to be found to remain in its entirety. See Exhibit 16(b) at page 8.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">Despite language which refers to existing walls remaining \u201cin their entirety\u201d in linear feet for purposes of [the Policy\u2019s] 50 percent requirement, DPS officials consistently testified that their interpretation of [the Policy] allows changes to the openings in the wall for windows and doors, and the Board accepts this as the policy of DPS. The Board finds that the record contains numerous photographs which show that the changes made to the front wall of the subject Property went beyond changing windows and doors, to the removal of large portions of this front wall in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>[sic] entirety. See Exhibit 18(a) at pages 34-36, and at page 38; Exhibits 19(a)-(c), and (e). Indeed, the Board finds that these pictures show that the original front wall, between the window on the left hand side of the house (as you face it from the road) and the front door, was completely removed. See Exhibit 19(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">(Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The Board went on to note that it was not apparent from the plans Ms. Longo submitted the extent of the planned demolition of the front wall.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">In reviewing the plans of record, the Board finds that the extent of this demolition was not clearly shown on and was not apparent from the constructions plans submitted with the original application, nor was it apparent from the plan revisions dated 10/12/06 or 11/05/06. Similarly, the Board finds that none of the plans on file clearly show the extent of existing front wall that is to remain, or that which will be newly constructed/rebuilt. See Exhibits 22, 24 and 30. Furthermore, the Board finds that a comparison of the plans for the existing house with the construction plans submitted does not reveal the full extent of the contemplated demolition. The Board finds that this lack of clarity in the plans could have caused a DPS official reviewing the plans to reasonably believe that incremental changes were being made to the window and door openings, and that the firebox was being demolished and filled in, and thus to conclude that the wall was being maintained as an exterior wall for the purposes of [the Policy]. See Exhibits 21, 22, 24, and 30. The Board finds that the extent of actual demolition to the front wall of the house (and the resultant extent of front wall remaining) was not apparent from any of the plans, and indeed was not apparent until the physical demolition took place on site. At that point, stop work orders were issued which called into question the extent of front wall retention for the purposes of compliance with [the Policy], The Board finds that, as shown by the photographs in the record, the demolition that occurred on site involved the removal of entire sections of wall\u2014not just the changing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>of windows and doors. As a result ... of this demolition\u2014 demolition which again was not obvious from any of the plans filed with this permit\u2014the Board finds that the front wall can no longer be counted as remaining in its entirety for purposes of the 50 percent wall retention requirement of [the Policy], Given the necessity that the front wall be counted as remaining if this construction were to be considered to meet the 50 percent wall retention requirement, as discussed above, the Board concludes that the stop work orders should not have been lifted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">The Board is not persuaded by testimony from the Intervenor\u2019s architect and DPS that the plans showed the changes made to the front wall, nor are they persuaded by DPS testimony that those changes should be considered an alteration of the wall, and thus that the wall should be considered to remain in its entirety and counted towards the 50 percent requirement. As noted above, the Board concludes, after reviewing the plans and plans revisions, that the extent of proposed demolition was not clear, that the actual demolition exceeded that allowed under [the Policy], and consequently that the stop work orders should not have been lifted. The burden in this case was on DPS to show that the stop work orders were correctly lifted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">The Board in this case is not persuaded that the stop work orders were correctly lifted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">(Footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">On November 29, 2007, Ms. Longo filed a Petition for Judicial Review in the circuit court, arguing, among other things, that the lifting of a stop work order and the revision of a building permit are not appealable decisions. Ms. Placek filed an \u201cAnswering Memorandum\u201d in opposition to Ms. Lon-go\u2019s memorandum. The County also filed an \u201cAnswering Memorandum,\u201d but, instead of supporting the decision reached by DPS in approving Ms. Longo\u2019s building permit, as it argued before the Board of Appeals, the County argued' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>before the circuit court that \u201cthe record supports the Board\u2019s findings and conclusions .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">On May 29, 2008, a hearing was held in the circuit court. On June 10, 2008, the circuit court reversed the decision of the Board of Appeals, concluding that \u201cthe Board lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal, because the lifting of stop work order and revisions to the permit are not appealable decisions under [MCC] 8-23.\u201d The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">Section 8-23 of the Code states: \u201c(a) Any person aggrieved by the issuance, denial, renewal, or revocation of a permit or any other decision or order of the Department under this Chapter may appeal to the County Board of Appeal within 30 days after the permit is issued, denied, renewed, or revoked, or the order or decision is issued.\u201d With respect to the lifting of a stop work order, the court found:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">While the <em>issuance </em>of a stop work order is an order under Chapter 8 and therefore appealable, a <em>lifting </em>of a stop work order is not, because it is not set forth in Chapter 8. While DPS may have the authority (although not proscribed by statute) to lift a stop work order, it is not a decision under this Chapter tha[t] can be appealed. Therefore, the Board did not have jurisdiction to hear Ms. Placek\u2019s appeal with respect to this issue under Section 8-23.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The court similarly found that a revision to a building permit did not constitute \u201cany other decision or order\u201d that could be appealed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-8\">Similarly, the revisions to the building permit is [sic] not an appealable decision under Section 8-23. The Court finds that the Board erred in denying the Petitioners\u2019 Motion for Summary Disposition. In <em>National Institutes of Health Federal Credit Union v. Hawk, </em>an agency issued a use and occupancy permit. No appeal was filed within 30 days thereafter. Approximately six months later, a resident sent a letter to the agency requesting that the permit be revoked. The agency responded with a letter denying that request. The resident appealed even though the limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>period expired. The Court of Special Appeals found that an agency\u2019s written denial to revoke an original use and occupancy permit was not an appealable \u201cdecision.\u201d The jurisdiction of the County Board over the original permit was not revived by the agency\u2019s refusal to revoke the permit. It was, at most, a re-affirmation of the issuance of the original permit. Therefore, the <em>Haivk </em>court concluded that the Board lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter and it should have been dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-5\">Although the facts in <em>Hawk </em>do not exactly mirror the facts in this case, the appeal provisions in the County Code and Zoning Ordinance dealing with administrative proceedings in <em>Hawk </em>are similar to the appeal provisions under Code 8-28. The <em>Hawk </em>court states that the appeal provisions \u201cclearly relate in their respective procedure to a point in time when the finality of the review process is conceded and all opportunities to appeal from administrative decisions and orders are clearly specified within prescribed procedures and time limitations.\u201d It can hardly be said that revising a building permit constitutes a point in time when the finality of the review process is established. Revisions to permits can occur frequently. In fact, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>there were two revisions to the building permit. If revisions to permits were appealable decisions, then the limitations period to appeal could constantly be revived upon multiple permit revisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">The <em>Hawk </em>court further explains that \u201c[t]he specific remedy for an alleged improper issuance of a use and occupancy certificate ... is the filing of an appeal with the County Board within thirty days after the certificate has been issued.\u201d Thus, Ms. Placek should have filed her appeal within 30 days of the issuance of the original permit, which was on August 2, 2006, and not after any subsequent revisions. The Board lacked jurisdiction to hear this matter. Because this matter was resolved on jurisdictional grounds, the Court does not address the remaining issues on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>For the reasons set forth herein, the Board\u2019s decision shall be REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">(Footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Ms. Placek and the County noted timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">On appeal from a decision of an administrative agency, we review the final decision of the agency, rather than the decision of the circuit court. <em>See People\u2019s Counsel for Balt.

Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>8-23(a) confers jurisdiction on the Board to hear appeals from decisions or orders issued by DPS under Chapter 8 of the MCC:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-4\">Any person aggrieved by the issuance, denial, renewal, or revocation of a permit or any other decision or order of the Department [of Permitting Services] under this Chapter may appeal to the County Board of Appeals within 30 days after the permit is issued, denied, renewed, or revoked, or the order or decision is issued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Here, the initial building permit was issued on August 2, 2006. No appeal was taken within 30 days after issuance of the permit. After construction began, however, Ms. Placek complained to DPS regarding permit violations. Ms. Placek alleged, among other things, that the building, as constructed, did not retain two walls as required for an addition. DPS investigated the complaint, initially determined that it potentially had merit, and issued a stop work order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After discussions with Ms. Longo, discussions with the County Attorney, and the submission of a revised site plan, DPS lifted the stop work order.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Ms. Placek argues that the decision of DPS to lift the stop work order is an appealable decision or order under MCC \u00a7 8-23(a). She additionally argues that the subsequent decision by DPS to issue a revised building permit was an appealable event under \u00a7 8-23(a). She contends that, because an appeal was noted within 30 days of these events, the circuit court erred in holding that the Board did not have jurisdiction to entertain her appeal. The County, although not agreeing that the revisions to the building permit constituted an appeal-able event, agrees with Ms. Placek that the Board had \u201cjuris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>diction to review the decisions made by DPS to lift the stop work orders in this case.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Ms. Longo, on the other hand, contends that the circuit court properly found that the Board of Appeals did not have jurisdiction to consider Ms. Placek\u2019s appeal. She argues that, in order to challenge the permit, Ms. Placek was obligated to file an appeal within 30 days after DPS issued the initial building permit, which Ms. Placek did not do. Ms. Longo argues that neither the revisions to the building permit nor the lifting of the stop work order constituted a \u201cdecision or order\u201d from which an appeal could be noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The caselaw on this issue is sparse. We begin our analysis by discussing <em>Nat\u2019l Inst. of Health Fed. Credit Union v. Hawk, </em>47 Md.App. 189, 422 A.2d 55 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>289 Md. 738 (1981), the sole case relied upon by the circuit court in its finding that the Board did not have jurisdiction to hear Ms. Placek\u2019s appeal. In <em>Hawk, </em>a use and occupancy permit was issued on November 18, 1977. <em>Id. </em>at 192, 422 A.2d 55. No timely appeal was taken from that action. <em>Id. </em>After the time to appeal the issuance of the permit expired, several area residents wrote letters to the County requesting that the County suspend the use and occupancy permit and schedule a show cause hearing to \u201cdetermine the validity\u201d of the permit. <em>Id. </em>at 195, 422 A.2d 55. On July 27, 1978, the Director of the Department of Environmental Protection sent a letter denying the requests. <em>Id. </em>at 193, 195, 422 A.2d 55. This denial was appealed several days later. <em>Id. </em>at 193, 422 A.2d 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">This Court concluded that the Board did not have jurisdiction to consider the appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">The County Board should not have heard these appeals and should not have addressed the Director\u2019s issuance of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>permit on November 18, 1977, because the thirty-day time limit set forth in Section 2-112(a)(3) of the Montgomery County Code had already passed before the appeals were filed on August 9 and August 10, 1978. The appellees failed to comply with the procedure for timely appeal, and thus lost their privilege to challenge the initial permit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 195, 422 A.2d 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">This Court quoted with approval the hearing examiner\u2019s conclusion that the letter from the Director was \u201cnot a final administrative decision, order or determination,\u201d but was \u201cat most a reiteration or reaffirmation of the final administrative decision or order\u201d granting the original permit. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">If this were not the case an inequitable, if not chaotic, condition would exist. All that an appellant would be required to do to preserve a continuing right of appeal would be to maintain a continuing stream of correspondence, dialogue, and requests of the nature pursued by the appellants herein with appropriate departmental authorities even on the most minute issues of contention with the ability to pursue a myriad of appeals ad infinitum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-7\"><em>Id. </em>This Court held that \u201can administrative decision concerning reconsideration of zoning is not an appealable final order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196, 422 A.2d 55. Thus, the Court held, the County Board did not have jurisdiction to hear the case. <em>Id. </em>at 197, 422 A.2d 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Similarly, in <em>United Parcel Serv. v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 573, 650 A.2d 226 (1994), after a building permit was issued, and after commencement of construction, a citizen wrote a letter to the Director of the Office of Planning and Zoning lodging an objection to the manner in which the building would be used. The zoning commissioner responded with a letter explaining that the proposed use, warehousing, was a permitted use without a special exception. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals stated that the January 1987 letter \u201cdid not grant, deny, decide, or order anything.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585, 650 A.2d 226. Rather, the letter \u201csimply explained and defended the 1986 decision approving the application for a building permit.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Accordingly, the Court held that the letter was not an \u201c \u2018approval\u2019 or \u2018decision\u2019 appealable to the Board of Appeals.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">We find <em>Hawk </em>and <em>United Parcel Service </em>to be distinguishable from the present case. Here, the lifting of the stop work order was not merely a reaffirmation of the prior issuance of a building permit. Rather, as the Board found, it was a \u201cdecision\u201d by DPS based on new factual information presented and submission of a revised building permit application.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Ms. Placek\u2019s complaint to DPS was not with respect to the initial building permit. It was a complaint that the building, as it was being constructed, did not meet the requirements to qualify as an addition. Mr. Nauman, who investigated the complaint, agreed that, based on the extent to which the front wall had been demolished, the construction to the house did not qualify as an addition. He issued a stop work order and told Ms. Longo that the current permit would be voided, and she would need to apply for a new house permit. He then informed Mr. Bell and Ms. Scala-Demby about the situation because they would make the final determination about what would happen.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">In determining whether to lift the stop work order, DPS was not merely reconsidering whether its initial decision to issue the building permit was correct. Rather, it was assessing whether the building, as constructed, met the requirements for an addition. The Board of Appeals made a factual finding that the extent of the demolition to the front wall was not clearly shown on the construction plans submitted by Ms. Longo to DPS. Thus, when DPS received a complaint that the building, as constructed, did not meet the requirements for an addition, and after an investigation resulted in a preliminary determination that there was some validity to the complaint, DPS had to make a decision whether the extent of the actual demolition to the front wall, to a greater extent than shown on the construction plans, satisfied the 50% Wall Retention Rule. These new facts were significant enough that Mr. Bell, a Permitting Specialist II with DPS, met with the County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Attorney to discuss the issue. At that meeting, \u201cit was then decided that the front wall was fine, it was within policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">Thus, DPS\u2019s decision to lift the stop work order was not \u201ca reiteration or reaffirmation\u201d of its initial decision to issue the permit, as in <em>Hawk, </em>47 Md.App. at 195, 422 A.2d 55. Rather, it was a decision made in response to new facts, i.e., demolition to the front wall that was not depicted clearly in the plans that DPS relied upon in issuing the permit. After meeting with the County Attorney, DPS determined that the building, as constructed, met the criteria for an addition. Accordingly, the County made the decision that the permit issued would not be voided, the stop work order would be lifted, and construction would be allowed to proceed. Under these circumstances, we hold that the decision to lift the stop work order was an appealable decision or order pursuant to \u00a7 8-23(a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Accordingly, the circuit court erred in concluding that the Board did not have jurisdiction to consider Ms. Placek\u2019s appeal. Therefore, we will proceed to address the other preliminary procedural issues raised by Ms. Longo, and then we will address the Board\u2019s decision on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The County\u2019s Participation in this Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Ms. Longo points out that the Office of the County Attorney for Montgomery County, acting on behalf of DPS, argued before the Board that the Board had no jurisdiction to consider Ms. Placek\u2019s appeal. This, of course, is the opposite of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>what the County is arguing in this Court. Ms. Longo argues that the County \u201cmay not switch sides\u201d and that the County Attorney may not advocate \u201con appeal a position exactly opposite to the position it advocated in the administrative proceeding.\u201d Ms. Longo argues that the County has \u201clost the right to appeal the decision of the Circuit Court which in effect upheld the position of the Department of Permitting Services, the same position advocated by the Office of the County Attorney in the administrative hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">The County does not dispute that, acting on behalf of DPS, it took a different position before the Board than it is taking on appeal. It argues, however, that its position in the case \u201cis consistent with its responsibility as legal advisor to the various components of County government and as the exclusive entity responsible for representing the County\u2019s interests in all legal actions.\u201d It contends that the County \u201cmay participate in a matter on judicial review when the interests of the government support the participation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">We recognize that, because the Office of the County Attorney represents all departments of the County, it is inevitable that situations may arise wherein different attorneys, advising different departments and agencies, may take inconsistent positions. Although we are inclined to agree with the County that this does not preclude the County from participating in a case on appeal, it is not necessary for us to decide this issue in this case. \u201cIt is a settled principle of Maryland law that \u2018where there exists a party having standing to bring an action ... we shall not ordinarily inquire as to whether another party on the same side also has standing.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Friends of the Ridge v. Balt. Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>120 Md.App. 444, 469 n. 27, 707 A.2d 866 (1998) (quoting <em>Sugarloaf Citizens\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. Dep\u2019t of the Env\u2019t, </em>344 Md. 271, 297, 686 A.2d 605 (1996)), <em>vacated in part on other grounds, </em>352 Md. 645, 724 A.2d 34 (1999). Here, Montgomery County is not the only appellant in this case. Ms. Placek, who, as discussed <em>infra, </em>is an aggrieved party with standing to bring an appeal, has also appealed the judgment of the circuit court. Ms. Placek raises the same issues as the County. Thus, it is not necessary to resolve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>question whether Montgomery County is precluded from advancing the arguments it makes on appeal; we will address the issues as raised by Ms. Placek, regardless of the resolution of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Ms. Placek\u2019s Standing to Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Ms. Longo next argues that the Board erred in finding that Ms. Placek had standing to appeal the decision of DPS. Specifically, she argues that \u201cAppellant Placek had no diseernable interest\u201d in the Property \u201cthat was in any way different from that of any member of the general public who might see the structure on the subject Property or who might walk by it,\u201d and, therefore, Ms. Placek was not aggrieved by the permit revision or the rescission of the stop work order. Ms. Placek counters that the Board correctly found that she had standing, and \u201c[Ms. Longo] has ignored the Board\u2019s stated basis for finding\u201d standing as well as the \u201cmultiple reasons presented in the record.\u201d We agree with Ms. Placek, and we hold that Ms. Placek has standing to bring this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Section 8-23 provides that \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved ... may appeal to the County Board of Appeals....\u201d Generally, a person is deemed to be aggrieved if he or she \u201ccan demonstrate that the land use decision will adversely affect his, her, or its interest, and that such interest is personal or specific, and not shared by the general public.\u201d <em>120 W. Fayette St., LLLP v. Mayor of Balt., </em>407 Md. 253, 271, 964 A.2d 662 (2009). With respect to the location of two properties, \u201c[a]n adjoining, confronting or nearby property owner is deemed, <em>prima facie, </em>to be specially damaged and, therefore, a person aggrieved.\u201d <em>Bryniarski v. Montgomery County Bd. of Appeals, </em>247 Md. 137, 145, 230 A.2d 289 (1967). <em>Accord Chatham, Corp. v. Beltram, </em>252 Md. 578, 584, 251 A.2d 1 (1969) (no clear error in finding that owners of homes in close proximity to the reclassified area had standing to sue); <em>Comm, for Responsible Dev. on 25th St. v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt., </em>137 Md.App. 60, 86, 767 A.2d 906 (2001) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>(\u201cGenerally, to be considered an aggrieved party, the complaining property owner must be in \u2018sight or sound\u2019 range of the property that is the subject of his complaint.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">In contrast, \u201c[a] person whose property is far removed from the subject property ordinarily will not be considered a person aggrieved.\u201d <em>Bryniarski, </em>247 Md. at 145, 230 A.2d 289. <em>Accord White v. Major Realty, Inc., </em>251 Md. 63, 64, 246 A.2d 249 (1968) (party who lived mile from property that was being rezoned was not aggrieved); <em>Shore Acres Improv. Ass\u2019n v. Anne Arundel County Bd. of Appeals, </em>251 Md. 310, 313, 318, 247 A.2d 402 (1968) (owner of land 3,760 \u201cfeet in a straight line from the nearest point of Baldwin\u2019s property\u201d and approximately 9,400 \u201cfeet by road from the nearest point of Baldwin\u2019s land\u201d was not aggrieved in manner different than public).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Here, the Board concluded that Ms. Placek was \u201caggrieved and had standing to pursue this appeal, based on where she lives.\u201d The Board explained its reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">She states that she lives six houses, or approximately 250 feet, from the subject Property, that she walks and drives by it every day, and that she sees the back of it from Rock Creek Park bike trail.... Appellant states that contrary to the assertions of the Intervenor and County, she does live within sight or sound of the subject Property, since she can see the back of the subject house from her family room windows, decks and back yard, due to the extent of the projection of the new construction toward the rear of the Property. Appellant further states that the new construction will add to impermeable surface area, and cause additional runoff to flow from the higher elevation of the subject Property down the street to the storm drain in front of her house, which she states is located at the lowest point directly downhill from the subject Property. In addition she states that a storm drain channel runs parallel to her house, and that part of her house is in a flood plain which \u25a0will be affected by the runoff from the development of the subject Property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>The Board\u2019s conclusion that Ms. Placek had standing to appeal was based on her status as a nearby property owner and the impact to her home from the runoff of the Property. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The Board\u2019s Decision on the Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">We turn next to the issue whether there was substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s decision that the house, as constructed, did not qualify as an addition and that DPS erred in lifting the stop work order. As indicated, we do not substitute our judgment for the expertise of the agency or second-guess the agency\u2019s decision where there is substantial evidence to support the agency\u2019s decision. <em>See Surina, </em>400 Md. at 681, 929 A.2d 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The Board\u2019s decision that the construction exceeded that permitted as an addition was based on the 50% Wall Retention Rule. This rule authorizes changes to an existing building as an addition, provided that \u201c[a]t least 50% of the existing first floor exterior walls, in their entirety, (measured in linear feet) and comprising the footprint of the existing building [ ] must remain as exterior walls.\u201d On this issue, the Board found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">Despite language which refers to existing walls remaining \u201cin their entirety\u201d in linear feet for purposes of [the Policy\u2019s] 50 percent requirement, DPS officials consistently testified that their interpretation of [the Policy] allows changes to the openings in the wall for windows and doors, and the Board accepts this as the policy of DPS. The Board finds that the record contains numerous photographs which show that the changes made to the front wall of the subject Property went beyond changing windows and doors, to the removal of large portions of this front wall in their [sic] entirety. See Exhibit 18(a) at pages 34-36, and at page 38; Exhibits 19(a)-(c), and (e). Indeed, the Board finds that these pictures show that the original front wall, between the window on the left hand side of the house (as you face it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>from the road) and the front door, was completely removed. See Exhibit 19(b).... As a result of the extent of this demolition\u2014demolition which again was not obvious from any of the plans filed with this permit\u2014the Board finds that the front wall can no longer be counted as remaining in its entirety for purposes of the 50 percent wall retention requirement of [the Policy]. Given the necessity that the front wall be counted as remaining if this construction were to be considered to meet the 50 percent wall retention requirement, as discussed above, the Board concludes that the stop work orders should not have been lifted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Ms. Longo argues that the Board erred in concluding that the front wall did not count towards the 50% Wall Retention Rule. She contends that the purpose of the policy is \u201cto require that the length of an exterior wall must remain,\u201d and the front wall, although altered, met that requirement. She argues that the Board sought to \u201cinfuse into\u201d the policy a requirement of \u201cstructural \u2018adequacy,\u2019 \u201d but there is no such requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Ms. Placek counters that the Board\u2019s decision should be affirmed because the \u201cplain language of the 50 percent exteri- or wall requirement strongly states that the wall must remain \u2018in its entirety\u2019 and the Board could have concluded based on its review of the photographs that it did not.\u201d Similarly, the County argues that, \u201c[n]ot only did the record contain substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s decision, but the Board properly applied the DPS interpretation policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Here, the Board concluded that, once the chimney was removed from the front wall of the house, the wall did not remain in its entirety, and, therefore, the construction violated the 50% Wall Retention requirement for an addition. Mr. Nauman\u2019s testimony supported this finding. Mr. Nauman testified that, at the time he inspected the Property, the wall did not remain in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">[A] substantial portion of the front wall had been removed, and according to the wording of the regulation, the wall was supposed to remain in tact [sic] and be utilized in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>entirety as a finished exterior wall. And obviously, that was not able to take place because of the overall extent of the demolition of the wall. It had been a structural wall. It was no longer capable of being a structural wall, and it would require substantial rebuilding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">Photographs were introduced into evidence, which documented the state of the wall at the time of Mr. Nauman\u2019s inspection, and which supported the Board\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Based on this evidence, and the deference afforded to the Board in such matters, we conclude that there was substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding that the front wall did not remain \u201cin its entirety\u201d when \u201centire sections of [the] wall\u201d were removed. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the circuit court, and we remand the case to that court to affirm the decision of the Board of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED. CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO AFFIRM THE DECISION OF THE BOARD OF APPEALS FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-8\">. According to the attorney for the County who appeared before the Board, if Ms. Longo applied for a permit for new construction, she would be required to participate in an additional level of zoning review with the Montgomery County Department of Park and Planning. There might be additional requirements imposed, including installation of a sprinkler system, but the record is not clear on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b55-9\">. Throughout this opinion, we refer to the different attorneys representing Montgomery County as the \u201cCounty Attorney,\" recognizing that, in most instances, the attorney is an Assistant County Attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b56-10\">. The transcripts from this preliminary hearing were not included in the record.

As indicated, two stop work orders were issued and subsequently lifted. The first stop work order addressed the 50% Wall Retention Rule.

Because we find that the lifting of the stop work order was an appealable decision in this case, giving the Board jurisdiction to hear the case, we need not address whether the issuance of a revised building permit is an appealable decision or order. We note that, in <em>Mendelson v. Dist. of Columbia Bd. of Zoning Adjustment, 645 </em>A.2d 1090, 1093-94 (D.C.1994), the District of Columbia Court of Appeals held that the issuance of a revised building permit was an appealable \"decision,\u201d at least with respect to the revisions approved.
