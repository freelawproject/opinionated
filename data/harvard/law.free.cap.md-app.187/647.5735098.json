We conclude that it would be contrary to the fundamental policy of this State, as embodied in Article 2 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and in <em>Pope v. State, </em>284 Md. 309, 396 A.2d 1054 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>(1979), for a Maryland court to apply a choice-of-law provision that conflicts with an interpretation of federal law by the State\u2019s highest court. For this reason and others set forth below, we must reverse the decision of the Circuit Court for St. Mary\u2019s County in this case and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">This question arises in litigation of humble origin. Dissatisfied with the Gateway computer he purchased at Best Buy, appellant Barrington D. Henry, <em>pro se, </em>filed suit in December 2007 in the circuit court. Naming appellees Gateway, Inc. and Best Buy Co., Inc. as defendants, Henry\u2019s four-count <em>pro se </em>complaint asserted three state law claims: 1) breach of express warranty; 2) breach of implied warranty; 3) violation of the Maryland Consumer Protection law, Md.Code (1975, 2005 Repl. Vol.), Commercial Law Article, \u00a7\u00a7 13-101 <em>et seq., </em>and one federal claim, a violation on the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (MMWA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301 <em>et seq. </em>Each count sought a judgment of $377.98, which was the computer\u2019s purchase price, and $30,000 in consequential damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Appellees filed a Motion to Dismiss with Prejudice and to Compel Arbitration, accompanied by exhibits and two affidavits. Among other things, they contended that the One Year Limited Warranty Agreement they said Henry received when he purchased the computer was governed by South Dakota law and required him to arbitrate his dispute. This included his federal MMWA claim, which, they said, was subject to arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Henry opposed the motion and in a response, accompanied by documentary materials and his own affidavit, argued that the MMWA prevailed over the FAA and that he was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>compelled to arbitrate his federal claim. He also contended that the arbitration provision in the Limited Warranty was a contract of adhesion, fraudulently induced, unconscionable, and the product of misrepresentation, and that the warranty accompanying the computer he purchased did not contain an arbitration provision. In his opposition, appellant also contended that it would be premature to grant appellee\u2019s motion before he obtained discovery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a supplementary opposition filed on the eve of the motions hearing, Henry asked the court to order discovery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In their April 2008 response to appellant\u2019s opposition, appellees mentioned, for the first time, the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Koons Ford of Baltimore, Inc. v. Lobach, </em>398 Md. 38, 919 A.2d 722 (2007), which held that the MMWA supersedes the FAA, so that a litigant advancing a federal warranty claim could not be forced to resolve his or her claim through binding arbitration. However, appellees asserted that the <em>Koons Ford </em>case was distinguishable and not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">On April 18, 2008, the circuit court held a hearing on the motion, and appellant appeared to argue his own case and to respond to questions from the court. He did not mention the discovery issue. After argument, the circuit court judge indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>cated that she was \u201cgoing to grant the motion to dismiss in light of the arbitration clause.\u201d With apparent reference to Henry\u2019s claims of fraud, unconscionability, and other challenges to the arbitration agreement, the circuit court judge said: \u201cI don\u2019t find your allegations credible in light of the [Gateway] affidavits and the course of conduct that is ... the way of doing business that Gateway has.\u201d A week later, the court granted the appellees\u2019 motion to compel arbitration and dismissed Henry\u2019s claims with prejudice. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">QUESTIONS PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">In our view, the 11 questions appellant has raised in this appeal<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> can be reduced to two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>1) Did the circuit court erred in rejecting appellant\u2019s state law defenses to the motion to compel arbitration without affording him a reasonable opportunity to engage in discovery? and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-5\">2) Did the circuit court erred in finding that appellant\u2019s federal MMWA claim was required to be submitted to arbitration?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">We answer \u201cyes\u201d to both questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">FACTS<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">In August of 2006, Henry purchased a Gateway computer from Best Buy. Gateway assembles and sells computers under both the Gateway and eMachines names through \u201cresellers\u201d like Best Buy. These computers are sold subject to the terms of a Gateway One Year Limited Warranty Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d), with the computers essentially nonfunctional without accepting the terms of the Agreement. A copy of this Agreement is placed in a conspicuous location inside of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>computer\u2019s sealed box, so that the customer sees the Agreement when unpacking the box.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The Agreement between appellant and Gateway contained the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">THIS AGREEMENT APPLIES TO YOU UNLESS YOU NOTIFY GATEWAY IN WRITING THAT YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT WITHIN 15 DAYS AFTER YOU RECEIVE THIS AGREEMENT AND YOU RETURN YOUR PRODUCT OR CANCEL SERVICES UNDER EITHER GATEWAY\u2019S OR THE RESELLER\u2019S RETURN POLICY, AS APPLICABLE. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A DISPUTE RESOLUTION CLAUSE. PLEASE SEE SECTION 7 BELOW.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">The Agreement also contained the following \u201cDISPUTE RESOLUTION CLAUSE:\u2019\u2019</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-9\">7. DISPUTE RESOLUTION. You and Gateway agree that any Dispute between You and Gateway will be resolved exclusively and finally by arbitration administered by the National Arbitration Forum (NAF) ... The arbitration shall be held at any reasonable location near your residence by .. . whichever method of presentation you choose. If you prevail in the arbitration of any Dispute with Gateway, Gateway will reimburse you for the fees paid to the NAF in connection with the arbitration.... You understand that, in the absence of this provision, you would have had a right to litigate disputes through a court .. . and that you have expressly and knowingly waived those rights and agreed to resolve any Disputes through binding arbitration. This arbitration provision shall be governed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Section 1, <em>et seq.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Av2\">(Emphasis in original.).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Also set forth in bold type in the agreement was the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY SALES THEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA, WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS RULES.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">A user purchasing an eMachine computer, who turns on the computer, is confronted with a series of clickable set-up screens that give the user the option of either accepting or rejecting two agreements. One of the required clickable screens contains an End User License Agreement for the Microsoft Windows operating system software and the Gateway One Year Limited Warranty Agreement, both of which must be accepted before the customer can use the computer. If a customer selects the \u201cNo, I don\u2019t accept\u201d option on the clickable screen, the computer will not operate, and the customer can return the computer for a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">On July 26, 2007, appellant contacted Gateway Technical Support for assistance because the computer he purchased was freezing up. The technical support representative spent several hours on the phone with Henry, but was unable to fix the problem. Appellant contacted technical support again on July 29, 2007, but again, after several hours on the phone, the representative was unable to resolve the problem. The representative told appellant that his computer had a defective piece of hardware, and advised appellant to take his computer to Best Buy for additional trouble-shooting and repair. On July 30, 2007, Henry took his computer to Best Buy, where an employee determined that the computer was defective and advised him to contact Gateway. Best Buy also told him that if it completed any repairs, then appellant would have to pay all costs of those repairs and that Best Buy would not replace the product or refund the purchase price.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>On August 28, 2007, while at Best Buy, Henry contacted Gateway again. According to appellant, Gateway advised him that the computer was still under warranty. He then requested that Gateway either replace the computer with a comparable product or refund the purchase price. Appellant claimed that Gateway refused to replace the computer or issue him a refund. This lawsuit followed. Additional facts will be discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Adn\">1. Preliminary Matters</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Appellees asserted, and the circuit court obviously agreed, that the arbitration requirement was governed by federal law, <em>viz. </em>the FAA. Although the Agreement recited that it was governed by the FAA, it did not (as is commonly the case) state that the transaction involved interstate commerce. <em>See Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, </em>546 U.S. 440, 442-43, 126 S.Ct. 1204, 163 L.Ed.2d 1038 (2006); <em>Koons Ford, supra, </em>398 Md. at 41, 919 A.2d 722. Nevertheless, in light of the broad reach of the FAA, which covers arbitration agreements in contracts evidencing a transaction \u201cinvolving interstate commerce,\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-2; <em>Citizens Bank v. Alafabco, Inc., </em>539 U.S. 52, 56, 123 S.Ct. 2037, 156 L.Ed.2d 46 (2003), and the fact that appellee has not challenged the Agreement on this ground, we conclude that the FAA would apply to this transaction, unless otherwise precluded by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">In addition, appellant has not challenged the circuit court decision on the ground that it did not stay his claims under 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 3. Although the issue of whether a court should stay rather than dismiss claims subject to arbitration under the FAA has divided federal courts, <em>see Lloyd v. HOVENSA, LLC, </em>369 F.3d 263, 268-69 (3rd Cir.2004), there is authority that a dismissal with prejudice is permissible when all of the issues presented in the lawsuit are arbitrable. <em>See Choice Hotels Int\u2019l. Inc. v. BSR Tropicana Resort, Inc., </em>252 F.3d 707, 709-10 (4th Cir.2001); <em>Green v. Ameritech Corp., </em>200 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>967, 973 (6th Cir.2000). That appears to be what the circuit court found here. Because appellant does not raise the issue here, we express no view on the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">2. Invalidity of Arbitration Agreement on State Law Grounds</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The FAA provides that written arbitration agreements \u201cshall be validly irrevocable and enforceable, save upon grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Thus, generally available contract defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability, may be asserted in court to invalidate an arbitration agreement. <em>Shearson/Am. Express Inc. v. McMahon, </em>482 U.S. 220, 226, 107 S.Ct. 2332, 96 L.Ed.2d 185 (1987). A court may also consider \u201cissues relating to the making and performance of the agreement to arbitrate,\u201d <em>Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co., </em>388 U.S. 395, 404, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 18 L.Ed.2d 1270 (1967).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The burden of demonstrating these defenses is on the party opposing arbitration, and these issues are often fact-intensive. <em>See, e.g., Green Tree Fin. Corporation-Alabama v. Randolph, </em>531 U.S. 79, 92, 121 S.Ct. 513, 148 L.Ed.2d 373 (2000); <em>Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc., </em>490 U.S. 477, 483-84, 109 S.Ct. 1917, 104 L.Ed.2d 526 (1989).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Here, there was no evidentiary hearing on Henry\u2019s defenses and no discovery\u2014merely a motion to dismiss and an opposition, both accompanied by affidavits and exhibits. Because the circuit court obviously considered some of those evidentiary materials, <em>see </em>pp. 651-53, 979 A.2d 289-90, Maryland Rule 2-322(c) was triggered. This rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-5\">If, on a motion to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 2-501, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 2-501.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The requirements of Maryland Rule 3-222(c) were the subject of a recent decision of the Court of Appeals, <em>120 W. Fayette St., LLLP v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>407 Md. 253, 964 A.2d 662 (2009). There, the Court emphasized that when a court considers matters outside of the pleadings, and thus converts a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment, the court must give the plaintiff a reasonable opportunity to present \u201cadditional\u201d pertinent material, <em>id. </em>at 263, 964 A.2d 662, and must consider the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, not the moving party. <em>Id. </em>at 264, 964 A.2d 662. Relying on federal authorities interpreting the similar requirement of Rule 12(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court said the circuit court judge erred as a matter of law when he considered matters outside the pleadings and failed to provide the plaintiff the opportunity to employ discovery in order to counter facts in the defendant\u2019s affidavit or to establish a factual basis for his actions against the defendant. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>This is exactly what happened here. Although not labeled a motion to dismiss \u201cfor failure to state a claim,\u201d the appellees\u2019 motion clearly contemplated dismissal on the legal ground that the claims were subject to arbitration. The court expressly relied on appellees\u2019 affidavit and exhibits.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Yet appellant had no notice that this would transform the appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment. He may have submitted his own affidavits and exhibits in response to those initially filed by appellees. However, that does not make the requirements of Md. Rule 2-322(c) inapplicable. <em>See Batson v. Powell, </em>912 F.Supp. 565, 571 (D.D.C.1996)(applying the mandatory conversion requirements of F.R. Civ. Proc. 12(b) when both parties submitted material outside the pleadings.). He did not waive his requests for discovery. Even though he may not have mentioned the issue at the motions hearing, it was preserved in two pretrial filings, including a written motion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, Rule 2-322(a) imposes a mandatory duty on the circuit court judge, not the parties, to give the litigants a reasonable opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>present all materials, including the right to discovery. We conclude that the dictates of Rule 2-322(c) were not followed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Therefore, the dismissal of appellant\u2019s state law claims must be reversed, along with the order mandating such claims to arbitration.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">3. Arbitrability of the Federal MMWA Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The parties have devoted most of their attention on this appeal to appellant\u2019s federal claim under the MMWA. Appellant argues that the MMWA supersedes the FAA and thus, he cannot be compelled to arbitrate his federal claim. He finds support in the decision of the Court of Appeals of Maryland in <em>Koons Ford, supra, </em>as well as decisions of two U.S. District courts. <em>See </em>Shannon Karla, <em>Recent Development: Koons Ford of Baltimore, Inc. v. Lobach, </em>23 Ohio St. J. on Disp. Resol. 421 n. 2 (2008) (collecting cases). Appellees point to decisions of two federal circuit courts, three U.S. district courts, and four state appellate courts holding that the FAA prevails over the MMWA. <em>Id. </em>In addition, they contend that because Henry\u2019s agreement with Gateway contains a choice-of-law clause that makes the law of South Dakota <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>controlling, that State would adopt the view taken by a majority of federal courts, rather than Maryland\u2019s, and compel appellant to arbitrate his MMWA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">At the outset, we assume, without deciding, that when the agreement in question provided that it was to be governed by the \u201claws\u201d of South Dakota, it intended to include interpretations of federal law by the courts of that state. <em>See </em>the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, \u00a7 187(1) and \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The parties have not directed us to any South Dakota case on the issue of whether the MMWA does or does not supersede the FAA, nor to any decision of any federal court within the Eighth federal circuit (which includes South Dakota) that speaks to this question. Moreover, our search has turned up no such case. And obviously there is no Supreme Court decision on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Appellees, however, rely on a 1994 decision of the Supreme Court of South Dakota, <em>St. Cloud v. Leapley, </em>521 N.W.2d 118 (S.D.1994), indicating that it is \u201cbound\u201d by decisions of the federal appellate or district courts interpreting federal statutes. <em>Id. </em>at 122-23. In that case, the South Dakota appellate court adhered to a decision of the U.S. District Court for the District of South Dakota on the issue of who was an \u201cIndian\u201d for purposes of federal criminal jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>Appellees contend that on the basis of <em>St. Cloud, </em>South Dakota\u2019s high court would simply do a headcount of the federal courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>considering the MMWA/FAA issue and side with the majority.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, in a later decision, <em>State v. Greger, </em>559 N.W.2d 854, 859, n. 5 (S.D.1997), another case involving jurisdiction over Indians in criminal cases, the South Dakota Supreme Court said: \u201c[W]e do not consider ourselves bound by a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit interpreting federal law on the question.\u201d The <em>Greger </em>Court pointed to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>ASARCO Inc. v. Kadish, </em>490 U.S. 605, 620, 109 S.Ct. 2037, 104 L.Ed.2d 696 (1989), for the proposition that state courts can render binding-judgments over issues of federal law \u201cthat rest on their own interpretations of federal law.\u201d 559 N.W.2d at 859, n. 5. <em>St. Cloud </em>was relegated to a <em>\u201cbut </em>see\u201d reference after <em>ASARCO.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Maryland caselaw reflects the views of the majority of state courts on this question and echoes <em>Greger. </em>In <em>Pope v. State, </em>284 Md. 309, 320, 396 A.2d 1054 (1979), the Court of Appeals citing Article 2 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, said that \u201cunlike decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, decisions of federal circuit courts of appeals construing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>the federal constitution and acts of the Congress pursuant thereto, are not binding upon us.\u201d <em>See also Degren v. State, </em>352 Md. 400, 414, n. 8, 722 A.2d 887 (1999); <em>Lone v. Montgomery County, </em>85 Md.App. 477, 494, 584 A.2d 142 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Even if <em>Greger </em>and <em>Pope </em>did not appear to be consistent in their view of the impact of federal caselaw,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> there is an overriding reason why the choice-of-law clause in the Gateway Agreement cannot have the effect of precluding a Maryland court from applying the decision of our State\u2019s highest court in <em>Koons Ford. </em>It would be contrary to a \u201cfundamental policy\u201d of this State within the meaning of \u00a7 187(2)(b) of the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, <em>viz., </em>the requirements of Article 2 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and of <em>Pope v. State, supra, </em>that \u201cthe Judges of this State ... shall be bound\u201d by federal law as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court or the Maryland Court of Appeals, if there is no Supreme Court decision.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Section 187 of the Restatement (Second) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">(1) The law of the state chosen by the parties to govern their contractual rights and duties will be applied if the particular issue is one which the parties could have resolved by an explicit provision in their agreement directed to that issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\">(2) The law of the state chosen by the parties to govern their contractual rights and duties will be applied, even if the particular issue is one which the parties could not have resolved by an explicit provision in their agreement directed to that issue, unless either</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>(a) the chosen state has no substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction and there is no other reasonable basis for the parties choice, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">(b) the application of the law of the chosen state would be contrary to a fundamental policy of a state which has a materially greater interest than the chosen state in the determination of the particular issue and which, under the rule of \u00a7 188, would be the state of the applicable law in the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">(3) In the absence of a contrary indication of intention, the reference is to the local law of the state of the chosen law.<footnotemark>[19]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWn\">Embracing the rule set forth in the Restatement (Second), Maryland appellate courts have long recognized the ability of parties to specify in their contracts which state\u2019s law will apply. <em>Jackson v. Pasadena Receivables, Inc., </em>398 Md. 611, 617, 921 A.2d 799 (2007). The Court of Appeals has required the existence of a \u201cstrong\u201d public policy to override a choice-of-law clause in a contract, <em>id. </em>at 621, 921 A.2d 799, and has not hesitated to apply out-of-state law, even where it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>trump an act of the General Assembly. <em>Id. </em>at 627, 921 A.2d 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">However, it is difficult to think of a stronger or more fundamental public policy than one expressed in the State Constitution. Nor can we conceive of a more forceful statement of the duty of a state court than found in Article 2 of the Declaration of Rights. Unlike the oath for State office contained in Article I, \u00a7 9 of the Maryland Constitution, which requires a judge to \u201csupport\u201d the laws of the State, Article 2 expressly mandates that \u201cjudges of this State\u201d are \u201cbound\u201d by federal law, notwithstanding \u201canything in the Constitution of Laws of this State to the contrary.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Moreover, in the absence of a controlling decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, Maryland courts are to \u201cdecide federal questions the way they believe the Supreme Court would decide them,\u201d Donald Ziegler, <em>Gazing at the Crystal Ball: Reflections on the Standards. State Judges Should Use to Ascertain Federal Law, </em>40 Wm &amp; Mary L.Rev. 1143, 1177 (1999), not the way <em>some </em>federal courts have. <em>Pope, supra, </em>284 Md. at 320, 396 A.2d 1054. That is particularly true of a federal question like that presented in <em>Koons Ford, </em>which had divided courts around the country. To adopt appellees\u2019 position that a decision of Maryland\u2019s highest court on a federal question dissolves because of another state\u2019s opposing interpretation of federal law, or because of a headcount of federal appellate or district court decisions on the subject, would require Maryland courts to decide a federal question contrary to the way they believe the Supreme Court would have decided it. This would fly in the face of Article 2 of the Declaration of Rights. Thus, we conclude that embracing a decision of another state or a federal court disagreeing with <em>Koons Ford, </em>would, in the words of \u00a7 187(2)(b) of the Restatement (Second), \u201cbe contrary to a fundamental policy of [this] State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>There is little doubt that the other prerequisite of \u00a7 187(2)(b) is satisfied in this case. Maryland has a materially greater interest in the determination of the MMWA/FAA issue than South Dakota. That state has never decided the issue and its caselaw indicates no clear preference for following federal law in this area. However, because a Maryland court is bound by Article 2 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights to decide the federal law issue the way it believes the U.S. Supreme Court would have decided it, it has a materially greater interest than South Dakota in applying the <em>Koons Ford </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">In addition, even if we were required to consider the factors specified in \u00a7 188(2) of the Restatement to determine whether \u00a7 187(2)(b) has been satisfied, <em>see </em>n. 18, <em>supra, </em>they would favor the application of Maryland law <em>(ie. </em>its interpretation of federal law) here. The place of contracting would be Maryland, since appellant purchased the computer in this State and, according to appellees, accepted the contract terms in Maryland by electronically agreeing to it in the Gateway End User License Agreement. The place of negotiation of the contract, to the extent there was any, was Maryland. The place of performance, in terms of payment of the purchase price and receipt of the computer, was Maryland. The location of the subject matter of the contract, the computer, is in Maryland. And lastly, appellant\u2019s domicile is Maryland, as well as his residence. From the record, it appears that Gateway has a technical support center in South Dakota, although neither appellee is incorporated or headquartered there. In addition, Gateway\u2019s reseller, Best Buy, has a retail outlet in Maryland and both entities do business here.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">For all of these reasons, \u00a7 187(2)(b) would dictate that Maryland law applies here and that the <em>Koons Ford </em>case controls the issue of whether appellant\u2019s MMWA claim survives arbitration.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Because appellant\u2019s federal claim cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>be forced to arbitration under the FAA, this case must be reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ST.

Some recitation of <em>alleged </em>facts, particularly as to the terms of the arbitration agreement, is necessary to properly address the legal issues in this case.

In an affidavit, appellant asserted that the sealed computer package he received contained a one year warranty without an arbitration provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b680-7\">. In <em>Prima Paint, </em>the Supreme Court drew a line between a defense of fraud in the inducement of the contract, which should be considered by the arbitrator, and fraud in the inducement of the arbitration agreement, which may be heard by a court. 388 U.S. at 395, 87 S.Ct. 1801.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b680-8\">. In <em>Rodriguez, </em>the Supreme Court said that 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 allows courts to grant relief when the party opposing arbitration presents a ''well-supported\u201d claim of a defense such as fraud or overwhelming economic power. 490 U.S. at 483-87, 109 S.Ct. 1917. In <em>Green Tree, </em>the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-9\">[W]e believe that where, as here, a party seeks to invalidate an arbitration agreement on the ground that arbitration would be prohibitively expensive, that party bears the burden of showing the likelihood of incurring such costs. Randolph did not meet that burden. How detailed the showing of prohibitive expense must be before the party seeking arbitration must come forward with contrary evidence is a matter we need not discuss; for in this case <em>neither </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number><em>during discovery nor when the case was presented on the merits </em>was there any timely showing at all on the point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVf\">531 U.S. at 92, 121 S.Ct. 513. (Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b681-11\">. Federal cases interpreting F.R. Civ. Proc. Rule 12(b) also indicate that when confronted with a case such as this one, the court must either disregard the submitted malter or give the parties notice that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>motion is being converted into one for summary judgment and permit the parties to submit evidence accordingly. <em>See, e.g., Nason v.

It is apparent from the record, <em>see </em>pp. 653-54, 979 A.2d 290-91, <em>supra, </em>that the court also made a credibility determination based on the submitted material. <em>See Bagwell v. Peninsula Regional Med. Ctr., </em>106 Md.App. 470, 488, 665 A.2d 297 (1995)(\u201cIn resolving a motion for summary judgment, the trial court may not determine the credibility of witnesses ...

In their brief, appellees state that they never received the motion for discovery that was included in appellant\u2019s supplementary opposition to the motion to dismiss and argue that it should not be considered by this Court. However, this filing contained a certificate of service, was accepted by the Clerk of Court, included in the record of this case, and presumably considered by the court. In addition, something more than a mere denial of receipt is necessary to rebut the presumption of service that arises from a certificate of service. <em>Murnan v. Joseph J. Hock, Inc., </em>274 Md. 528, 531-32, 335 A.2d 104 (1975). Finally, appellant indicated his need for discovery in an earlier filing that apparently was received by appellees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b683-7\">. Perhaps, appellees could have avoided the technical application of Rule 2-322(c) by not joining a motion to dismiss with a motion to compel arbitration. However, even in the latter case, with an evidentiary dispute such as that presented here, the case should not be disposed of summarily without affording the person opposing arbitration limited discovery to challenge the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b683-8\">. Our reversal does not prevent appellees from filing a motion for summary judgment raising their challenges to Henry\u2019s asserted defenses to the arbitration agreement, or the court from conducting an evidentiary hearing on these issues, after a reasonable opportunity has been afforded to appellant to engage in discovery and to respond to appellees\u2019 factual contentions. Of course, appellant\u2019s discovery would be limited to (1) whether an arbitration agreement exists, including those generally applicable defenses to the validity of the arbitration agreement, not to the facts urrderlying his state claims and (2) the facts underlying his federal claim. It may also be desirable for the parties to stipulate that their activities during the discoveiy and any further proceedings do not waive appellees' right to proceed in arbitration on appellant\u2019s state claims. <em>See Brendsel v. Winchester, </em>162 Md.App. 558, 568, 875 A.2d 789 (2005), <em>aff\u2019d. </em>392 Md. 601, 898 A.2d 472 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b684-7\">.
