However, she appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of attorneys\u2019 fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 (Act). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-23\">The Act provides that attorneys\u2019 fees are available to a prevailing party in a civil action against the United States unless \u201cthe position of the United States was substantially justified.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A). To determine whether the Secretary\u2019s position was substantially justified, we apply a reasonableness standard\u2014 whether the Secretary\u2019s position was reasonable in both law and fact. <em>Foster v. Tourtellotte, </em>704 F.2d 1109, 1112 (9th Cir.1983) (per curiam). We review the district court\u2019s determination on this issue for an abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Rawlings v. Heckler, </em>725 F.2d 1192, 1194 (9th Cir.1984); <em>Hoang Ha v. Schweiker, </em>707 F.2d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-24\">The administrative law judge (AU) rejected the opinions of four treating physicians, three of whom considered Albrecht disabled, while the fourth drew no conclusions about disability. The AU decided to follow the opinions of two nontreating physicians who reviewed Albrecht\u2019s record and determined that she had the residual function capacity for sedentary work other than her old job. The district court reversed the AU because the AU failed to identify clear and convincing reasons for rejecting the treating physicians\u2019 reports. <em>See, e.g., Murray v. Heckler, </em>722 F.2d 499, 501-02 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>(9th Cir.1983); <em>see also Allen v. Heckler, </em>749 F.2d 577, 579-80 (9th Cir.1985) (consultative evidence may suffice notwithstanding the \u201cclear and convincing reasons\u201d rule). Thus, the district court concluded that the AU\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">The district court, however, denied Albrecht\u2019s request for fees. The court concluded that while the AU should not have relied on the nontreating physicians\u2019 recommendations in the face of the treating physicians\u2019 disability findings without stating clear and convincing reasons, the existence of some evidence supporting the Secretary precluded a finding that the Secretary\u2019s position was substantially unjustified. The district court observed that if no evidence had supported the Secretary, her position would be unreasonable. <em>See, e.g., Wolverton v. Heckler, </em>726 F.2d 580, 583 (9th Cir.1984). We cannot say that the district judge abused his discretion when he concluded that the Secretary\u2019s position was \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d When the AU is reversed for a failure to weigh conflicting medical evidence properly, an award of fees is inappropriate. <em>Cf. id. </em>(stating that fees were appropriate because \u201c[t]he AU was not reversed for improper balancing, but because there was no evidence contradicting the medical experts\u2019 unanimous finding of disability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">Albrecht also argues to us that aside from improper balancing, the Secretary could not have prevailed because no evidence was introduced regarding the transferability of Albrecht\u2019s skills to other sedentary work. <em>See, e.g., Bonilla v. Secretary of HEW, </em>671 F.2d 1245, 1246 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam). Albrecht argues that because the Secretary introduced no vocational expert testimony on transferability of skills, she was entitled to prevail as a matter of law and the Secretary\u2019s position was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">We decline to reverse the district court on this basis for two reasons. First, contrary to Albrecht\u2019s assertions, the Secretary is not required to present a vocational expert to supply evidence of transferability; the regulations provide only that the Secretary may use such an expert if one is deemed necessary. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-1566(e) (1984). Second, the district court did not rely on this argument in its denial of fees, and our review of the record reveals that it was not fully presented to the district court. Therefore, we will not reverse for an abuse of discretion on an issue on which neither Albrecht nor the district court relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-8\">Since we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of fees, we need not decide whether Al-brecht is entitled to fees for her appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
