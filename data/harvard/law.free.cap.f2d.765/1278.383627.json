The paragon is whether, by virtue of their contractual and operational relations with a county hospital, a private employer and some of its employees acted \u201cunder color of state law\u201d within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982). The paradigm is whether these same private actors became \u201crecipients\u201d of federal assistance when paid by a federally funded county hospital such that they can be held accountable for their allegedly discriminatory conduct under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794 (1982). The pittances concern a refusal to grant relief pursuant to Fed.R. Civ.P. 60(b)(6), a denial of attorney\u2019s fees, and other sundry procedural rulings by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-15\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-16\">Lifetron, Inc. (formerly Vitraton Systems, Inc.), is a privately-owned and -operated corporation that provides respiratory therapy care to facilities such as Northwest Mississippi Regional Medical Center. Northwest, in turn, is a county hospital organized under Mississippi law and run by a Board of Trustees appointed by the Board of Supervisors of Coahoma County, Mississippi. In December of 1980, Lifetron and Northwest entered into a contract whereby Lifetron was to staff and run the hospital\u2019s respiratory therapy department. When the agreement took effect on February 1, 1981, the employees in the hospital\u2019s self-run respiratory therapy section (other than individuals with a minimum of ten years\u2019 employment at Northwest) became employees of Lifetron. Subject to the rules and policies of the hospital and its medical staff, Lifetron was the final authority over who was promoted or demoted, hired or fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-17\">In return for its services, Lifetron was to receive every month from Northwest a minimum flat fee supplemented by twenty percent of any gross respiratory-therapy-patient revenues over a certain amount. The agreement stated that Lifetron was an independent contractor and that Northwest was to pay Lifetron for services rendered, rather than as a function of Northwest\u2019s having billed or even collected payment from its respiratory therapy patients. The contractual relationship between Lifetron and Northwest was thus bilateral in both execution and effect: Lifetron had an agreement only with Northwest, which it<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>self retained sole dominion over the billing of patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-4\">In contrast with these mutually exclusive spheres \u2014 Lifetron with its relative independence over those in its employ, and Northwest with its unshared authority to bill patients \u2014 the day-to-day operations of the hospital and the independent contractor were more entwined. Northwest provided for most or all of Lifetron\u2019s utilities as well as for some of the respiratory therapy equipment; Lifetron\u2019s office was located in the hospital building; Lifetron\u2019s patients were the hospital\u2019s patients; and finally, Lifetron\u2019s activities were subject not only to its own departmental policy and procedure manual but also to the hospital\u2019s policy regarding patient care. A patient in need of respiratory therapy would apparently never know that his care was being furnished by anyone other than the hospital staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-6\">Dorothy Frazier was a respiratory therapist employed by the hospital when Life-tron took over the management of Northwest\u2019s respiratory therapy department in February of 1981. Consistent with the arrangement between Northwest and Life-tron, Frazier became an employee of Life-tron, which soon demoted her from supervisor of the eleven-to-seven shift to technician on the seven-to-three shift. She was told by her new supervisor, Wes Cummings, as well as by two subsequent Life-tron supervisors, Bryan Parker and Tony Nolan, that her demotion stemmed from negative comments in her Northwest personnel file.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-9\">On January 29, 1982, Frazier filed suit in federal district court for the Northern District of Mississippi against Northwest and Lifetron, as well as against Cummings, Parker, Northwest\u2019s personnel manager (Fred Hood), and Northwest\u2019s administrator in charge of operations (Clifford Johnson).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The complaint alleged that Northwest and Lifetron had penalized Frazier for having spoken out against deficiencies in the respiratory care at Northwest and for her history of a nervous breakdown sixteen years earlier. In Frazier\u2019s view, Northwest and Lifetron, acting through each of the above-named individuals, had conspired to plant adverse documentation in her personnel file with an eye toward her eventual discharge. These activities purportedly deprived Frazier of her constitutional rights under color of state law within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by impermissibly burdening (1) Frazier\u2019s first amendment right to criticize patient care, (2) her procedural due process right to a hearing on the validity of the reports contained in her personnel file, and (3) her equal protection right not to be discriminated against because of her history of mental instability. The complaint sought damages for back pay and emotional distress, as well as injunctive relief to restore her to her former supervisory position and to afford her the opportunity to contest the reports in her personnel file.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-10\">Some three months into the lawsuit, on April 21, 1982, Lifetron fired Frazier for having violated departmental policy by speaking to nursing personnel instead of to her supervisor about perceived flaws in the administration of treatment in the department. Frazier responded with a motion to amend her complaint and for a preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>injunction reinstating her as Lifetron\u2019s employee at the hospital. The court granted the motion on May 28, allowing Frazier to bolster her claims of discrimination with the added fact of her discharge, and to join her then-current supervisor Tony Nolan (a Lifetron employee) as a defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court also granted the requested injunctive relief, reasoning that in light of the then-prevailing law, the relationship between Li-fetron and Northwest was sufficient to characterize Frazier\u2019s discharge as \u201cstate action\u201d for purposes of her section 1983 claim, that there was a substantial likelihood of plaintiff\u2019s success on the merits of that claim, and that the equities as between Frazier\u2019s prolonged unemployment and Li-fetron\u2019s patience weighed in favor of granting the requested relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1386-4\">Several months of depositions ensued, but on August 20, 1982, the district court granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of defendants Northwest and its employees, Johnson and Hood. The summary disposition was based on a lack of evidence that Northwest or any of its employees had had anything to do with the \u2019 decisions to demote or to discharge Frazier: in the district court\u2019s view, these actions were attributable solely to Lifetron in its capacity as Frazier\u2019s employer. On April 19, 1983, the court entered a final judgment dismissing the claims against the Northwest defendants pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). Frazier never appealed this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-5\">Another five months of deposition squabbles passed before the district court, on September 12, 1983, entered an order vacating the preliminary injunction and granting the remaining defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The court reasoned that in the interim since it had granted Frazier\u2019s request for preliminary injunctive relief, the Supreme Court had handed down <em>Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, </em>457 U.S. 830, 102 S.Ct. 2764, 73 L.Ed.2d 418 (1982), and <em>Blum v. Yaretsky, </em>457 U.S. 991, 102 S.Ct. 2777, 73 L.Ed.2d 534 (1982)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 cases that altered the concept of state action as it applies to the conduct of private parties. In the district court\u2019s view, these cases dictated that Lifetron and its employees could no longer be characterized as having acted under color of state law for purposes of the plaintiff\u2019s section 1983 claim. As to Frazier\u2019s claim under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the court noted our decision in <em>Brown v. Sibley, </em>650 F.2d 760 (5th Cir.1981), which held that standing to sue under section 504 exists only where an otherwise qualified plaintiff can show that he was discriminated against by a particular program or activity that is a \u201crecipient\u201d of federal funds within the meaning of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 770. The district court concluded that while Northwest is a recipient for purposes of a section 504 claim, the \u201cnexus\u201d between the Medicare and Medicaid funds received by Northwest and the payment ultimately channeled to Lifetron \u201cis so attenuated as not to be actionable by a plaintiff having the status of an employee of a private contractor furnishing respiratory services to a county-owned hospital.\u201d Accordingly, the court dismissed Frazier's claim under section 504 as well as that under section 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>On September 23, 1983, Frazier filed a motion under Rules 59(e), 60(b)(3), and 60(b)(6), asking, among other things, for the court to alter and amend its final judgment of September 12 in favor of Lifetron and its employees, as well as for relief from the court\u2019s order of April 19, which had directed the entry of final judgment in favor of Northwest and its employees pursuant to Rule 54(b). The district court denied the motions in an order entered October 3, and it is from this and the September 12 orders that Frazier now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-5\">A claim for relief under section 1983 requires a showing of two elements: first, that the claimant has been deprived of a right \u201csecured by the Constitution and laws\u201d of the United States, and second, that the deprivation was conducted \u201cunder color of any statute ... of any State.\u201d <em>Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 150, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 1604, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970). Often implicit in the first component, and always related to the second, is the requirement of \u201cstate action.\u201d Most constitutional rights are secured from infringement by governments, not private parties. <em>Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345, 349, 95 S.Ct. 449, 452, 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974); <em>Shelley v. Kraemer, </em>334 U.S. 1, 13, 68 S.Ct. 836, 842, 92 L.Ed. 1161 (1948); <em>The Civil Rights Cases, </em>109 U.S. 3, 17-18, 3 S.Ct. 18, 25-26, 27 L.Ed. 835 (1883); <em>Ex parte Virginia, </em>10 Otto 339, 346, 100 U.S. 339, 346, 25 L.Ed. 676 (1880). Where, as here, a party predicates her section 1983 claim on the infringement of her rights to free speech, due process, and equal protection, that party must demonstrate that her first and fourteenth amendment loss stemmed from conduct properly or fairly attributable to the state.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Lugar v. Edmonson Oil Co., </em>457 U.S. 922, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 2754, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982); <em>Flagg Brothers, Inc. v. Brooks, </em>436 U.S. 149, 156-57, 98 S.Ct. 1729, 1733, 56 L.Ed.2d 185 (1978). Viewed in the context of a claim under section 1983, a showing of state action serves a two-fold purpose. State action, while necessary to establish the deprivation of any of these constitutional rights, when present is also sufficient to meet the under-color-of-law element of section 1983 itself. <em>Lugar, </em>102 S.Ct. at 2753.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AGZs\">Although the state action inquiry has been characterized variously as a \u201cparagon of unclarity,\u201d a \u201cprotean concept,\u201d and an \u201cimpossible task,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> at least our goal is relatively well-marked. \u201cThe ultimate issue in determining whether a person is subject to suit under \u00a7 1983 is the same question posed in cases arising under the Fourteenth Amendment: is the alleged infringement of federal rights \u2018fairly attributable to the state?\u2019 \u201d <em>Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, </em>457 U.S. 830, 102 S.Ct. 2764, 2770, 73 L.Ed.2d 418 (1982) (quoting <em>Lugar, </em>102 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>S.Ct. at 2754). Under the fair attribution test, \u201ca State normally can be held responsible for a private decision only when it has exercised coercive power or has provided such significant encouragement, either overt or covert, that the choice must in law be deemed to be that of the State.\u201d <em>Blum v. Yaretsky, </em>457 U.S. 991, 102 S.Ct. 2777, 2786, 73 L.Ed.2d 534 (1982), <em>quoted in Ren-dell-Baker, </em>102 S.Ct. at 2771. If Lifetron\u2019s decisions to demote and to discharge Frazier are fairly attributable to the state through Northwest,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> then the state action and under-color-of-law elements of Frazier\u2019s section 1983 claim will have been satisfied. Conversely, if Frazier\u2019s dilemma amounts to no more than a private employer\u2019s internal decision over the composition of its staff, then section 1983 cannot be the source of redress for Frazier\u2019s employment grievance against Lifetron.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1388-4\">Imbued with an identity all its own, every state action inquiry partakes only slightly of the factual stuff of other cases.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Still, the Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of <em>Rendell-Baker </em>is instructive. As in our case, the plaintiff in <em>Rendell-Baker </em>asserted a section 1983 claim against a private party and sought to characterize the defendant\u2019s actions as those of the state. There, the petitioners had been discharged by a private school allegedly in violation of their first, fifth, and fourteenth amendment rights. The school \u2014 a nonprofit institution teaching mostly students with special needs \u2014 was located on privately-owned property and was operated under a Board of Directors composed solely of individuals from the private sphere. None were public officials, nor had any been chosen by public officials. The school, however, received most of its referrals from public school committees and from the Drug Rehabilitation Division of the state\u2019s Department of Mental Health. A state statute required that the school committees themselves pay for the education of students they referred, and since this particular school also received funds from several other state and federal agencies, public funds accounted for between 90 and 99% of the school\u2019s operating budget. Moreover, the school had to comply with a variety of state regulations; in particular, the school was required to maintain written job descriptions and written descriptions of personnel standards and procedures. Although employment contracts specified that school employees were not city employees, and although most of the petitioners in <em>Rendell-Baker </em>were teachers at the school, Rendell-Baker was herself a vocational counselor who had been hired pursuant to a federal grant. Consequently, the state\u2019s Committee on Criminal Justice had to approve the school\u2019s initial decision to hire her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-8\">Tracking its analysis in the companion case of <em>Blum, </em>102 S.Ct. at 2786-90,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>Court in <em>Rendell-Baker </em>examined four factors<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> in determining whether the private school\u2019s conduct bore a relationship with the state sufficiently close to warrant calling the school\u2019s personnel decisions \u201cstate action.\u201d First, the Court cited <em>Blum </em>for the proposition that \u201cthe school\u2019s receipt of public funds does not make the discharge decisions acts of the state.\u201d <em>Rendell-Baker, </em>102 S.Ct. at 2771. Focusing on the state\u2019s role in the type of dispute before it, the Court noted that \u201cthe relationship between the school and its teachers and counselors is not changed because the state pays the tuition of the students.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1982)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>). Similarly, the fact that the school was mostly or totally engaged in the performance of public contracts did not erase its status as a private contractor; financial involvement with the state was insufficient to convert a private personnel decision into state action.</p>\n<p id=\"At39\">The Court next considered the impact of state regulation on the nature of the private actor\u2019s conduct. Acknowledging that the state extensively regulated the school\u2019s operations, the Court held that this too was not enough to implicate state action. The most that could be said for the state\u2019s involvement in the decision to discharge the teachers was that the Committee on Criminal Justice had the authority to approve the hiring of vocational counselors. Again, the focus was narrower than the mere fact or even degree of involvement: \u201cthe <em>decisions to discharge </em>... were not compelled or even influenced by any state regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>102 S.Ct. at 2772 (emphasis added); <em>see also Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345, 350, 95 S.Ct. 449, 453, 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974) (holding that state regulation, even if \u201cextensive and detailed,\u201d was insufficient to convert a utility\u2019s actions into those of the state).</p>\n<p id=\"ALb_\">Third, the Court evaluated whether the school merited state-actor status because it performed a \u201cpublic function.\u201d The public function test requires that the function performed be \u201c \u2018traditionally the <em>exclusive </em>prerogative of the State.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rendell-Baker, </em>102 S.Ct. at 2772 (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>419 U.S. at 353, 95 S.Ct. at 454). Since the provision of special services for students was neither a traditional nor an exclusive state task, the Court found that the state had not avoided responsibility by delegating a \u201cpublic function.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ade-dedup-0\">The final factor reflected the theory of \u201cjoint participation\u201d recognized in <em>Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority, </em>365 U.S. 715, 81 S.Ct. 856, 6 L.Ed.2d 45 (1961), where the Court held that a restaurant\u2019s refusal to serve blacks constituted state action since, among other things, the restaurant was located on the premises of a public parking garage and the garage profited from the discriminatory conduct of the restaurant. <em>Id. </em>at 723-25, 81 S.Ct. at 860-61. Under the theory of joint participation or \u201csymbiotic relationship,\u201d \u201cConduct that is formally \u2018private\u2019 may become so entwined with governmental policies or so impreganted with a governmental character as to become subject to the constitutional limitations placed upon state action.\u201d <em>Evans v. Newton, </em>382 U.S. 296, 299, 86 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>S.Ct. 486, 488, 15 L.Ed.2d 373 (1966); see <em>also Terry v. Adams, </em>345 U.S. 461, 467-70, 73 S.Ct. 809, 812-13, 97 L.Ed. 1152 (1953); <em>Public Utilities Commission v. Pollak, </em>343 U.S. 451, 462, 72 S.Ct. 813, 820, 96 L.Ed. 1068 (1952); <em>Marsh v. Alabama, </em>326 U.S. 501, 505-09, 66 S.Ct. 276, 278-80, 90 L.Ed. 265 (1946); <em>Smith v. Allwright, </em>321 U.S. 649, 659-65, 64 S.Ct. 757, 762-65, 88 L.Ed. 987 (1944). In <em>Rendell-Baker, </em>the Court distinguished the joint participation present in <em>Burton </em>from the private school situation before it on the ground that \u201cthe school\u2019s fiscal relationship with the State is not different from that of many contractors performing services for the government.\u201d 102 S.Ct. at 2722. No more was written of <em>Burton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1390-4\">If a thread of commonality is to be drawn from the various forms in which state action can manifest itself through the conduct of private parties, it is that attribution is not fair when bottomed solely on a generalized relation with the state. Rather, private conduct is fairly attributable only when the state has had some affirmative role, albeit one of encouragement short of compulsion,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> in the particular conduct underlying a claimant\u2019s civil rights grievance. \u201cThe purpose of this [close nexus] requirement is to assure that constitutional standards are invoked only when it can be said that the State is <em>responsible </em>for the specific conduct of which the plaintiff complains.\u201d <em>Blum, </em>102 S.Ct. at 2786; <em>see Smith v. North Louisiana Medical Review Association, </em>735 F.2d 168, 173 (5th Cir.1984).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> With this principle in mind, we turn to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-9\">Appellant has few routes by which to contend that Lifetron\u2019s decision to demote and fire her constituted state action. While Lifetron\u2019s income flowed directly from Northwest both on a fixed-fee and percentage basis, public funding alone is insufficient to implicate the state in the discharge decisions of a private actor.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In addition, there is no evidence of the sort of \u201cextensive and detailed\u201d regulation that would be required to impute Lifetron\u2019s personnel decisions to the state; at most, Life-tron\u2019s staff operates subject to the hospital\u2019s policies and procedures, but even assuming some degree of cooperation between the personnel departments of Northwest and Lifetron,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Lifetron retained authority over how it would organize employees within its department and over whom it would fire. And as to \u201cpublic function,\u201d there has been no contention that respiratory therapy, however valuable an asset of medical care, is an activity that has traditionally been the exclusive prerogative of the state. \u201cThat a private entity performs a function which serves the public does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>make its acts state action.\u201d <em>Rendell-Baker, </em>102 S.Ct. at 2772 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-4\">Appellant\u2019s best argument is that Life-tron and Northwest shared a symbiotic relationship akin to that in <em>Burton. </em>As the district court quite properly observed, however, <em>Burton </em>is now subject to the gloss of <em>Rendell-Baker </em>and <em>Blum. </em>The \u201cjoint\u201d of 1961 does not the \u201csymbiosis\u201d of today make.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-5\">It would be disingenuous not to acknowledge the tension that exists between the holdings of <em>Burton </em>and <em>Rendell-Baker. </em>Both cases involved a significant degree of financial integration between the public and private actors; indeed, Massachusetts\u2019s funding in <em>Rendell-Baker </em>arguably rose to a greater level of governmental involvement than did the Wilmington Parking Authority\u2019s lease to and profit-by-association with the Eagle Coffee Shoppe. Perhaps more pointedly, if fair attribution is the guiding light of state action through private means, it is difficult to see how the state in <em>Burton </em>was any more \u201cresponsible\u201d for the restaurant\u2019s decision not to serve blacks than was the state in <em>Rendell-Baker </em>for the school\u2019s decision to discharge its teachers. Nonetheless, <em>Burton </em>clearly remains good law.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1391-6\">The relation between Lifetron and Northwest is not dissimilar to that involved in <em>Burton, </em>where the restaurant and garage were physically and financially integrated; the city was responsible for the repair and upkeep of the entire building; and the garage profited realistically, if not contractually, from the racial discrimination practiced at the Eagle. In the present case, Lifetron is located on hospital premises; Northwest pays for Lifetron\u2019s utilities and furnishes some of the equipment used in the respiratory therapy department; and Northwest directly profits from the patients who use Lifetron\u2019s services. Finally, the anomalies lurking in <em>Burton </em>seem equally applicable today:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1391-12\">It is irony amounting to grave injustice that in one part of a single building, erected and maintained with public funds by an agency of the State to serve a public purpose, all persons have equal rights, while in another portion, also serving the public, a Negro is a second-class citizen, offensive because of his race, without rights and unentitled to service, but at the same time fully enjoys equal access to nearby restaurants in wholly privately owned buildings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1391-13\">365 U.S. at 724-25, 81 S.Ct. at 861. Had Frazier worked elsewhere within the hospital as an employee of Northwest, her current state action dilemma would have vanished as ashes in the wind.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1391-14\">Viewed in light of <em>Rendell-Baker, </em>however, <em>Burton </em>is distinguishable, and the irony is no more than a red herring. Unlike in the present case, the garage\u2019s profits in <em>Burton, </em>earned through the discriminatory practices of its lessee, \u201cnot only contribute[d] to, but also [were] indispensable elements in, the financial success of a governmental agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 724, 81 S.Ct. at 861. This element of indispensabil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>ity \u2014 at the core of the joint participation in <em>Burton </em>\u2014 is lacking here.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Moreover, <em>Rendell-Baker </em>dictates that the ultimate question is whether the conduct in a particular case is fairly attributable to the state. A symbiotic relationship, where present, denotes a level of functional intertwining whereby the state plays some meaningful role in the mechanism leading to the disputed act.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In the present case, we return again to the facts that Lifetron retained ultimate control over its own personnel and that Northwest and its employees have been adjudicated innocent of any material involvement in the decisions to demote and to discharge Frazier.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> There is no symbiotic relationship in this case. <em>Cf. Miller v. Hartwood Apartments, Ltd., </em>689 F.2d 1239, 1242-44 (5th Cir.1982); <em>Taylor v. St. Clair, </em>685 F.2d 982, 987 (5th Cir.1982); <em>Greco v.

Instead, we are faced only with the narrow issue of whether the decisions of a particular private respiratory therapy company to demote and to discharge this plaintiff can be fairly attributed to the state for purposes of stating a claim under section 1983. Bearing in mind that \u201c[differences in circumstances beget appropriate differences in law,\u201d <em>Whitney v. State Tax Commission, </em>309 U.S. 530, 542, 60 S.Ct. 635, 640, 84 L.Ed. 909 (1940), we hold that the victimization in this case, if any, was not the product of state action. The district court properly dismissed appellant\u2019s section 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-8\">To paraphrase a refrain from another context, we hope not to belittle the question presented by appellant\u2019s second claim when we frame the issue as, \u201cWhen is a recipient a recipient?\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Frazier\u2019s complaint alleged that her demotion and discharge had been motivated by her history of mental impairment in violation of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794 (1982). <em>See also id. </em>\u00a7 706(7)(B) (defining \u201chandicapped individual\u201d).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Having already dismissed Frazier\u2019s claims against the Northwest defendants for lack of evidence implicating them in the relevant staffing decisions, the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>trict court held that the Lifetron defendants were not subject to the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s antidiscrimination provisions because Lifetron was not a \u201cprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance\u201d under section 504 of the Act. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 794. Because we believe that Lifetron does indeed satisfy section 504\u2019s subject matter threshold, we reverse this part of the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-4\">Section 504 of the Act provides in pertinent part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1393-5\">[n]o otherwise qualified handicapped individual ... shall, solely, by reason of his handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1393-6\"><em>Id. </em>As a hospital receiving Medicare and Medicaid payments, Northwest is prohibited from discriminating against otherwise qualified individuals based on handicap. <em>United States v. Baylor University Medical Center, </em>736 F.2d 1039, 1040-41 (5th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 958, 83 L.Ed.2d 964 (1985).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The question before us is a variation on that theme: Is a private contractor of services that are integral to the operation of a recipient hospital also a recipient by virtue of a contractual relationship that links both parties\u2019 revenues to the receipt of Medicare and Medicaid payments?</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-9\">While the present inquiry obviously resembles that in Part II above, we are here concerned with a much more circumscribed aspect of the relation between Life-tron and Northwest. Focusing properly on the financial arrangement between the two, Lifetron contends that its status is no different from that of the company the hospital hires to mow its lawn, clean its floors, or supply its aspirin, and that if we hold Lifetron subject to section 504, we will have read any meaningful limits out of the statute by allowing its application to each of these types of contracted-for services. In the instant case, the hospital fulfills its contractual obligations out of a general fund, the composition of which is part Medicare and Medicaid payments, part non-federal in origin. On appellees\u2019 view, we cannot say that a non-recipient contractor turns recipient merely because it is paid by a recipient hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-12\">The view is not without some intuitive sway. Under the terms of its contract, Lifetron is to be paid monthly within thirty days of submitting an itemized invoice for past services rendered, and payment is to be made irrespective of Northwest\u2019s ability to collect payment either from patients or from the federal government. Given this method of payment, Northwest\u2019s Medicare and Medicaid receipts are not in any formal way earmarked for Lifetron.</p>\n<p id=\"ask-dedup-1\">We are not bound, however, to the formalisms of the contractual method of payment in analyzing the reality of Lifetron\u2019s financial nexus to Northwest. Far from being a cinctured financial island within the hospital, Lifetron\u2019s revenue was <em>in fact </em>linked to the hospital\u2019s receipt of Medicare and Medicaid funds even if the terms of their contractual agreement created a theoretical moat \u2014 the androgynous \u201cgeneral fund\u201d \u2014 between them. Under these circumstances, appellant has clearly satisfied the test for stating a claim under section 504: \u201cthat the program or activity with which ... she was involved, or from which ... she was excluded, itself received <em>or was directly benefited </em>by federal financial assistance.\u201d <em>Brown v. Sibley, </em>650 F.2d 760, 769 (5th Cir.1981) (emphasis added). Indeed, viewing the evidence most favorably to appellant, the respiratory therapy department kept weekly tallies of the number of Medicare and Medicaid patients <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>treated in the department. Record vol. 2, at 432-35. More importantly, the contract provided that Lifetron would recompense Northwest in the event that \u201cthird-party payors\u201d disallowed any of the hospital\u2019s claims for reimbursement based on services rendered by Lifetron.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In light of these facts, it is difficult to fathom how Life-tron\u2019s interest in the hospital\u2019s federal assistance was limited to that of a disinterested spectator. Both Northwest and Life-tron reaped a percentage benefit of revenues generated by Medicare and Medicaid patients treated in the respiratory therapy department.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-4\">It is this mutual benefit that distinguishes Lifetron\u2019s womb-like financial situation from that of a private contractor with no material relationship to the recipient\u2019s receipt of federal funds. Unlike the hospital\u2019s privately-contracted mower of lawns, sweeper of floors, or supplier of aspirin, Lifetron contributes in a direct and tangible way to the hospital\u2019s claims for reimbursement under Medicare and Medicaid. That the federal check does not bear Life-tron\u2019s name is no answer to the fact that the check would not have been written at all were it not for Lifetron\u2019s performance as a de facto subdivision of Northwest. Appellees\u2019 parade of horribles is no Mardi Gras.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-5\">Our conclusion is reinforced by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Grove City College v. Bell, </em>465 U.S. 555, 104 S.Ct. 1211, 79 L.Ed.2d 516 (1984). In <em>Grove City, </em>the Court held that where a college program or activity receives federal monies in the form of Basic Educational Opportunity Grants (\u201cBEOGs\u201d) \u2014 federal grants extended to college students for college expenses \u2014 the program or activity must comply with title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Pub.L. No. 92-318, \u00a7 901, 86 Stat. 373 (codified as amended at 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681(a) (1982)). 104 S.Ct. at 1222. The Court reached this decision despite the fact that under title IX \u2014 which, like section 504, was modeled on title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Pub.L. No. 88-352, 78 Stat. 252 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000d to 2000d-4 (1982), <em>see Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Darrone, </em>465 U.S. 624, 104 S.Ct. 1248, 1250, 79 L.Ed.2d 568 (1984); <em>Baylor University, </em>736 F.2d at 1042-43 \u2014 federal funds are granted to students rather than directly to the program or activity itself. <em>Grove City, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1220. The absence of direct funding to the college did not foreclose characterizing the relevant program or activity as one \u201creceiving Federal financial assistance\u201d under title IX.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Similarly, the fact that a respiratory therapy patient\u2019s Medicare or Medicaid payments are remitted first to Northwest and then to Lifetron does not launder those monies: the company is as much a recipient of these funds as the hospital, which would not have reaped that portion of its federally funded revenue but for the provision of services by Lifetron.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number>In addition, we note that the Secretary of Health and Human Services \u2014 the agency charged with administering section 504 as it relates to recipients of Medicare and Medicaid funds, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1301(a)(6), 1302 \u2014 has defined \u201crecipient\u201d for purposes of section 504 to include \u201cany public or private agency, institution, organization, or other entity ... to which Federal financial assistance is extended directly <em>or through another recipient.\u201d </em>45 C.F.R. \u00a7 84.3(f) (1984) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> We generally accord some deference, even great weight, to the statutory interpretations of agencies charged with administering a piece of legislation. <em>Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Darrone, </em>465 U.S. 624, 104 S.Ct. 1248, 1254-55, 79 L.Ed.2d 568 (1984); <em>NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., </em>416 U.S. 267, 275, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 1762, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1974). As our discussion thus far should suggest, we find the Secretary\u2019s to be a reasonable interpretation of the statute under the circumstances of this case, and Lifetron falls squarely within its compass. Lifetron is a recipient of federal financial assistance under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-8\">Appellant argues that the district court erred in several other respects. First, that the court abused its discretion in dismissing appellant\u2019s pendent state claims for slander, libel, and tortious interference with contractual relations. Second, that the court abused its discretion by not allowing Frazier to file a supplemental complaint under Rule 15(d) against Lifetron, Northwest, Tony Nolan, and Northwest\u2019s nursing supervisor, Carol Williams, for their roles in suspending Frazier with pay despite the court\u2019s preliminary injunction requiring her temporary reinstatement. Third, that the court abused its discretion under Rule 60(b)(3) by not setting aside the judgment in favor of the Lifetron defendants on the section 504 claim because these defendants knowingly withheld information on discovery relevant to the financial relationship between Northwest and Lifetron. Fourth, that the court abused its discretion by not withdrawing under Rule 60(b)(6)<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> its Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>54(b) direction for entry of final judgment in favor of the Northwest defendants. And finally, that the court abused its discretion by not granting Frazier an interim award of attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 after she had obtained a preliminary injunction based on her section 1983 claim. Having considered appellant\u2019s arguments on the first and second points, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion either by dismissing the pendent state claims or by denying appellant\u2019s motion to file a supplemental complaint. As to the third point, our holding with regard to appellant\u2019s section 504 claim obviates the need to address this issue. We will devote some space, however, to appellant\u2019s fourth and fifth contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-4\">Our scope of review in evaluating the denial of a motion for relief from a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) is limited to the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>E.g., Phillips v. Insurance Co. of North America, </em>633 F.2d 1165, 1167 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Fackelman v. Bell, </em>564 F.2d 734, 736 (5th Cir.1977). Rule 60(b) states that \u201cthe motion shall be made within a reasonable time.\u201d In the present case, appellant\u2019s motion sought relief from the judgment in favor of the Lifetron defendants on the theory that that ruling was based upon the court\u2019s prior abuse of discretion in granting judgment for the Northwest defendants. Record vol. 2, at 414. To the extent this theory of transitive abuse is valid, it has no merit in the present case. Appellant waited over five months after the fact to object for the first time to the entry of final judgment on behalf of the Northwest defendants. If appellant wished to base her case against the Lifetron defendants on facts that were nonadjudicable by virtue of the final judgment against the Northwest defendants, five months was hardly a \u201creasonable time\u201d at which to contest the district court\u2019s Rule 54(b) order.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Relief from the Northwest defendants\u2019 final judgment should have been sought at the proper time, and if unsuccessfully, on appeal to this court. Appellant\u2019s failure to do so cannot now be remedied via a rule that is appropriately invoked only in \u201cexceptional and compelling circumstances.\u201d 7 J. Moore &amp; J. Lucas, <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>U 60.27[1], at 60-269 (2d ed. 1985). Rule 60(b)(6) is neither a direct nor a vicarious substitute for appeal, <em>see Fackelman, </em>564 F.2d at 735-37, and the district court accordingly did not abuse its discretion in refusing to vacate either of its final judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-8\">With regard to appellant\u2019s claim for an interim award of attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> we begin with the familiar observation that although the decision to award attorney\u2019s fees under section 1988 is within the discretion of the trial court, attorney\u2019s fees generally should be awarded to prevailing plaintiffs absent special circumstances. <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>103 S.Ct. 1933, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1937, 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983); <em>Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, </em>447 U.S. 752, 100 S.Ct. 2455, 2462, 65 L.Ed.2d 488 (1980); <em>Taylor v. Sterrett, </em>640 F.2d 663, 669 (5th Cir.1981). The nature of \u201cprevailing party\u201d status has been expressed in a variety of ways, depending on the context in which the claim for attorney\u2019s fees arises. Often, \u201cthe proper focus is whether the plaintiff has been successful on the central issue as exhibited by the fact that he has acquired the primary relief sought,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 669; <em>see Iranian Students Association v. Edwards, </em>604 F.2d 352, 353 (5th Cir.1979); at other times, we have stated that the lawsuit must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>be a \u201csubstantial factor or a significant catalyst in motivating the defendants to end their unconstitutional behavior,\u201d <em>Robinson v. Kimbrough, </em>652 F.2d 458, 466 (5th Cir.1981); <em>see also Hennigan v. Oua-chita Parish School Board, </em>749 F.2d 1148, 1151-52 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.1985). Moreover, while a party does not attain prevailing-party status by virtue of any procedural victory during the course of a civil rights case, <em>see Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, </em>463 U.S. 680, 103 S.Ct. 3274, 3279 n. 9, 77 L.Ed.2d 938 (1983), the Supreme Court has observed that \u201cCongress contemplated the award of fees <em>pendente lite </em>in some cases.\u201d <em>Hanrahan v. Hampton, </em>446 U.S. 754, 757, 100 S.Ct. 1987, 1989, 64 L.Ed.2d 670 (1980) (per curiam). The Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1397-4\">But it seems clearly to have been the intent of Congress to permit such an interlocutory award only to a party who has established his entitlement to <em>some relief on the merits of his claims, either in the trial court or on </em>appeal____ It seems apparent ... that Congress intended to permit the interim award of counsel fees only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1397-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 757-58, 100 S.Ct. at 1989 (emphasis added). Appellant contends that she was entitled to an interim award of attorney\u2019s fees in light of the trial court\u2019s preliminary injunction returning her to work based in part on the likelihood of success on her section 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-8\">In <em>Deerfield Medical Center v. City of Deerfield Beach, </em>661 F.2d 328 (5th Cir.1981), we held that certain plaintiffs qualified as prevailing parties by having obtained a preliminary injunction on appeal. Because the decision to grant the preliminary injunction in <em>Deerfield Medical Center </em>subsumed an evaluation of the claimants\u2019 likelihood of success on the merits, <em>see id. </em>at 334-38, the plaintiffs had, by virtue of the preliminary injunction, \u201cat least partially achieved the result sought in filing [their] action,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 339; <em>see also Davis v. City of Ennis, </em>520 F.Supp. 262, 265-66 (N.D.Tex.1981) (per curiam) (three-judge court) (distinguishing between relief that is predicated on an adjudication on the merits and interim relief that merely forestalls injury pending final consideration on the merits), <em>cited with approval in Wooten v. Housing Authority, </em>723 F.2d 390, 391 (5th Cir.1984) <em>and Smith v. Thomas, </em>687 F.2d 113, 116 (5th Cir.1982). Similarly, the plaintiff in our case achieved some relief on the merits of her section 1983 claim when the trial court reinstated her at Lifetron pending the outcome of this litigation. This relief \u2014 coextensive in kind with the injunctive relief requested as part of appellant\u2019s original and amended complaints\u2014 was sufficient to establish appellant as a prevailing party at the time the relief was granted. <em>Kirchberg v. Feenstra, </em>708 F.2d 991, 998 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Doe v. Marshall, </em>622 F.2d 118, 120 (5th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 993, 101 S.Ct. 2336, 68 L.Ed.2d 855 (1981); <em>Iranian Students Association, </em>604 F.2d at 353; <em>accord Williams v. Alioto, </em>625 F.2d 845, 847 (9th Cir.1980) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 1012, 101 S.Ct. 1723, 68 L.Ed.2d 213 (1981); <em>cf. Laurenzo ex rel. Laurenzo v. Mississippi High School Activities Association, Inc., </em>708 F.2d 1038, 1042 (5th Cir. 1983) (per curiam) (noting that prevailing-party status based on preliminary injunction requires some determination of likelihood of success on merits).</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-10\">Appellees contend, however, that the ultimate failure of Frazier\u2019s section 1983 claim in the district court, which we today affirm, negated the prevailing-party value that any preliminary relief may have had. While the district court\u2019s issuance of the preliminary injunction was based on its view of the law as it existed at the time, the Supreme Court subsequently decided two cases that led the district court ultimately to rule against plaintiff on her civil rights claim. Thus, on appellees\u2019 view, \u201cMrs. Frazier\u2019s initial success was based on a mistake of law which the District Court itself corrected.\u201d <em>Brief for Lifetron Appellees </em>at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-11\">That a plaintiff eventually loses on the merits of a section 1983 claim does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>automatically undermine the validity of an interim attorney\u2019s fee award based on substantial relief that is granted in light of the then-current universe of legal principles. A plaintiff\u2019s prevailing-party status requires the district court to have passed favorably on the merits of the civil rights claim and to have granted relief that would not have been gained but for the litigation. These circumstances are present where, as here, the district court has decided to grant a preliminary injunction against the defendants, <em>Deerfield Medical Center, </em>661 F.2d at 339, and where on appeal we have not repudiated the district court\u2019s preliminary evaluation of the merits of appellant\u2019s section 1983 claim under the law as it then stood. <em>See Kirchberg, </em>708 F.2d at 998; <em>Marshall, </em>622 F.2d at 120. More precisely, the issuance of a preliminary injunction is reviewable only for an abuse of discretion, <em>Vision Center v. Opticks, Inc., </em>596 F.2d 111, 114 (5th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1016, 100 S.Ct. 668, 62 L.Ed.2d 646 (1980), and we cannot say that the court below abused its discretion in enjoining the defendants from demoting and discharging plaintiff under the law as it then existed. <em>See </em>Part III <em>supra. </em>The statute simply does not contemplate that a plaintiff who attains prevailing-party status, and who is entitled to an interim fee award absent special circumstances, can later be divested of that status.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The very meaning of awarding interim attorney\u2019s fees in the course of litigation is to enable the civil rights plaintiff to press forward as a \u201cprivate attorney general.\u201d <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 1011, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 3-5, <em>reprinted in </em>1976 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5908, 5910-13.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> If a defendant is aggrieved by the underlying issuance of injunctive relief against it, the appropriate remedy lies in noticing an interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). Beyond that, however, \u201c[t]he purpose of section 1988 is to ensure \u2018effective access to the judicial process\u2019 for persons with civil rights grievances,\u201d <em>Hensley, </em>103 S.Ct. at 1937, and a subsequent change in law does not convert an otherwise \u201cprevailing\u201d civil rights plaintiff into a nonprevailing party.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Moreover, in light of the purpose of section 1988, we do not think that a change in law following the trial court\u2019s decision to grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>a preliminary injunction alone constitutes \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d sufficient to justify not awarding interim attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-5\">However, plaintiff\u2019s prevailing-party status for purposes of obtaining an interim award of attorney\u2019s fees does not necessarily entitle her to the award. That decision remains within the discretion of the district court. On the record before us, it is unclear whether the trial judge\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees stemmed from the belief that appellant was not a prevailing party under section 1988, or whether the denial was an exercise of discretion under the statute. We therefore remand this claim to the district court for a determination of whether the circumstances of this case, other than the intervention of new and relevant case law, render an interim award of attorney\u2019s fees unjust. <em>Cf. Kimbrough v. Arkansas Activities Association, </em>574 F.2d 423, 427 (8th Cir.1978) (remanding for similar determination).<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Absent such special circumstances, it will remain for the district court to determine what fee is reasonable. <em>See Blum v. Stenson, </em>465 U.S. 886, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 1544, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984); <em>Hensley, </em>103 S.Ct. at 1939; <em>Johnson v.

On the one hand, the contract between the two is a bipartite umbilical cord fed by Medicare and Medicaid funds such that Lifetron can be properly termed a recipient of federal financial assistance under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. On the other hand, the parameters limned by the Supreme Court, particularly in <em>Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, </em>constrain us to hold that the actions of this private defendant cannot be fairly attributed to the state for purposes of the under-color-of-law requirement of section 1983. The apparent tension between these holdings is .readily dissolved; as Liebniz once declared, <em>nihile est sine ratione </em>\u2014there is nothing without its reason. The concepts of under-color-of-law and recipient status are informed by different considerations: the former comprises the state action requirements both of the Constitution and of section 1983, while the latter focuses more narrowly on the scope of the language employed by Congress to address the problem of discrimination based on handicap. Often, these considerations yield results that, while not geometrically congruent, are consistent. Because this is the situation before us, and because in other respects we do not take issue with the district court\u2019s rulings except with regard to attorney\u2019s fees, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-12\">AFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1385-7\">. In addition, Frazier named as defendants four other individual employees of Northwest, as well as Johnson and Hood, on the pendent state law theories of libel, slander, and tortious interference with contractual relations.

Although Frazier was reinstated pursuant to the court's injunction, Lifetron subsequently suspended her with pay pending an investigation of allegations that she had changed a doctor\u2019s orders regarding a patient. The court denied her motion for an order to show cause as to why Lifetron had varied from the terms of the court\u2019s previous preliminary injunction. Frazier did not move to file a supplemental complaint adding these latest events until September 9, 1983, a day after the court had issued the order granting summary judgment for the Lifetron defendants. Since the court denied this motion as well, the record on appeal consists solely of the events surrounding her demotion and initial discharge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1386-11\">. <em>Rendell-Baker </em>and <em>Blum </em>were the second and third cases of a state-action trilogy that the Court decided on the same day.

Decisive facts may not emerge until discovery or trial. The law may change or clarify in the midst of litigation. Even when the law or the facts appear questionable or unfavorable at the outset, a party may have an entirely reasonable ground for bringing suit.\u201d); <em>Newman v. Piggie Park Enters., Inc., </em>390 U.S. 400, 402, 88 S.Ct. 964, 966, 19 L.Ed.2d 1263 (1968) (per cu-riam) (reasoning that \"private attorney general\" concept underlying title II\u2019s private right of action requires award of attorney\u2019s fees to party who prevails in obtaining injunctive relief).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b1398-8\">. We recognize that our conclusion conflicts with that of the Eleventh Circuit in <em>Doe v. Busbee, </em>684 F.2d 1375 (11th Cir.1982). In <em>Busbee, </em>the court held that an outcome-determinative change in law subsequent to the issuance of a preliminary injunction vitiated the significance of the injunctive relief for purposes of \u00a7 1988. Distinguishing <em>Deerfield Medical Center, </em>the Eleventh Circuit observed that in <em>Deerfield, </em>\u201cit is clear that plaintiffs were prevailing parties [when they were granted their preliminary injunction], However, in this case, plaintiffs have not ultimately prevailed on any legal issue, and any relief entered by the district court was awarded under a mistake of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1383. We read the holding in <em>Busbee </em>to be largely inconsistent with that in <em>Deerfield Medical Center. </em>The eventual resolution of the merits of a civil rights claim should not retroactively eradicate interim prevailing party status, since to hold otherwise would undo the utility of awarding attorney\u2019s fees <em>pendente lite. </em>Accordingly, we read <em>Deerfield Medical Center </em>to control appellant\u2019s prevailing-party status in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b1399-8\">. As we have stated, \"Proper appellate review requires that any district court denying \u00a7 1988 attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing plaintiff who notices an appeal should ... set out the specific reasons justifying its action, in the form of written findings of fact and conclusions of law.\" <em>Kirchberg, </em>708 F.2d at 1001.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
