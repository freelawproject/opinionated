Because we find that the court below erred in utilizing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b)(1) as a ceiling on the amounts of attorneys\u2019 fees to be awarded against the government in these Social Security cases, we vacate the orders of the lower court and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1668-17\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"anw-dedup-0\">The facts which form the predicate of these appeals may be briefly stated. Each appellant was a prevailing plaintiff in the district court in an action challenging a decision of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (\u201cSecretary\u201d or \u201cappel-lee\u201d). In appellant Watford\u2019s case, the Secretary\u2019s decision had terminated Watford\u2019s disability benefits under the Supplemental Security Income (\u201cSSI\u201d) program. In appellant Scott\u2019s case, the Secretary\u2019s decision terminated disability benefits Ms. Scott had been receiving under the SSI program as well as the Social Security program. Each plaintiff was represented by an attorney from the Legal Services Corporation of Alabama. In each action, the district court concluded that the Secretary\u2019s position lacked a reasonable basis in law or fact, and therefore determined that each plaintiff was entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to the EAJA, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1668-18\">Except as otherwise specifically provided by statute, a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the United States fees and other expenses ... incurred by that party in any civil action (other than cases sounding in tort) brought by or against the United States in any court having jurisdiction of that action, unless the court finds that the position of the United States was sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1565\">*1565</page-number>stantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1669-4\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1669-5\">Having determined that each plaintiff was entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A), the district court proceeded to fix the amount of the fee award. In doing so, the court first analyzed each of the factors listed in <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, </em>488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir.1974).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In light of the <em>Johnson </em>factors, the court determined that in the <em>Watford </em>case, plaintiff\u2019s counsel would normally \u201cbe entitled to be compensated for 11.9 hours at the rate of $55.00 per hour for a total of $654.50.\u201d (Record Excerpts at 28), and in the <em>Scott </em>case, that plaintiff\u2019s counsel would normally \u201cbe entitled to be compensated for 8 hours at the rate of $75.00 per hour for a total of $600.00.\u201d (Record Excerpts at 11). In each case, however, the district court decided that a ceiling should be placed upon the award in light of the following provision of the Social Security Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1669-6\">(1) Whenever a court renders a judgment favorable to a claimant under this subchapter who was represented before the court by an attorney, the court may determine and allow as part of its judgment a reasonable fee for such representation, not in excess of 25 percent of the total of the past-due benefits to which the claimant is entitled by reason of such judgment, and the Secretary may, notwithstanding the provisions of section 405(i) of this title, certify the amount of such fee for payment to such attorney out of, and not in addition to, the amount of such past-due benefits. In case of any such judgment, no other fee may be payable or certified for payment for such representation except as provided in this paragraph. (2) Any attorney who charges, demands, receives, or collects for services rendered in connection with proceedings before a court to which paragraph (1) of this subsection is applicable any amount in excess of that allowed by the court thereunder shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be subject to a fine of not more than $500, or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1669-10\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-11\">In each of the cases <em>sub judice </em>the district court held that the fee award previously determined under the <em>Johnson </em>analysis should be limited in light of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b). Thus, in <em>Watford </em>the court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1669-12\">After examining plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s application for fees in light of the <em>Johnson </em>factors, the Court concludes that plaintiff\u2019s counsel would be entitled to be compensated for 11.9 hours at the rate of $55.00 per hour for a total of $654.50. However, the Court believes that the fee award should not exceed the maximum amount that a private attorney could have received under the Social Security Act, which provides for awards up to \u201c25 percent of the total of past-due benefits.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b)(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1669-13\">It is the Court's understanding that $654.50 may exceed 25 percent of the past-due benefits, but the precise amount of the back award is as yet unavailable. Thus, the Court finds that plaintiff is entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees to be paid to her attorney equal to $654.50 or 25 percent of the past-due benefits, whichever is less.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1669-14\">(Record Excerpts at 28-29). Using precisely the same analysis in <em>Scott, </em>the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1566\">*1566</page-number>court found that the plaintiffs attorney in that case was \u201centitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees to be paid to her attorney equal to $600.00 or 25 percent of her past-due benefits, whichever is less.\u201d (Record Excerpts at 12).</p>\n<p id=\"b1670-4\">From these rulings, the plaintiffs appeal, contending that the district court erred in utilizing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b) as a limit upon the amounts otherwise recoverable under the EAJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1670-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1670-6\">It is settled that \u00a7 406(b) of the Social Security Act is not a statute \u201cspecifically providing\u201d for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees <em>against the government </em>so as to preclude application of the EAJA altogether under the first clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 406(b) provides for the discretionary award of attorneys\u2019 fees out of (and not in addition to) the past-due benefits recovered by a successful claimant in a Social Security action. In other words, it essentially provides for contingent fees to be charged <em>to the client, </em>with the amount to be set by the district court subject to a statutory maximum. <em>See Wolverton v. Heckler, </em>726 F.2d 580, 582 (9th Cir.1984) (Section 406(b) does not provide for fee-shifting, but \u201cspecifies only a limitation on the amount that a claimant must pay toward lawyers\u2019 fees\u201d). <em>Accord, Cornelia v. Schweiker, </em>728 F.2d 978 (8th Cir.1984); <em>Guthrie v. Schweiker, </em>718 F.2d 104 (4th Cir.1983). Section 406(b) does not provide for nor purport to prohibit an award of attorneys\u2019 fees <em>against the government, </em>and the courts have invariably concluded that in Social Security cases Section 406(b) does not preclude the award of attorneys\u2019 fees against the government pursuant to the EAJA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Wolverton v. Heckler, </em>726 F.2d at 582; <em>Cornelia v. Schweiker, </em>728 F.2d at 987; <em>Guthrie v. Schweiker, </em>718 F.2d at 104. <em>Accord, Smith v. Heckler, </em>739 F.2d 144, 147 (4th Cir.1984); <em>Tant v. Heckler, </em>577 F.Supp. 448 (N.D.Ga.1983); <em>Watkins v. Harris, </em>566 F.Supp. 493 (E.D. Pa.1983); <em>Ocasio v. Schweiker, </em>540 F.Supp. 1320 (S.D.N.Y.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1670-14\">Therefore, the question becomes this: does Section 406(b) of the Social Security Act directly or indirectly place a ceiling on the <em>amount </em>of attorneys\u2019 fees that may be awarded against the government (pursuant to the EAJA) in Social Security cases? In view of the purposes and legislative histories of the two acts, as well as their express language, the answer would seem to be no. As already noted, the express language of Section 406(b) makes no reference to any limitation on the amount of fees to be awarded <em>against the government </em>in a proper case. Nor can any limit be gleaned from the express purposes of the two acts. The purpose of the EAJA was to alleviate economic deterrents to contesting unreasonable government action by shifting the burden of attorneys\u2019 fees from the private litigant <em>to the government </em>where the government\u2019s position is substantially unjustified. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 96-1418, 96th Cong.2d Sess. (1980), <em>reprinted in </em>1980 <em>U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News </em>4984. The purposes of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b), on the other hand, were (1) to limit the size of contingency fees <em>payable by the client, </em>Congress believing that contingent fee arrangements in Social Security cases often resulted in an inordinate deprivation of benefits otherwise payable to the client, and (2) to ensure that attorneys would receive some fees for their representation. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 422 (1965), <em>reprinted in </em>1965 <em>US. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News </em>1943, 2062. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1567\">*1567</page-number><em>also Guthrie v. Schweiker, </em>718 F.2d at 107, n. 9; <em>Watkins v. Harris, </em>566 F.Supp. at 495-96; <em>Ocasio v. Schweiker, </em>540 F.Supp. at 1322. Consequently, allowing fee awards <em>against the government </em>in Social Security cases in amounts greater than 25 percent of a claimant\u2019s past-due benefits would not be contrary to the letter or the spirit of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b). To the extent the district court\u2019s decision is based on a contrary construction of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b), the district court erred as a matter of law. That provision alone neither expressly nor impliedly limits the amounts properly to be awarded under the EAJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1671-5\">Thus, if any such limitation exists, it must arise from some principle extraneous to the express language and purposes of the two acts. In relying upon \u00a7 406(b) as a measure of the maximum fees to be awarded in the cases <em>sub judice, </em>the district court apparently acted on the belief that since private attorneys<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> could extract from a claimant no more than 25 percent of the past-due benefits recovered in ordinary litigation, it would be an unjust windfall to award any greater amount as attorneys\u2019 fees <em>against the government </em>even when the government\u2019s position was unjustified. A point similar to this was made in <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, </em>where it was said generally that \u201c[i]n no event should the litigant be awarded a fee greater than he is contractually bound to pay, if indeed the attorneys have contracted as to amount.\u201d 488 F.2d at 718. Apparently, the district court, recognizing that fee awards are generally intended to be simply a make-whole remedy and not a penalty, operated from the premise that attorneys\u2019 fee awards against the government in Social Security cases should not exceed the maximum an attorney could legally charge his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b1671-7\">However compelling this argument may be in other contexts, it is not very persuasive insofar as the EAJA is concerned. The EAJA expressly provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1671-8\">____[t]he amount of fees awarded under this subsection shall be based upon prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the services furnished, except that ... attorneys\u2019 fees shall not be awarded in excess of $75 per hour unless ... a special factor ... justifies a higher fee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1671-10\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(A). In explaining this provision, the House Committee on the Judiciary stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1671-11\">The definition establishes that fees are to be based on the prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of services ren-dered____ In general, ... the computation of attorney fees should be based on prevailing market rates <em>without reference to the fee arrangements between the attorney and client. The fact that attorneys may be providing services at salaries below the standard commercial rates which attorneys might normally receive for services rendered is not relevant to the computation of compensation under the Act. </em>In short, the award of fees is to be determined according to general professional standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1671-13\">H.R.Rep. No. 96-1418, <em>supra, </em>at 4993-4994 (emphasis supplied). Thus, the fact that attorneys may recover from their clients no more than 25 percent of the clients past-due benefits does not limit the amounts to be awarded under the EAJA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Cornel-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1568\">*1568</page-number><em>la v. Schweiker, </em>728 F.2d 978, 986-87 (8th Cir.1984) (using same rationale to justify award of attorneys\u2019 fees to Social Security claimant represented by <em>pro bono </em>counsel); <em>Jones v. Schweiker, 565 </em>F.Supp. 52, 55 (W.D.Mich.1983) <em>(accord); Hornal v. Schweiker, </em>551 F.Supp. 612, 616 (M.D.Tenn.1982) (accord); <em>Kauffman v. Schweiker, 559 </em>F.Supp. 372, 373-75 (M.D. Pa.1983) <em>(accord). </em>Congress has manifested an explicit intent that the EAJA allow for a fee award against the government which might exceed the amounts due the attorney from his client. Congress certainly has the power to enact such legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1672-4\">There is a related argument which should be addressed here. Since fees to be awarded under the EAJA are to be \u201cbased upon prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the services furnished,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(A), there is an argument (albeit somewhat circular) that, in light of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b), the \u201cprevailing market rates\u201d <em>for Social Security cases </em>cannot be in excess of 25 percent of the claimant\u2019s past-due benefits. This argument is also without merit. The statute speaks of the \u201ckind and quality of the services\u201d furnished by the lawyer, not of the statute under which suit is brought. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis supplied). This language tracks that of <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, </em>which provides that fee awards should be based upon the \u201ccustomary fee for similar work in the community.\u201d 488 F.2d at 718. In applying this language from <em>Johnson </em>in the context of other fee-shifting statutes, the Eleventh Circuit has held that the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees must be determined according to rates customarily charged for similarly complex litigation, and is not to be limited by the amounts customarily charged in actions brought under the same statute. <em>See Varner v. Century Finance Co., </em>738 F.2d 1143 (11th Cir.1984).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We hold that the same rule must be followed in setting a fee under the EAJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1672-9\">Finally, the Secretary argues that even if Section 406(b) does not implicitly limit the amount of fees properly awarded under the EAJA, the district court\u2019s award was nevertheless justified because the lower court has broad discretion and is entitled to consider the relatively small amount involved in the suit when calculating the fee. The district court invoked this same argument in denying a motion by Ms. Scott to amend the judgment awarding attorneys\u2019 fees. While this argument is generally correct in the abstract, it has little application here. As the Supreme Court has noted, \u201cthe most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.\u201d <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1939, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). <em>Accord, Jones v. Central Soya Co., Inc., </em>748 F.2d 586, 589, n. 3 (11th Cir.1984); <em>Copper Liquor, Inc. v. Adolph Coors Co., </em>624 F.2d 575, 583 (5th Cir.1980). The other factors listed in <em>Johnson, </em>however, must generally be considered to determine if this \u201cbase rate\u201d should be adjusted upward or downward. <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. at 433-34, n. 7, 103 S.Ct. at 1939, n, 7; <em>Jones v. Central Soya Co., Inc., </em>748 F.2d at 588-89, n. 1; <em>Varner v. Century Finance Co., </em>738 F.2d at 1148. One of those other factors is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1569\">*1569</page-number>\u201cthe amount involved and the results obtained.\u201d 488 F.2d at 718. However, in assigning weight to the other factors, \u201c[n]o one <em>Johnson </em>criterion should be stressed to the neglect of others.\u201d <em>Jones v. Diamond, </em>636 F.2d 1364, 1382 (5th Cir.1981) <em>(en banc), cert. dismissed </em>453 U.S. 950, 102 S.Ct. 27, 69 L.Ed.2d 1033 (1981). Although the amount involved is generally a factor to be considered, a fee award may not be limited to a \u201cmodest proportion of the total monetary recovery\u201d or even to \u201cthe [total] amount recovered.\u201d <em>Harkless v. Sweeny Independent School District, </em>608 F.2d 594, 598 (5th Cir.1979). <em>Accord Reneau v. Mossy Motors, </em>622 F.2d 192, 196 (5th Cir.1980). The lower court plainly followed the forbidden path, and this constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1673-5\">It should be stressed that in these cases, the claimants apparently obtained precisely the relief they sought from the outset. In other words, the \u201cresults obtained\u201d amounted to complete success. In these circumstances, a fully compensatory award based upon all hours reasonably expended on the litigation is normally appropriate. <em>Compare Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. at 434-35, 440, 103 S.Ct. at 1939-40, 1943. Moreover, it would seem particularly inappropriate to rely too heavily on the \u201camounts involved\u201d in reducing an otherwise reasonable fee when dealing with a statute that <em>expressly </em>requires adherence to \u201cthe prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of services involved,\u201d and does not on its face allow the fee to be limited based upon the amount involved.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(2)(A). <em>Cf. Harkless v. Sweeny Independent School District, </em>608 F.2d at 598. Indeed, to severely limit the amount of otherwise reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees simply because the monetary amounts involved are relatively small would seem to thwart the very purpose of the EAJA \u2014 to eliminate economic deterrents to challenging unjustified government action and to correct inequities arising from the great disparity in resources between the government and private litigants. <em>See Gross v. Schweiker, </em>563 F.Supp. 260, 261 (N.D.Ind.1983).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1673-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1673-13\">Whether analyzed in terms of an abuse of discretion or an error of law,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the district court erred in limiting the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees in each of these cases to 25 percent of the claimant\u2019s past-due benefits. We therefore vacate those portions of the lower court\u2019s orders which impose such a limit on the fee awarded in each case, and remand the case for entry of an order in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1570\">*1570</page-number>each case awarding the amounts initially determined to be reasonable by the district court. Thus, in <em>Watford, </em>the court shall award attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $654.50. In <em>Scott, </em>the court shall award attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $600.00.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We have not addressed the question of the plaintiffs\u2019 entitlement to further amounts under the EAJA for the services of their attorneys in connection with this appeal, a question which will be left to the determination of the district court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1674-4\">The decisions below are hereby VACATED and REMANDED with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1668-19\">.

It is worth noting here that in drafting the EAJA, Congress explicitly rejected a proposal to exclude Social Security cases from the ambit of the act, deciding instead to hold the government to the same standards in Social Security actions as in other litigation. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep.

Schweiker, </em>728 F.2d 978, 986-87 (8th Cir.1984); <em>Ceglia v. Schweiker, </em>566 F.Supp. 118, 123 (E.D.N.Y.1983); <em>Jones v. Schweiker, </em>565 F.Supp. 52, 55 (W.D.Mich.1983); <em>Chee v.

The Fourth Circuit evidently agrees, for it has held that \u201d[a]ny award received by [claimant\u2019s] counsel under the EAJA for work in court must be used to reimburse [claimant] <em>up to </em>the amount awarded under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b)(1)____\u201d <em>Guthrie v.

Thus, the Fourth Circuit has implic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1568\">*1568</page-number>itly recognized that the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees properly awarded under the EAJA in Social Security cases is not limited by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1672-6\">. In <em>Varner, </em>the lower court had computed the amount of an attorneys' fee award due under the Truth-in-Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(a)(3), only by reference to rates charged in other Truth-in-Lending actions. In reversing, the Eleventh Circuit (per Judge Vance) held this to be an abuse of discretion:</p>\n<p id=\"b1672-7\">In computing the base rate, the district court refused to consider rates other than those customarily charged for Truth-in-Lending cases in the northern district of Georgia. We agree that this constitutes error. Under <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir.1974), the award must be based on customary fees in cases of like difficulty, <em>id. </em>at 718, whether or not such cases involve Truth-in-Lending violations ... We remand each award for reconsideration of the base rate in light of prevailing fees for cases of similar complexity generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b1672-11\">738 F.2d at 1148-49.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1673-6\">. In light of the fairly specific language of the EAJA and its even more specific legislative history, <em>see </em>H.R.Rep. No. 96-1418, <em>supra, </em>it is debatable whether Congress intended to authorize a substantial downward adjustment of a fee award based on the amounts involved in the suit. In fact, one of the main objectives in passing the act was to make it economically feasible for private litigants to retain attorneys and challenge unjustified government action even \"[w]hen the cost of contesting a Government order ... exceeds the amount at stake____\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 96-1418, <em>supra, </em>at 4988.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1673-9\">. To the extent that the \"amount involved\u201d is properly considered in setting a fee under the EAJA, the district court must consider the prospective monetary effects of the litigation as well as the retroactive effects. In these cases, the district court focused solely on the amount of past-due benefits involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1673-10\">. Normally, the standard of review in cases involving awards of attorneys' fees is whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir.1974). In the instant case, however, the appellants do not challenge the district court\u2019s initial determination of what fee is reasonable in light of the <em>Johnson </em>factors. Rather, the primary question is whether the district court erred in relying upon 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b) to limit the amount of fees previously determined to be reasonable and proper under the <em>Johnson </em>analysis. The district court\u2019s opinion is somewhat ambiguous as to whether \u00a7 406(b) was viewed as a mandatory limit upon the award of attorneys\u2019 fees under the EAJA, or simply as a discretionary guide. However, the point is academic, for we conclude that to the extent \u00a7 406(b) was viewed as a mandatory limit on EAJA awards, the district court erred as a matter of law, and to the extent that \u00a7 406(b) was viewed as a discretionary guide, the district court abused its discretion. The limits imposed by \u00a7 406(b) are not properly considered in awarding fees under the EAJA, for the two statutes have totally unrelated functions and purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1674-13\">. We stress that these figures are derived from the district court\u2019s own calculation of the amounts properly due to be awarded under the EAJA, which the district court then erroneously reduced in light of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b). The plaintiffs have not challenged the reasonableness of the court\u2019s initial calculations, but only the propriety of the subsequent reductions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
