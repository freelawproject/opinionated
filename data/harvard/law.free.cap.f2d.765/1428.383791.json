Phillips (hereinafter collectively-referred to as Phillips) seek reversal of the district court order dismissing Phillips\u2019 suits for damages against individually named agents of the Internal Revenue Service (hereinafter IRS) pursuant to Fed.R. Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Phillips contends that the district court erred because the claim alleging deprivation of a liberty and property interest without due process of law was one on which relief could be granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1534-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"ATK8\">The appropriate standard of review is not in dispute. A dismissal for failure to state a claim pursuant to Fed.R. Civ.P. 12(b)(6) is a ruling on a question of law and as such is reviewable <em>de novo. Guillory v. County of Orange, </em>731 F.2d 1379, 1381 (9th Cir.1984); <em>North Star International v. Arizona Corp. Commission, </em>720 F.2d 578, 580 (9th Cir.1983). The review is limited to the contents of the complaint. <em>North Star, </em>720 F.2d at 581. To affirm this type of dismissal, it must appear to a certainty that the plaintiff would not be entitled to relief under any set of facts that could be proved. <em>Halet v. Wend Investment Co., </em>672 F.2d 1305, 1309 (9th Cir.1982). All allegations of material fact are taken as true and construed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>North Star, </em>720 F.2d at 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-14\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-15\">On May 3,1984, Phillips filed an action in the district court seeking monetary damages from individually named IRS agents for issuance of \u201cpre-filing notification letters.\u201d The basis for relief, as pleaded, was for damages for violation of his constitutional rights by a federal agent under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Narcotics Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-16\">Phillips is the sole general partner of two companies in the business of producing and developing oil and gas; Western Reserve Oil and Gas Co. and 1983 Western Reserve Oil and Gas Co., Ltd. Both companies are also California limited partnerships in which various individuals (hereinafter partners) purchased limited partnership interests from the years 1981-1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1534-17\">In a letter dated March 22, 1984, the IRS advised Phillips that its investigation showed that there was a basis for concluding that a claim by the Phillips partners for tax benefits for the year 1983 would not comply with the income tax laws.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Phillips <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1431\">*1431</page-number>was notified on April 4, 1984, that, pursuant to Rev.Proc. 83-78, 1983-2 Cum.Bull. 595 (hereinafter Rev.Proc. 83-78) he would be afforded an opportunity to meet with IRS agent Bobbie J. Tadlock (hereinafter Tadlock) and District Counsel attorney Steve New (hereinafter New) to present any facts or legal arguments to demonstrate that the claimed tax benefits complied with federal income tax laws.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1535-4\">Phillips attempted to obtain specific information concerning the factual basis for the IRS determination that his company may be operating as an abusive tax shelter. The IRS, however, refused to give Phillips the information he sought. On April 4, 1982, Phillips met with the IRS agents to dissuade them from issuing any pre-filing notification letters to the limited partners in his companies. This attempt was unsuccessful. On April 11, the IRS sent pre-fil-ing notification letters to the Phillips\u2019 partners in Western Reserve Oil and Gas Co.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The partners in 1983 Western Reserve Oil and Gas Co., Ltd. did not receive pre-filing notification letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-12\">The complaint as amended alleges that Phillips was denied his Fifth Amendment right to liberty and property because (1) the mailing of the letters had the \u201cirreversible consequence of destroying the means by which Phillips secure[d] his livelihood\u201d; (2) the letters had a \u201cchilling effect\u201d because investors would withdraw; and (3) the letters had the same damaging effect on his livelihood as a \u201cjeopardy assessment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1535-13\">The complaint states that the agents acted \u201cunder color of authority\u201d when they issued the pre-filing notification letters to the investors. It further alleges, however, that the actions undertaken in compliance with Rev.Proc. 83-78, were motivated by a \u201cpersonal hate and vendetta\u201d directed towards Phillips\u2019 business partner, Terry Ma-bile, a former IRS agent. Phillips alleges that the deprivation occurred because the agents knew that through the use of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1432\">*1432</page-number>\u201cpower with the IRS\u201d they could \u201cmost effectively injure, embarrass and destroy Mabile and those with whom he was associated.\u201d The complaint also alleges that the April 4 meeting with the IRS and the procedures available for review following issuance of the letters did not provide him with an adequate predeprivation hearing or sufficient notice of the specific legal theory or factual basis in violation of his right to procedural due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-6\">Phillips contends that the mailing of the pre-filing notification letters resulted in the deprivation of his liberty and property without adequate notice and opportunity to be heard in violation of his right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-7\"><em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Narcotics Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 authorizes the filing of an action against individual federal agents by a citizen \u201csuffering a compensable injury to a <em>constitutionally protected interest.\" Butz v. Economou, </em>438 U.S. 478, 504, 98 S.Ct. 2894, 2909, 57 L.Ed.2d 895 (1978) (emphasis added). We are required to dismiss a complaint brought pursuant to <em>Bivens </em>unless it appears from the face of the complaint that the citizen \u201chas stated a cause of action which asserts ... [a constitutionally protected] right.\u201d <em>Davis v. Passman, </em>442 U.S. 228, 234, 99 S.Ct. 2264, 2271, 60 L.Ed.2d 846 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-8\">A. <em>Property Or Liberty Interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1536-9\">To establish a cognizable property interest within the meaning of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, \u201ca person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a <em>legitimate </em>claim of entitlement to it.\u201d <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2709, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-12\">Phillips claims that the right to continue the operation of a business is a cognizable property interest. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-13\">The same argument was rejected by the Sixth Circuit in <em>Mid South Music Corp. v. Kolak, </em>756 F.2d 23 (6th Cir.1984). The facts in <em>Mid South Music Corp. </em>are virtually identical to those before this court. In <em>Mid South Music Corp., </em>the appellant brought suit against the United States and various federal officials of the IRS seeking compensatory and punitive damages for a violation of its constitutional rights. The alleged violations arose from the pre-filing notification letter sent by the IRS to investors in the company advising them that deductions from their investment in <em>Mid South </em>would not be allowed. The complaint alleged that the pre-filing notification letter caused destruction of business thereby depriving the company of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The Sixth Circuit held as follows: \u201cNo constitutional claim is stated against the individual defendants because the plaintiff has alleged no property interest cognizable under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court noted that \u201c[t]he plaintiff is in effect claiming that its business interests should be protected from IRS communications intended to convey to taxpayer investors information which will prevent them being penalized for erroneously taking deductions on their income tax returns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Sixth Circuit also concluded that \u201cthe causal connection between IRS\u2019 actions and the alleged business injury is attenuated. Here, there was no IRS action directly depriving the plaintiff of property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Phillips has failed to plead facts showing that he had a \u201clegitimate claim of entitlement\u201d to operate a business in violation of the tax laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1433\">*1433</page-number>Our holding that Phillips has failed to allege a cognizable property interest is also supported by the decision of the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia in <em>Investment Annuity, Inc. v. Blumenthal, </em>609 F.2d 1, 7 (D.C.Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 981, 100 S.Ct. 2961, 64 L.Ed.2d 837 (1980). In <em>Investment Annuity, Inc., </em>the Court held that annuity sellers did not have a sufficient \u201cproperty interest\u201d to support a claim that the IRS violated due process rights by notifying annuity buyers of recent IRS positions on disallowance of deductions. <em>Id. </em>at 7. The court concluded in <em>Investment Annuity, Inc. </em>that the actions taken by the IRS were too attenuated to constitute a deprivation of the alleged property interest. <em>Id. </em>at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-5\">Phillips further claims that a constitutionally recognized liberty interest was denied by the actions of the IRS agents. This claim is grounded upon the same assertion as the property interest claim; i.e. that the issuance of pre-filing notification letters destroyed Phillips\u2019 business. Phillips relies on <em>Sanderson v. Village of Greenhills, </em>726 F.2d 284 (6th Cir.1984) to support this contention. This reliance is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-6\">In <em>Sanderson, </em>the plaintiff alleged that he was deprived of his \u201cliberty\u201d interest to engage in a lawful business because local officials did not want a billiard parlor in the Village of Greenhills. Three officials claimed that they had the inherent power to disapprove of a business \u201cirrespective of any existing regulatory ordinance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287. The district court dismissed this claim as failing to state a cause of action under section 1983. The Sixth Circuit reversed. The Court noted that, while \u201cthere can be no <em>unfettered </em>freedom to engage in a business which may be properly regulated,\u201d under the facts as pleaded, the action of the village officials was not motivated by an attempt to enforce a regulatory ordinance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1537-7\">In the matter <em>sub judice, </em>the filing of the pre-notification letters attached to the complaint show that the federal agents were acting under existing regulation directed at protecting investors from taking invalid deductions. Thus, unlike the facts presented in <em>Sanderson, </em>the regulatory basis for the actions of the federal agents is clearly set forth in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-10\">Phillips further contends that he was denied a federally cognizable interest because the agents acting \u201cwith malice,\u201d and intended \u201cto injure [and] embarass\u201d him. This contention is also devoid of merit. We have held conduct by an individual acting under color of law which is designed to harass and embarrass does not constitute a denial of a cognizable \u201cliberty\u201d or \u201cproperty\u201d interest in a claim brought under section 1983. <em>Rutledge v. Arizona Board of Regents, </em>660 F.2d 1345, 1353 (9th Cir.1981), <em>aff'd sub nom. Kush v. Rutledge, </em>460 U.S. 719, 103 S.Ct. 1483, 75 L.Ed.2d 413 (1983). Rather, such \u201ctransgressions constitute nothing more than a tort \u2018which the state may protect against ... by virtue of its tort law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. quoting Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 712, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 1166, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-11\">B. <em>Denial of Procedural Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1537-12\">Phillips also contends that his right to procedural due process was violated because he did not receive adequate notice or an opportunity to be heard. There is no support in the record for this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-13\">As set forth above, Phillips was given written notice that the IRS was considering imposition of the sanctions provided in Rev.Proc. 83-78. He was informed in the letter dated March 22, 1984, that the agents had determined that his company would not be in compliance with the Federal tax laws if tax benefits to the partners were claimed. Thereafter, Phillips was afforded the opportunity to meet with the IRS agents to establish the legitimacy of the tax shelters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-14\">The complaint alleges that the IRS agents refused to give Phillips detailed information concerning the factual basis for their \u201cabusive tax shelter\u201d determination prior to and at the April 4th meeting and that Phillips was thereby denied a fair opportunity to present his case. The complaint further alleges that the \u201chearing\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1434\">*1434</page-number>was infirm since Phillips\u2019 request for a continuance was denied arbitrarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-4\">Assuming, as we must, that these allegations are true, <em>North Star, </em>720 F.2d at 580, Phillips nonetheless failed to state a sufficient claim of denial of due process. No hearing is required prior to the assessment or collection of taxes so long as the aggrieved party has adequate opportunity for later judicial determination of liability. <em>Phillips v. Commissioner, </em>283 U.S. 589, 595, 51 S.Ct. 608, 611, 75 L.Ed. 1289 (1931); <em>Boday, et al. v. United States, </em>759 F.2d 1472, 1475 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Tavares v. United States, </em>491 F.2d 725, 726 (9th Cir.1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 925, 95 S.Ct. 1120, 43 L.Ed.2d 394 (1975). Phillips is afforded adequate post-enforcement opportunities for judicial review. Congress has provided for suits concerning the adjustment or readjustment of disputed items of a partnership. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6226, 6228 (following notice of final partnership administrative adjustment, partner may file petition for readjustment in either Tax, Claims Court or United States District Court) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1) (jurisdiction in United States District Courts for suits against United States for recovery of erroneously or illegally assessed or collected taxes).</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-5\">C. <em>No Bivens Violation Where Agent Acting Within the Scope of His Authority</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1538-6\">A federal officer can be held liable for damages pursuant to <em>Bivens </em>only if his <em>constitutional torts </em>knowingly were committed outside the scope of his statutory authority. <em>Granger v. Marek, </em>583 F.2d 781, 783 n. 4 (6th Cir.1978). Here, the agents were acting well within the scope of the authority delegated to the IRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-7\">Rev.Proc. 83-78 was implemented for the express purpose of ensuring \u201cmore effective compliance with the tax laws.\u201d Rev. Proc. 83-78 \u00a7 2. This procedure is in compliance with the Internal Revenue Code which \u201cimposes on the Secretary of the Treasury, and the IRS as his designate, a broad duty to enforce the tax laws\u201d and manifests \u201cCongressional intent to provide the Secretary with broad latitude to adopt enforcement techniques helpful in the performance of his tax collection and assessment responsibilities.\u201d <em>United States v. Euge, </em>444 U.S. 707, 716 and n. 9, 100 S.Ct. 874, 880 and n. 9, 63 L.Ed.2d 141 <em>rehearing denied, </em>446 U.S. 913, 100 S.Ct. 1845, 64 L.Ed.2d 267 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-9\">These powers are necessary to the fulfillment of a significant function of the IRS; to prevent commission of crimes. <em>See United States v. Little, </em>753 F.2d 1420,1436 (9th Cir.1984) (statutory grants of authority encompass \u201cundercover criminal investigations which may be necessary and proper to ... the general enforcement of revenue laws.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-11\">Phillips\u2019 complaint failed to allege sufficient facts to establish a cognizable property or liberty interest or that the conduct of the federal agents in sending the pre-filing notification letters directly deprived him of his right to conduct his business solely as the result of arbitrary or capricious motivation. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1534-7\">. Phillips also contends that the district court erroneously dismissed the complaint on the alternative ground that the IRS agents were immune from suit. We do not address this issue since we find that the complaint properly was dismissed for failure to state a claim. Fed.R. Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1534-8\">.
