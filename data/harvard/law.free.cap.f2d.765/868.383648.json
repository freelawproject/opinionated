We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-28\">At his deportation hearing, Delgado-Chavez conceded that he was deportable pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>ant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2) for remaining in the United States beyond the period he was authorized to stay. The Immigration Judge denied Delgado-Chavez\u2019s request for voluntary departure, citing petitioner\u2019s embezzlement conviction in state court. On appeal, Delgado-Chavez advised the BIA that the state court judge in his embezzlement trial issued a recommendation against deportation. The BIA nevertheless dismissed the appeal. Delgado-Chavez maintains that pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(b)(2), his embezzlement conviction should not have been considered in connection with his application for voluntary departure..</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">In lieu of deportation, the Attorney General has discretion to allow an alien to depart the United States voluntarily; to obtain such relief, an alien must establish that he or she is and has been a person of good moral character for at least five years prior to the application for voluntary departure. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(e). Compliance with the statutory requirements for suspension of deportation does not automatically entitle an alien to such relief \u2014 it is a matter of discretion and administrative grace. <em>United States ex rel Hintopoulos v. Shaughnessy, </em>353 U.S. 72, 77, 77 S.Ct. 618, 621, 1 L.Ed.2d 652 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">Delgado-Chavez\u2019s conviction for embezzlement is relevant to determining whether he is and has been a person of good moral character for purposes of granting him voluntary departure. Embezzlement, a crime which involves the intent to defraud, is a crime of moral turpitude, <em>see McNaughton v. INS, </em>612 F.2d 457, 459 (9th Cir.1980). While the Immigration and Nationality Act provides that one who has committed a crime of moral turpitude shall not be found to possess good moral character, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(f)(3), 1182(a)(9), the BIA in this case recognized that convictions may not render an alien statutorily ineligible for voluntary departure. Rather, a conviction may be considered as an adverse factor in deciding whether the favorable exercise of discretion is warranted. <em>In re Seda, </em>17 I. &amp; N. Dec. 550, 554 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">Delgado-Chavez, however, argues that pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(b)(2), the recommendation against deportation by the state court judge prevents consideration of his conviction in connection with his application for voluntary departure. Section 1251(b) provides, in relevant part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqJ\">(b) The provisions of subsection (a)(4) of this section respecting the deportation of an alien convicted of a crime or crimes shall not apply (1) in the case of any alien who has subsequent to such conviction been granted a full and unconditional pardon by the President of the United States or by the Governor of any of the several States, or (2) if the court sentencing such alien for such crime shall make, at the time of first imposing judgment or passing sentence, or within thirty days thereafter, a recommendation to the Attorney General that such alien not be deported, due notice having been given prior to making such recommendation to representatives of the interested State, the Service, and prosecution authorities, who shall be granted an opportunity to make representations in the matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANSc\">Delgado-Chavez\u2019s argument lacks merit. Section 1251(b)(2) on its face applies not to applications for voluntary departure, but only to deportation proceedings based upon convictions of crimes of moral turpitude. Section 1251(b)(2) does not apply to deportation proceedings brought pursuant to provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act other than \u00a7 1251(a)(4). <em>Jew Ten v. INS, </em>307 F.2d 832, 835 (9th Cir.1962), <em>cert. denied, </em>371 U.S. 968, 83 S.Ct. 551, 9 L.Ed.2d 538 (1963); <em>accord, United States v. George, </em>534 F.Supp. 570, 571 (S.D.N.Y. 1982) (court held it lacked jurisdiction to hear a \u00a7 1251(b) application where the convicted alien was deportable for overstaying his visa under \u00a7 1251(a)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">Nevertheless, in <em>Giambanco v. INS, </em>531 F.2d 141 (3d Cir.1976), the Third Circuit held that a prior fraud conviction cannot be considered in determining whether an alien is entitled to adjustment of deportation status where there is a recommendation against deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(b)(2)). Mat 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>The court in <em>Giambanco </em>maintained that allowing the INS to consider a conviction in adjustment of status proceedings when there is a recommendation against using the conviction as a basis for deportation renders meaningless the provisions of \u00a7 1251(b)(2) which provide for notice and an opportunity for a hearing to the INS <em>Id. </em>at 147. While this argument is not without appeal, the plain language of \u00a7 1251(b)(2) limits its application to deportation proceedings under \u00a7 1251(a)(4). Therefore, consideration of Delgado-Chavez\u2019s embezzlement conviction in connection with his application for voluntary departure was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
