Because this appeal follows a second trial and two reported opinions, one by this Court, 717 F.2d 752, and one by the district court, 590 F.Supp. 1043, there is no need for an extended recital of the facts. The accident occurred at night when Thomas Furey\u2019s motorboat, operated by Ronald Stissi with Furey and Ruth Calabro as passengers, attempted to cross the wake of the tugboat DELAWARE. The motorboat fouled its propeller on the DELAWARE\u2019S tow line and was struck by the barge that the DELAWARE was towing. Stissi and Calabro died as a result of the collision, and their respective estates are represented by Barbara Stissi and Judith Lax. The DELAWARE was chartered to Sonat Marine, Inc., formerly Interstate and Ocean Transport Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">On the prior appeal, we affirmed in part and vacated in part Judge Nickerson\u2019s decision apportioning 80% of the fault for the collision to the tug and barge and 20% of the fault to the Furey boat. We held that the district court was correct in denying Sonat\u2019s and Furey\u2019s request for exoneration from, or limitation of, liability but concluded that the district court had erred in assessing only 20% of the fault to the Fu-rey boat. Upon remand, the district court consolidated the claims for trial before a jury, the jury\u2019s verdict in the Lax and Fu-rey actions to be advisory only. The district court held that Stissi was entitled to a binding verdict because she had elected to invoke the savings to suitors clause, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333, during the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Following a six-day trial, the jury found Sonat 94% at fault, Stissi 3% at fault, and Furey 3% at fault. The jury also fixed damages in the amount of $1,110,024 for Stissi, $567,574 for Lax and $40,000 for Furey. Thereafter, the district court adopted the jury\u2019s findings on both apportionment and damages. 590 F.Supp. at 1050.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">Sonat argues on this appeal that the district court erred in retrying the issue of apportionment of fault instead of reconsidering that issue on the record of the first trial. We disagree; our mandate did not preclude a retrial. However, the district court did err in disregarding certain legal conclusions reached on the first trial and appeal, which should not have received <em>de novo </em>consideration. For reasons hereafter discussed, the issue of apportionment of fault will have to be tried a third time.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">In 1980, a tug such as the DELAWARE, which had another vessel in tow, was required by then-current federal navigation rules to carry certain lights. One of these rules, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 173 (1976), provided that the tug should \u201cin addition to her side lights\u201d carry three bright lights not less than three feet apart in a vertical line. Section 173 also provided, by reference to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 172(a) and (f) (1976), that these lights should be carried \u201con or in front of the foremast, or, if a vessel without a foremast, then in the forepart of the vessel\u201d (\u00a7 172(a)), or, alternatively, in the same position that the after range single light would occupy on a vessel containing only a two-white-light central range (\u00a7 172(f)).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">There is no dispute as to the lights carried by the DELAWARE on the night of the accident. The evidence as to the lights was identical on both trials; the tugmas-ter\u2019s and Coast Guard\u2019s descriptions of the lights, as given on the first trial, were read into evidence on the second. At the conclusion of the first trial, the district court held that \u201cthe tug was exhibiting the lights required by Article 3 of the Inland Rules [33 U.S.C. \u00a7 173] for a tug towing a barge astern, namely a white bow light, port and starboard running lights, three vertical bright white lights and an optional stern light.\u201d This Court agreed. 717 F.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>754. These were not findings of fact; they were conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">When a decision turns on the meaning of words in a statute or regulation, the decision is one of law which must be made by the court. <em>Trust of Bingham v. Commissioner, </em>325 U.S. 365, 371, 65 S.Ct. 1232, 1235, 89 L.Ed. 1670 (1945); <em>Day v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>393 F.Supp. 217, 220 (S.D.N.Y.), <em>aff'd, </em>528 F.2d 31 (2d Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 890, 97 S.Ct. 246, 50 L.Ed.2d 172 (1976); <em>Gaibis v. Werner Continental, Inc., </em>565 F.Supp. 1538, 1548 (W.D.Pa.1983). The application of a statute\u2019s terms to undisputed facts also is a question of law. <em>Gold Kist, Inc. v. United States, </em>339 F.Supp. 1249, 1255 n. 6 (N.D.Ga.1971), <em>aff'd sub nom., ICC v. Gold Kist, Inc., </em>409 U.S. 808, 93 S.Ct. 106, 34 L.Ed.2d 67 (1972); <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>252 F.2d 6, 9 (8th Cir.1958); <em>see Nelson v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., </em>312 U.S. 373, 376, 61 S.Ct. 593, 595, 85 L.Ed. 897 (1941); <em>Dowell, Inc. v. Lyons, </em>238 F.2d 633, 635 (6th Cir.1956); <em>Coleman Furniture Corp. v. Home Insurance Co., </em>67 F.2d 347, 351 (4th Cir.1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The district court\u2019s legal conclusions concerning the tug\u2019s compliance with Article 3, which were approved and adopted by this Court, thus became the law of the case and should have been followed by the district court on the second trial. <em>Doe v. New York City Department of Social Services, </em>709 F.2d 782, 788-89 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 195, 78 L.Ed.2d 171 (1983). Instead of adhering to this well-established rule, the district court permitted Richard Riley, a tugboat captain for the Texaco Company, to hold forth erroneously and at great length concerning the allegedly mandatory lighting requirements for a tug with tow astern on Long Island Sound. The end result was prejudicial and reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">On six separate occasions, Riley, without referring to any specific rule or regulation, testified that the DELAWARE should have carried a yellow light on the stern; this, he said, was \u201cmandatory\u201d. He testified that, because this light was absent, a pilot in Mr. Stissi\u2019s position \u201cprobably would be confused\u201d. It was only after Stissi\u2019s counsel informed the district court that Riley himself was confused about the yellow light that the district court told the jury a yellow light was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">Assuming for the argument that Riley\u2019s error with reference to the yellow light was cured by the court's instructions, another more egregious error concerning the forward range light never was cured. Although the testimony and the photographs introduced on the first trial clearly established the presence and location of the white bow or range light, and the existence of this light was approved specifically by both the district court and this Court, Riley testified that the light was improper. What\u2019s more, he convinced the district court to overturn, not only its own prior ruling to the contrary, but also the holding of this Court, which, as stated above, established the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">The district court attempted to justify its ruling, stating that the evidence on the first trial \u201cdid not reveal, as it did at the jury trial, that in addition to the three vertical lights displayed by the tug it was also carrying an additional light that at certain angles could be mistaken for a fourth vertical light\u201d and that \u201c[tjhis could have caused Stissi to mistake the three mast lights signalling that a barge was in tow.\u201d 590 F.Supp. at 1047. In making this statement, the district court erred, not once, but twice.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">In the first place, even the most casual observer of the photograph of the bow of the DELAWARE, which was in evidence on both trials, could not help but see that, when viewed from directly ahead of the vessel, the forward range light would be directly in line with the three mast lights behind it. In the second place, the evidence is uncontroverted that Stissi never was directly in front of the tug so as to have this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">Unfortunately, these errors were reflected in the district court\u2019s instructions to the jury. The judge charged the jury that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>pursuant to Article 3 of the Inland Water Rules (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 173), the DELAWARE was required to carry three white lights on its mast but that, under Article 1 of those Rules (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 171), the DELAWARE was not permitted to carry other lights which might be mistaken for the prescribed lights. Even if we had not already established the law of the case with reference to the forward range light, we would hold that the presence of this light was proper and not in violation of the applicable rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">An understanding of why this is so requires some knowledge of the nature and purpose of the so-called range lights, whose history antedates that of the red and green side lights. <em>See Belden v. Chase, </em>150 U.S. 674, 694, 14 S.Ct. 264, 270, 37 L.Ed. 1218 (1893). Ordinarily, range lights consist of two white lights in the same vertical plane as the keel of a vessel, with the rear range light higher than the forward one. By observing the relative position of these two lights, the lookout on an approaching ship can readily determine the course of the light-bearing vessel. As one commentator puts it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">Range lights are a valuable aid in determining the relative heading of another vessel when she is first sighted at night. These white lights are both brighter and higher than the side lights, and consequently they normally will be seen well before the colored light or lights can be detected and read for their meaning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">The relative location of the two range lights will be the key. Should they be seen one directly over the other, the other vessel is headed <em>directly toward </em>the observer and danger of collision exists. Should the lower forward range light be seen to the right or left of the higher light, the other vessel is on an oblique course and the angle can be roughly gauged by the horizontal separation between the lights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Charles F. Chapman, <em>Piloting, Seamanship and Small Boat Handling </em>64(d). Judicial comment is in accord:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">The rule for inland waters and narrow channels differs in one respect from that for open waters. It not only requires the two colored side lights, but it requires the two white range lights, to be up and burning. The red and white side lights only show in what <em>general direction </em>the steamer is going; they do not show with accuracy <em>the course </em>held by the steamer moving in that general direction. In narrow waters it is necessary to safety that this <em>course </em>shall be known; and the high light aft, and the lower light forward, fixed on a range with the center of the vessel, as required by rule 7, shows this <em>course.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-11\">These two sorts of lights are probably more important in narrow channels than the red and white lights. They are both essential. It is for this reason that every steamer navigating narrow waters at night is required to have these lights up. If a steamer has them not it is in fault; it is grossly in fault.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-12\"><em>The Conoho, </em>24 Fed. 758, 760 (E.D.Va. 1885).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-13\">As of the date of the accident, section 172(a) provided that a steam vessel, such as a tugboat, under way should carry a white light in its bow. Section 172(f) provided that such vessel should carry a central range of two white lights, the afterlight being carried at an elevation at least fifteen feet above the light at the head of the vessel. Section 173 provided that a tug towing one or more vessels astern should carry three vertical lights in the same position as the after range light mentioned in section 172(f). The purpose of requiring those lights to be placed in this position seems clear; if an approaching vessel was so located that the forward range light was directly below the three mast lights, the approaching vessel would know that it was on a direct collision course with the tug. Of course, since the Furey boat never was directly ahead of the DELAWARE so that the lights would be observed in this manner, the district court\u2019s comments concerning possible confusion were simply academic.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-14\">We are as satisfied now as we were at the conclusion of the first trial that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>was nothing improper about the lights on the DELAWARE. The district court\u2019s holding to the contrary, 590 F.Supp. at 1047, was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Because the issue of fault must be retried, it is appropriate that we comment briefly concerning certain matters that are likely to recur. As the district court correctly stated, what the nautical rules say was a matter for it to decide. It was not Riley\u2019s function to testify as to what the rules required or prohibited. The district court therefore should not have permitted Riley to give the jury his version of the rules. The prejudice resulting from the disregard of this evidentiary rule as it related to the lighting on the tug already has been discussed. Enforcement of the rule also would have precluded Riley from telling the jury that, when the Furey boat was seven-tenths of a mile away, \u201cby law\u201d its lights would have been visible to a vigilant lookout on the tug; that the blowing of a danger signal was \u201cmandatory\u201d; that a rule which Riley did not deign to identify required that the tug\u2019s whistle be heard \u201cin all directions\u201d, \u201castern as well as ahead\u201d; and that when the DELAWARE backs up, it is required \u201cby law\u201d to sound a whistle. The effect that testimony of this kind has on a jury seldom is eliminated by a cursory curative statement that the jury is to take the law from the court, particularly where, as here, the court fails to give its own version of the legal pronouncements that the witness has made.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">On the other hand, the district court did not abuse its discretion in redacting the double hearsay and conclusory portions of the Coast Guard report. <em>See City of New York v. Pullman, Inc., </em>662 F.2d 910, 914-15 (2d Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1164, 102 S.Ct. 1038, 71 L.Ed.2d 320 (1982); <em>Lindsay v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., </em>637 F.2d 87, 94 (2d Cir.1980). Because Sonat disputed the feasibility of shortening the 1000-foot hawser, the district court likewise acted within its discretion in permitting evidence to be introduced that the hawser was shortened following the accident. <em>See Anderson v. Malloy, </em>700 F.2d 1208, 1212-14 (8th Cir.1983). Finally, the district court did not err in admitting testimony concerning a prior incident when Stissi, operating Furey\u2019s boat, observed and heeded the warning of a tug showing three towing lights. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>727 F.2d 214, 219-21 (2d Cir.1984). This evidence bore on the question whether Furey permitted an inexperienced pilot to operate his boat. Moreover, even if its admission was error, it was not prejudicial error. The more knowledgeable Stissi was concerning nautical signals, the more negligent he was in ignoring the warning lights that the DELAWARE showed on the night of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Turning to the charge, we do not believe the district court erred in refusing to incorporate the statement from this Court\u2019s prior opinion that crossing the wake of a tug displaying towing lights, such as were shown here, is \u201cinexcusable negligence\u201d justifying a finding that the motorboat operator was \u201cgrossly at fault\u201d. Because appellate opinions are designed for a different purpose than are jury instructions, it sometimes is not advisable to incorporate language from the former directly into the latter. <em>See Howland Pulp &amp; Paper Co. v. Alfreds, </em>179 Fed. 482, 484 (1st Cir.1910); Devitt and Blackmar, <em>Federal Jury Practice and Instructions </em>\u00a7 8.01 at 243. Moreover, language such as \u201cinexcusable negligence\u201d and \u201cgrossly at fault\u201d may tend to confuse or mislead the jury. <em>See Rainey v. Paquet Cruises, Inc., </em>709 F.2d 169, 171 (2d Cir.1983). The district court correctly charged that \u201cwhere mast lights indicate the existence of a two, it is negligence to cross behind the stern of the towing vessel without knowing the position of the tow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Sonat was entitled, however, to have the jury instructed pursuant to former Article 27 of the Inland Water Rules, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 212 (1976) that, in obeying the Rules, the DELAWARE should take into consideration \u201cany special circumstances which may render a departure from the above rules necessary in order to avoid immediate danger.\u201d Because a new trial is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>to be had in any event, we need not decide whether, in view of the court\u2019s charge on the somewhat similar provisions of section 80.11 of the Pilot Rules, 33 C.F.R. \u00a7 80.11 (1980), the failure to charge Article 27 was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">The district court did not err in treating the jury\u2019s findings with respect to Furey in an advisory capacity. Furey waived his right to a jury trial by failing to request one at the outset of the limitation proceeding. <em>See Noonan v. Cunard Steamship Co., </em>375 F.2d 69 (2d Cir.1967). The district court did not err in holding Furey and Sonat jointly liable to Lax for the entire amount of Lax\u2019s damages. During the limitation proceeding, Lax had asserted a cross-claim against Furey. Although this Court subsequently affirmed the denial of exoneration and limitation, 717 F.2d at 757, the district court, sitting as an admiralty court, retained jurisdiction to adjudicate all claims arising out of this proceeding, including Lax\u2019s cross-claim against Furey. <em>See Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., </em>273 U.S. 207, 216-18, 47 S.Ct. 357, 359-60, 71 L.Ed. 612 (1927); <em>see also British Transport Commission v. United States, </em>354 U.S. 129, 138, 77 S.Ct. 1103, 1108, 1 L.Ed.2d 1234 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Although we are reversing and remanding on the issue of fault, we see no need for a retrial on the issue of damages. The damage awards were not so grossly excessive that they should not be permitted to stand. The award to Stissi\u2019s stepchildren was not improper. <em>See Spiller v. Thomas M. Lowe, Jr. and Associates, Inc., </em>466 F.2d 903, 904-08 (8th Cir.1972). The court did not err in allowing prejudgment interest on the awards to Stissi and Lax. <em>Independent Balk Transport, Inc. v. Vessel \u201cMorania Abaco\u201d, </em>676 F.2d 23, 25 (2d Cir.1982); <em>Mitsui &amp; Co., Lid. v. American Export Lines, Inc., </em>636 F.2d 807, 823 (2d Cir.1981). Finally, the court did not err in refusing to impute Stissi\u2019s contributory negligence to Furey in determining the amount of Furey\u2019s contribution toward Stissi\u2019s damages. <em>See Red Star Towing &amp; Transportation Company v. Cargo Ship \u201cMing Giant\u201d, </em>563 F.Supp. 224, 226 (S.D.N.Y.1983); <em>Shiver v. Burnside Terminal Company, </em>392 F.Supp. 1078, 1079 (E.D.La. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">We affirm that portion of the judgment which fixed the amount of plaintiffs\u2019 damages but vacate that part which apportioned fault between the parties, and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-6\">. In view of Judge Nickerson\u2019s statement that he agreed with the jury\u2019s apportionment of liability, 590 F.Supp. at 1047, a question might be raised concerning the wisdom of returning this case to the same judge for a third trial. However, we have every confidence that Judge Nick-erson will fairly try the issue of apportionment on the evidence properly introduced on the third trial, and what we have held to be the law of the case concerning the lights on the tug.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
