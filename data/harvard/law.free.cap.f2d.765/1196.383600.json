A majority of the judges of the court in regular active service have not voted in favor thereof. Upon consideration of the foregoing, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-23\">ORDERED, by the Court <em>en banc, </em>that the suggestions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-24\">Chief Judge SPOTTSWOOD W. ROBINSON, III, and Circuit Judge WALD did not participate in this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-25\">A dissenting statement of Circuit Judge SCALIA, joined by Circuit Judges BORK and STARR, is attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-26\">Prior Report: 577 F.Supp. 252 (D.C.D.C.1983), <em>affd. </em>758 F.2d 739 (D.C.Cir.1985).'</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-27\">SCALIA, Circuit Judge, with whom Circuit Judges BORK and STARR join, dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-28\">The panel opinion, 758 F.2d 739, in this case upheld the judgment of the District Court, in a suit brought by an association of brokerage houses, that the Comptroller violated sections 7(c) and 8 of the McFadden Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 36(c), 81 (1982), in permitting national banks to conduct discount brokerage operations at locations other than their main banking offices and authorized branches.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-29\">The McFadden Act restricts only the <em>location </em>and not (unlike the Glass-Steagall Act, ch. 89, 48 Stat. 162 (1933) (codified as amended in scattered sections of 12 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>(1982)) the <em>nature </em>of bank activities. It is uncontroverted that its purpose was to establish competitive equality between state and federal banks by authorizing branching by federally chartered banks to the same extent as permitted to state banks by state law. Thus, state banks (and state banking commissions) are obviously within the zone of interests protected by the statute \u2014 but the brokerage houses suing in the present case are no more within it than are businesses competing for the parking spaces that an unlawful branch may occupy-</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-4\">More importantly, however, the District Court, whose reasoning was adopted by the panel opinion, did not, in my view, base its standing decision merely on this erroneous construction of the language and purpose of the McFadden Act. My reading of the District Court opinion is that the Securities Industry Association\u2019s members (1) would have standing to sue under the Glass-Stea-gall Act, which restricts the scope of activities that national banks can engage in, and (2) would be actually harmed by attempts by national banks to exceed the locational curbs of the McFadden Act. This entirely reduces the \u201czone of interest\u201d inquiry under the McFadden Act to an inquiry into \u201cinjury in fact,\u201d as the conclusion of the McFadden Act standing portion of the opinion demonstrates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1301-5\">To be sure, the McFadden Act restricts national banks not in the type of business they may conduct but where they may conduct it. Still, attempts to exceed those curbs would harm SIA\u2019s members just as the data processors in <em>Data Processing [Service Organizations v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970)] and the tour operators in <em>Arnold Tours </em>[v. <em>Camp, </em>400 U.S. 45, 91 S.Ct. 158, 27 L.Ed.2d 179 (1970) ]. Accordingly, SIA is arguably within the zone of interests sought to be protected by the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\"><em>Securities Industry Ass\u2019n v. Comptroller of the Currency, </em>577 F.Supp. 252, 258-59 (D.D.C.1983). But neither standing under the Glass-Steagall Act (a statute the functional equivalent of which was at issue in <em>Data Processing </em>and <em>Arnold </em>Tours) nor injury in fact \u2014 nor the two combined \u2014 suffice to satisfy the zone of interests test under the <em>McFadden Act. </em>Thus, the District Court opinion holds either that standing under one statute confers standing to raise challenges under a separate statute\u2014 which is inconsistent with <em>Tax Analysts &amp; Advocates v. Blumenthal, </em>566 F.2d 130, 140-41 (D.C.Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1086, 98 S.Ct. 1280, 55 L.Ed.2d 791 (1978), and indeed with the whole principle behind the zone test \u2014 or that injury in fact is sufficient to confer standing \u2014 which discards the zone test entirely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-8\">On the merits, too, the District Court\u2019s\u2014 and thus the majority\u2019s \u2014 conclusion that discount brokerage offices operated by national banks are branches seems mistaken. The McFadden Act defines a branch to \u201cinclude\u201d any place \u201cat which deposits are received, or checks paid, or money lent,\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 36(f) (1982), which plainly does not describe a discount brokerage office. The District Court found, however, that the statutory definition of branches is not limited to offices performing one or more of these enumerated functions, basing this conclusion on remarks by Rep. McFadden made after passage of the Act, an opinion of the Eighth Circuit (followed nowhere else) finding trust offices to be branches, <em>St. Louis County National Bank v. Mercantile Trust Company National Ass\u2019n, </em>548 F.2d 716 (8th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>433 U.S. 909, 97 S.Ct. 2975, 53 L.Ed.2d 1093 (1977), and dicta in <em>First National Bank in Plant City v. Dickinson, </em>396 U.S. 122, 90 S.Ct. 337, 24 L.Ed.2d 312 (1969). It seems to me, however, that the <em>Plant City </em>dicta are virtually dispositive <em>in favor of the Comptroller. </em>The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2c\">Although the definition may not be a model of precision in part due to its circular aspect, it defines the minimum content of the term \u201cbranch\u201d by use of the word \u201cinclude.\u201d <em>The definition suggests a calculated indefiniteness with respect to the outer limits of the term. </em>However, the term \u201cbranch bank\u201d at the very least includes any place for receiv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>ing deposits or paying checks or lending money apart from the chartered premises; it may include more.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">396 U.S. at 135, 90 S.Ct. at 344 (emphasis added). It seems to me that a statute containing a \u201ccalculated indefiniteness\u201d presents precisely the situation in which our deference to the agency should be at its height. <em>See Chevron, USA, Inc. v. NRDC, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2782, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). The Comptroller\u2019s conclusion that discount brokerage houses do not fall within the range of indefiniteness \u2014 or indeed that the range includes <em>only </em>the enumerated functions\u2014 cannot by any means be considered unreasonable, even if we think it mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-8\">This circuit plays a leading role in formulating banking law, and administrative law generally, and this case squarely presents important questions in both areas. I think it should have been heard by the full court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
