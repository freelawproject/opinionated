United States Magistrate Hilbert Schauer held that the trustee had that power. United States District Judge John P. Moore denied a motion to reconsider the magistrate\u2019s ruling. This appeal followed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>The precise question posed by this appeal was recently addressed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Weintraub, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 1986, 85 L.Ed.2d 372 (1985). In reversing the Seventh Circuit, a unanimous court, with Justice Powell taking no part in the consideration or decision of the case, held that the trustee of a corporation in bankruptcy has the power to waive the corporation\u2019s attorney-client relationship with respect to pre-bankruptcy communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
