The debtor instituted the instant adversary action in bankruptcy court, seeking cancellation of the lien notice filed of record by the creditor. The bankruptcy court refused to cancel the lien, holding in part that the lien continued to be valid after confirmation of the plan. The district court affirmed this holding. Because we hold that confirmation of the debtor\u2019s Chapter 13 plan did not have the effect of lifting the creditor\u2019s statutory lien, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">\n<em>Facts and Proceedings Below</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Benjamin P. Simmons contracted to have J.T. Saveli, a plumber, perform certain work on Simmons\u2019 homestead. The work, which included the purchase and installation of plumbing fixtures, was begun on December 26, 1978, and completed on June 8, 1979, with the cost totalling $3,537.75.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">On May 1, 1980, Saveli filed a notice of construction lien with the Chancery Clerk of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi, for the labor and materials furnished on the plumbing contract. Thereafter, on May 14, 1980, Saveli filed in state court a Declaration to Enforce Lien on Real Property (\u201cdeclaration to enforce lien\u201d) against Simmons, the Independent Life and Accident Insurance Company (ILA), and the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claiming a construction lien in the amount of $3,537.75, together with interest and attorney\u2019s fees. The ILA filed an answer in the proceeding, but no further action has been taken in the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">On June 9,1980, Simmons filed a petition for relief in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Mississippi under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (Code), 11 U.S.C. ch. 7. On July 30, 1980, Saveli filed a proof of claim identifying his claim as secured by a construction lien. Saveli appended exhibits to the proof of claim, including copies of the original invoice, the lien notice, and the declaration to enforce lien pending in state court. Simmons then petitioned for conversion of his case to one under Chapter 13 of the Code, 11 U.S.C. ch. 13. The bankruptcy court ordered such conversion on September 3, 1980. On September 29, 1980, Simmons filed a petition and plan under Chapter 13. The plan listed the debt to Saveli as unsecured but disputed, making reference to the state court action to enforce the lien. The plan proposed a deferred 10% cash payout to unsecured creditors. On November 18, 1980, Saveli again filed a proof of claim, which indicated that his claim was secured by a statutory lien and which again incorporated as exhibits copies of the invoice, the lien notice, and the declaration to enforce lien. Again the claim made specific reference to the state court action to enforce the lien. Paragraph 11 of the proof-of-elaim form called for Saveli as claimant to indicate whether he accepted or rejected the plan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Saveli placed an \u201cX\u201d in the box marked \u201cClaimant accepts\u201d but added the following typewritten statement: \u201cCreditor objects to his claim being scheduled as unsecured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">The bankruptcy court, on May 26, 1981, entered an order confirming Simmons\u2019 plan. The order recites that no objections to confirmation of the plan were considered and that no one other than the trustee and Simmons\u2019 attorney appeared at the confirmation hearing. On July 28,1981, the trustee filed a motion to allow claims, which listed Saveli\u2019s claim as unsecured and which provided that the listed claims would be deemed allowed for the purpose of distribution unless objection was made by a party in interest within thirty days. Saveli filed no objection to this motion. Saveli has received payments under the plan since confirmation, but Saveli insists that the checks have not been cashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>On April 19, 1982, Simmons filed a Motion for Authorization to Sell Real Property, namely, his homestead, which was approved by the trustee and apparently agreed to by all lienholders of record, including Saveli. The bankruptcy court entered the order authorizing the sale on April 26, 1982. The order provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that Simmons escrow the sum of $3,322.88 from the sale proceeds pending resolution of the status of Saveli\u2019s purported construction lien. The property was sold, and the funds escrowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">On August 2, 1982, Simmons filed the instant adversary action in bankruptcy court, seeking an order that Saveli cancel the lien notice and an award of attorney\u2019s fees for Saveli\u2019s wilful failure to cancel the lien. Saveli answered and counterclaimed, seeking a judgment that his claim was secured, relief from the automatic stay to enforce his lien, and an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">After a hearing, on December 8, 1982, the bankruptcy court refused to cancel Sa-veli\u2019s lien and further held that the lien, which was perfected before Simmons filed his original petition in bankruptcy, was valid and enforceable, could not be avoided, and entitled to full satisfaction. In an opinion filed on February 22, 1983, the bankruptcy court reasoned that statutory liens are recognized as secured claims against a debtor in bankruptcy so long as the lien is not subject to avoidance under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 545. Section 545, the court continued, does not describe a situation when a lien \u201ccan be avoided because the debt is included in the plan and the creditor fails to object.\u201d Further, the court rejected Simmons\u2019 theories under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1327 that Saveli\u2019s failure to object to the plan constituted a waiver of his rights under the lien or that confirmation of the plan had the effect of vesting the homestead in Simmons free and clear of the lien. Simmons appealed the decision to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi and applied for a stay of execution of the judgment pending appeal, which was granted on December 29, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">In a memorandum opinion and order dated October 9, 1984, the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s holding that Saveli\u2019s construction lien remained valid after confirmation of the Chapter 13 plan. The district court, holding that a perfected construction lien is not enforceable under Mississippi law until judgment is entered pursuant to Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 85-7-141 to -151, reversed the bankruptcy court\u2019s determination that the lien was enforceable and remanded the case to the bankruptcy court for the purpose of itself adjudicating the issue of enforceability or directing the parties to proceed with the action pending in state court, the resolution of which would require the adjudication of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Simmons appeals the decision of the district court regarding the validity of Saveli\u2019s lien after the confirmation of Simmons\u2019 Chapter 13 plan. The district court\u2019s decision to remand the issue of enforceability to the bankruptcy court is not appealed by either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">On appeal, the parties continue to propound the same arguments that have carried them to this pass. Simmons contends that Saveli has waived his right to the lien recorded against Simmons\u2019 homestead. Simmons emphasizes the central place of the wage earner plan in facilitating Congress\u2019 purpose for Chapter 13 \u2014 viz., encouraging individual debtors to reorganize rather than liquidate by using future income to satisfy at least a portion of their outstanding obligations to creditors. Once Simmons\u2019 plan was confirmed, Simmons continues, Saveli was bound by the terms of the plan, which listed Saveli\u2019s claim as unsecured. After all, Saveli raised no objection to confirmation and had in fact \u201caccepted\u201d the plan although noting an objection to the classification of his claim as unsecured. Under section 1327, the order of confirmation vests all of the property of the estate in the debtor free and clear of any claim or interest of any creditor provided for by the plan. Construing the terms \u201cclaim or interest\u201d to include a lien, Simmons concludes that the confirmation of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Chapter 13 plan effectively vested the homestead in him free of the lien. Further, because Saveli\u2019s claim was allowed as an unsecured claim under Simmons\u2019 plan and because 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(d) mandates that any lien securing such a claim is void, Simmons asserts that Saveli\u2019s lien is a dead letter and that Saveli should be required to cancel it of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Saveli responds with three arguments. First, Saveli maintains that the Code, particularly section 545, which governs the avoidance of statutory liens, does not authorize the avoidance of a statutory lien simply because the debtor listed the purported lienholder\u2019s claim as unsecured and the lienholder did not object to confirmation of the plan. Second, Saveli asserts that his proof of secured claim should have been deemed allowed and treated by the plan as such because no objection to the proof of claim was ever filed by the debtor or any party in interest. Finally, notwithstanding Simmons\u2019 assertion to the contrary, confirmation of the Chapter 13 plan cannot have the effect of lifting liens on property of the estate. The debtor could not be vested by the act of confirmation with any greater interest in the property of the estate \u2014 i.e., property unencumbered by a lien \u2014 than had been vested in the estate when the petition in bankruptcy was originally filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">An understanding of the codal structure for the allowance or disallowance of creditors\u2019 claims is critical to a proper understanding and analysis of this case. Section 501(a) of the Code permits a creditor to file a proof of claim. Although the filing of a proof of claim may be a prerequisite to the allowance of certain claims, no creditor is required to file a proof of claim. H.R.Rep. No. 595, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 351 (1977), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5963, 6307 [hereinafter cited as House Report]; S.Rep. No. 989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 61, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 5787, 5847 [hereinafter cited as Senate Report]. \u00c1 proof of claim should be filed only when some purpose would be served. 3 Collier on Bankruptcy 501.01, at 501-3 (15th ed. 1985). For example, \"filing may prove necessary when the claim incorrectly appears in the debt- or\u2019s schedules or when the schedules list the claim as disputed, contingent or unliqui-dated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The filing of a proof of claim might also be required by a request for a determination of the secured status of a claim under section 506 and allowance or disallowance under section 502. Otherwise, proof of a secured claim need not be filed. Bankr.R. 3002 advisory committee note (\u201cA secured claim need not be filed or allowed under \u00a7 502 or \u00a7 506(d) unless a party in interest has requested a determination and allowance or disallowance under \u00a7 502.\u201d). Under Bankruptcy Rule 3001, which delineates the basic essentials of a proof of claim, a proof of secured claim should be filed in writing, executed by the creditor or the creditor\u2019s authorized agent, and should be accompanied by the writing on which the secured claim is based and by evidence that the security interest has been perfected. In a Chapter 13 case, the proof of claim should be filed with the clerk of the court in which the case is pending within ninety days after the first date set for a meeting of creditors. Bankr.R. 3002.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">The Code provides that \u201c[a] claim or interest, proof of which is filed under section 501 of this title, is deemed allowed, unless a party in interest... objects.\u201d <footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502(a). A proof of claim executed and filed in accordance with the Bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Rules constitutes prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Bankr.R. 3001(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The procedure for objecting to a claim is established in part by Bankruptcy Rule 3007, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">An objection to the allowance of a claim shall be in writing and filed with the court. A copy of the objection with notice of the hearing thereon shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to the claimant, the debtor or debtor in possession and the trustee at least 30 days prior to the hearing. If an objection to a claim is joined with a demand for relief of the kind specified in Rule 7001, it becomes an adversary proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The objection to a claim initiates a contested matter unless the objection is joined with a counterclaim asking for the kind of relief specified in Bankruptcy Rule 7001.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition to the requirements of Rule 9014, which governs contested matters, Rule 9004 specifies that the objection contain a proper caption designating it an objection to a proof of claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It has been said that the filing of a proof of claim is tantamount to the filing of a complaint in a civil action, <em>see Nortex Trading Corp. v. Newfield, </em>311 F.2d 163 (2d Cir.1962), and the trustee\u2019s formal objection to the claim, the answer. <em>See </em>3 Collier on Bankruptcy 1f 502.01, at 502-16. Upon the filing of an objection, the trustee must produce evidence tending to defeat the claim that is of a probative force equal to that of the ereditor\u2019s proof of claim. <em>Id. </em>at 502-17; <em>see also In re Eastern Fire Protection, Inc., </em>44 B.R. 140 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>neither the trustee nor Simmons filed an objection to Saveli\u2019s proof of secured claim before confirmation. Simmons\u2019 Chapter 13 plan, which listed Saveli\u2019s claim as unsecured but disputed, cannot be deemed to constitute such an objection. The purpose of filing an objection is to join issue in a contested matter, thereby placing the parties on notice that litigation is required to resolve an actual dispute between the parties. <em>See </em>Bankr.R. 9014 advisory committee note. An objection to a proof of claim filed in accordance with Rules 3007, 9004, and 9014 clearly places in issue the allowance or disallowance of that claim as filed. The parties are put on notice that the objection will have to be resolved before a final determination is made as to the allowance or disallowance of the claim. In contrast, the filing of a Chapter 13 plan does not initiate a contested matter. When a plan is filed with the petition, as permitted under Rule 3015, it is unlikely at that time that creditors have even contemplated filing proofs of claims. When the creditor files a proof of claim subsequent to the filing of the plan, the Code and the Rules clearly impose the burden of placing the claim in dispute on any party in interest desiring to do so by means of filing an objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-12\">In the case at bar, Saveli\u2019s proof of claim, although filed after Simmons peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>tioned for relief under Chapter 7, was of record when the case was converted to one under Chapter 13 and when Simmons thereafter filed his Chapter 13 petition and plan. Regardless, given the differences in purpose and effect of filing a plan and lodging an objection, Simmons\u2019 filing of the plan did not clearly place the claim in issue. The plan is like a proof of claim to which objections are filed, thereby instituting contested matters, rather than a vehicle through which objections are made. There is no statement in the plan that it was intended as an objection to Saveli\u2019s proof of claim. Moreover, there is no indication in the record that the plan was served with a notice of hearing on an objection purportedly asserted by the plan to a previously filed proof of claim, as is required by Rule 3007. The Code and the Rules do not envision the use of a plan as a means for objecting to proofs of claims. Consequently, we hold that Simmons\u2019 plan did not constitute an objection to Saveli\u2019s proof of secured claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Rule 3007 establishes no time limit for objecting to the allowance of a claim. Nevertheless, section 502(b) provides that, in the absence of an objection by a party in interest, a proof of claim is deemed allowed. We must determine then when a secured claim, proof of which has been timely filed in a Chapter 13 case, must be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">This issue was presented to the court in <em>In re Hartford, </em>7 B.R. 914 (Bankr.D.Me. 1981). In that case, after the claimant filed a proof of secured claim and no party in interest objected to the claim, the debtors\u2019 Chapter 13 plan, which listed a claimant as a \u201clong term claimant,\u201d was confirmed. The claimant moved for reconsideration of the confirmation order, seeking to have its claim allowed as secured rather than to be listed as a \u201clong term claimant.\u201d In resolving the issue as to when a proof of secured claim must be deemed allowed, the court made reference to two sections of the Code applicable to Chapter 13 cases both of which clearly require a determination of a claim\u2019s status before confirmation of a Chapter 13 plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">In particular, the court reasoned that \u201c[sjection 506(a), made applicable to Chapter 13 cases by section 103(a), requires, as to <em>each allowed secured claim, </em>a valuation of the creditor\u2019s security in conjunction with a hearing on confirmation of the Chapter 13 plan.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 916 (emphasis in original). Further, section 1325(a)(5) requires as one of the six prerequisites to confirmation of a Chapter 13 plan that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmP\">with respect to each <em>allowed secured claim </em>provided for by the plan\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-11\">(A) the holder of such claim has accepted the plan;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-12\">(B) (i) the plan provides that the holder of such claim retain the lien securing such claim; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-13\">(ii) the value, as of the effective date of the plan, of property to be distributed under the plan on account of such claim is not less than the allowed amount of such claim; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-14\">(C) the debtor surrenders the property securing such claims to such holder____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-16\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(a)(5) (emphasis added). Hence, under sections 506(a) and 1325(a)(5), a proof of secured claim must be acted upon \u2014 that is, allowed or disallowed \u2014 before confirmation of the plan or the claim must be deemed allowed for purposes of the plan. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502(a). We find this reasoning of the court in <em>In re Hartford </em>persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>In addition, section 1325(a)(4) requires that, before a wage earner plan shall be confirmed, the court must determine that the value of the property to be distributed in settlement of each allowed unsecured claim is not less than the amount that would be paid if the estate of the debtor were liquidated under Chapter 7. A determination of the liquidation value under this section is facilitated by resolving before confirmation whether the claims shall be allowed or disallowed as filed. <em>Cf </em>5 Collier on Bankruptcy j| 1325.01[D][b][iv], at 1325-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Hence, because no objection was filed before confirmation of Simmons\u2019 Chapter 13 plan, Saveli\u2019s claim should have been deemed an allowed secured claim for purposes of confirmation.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">A bankruptcy court is required to confirm a proposed wage earner plan if the plan satisfies the six requirements set out in section 1325. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(a); <em>see </em>House Report, <em>supra, </em>at 430; Senate Report, <em>supra, </em>at 142. Section 1325(a)(5), excerpted above, essentially provides that, before a plan can be confirmed: (1) all secured creditors must accept the plan; (2) the plan must provide that a secured creditor who does not accept the plan retain his lien <em>and </em>that the value, as of the effective date of the plan, of property to be distributed under the plan is not less than the allowed amount of the claim;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or (3) the plan must provide for the debtor to surrender the property securing a claim to the secured creditor who does not accept the plan. Unless one of these three circumstances exists, a proposed plan should not be confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">At the outset, it is probably true that confirmation of Simmons\u2019 Chapter 13 plan was improper because it did not provide for Saveli\u2019s claim as an allowed secured claim, but instead listed it as unsecured. Regardless, in the case at bar, none of the three circumstances described in section 1325(a)(5) can be said to exist. First, although Simmons alleges that Saveli accepted the proposed wage earner plan as evidenced by the \u201cX\u201d he typed in the box denominated \u201cClaimant accepts,\u201d his appending the typewritten objection to the scheduling of his claim as unsecured is tantamount to a rejection of the plan. Certainly a creditor\u2019s avowed acceptance of all portions of a wage earner plan, except the plan\u2019s treatment of his own claim, to which he expressly objects, cannot constitute an acceptance of the plan for purposes of section 1325(a)(5)(A).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Second, Simmons\u2019 plan made no provision that Saveli retain the lien on Simmons\u2019 homestead. Simmons\u2019 argument on appeal that confirmation of the plan had the effect of dissolving the lien on the homestead contravenes any assertion under section 1325(a)(5)(B) that the plan provided for retention of the lien. Finally, the plan expressly states that Simmons did not propose to surrender any property to the holder of secured claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">Therefore, because the requisites of section 1325(a)(5) were not satisfied with regard to Simmons\u2019 proposed Chapter 13 plan, it was erroneously confirmed. Nevertheless, the order confirming Simmons\u2019 plan is not before us in this appeal. We are called upon, however, to determine what effect the confirmation of the plan may have had on Saveli\u2019s lien. It is to this issue that we now direct our attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">Section 1327 describes the effect of confirmation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-11\">(a) The provisions of a confirmed plan bind the debtor and each creditor, whether or not the claim of such creditor is provided for by the plan, and whether or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>not such creditor has objected to, has accepted, or has rejected the plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\">(b) Except as otherwise provided in the plan or the order confirming the plan, the confirmation of a plan vests all of the property of the estate in the debtor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">(c) Except as otherwise provided in the plan or in the order confirming the plan, the property vesting in the debtor under subsection (b) of this section is free and clear of any claim or interest of any creditor provided for by the plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Simmons contends that under section 1327(a) all creditors, including Saveli, are bound as to all issues actually decided by the order of confirmation as well as all issues that could have been decided at the hearing on confirmation, citing <em>In re Lewis, </em>8 B.R. 132 (Bankr.D.Idaho 1981). Simmons urges that one of the effects of Saveli\u2019s being bound by the confirmed Chapter 13 plan, which treats Saveli\u2019s claim as unsecured, is a lifting of the lien from the homestead. In particular, Simmons relies upon the language of subsections 1327(b) and (c), which provide that the order of confirmation vests all of the property of the estate in the debtor free and clear of any \u201cclaim or interest\u201d of any creditor unless otherwise provided in the plan or order of confirmation. Hence, Simmons concludes, upon confirmation, the homestead passed to Simmons free and clear of the lien. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">In facing this precise contention in <em>In re Honaker, </em>4 B.R. 415 (Bankr.E.D.Mich. 1980), the court noted that section 1327 relates only to property of the estate as defined in sections 541 and 1306(a). Said the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-10\">By Section 541(a)(1) the estate was vested with the same interest in the collateral that the debtor had, that is, an interest subject to a valid security interest. There has been no action in this case to void or set aside the lien securing the Bank\u2019s claim. Then, by operation of Section 1327(b), that same interest is shifted again, this time from the estate back to the debtor. The question arises whether, by virtue of Section 1327(c), the debtor receives a greater interest than the estate had, in that the property is no longer subject to any liens. The language of Section 1327(c) is \u201cfree and clear of any <em>claim or </em>interest\u201d____ \u201cClaim\u201d is defined in the Code at Section 101(4). A \u201cclaim\u201d is distinct from a \u201clien,\u201d which is defined in Section 101(28). The term \u201cinterest\u201d is nowhere defined in the Code, but it would be odd if Congress had chosen that undefined term to mean \u201clien,\u201d when they could have used the defined term \u201clien\u201d and avoided uncertainty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-15\">4 B.R. at 416-17.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> After delineating the parameters of the dispute over the meaning of the terms \u201cclaim or interest,\u201d and having observed that the legislative history of section 1327(c) offers no insight regarding this issue, a leading commentator writes that \u201c[mjatters are further confused by the fact that there appears to be no sound reason for lifting liens by operation of law at confirmation under chapter 13.\u201d 5 Collier on Bankruptcy ([ 1327.01[3], at 1327-5. Nor are we able to discern any reason for such an effect. Therefore, we agree with the <em>In re Honaker </em>court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[t]he reading of Section 1327 urged by [the debtor] would have the Debt- or materially improve his financial position, by unencumbering [secured] assets, through the simple expedient of passing his property through the estate. This result has little to recommend it.\u201d 4 B.R. at 417; <em>see also In re Levine, </em>45 B.R. 333 (N.D.Ill. 1984) (bank\u2019s lien on Chapter 13 debtor\u2019s automobile remained intact, entitling bank to proceeds of vehicle\u2019s sale, although bank failed to file timely proof of claim against debtor\u2019s automobile, and notwithstanding confirmation of Chapter 13 plan); <em>In re Rhoades, </em>34 B.R. 168, 170 (Bankr.D.Vt. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-17\">Such a result would fare no better under the particular facts of the case at bar. It would be anomalous indeed were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>we to permit Simmons a windfall for his mischaracterization of Saveli\u2019s claim in the plan as unsecured. <em>Cf. Whiteford Plastics Co. v. Chase National Bank, </em>179 F.2d 582 (2d Cir.1950). It is clear that Saveli\u2019s claim should have been deemed an allowed secured claim at the time of confirmation and treated as such in the plan if the plan was to be confirmed. That did not happen. It is also apparent that Saveli should have objected to confirmation, and, had his objection not been sustained, he should have appealed the order of confirmation. But that also did not happen. Nevertheless, Saveli\u2019s failure to interpose an objection to the plan or to appeal the confirmation order should not now be permitted to justify avoidance of a lien securing a claim that was originally deemed an allowed secured claim as a result of Simmons\u2019 failure to object to Saveli\u2019s timely filed proof of secured claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Only recently has the Seventh Circuit through Judge Posner recalled the long line of cases allowing \u201ca creditor with a loan secured by a lien on the assets of a debtor who becomes bankrupt before the loan is repaid to ignore the bankruptcy proceeding and look to the lien for satisfaction of the debt.\u201d <em>In re Tarnow, </em>749 F.2d 464, 465 (7th Cir.1984).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Entirely consistent with this view is the oft-repeated observation that \u201c[a] secured claim need not be filed or allowed under \u00a7 502 or \u00a7 506(d) unless a party in interest has requested a determination and allowance or disallowance under \u00a7 502.\u201d Bankr.R. 3002 advisory committee note; <em>see </em>1 Norton Bankruptcy Law and Practice \u00a7 28.27, at 28-18 (1985).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In <em>In re Tarnow, </em>the court faced the issue whether the late filing of a claim secured by a lien on the crops and equipment of the debtor extinguished the lien. The creditor did not appeal the bankruptcy court\u2019s disallowance of the claim as untimely. Refusing to accept the notion that the rejection of a claim automatically abrogates the lien, the court held that the lien had not been invalidated because no party requested the court to determine the validity of the lien. 749 F.2d at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">It is clear under the Code that any statutory lien that is valid under state law remains valid through bankruptcy unless invalidated by some provision of the Code. Section 545 delineates those circumstances in which a trustee may avoid a statutory lien.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Simmons contends that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>because Saveli has never established his lien pursuant to Mississippi law, there was no lien for the trustee or Simmons to avoid under section 545. Simmons seems to argue that Saveli has not taken the proper steps to establish and enforce the lien and that this failure now permits Simmons to avoid the lien. Saveli responds that his lien was properly perfected under Mississippi law. The bankruptcy court and the district court held that Saveli perfected his lien, by filing a notice of construction lien, before Simmons petitioned for relief in bankruptcy. We agree. Section 85-7-131 of the Mississippi Code provides that the construction lien created by that section takes effect from the time of commencing suit to enforce the lien <em>or </em>from the time notice of the contract, or the contract itself, under which the lien arose is filed in the office of the clerk of the chancery court. Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 85-7-131. Hence, by filing notice of the construction lien with the chancery clerk, Simmons perfected his lien. That the issue of enforceability remains to be decided upon remand does not negate the fact that Saveli\u2019s lien was perfected in accordance with state law. Thus, having failed to bring an avoidance action under section 545 to avoid Saveli\u2019s properly perfected lien on his homestead, Simmons, without a shred of authority, now asks us to add to the provisions of section 545 a means of avoidance for a situation involving a lienholder who fails to object to the confirmation of a wage earner plan incorrectly listing his claim as unsecured. We decline the invitation as inappropriate and unsupported.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">Simmons asserts that Saveli\u2019s lien is void under section 506(d) of the Code. At the time the instant action was filed, section 506(d) read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-12\">To the extent that a lien secures a claim against the debtor that is <em>not an allowed secured claim, </em>such lien is void, unless\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-13\">(1) a party in interest has not requested that the court determine and allow or disallow such claim under section 502 of this title; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-14\">(2) such claim was disallowed only under section 502(e) of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-15\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(d) (1982) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Simmons argues that Saveli\u2019s claim is an allowed unsecured claim, not an allowed secured claim, and is void under section 506(d). The legislative history of this provision states that \u201c[s]ubsection (d) permits liens to pass through the bankruptcy case unaffected. However, if a party in interest requests the court to determine and allow or disallow the claim secured by the lien under section 502 and the claim is not allowed, then the lien is void____\u201d House Report, <em>supra, </em>at 357; <em>cf. </em>Senate Report, <em>supra, </em>at 68.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We previously observed that Saveli\u2019s claim was deemed to be an allowed secured claim pursuant to section 502(a). Consequently, Saveli\u2019s lien is not void under the express provisions of section 506(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-18\">Simmons contends, however, that, under section 1327(a), he and each creditor, including Saveli, are bound by the terms of the confirmed Chapter 13 plan, which provided for Saveli\u2019s claim as unsecured. He relies on <em>In re Lewis, </em>8 B.R. 132 (Bankr.D. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Idaho 1981), which held that under section 1327(a) an order of confirmation was res judicata as to all justiciable issues decided or which could have been decided at the hearing on confirmation, including the issues of adequate protection, equity in the property, and the necessity of the property for an effective reorganization of the debt- or\u2019s affairs. A leading authority has said that \u201c[ajbsent timely appeal, the confirmed plan is res judicata and its terms are not subject to collateral attack.\u201d 5 Collier on Bankruptcy 1327.01, at 1327-2 (citing <em>In re Flick, </em>14 B.R. 912 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1981)). The court in <em>In re Flick </em>held, <em>inter alia, </em>that confirmation of a plan providing for payment of a claim precluded the creditor from seeking relief from the stay to enforce the claim outside the plan absent some subsequent aggravating circumstances. <em>See also In re Gregory, </em>705 F.2d 1118, 1121 (9th Cir.1983); <em>In re Abercrombie, </em>39 B.R. 178 (Bankr.N.D.Ga.1984). We do not take issue with these authorities. Instead, we examine the essential elements of a Chapter 13 plan along with the requirements of section 506(d). The Senate Report states that \u201cChapter 13 is designed to serve as a flexible vehicle for the repayment of part or all of the allowed claims of the debtor.\u201d Senate Report, <em>supra, </em>at 141. The plan must provide for the submission of all or a portion of future earnings or other future income to the trustee to the extent that it is necessary for the execution of the plan; the plan must provide for full payment of all claims entitled to priority under section 507 of the Code; and, if claims are classified, the plan must accord each claim within a particular class the same treatment. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322(a). In addition, section 1322(b)(10) provides that the Chapter 13 plan may \u201cinclude any other appropriate provision not inconsistent with this title.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Under section 506(d), when a party in interest has not requested that the court determine and allow or disallow a claim under section 502, a lien cannot be void. <em>See </em>Hagedorn, <em>The Survival and Enforcement of the Secured Claim Under the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, </em>54 Am.Bankr.L.J. 1, 27 (1980). In the case at bar, to allow Simmons\u2019 plan to effect an avoidance of Saveli\u2019s lien would be inconsistent with section 506(d). The court in <em>In re Spadel, </em>28 B.R. 537 (Bankr.E.D.Pa. 1983), responding to the debtors\u2019 contention that a third mortgagee was bound by the terms of a confirmed plan proposing to avoid the mortgage lien on the debtors\u2019 residence, held that the third mortgagee\u2019s lien passed through the debtors\u2019 bankruptcy proceeding unaffected pursuant to section 506(d). Said the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">As to the debtors!\u2019] contention that [the third mortgagee's] lien is avoided because the confirmed plan provided that said lien was to be avoided, we find it dispositive that [the third mortgagee\u2019s] lien is expressly unavoidable by virtue of section 506(d)(1). Section 1322(b)(10) provides that a plan under chapter 13 may \u201cinclude any other appropriate provision not inconsistent with this title.\u201d ... In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the provision in the debtors\u2019 plan proposing to avoid [the third mortgagee\u2019s] lien is plainly inconsistent with section 506(d)(1) of the Code. Therefore, we conclude that [the third mortgagee\u2019s] lien passes through the debtors\u2019 bankruptcy proceeding unaffected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">28 B.R. at 540 (citations and footnotes omitted) (emphasis in original). The factual posture of the case at bar, involving no express provision of a Chapter 13 plan proposing to avoid the lien, presents an even more compelling case for upholding the clear congressional intent to permit liens to pass through a bankruptcy case unaffected.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">The Seventh Circuit\u2019s discussion of section 506(d) in <em>In re Tarnow </em>is instructive. The court read section 506(d) as providing that the bankruptcy court will determine the validity of a lien only when a party in interest seeks such a determination and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>allowance or disallowance of the claim. 749 F.2d at 466; <em>see In re Rhoades, </em>34 B.R. 168, 170 (Bankr.D.Vt.1983). Because no party sought a determination of the status of the claim, the bankruptcy court did not rule on the validity of the lien. The bankruptcy court\u2019s disallowance of the claim, because the claim had been filed too late, did not amount to a finding that the lien was invalid. Nor did it extinguish the lien. The court looked to section 506(d)\u2019s legislative history for support, explaining that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aah-dedup-0\">the Senate version of section 506(d) had provided \u201cthat to the extent a secured claim is not allowed, its lien is void unless the holder had neither actual notice nor knowledge of the case____\u201d S.Rep. No. 598, <em>supra, </em>at 68. This could have been read to mean that the lien would be extinguished whatever the basis for disallowing the claim. But Congress enacted the House version, <em>see </em>124 Cong.Rec. 33997 (1978), which is less hospitable to such a reading.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 466-67. Further, the Seventh Circuit found that Congress\u2019 recent amendment of section 506(d)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> could only be viewed as codifying, <em>or recodifying, </em>the long-established rule of the <em>Long v. Bullard </em>line of cases that a secured creditor need not participate in a bankruptcy proceeding to preserve his lien.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">To hold that confirmation of Simmons\u2019 repayment plan had the effect of dissolving Saveli\u2019s statutory lien because the validity of his secured claim could have been decided at the confirmation hearing, had a party in interest requested the court to do so, would require us to ignore the rule of <em>Long v. Bullard </em>and to read section 506(d) out of the Code.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This we will not do. Therefore, having reviewed the essential elements of a Chapter 13 plan in the light of Code provisions concerning the effect of confirmation, particularly sections 1327 and 506, and persuaded that giving sway to Congress\u2019 intent that liens pass through bankruptcy unaffected does not frustrate Chapter 13\u2019s fresh start policy, we hold that Saveli\u2019s statutory lien on Simmons\u2019 homestead remained unimpaired by the order of confirmation. <em>See In re Willey, </em>24 B.R. 369, 371 (Bankr.E.D.Mich.1982) (secured creditor retains lien against collateral even when its claim is treated as unsecured under a confirmed Chapter 13 plan).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Au2\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b653-10\">.

Employing language similar to that used to explain Rule 13-302(e)(l), the advisory committee noted that \"(t]he automatic allowance effected by [former Rule 13-307(b), which provided that a claim was deemed allowed in the absence of objection by a party in interest,] is only for the purpose of distribution and does not constitute a determination as to the amount or validity of the claim for any other purpose.\u201d Former Bankr. Rule 13-307(b) advisory committee note, <em>quoted in In re Henderson, </em>577 F.2d 997, 1000 (5th Cir.1978). The court in <em>In re Hines, </em>20 B.R. 44, 48 (Bankr.S.D.Ohio 1982), observed that \"Bankruptcy Rule 13-302(e)(l) should not be interpreted to invalidate liens, but merely as it establishes the procedure for the efficient administration of the proceedings by permitting the treatment of secured creditors who do not file or who file late as unsecured only for purposes of distribution under an 11 U.S.C. Chapter 13 plan.\u201d The <em>In re Hines </em>court further stated that, \"if the plan does not provide for payment to the creditor in an amount equal to the creditor\u2019s security, then the lien should survive the Chapter 13 discharge.\u201d Thus, confirmation of a plan treating a claim as unsecured could only have been res judicata as to issues of voting and distribution determined by the plan, or which could have been determined by the plan, because the court would not have considered the validity of a claim in the absence of a request by a party in interest to do so. <em>See Rich v. Maryland Nat'l Bank, </em>42 B.R. 350 (D.Md.1984); <em>In re Wil-ley, </em>24 B.R. 369, 371 (Bankr.E.D.Mich.1982) (collecting cases). This conclusion is entirely consistent with the <em>Long v. Bullard </em>line of cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
