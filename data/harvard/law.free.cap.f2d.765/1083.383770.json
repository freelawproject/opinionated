He deducted, as an adjustment to income, the full amount of wages received, claiming that he was a \u201csource-exchanger\u201d and that therefore his wages were \u201cnon-taxable.\u201d Accordingly, he sought a refund of all income taxes withheld from wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-5\">Hyslep was assessed a $500 civil penalty under I.R.C. (26 U.S.C.) \u00a7 6702 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for filing a frivolous return. He then filed this suit under I.R.C. \u00a7 6703(c) for a refund of the penalty assessed. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the government. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-6\">On appeal, Hyslep asserts arguments long held to be frivolous. <em>See, e.g., Davis v. United States, </em>742 F.2d 171, 172 (5th Cir.1984); <em>Lonsdale v. Commissioner, </em>661 F.2d 71, 72 (5th Cir.1981). He argues that the Secretary of Treasury did not sustain his burden of proving a private individual is liable for tax; that the government does not have subject matter jurisdiction to tax him on all receipts; that he is not an individual subject to tax; that he did not derive any taxable profits (because wages received in compensation for labor are not taxable income); that he did not file a return; and that he was entitled to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-7\">The Constitution grants Congress the power to tax \u201cincomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several states.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. XVI. \u201cExercising this power, Congress has defined income as including compensation for services. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 61(a)(1).\u201d <em>Lonsdale, </em>661 F.2d at 72. There is no provision in the Internal Revenue Code permitting an individual wage earner to adjust his gross income by deducting a charge for the \u201cvalue of labor.\u201d Thus, the argument that individual wage earners are not subject to income tax is completely frivolous and without merit. <em>See, e.g., Simanonok v. Commissioner, </em>731 F.2d 743, 744 (11th Cir.1984); <em>Lons-dale, </em>661 F.2d at 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-13\">Taxpayer\u2019s 1982 return plainly falls within the scope of section 6702, justifying the $500 penalty. The completed and signed Form 1040, filed in order to obtain a refund of taxes withheld from wages, is a \u201cpurported return\u201d for section 6702 purposes. <em>See Madison v. United States, </em>752 F.2d 607, 609 (11th Cir.1985). The return contains information on its face indicating that the self-assessment was substantially incorrect and that taxpayer\u2019s conduct was based on a position which is frivolous. <em>Id.; Davis v. United States, </em>742 F.2d 171 (5th Cir.1984); <em>Holker v. United States, </em>737 F.2d 751 (8th Cir.1984). Therefore, the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-14\">Future litigants should heed the warning given by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in a similar situation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-15\">Appellants\u2019 contentions are stale ones, long settled against them. As such they are frivolous. Bending over backwards, in indulgence of appellants\u2019 pro se status, we today forbear the sanctions of Rule 38, Fed.R.App.P. We publish this opinion as notice to future litigants that the continued advancing of these long-defunct arguments invites such sanctions, however.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1188-16\"><em>Lonsdale, </em>661 F.2d at 72. Likewise, those who would litigate in this circuit are put on notice that they may be expected to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>sanctions imposed against them if they continue to raise these sorts of frivolous contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1188-8\">. \u00a7 6702.
