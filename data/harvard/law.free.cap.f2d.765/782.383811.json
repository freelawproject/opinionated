Subsequently Judge Tang was selected to replace Judge Ely on the panel. Judge Tang listened to the tapes of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>oral argument of August 7, 1984, and fully participated in this decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b887-21\"> The Honorable Pamela A.

At his deportation hearing he requested asylum or withholding of deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(h). He appeals the denial of his request as well as the refusal of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to deport him to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-20\">While the petitioner raises a number of issues, only two merit discussion. First, he challenges the denial of relief under \u00a7 1253(h). His generalized contention that because he is without documents he is a displaced person does not establish his right to asylum. He presented no evidence that El Salvador persecutes persons without documents, and none that he had ever been persecuted. We find no basis in the record for reversal of the Board of Immigration Appeal\u2019s decision denying relief. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number><em>Shoaee v. INS, </em>704 F.2d 1079, 1084 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">The petitioner\u2019s second claim is based upon the refusal of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to deport him to Mexico instead of to El Salvador. He contends that his deceased father was a citizen of Mexico, that since the age of nine he lived in Mexico with relatives, and that his family ties are all in Mexico rather than in El Salvador where he is a stranger.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">His request for designation of Mexico pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(a) apparently was routinely transmitted to the Mexican Consul and routinely denied without knowledge of the explanatory facts Rodriquez-Agustin asserts in support of his designation. He requests that his designation of Mexico be resubmitted with his statement of family ties to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">This court can order the Immigration and Naturalization Service to resubmit Rodriquez-Agustin\u2019s application for country of deportation to the Mexican Consul and stay the mandate of deportation until the application has been reconsidered. The alien\u2019s right to designate a country of deportation is a substantive right. <em>See Maldonado-Sandoval v. INS, </em>518 F.2d 278, 280 n. 3 (9th Cir.1975). Apparently, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (as the Attorney General designate) submits applications to the consulate of the country designated on behalf of the alien.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">The statute, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253(a), states: \u201cIf the government of the country designated by the alien fails finally to advise the Attorney General ... whether that government will or will not accept such alien ... such designation may thereafter be disregarded.\u201d <em>See also </em>C. Gordon &amp; H.N. Rosenfeld, <em>Immigration Law and Procedure, </em>\u00a7 5.17b (1985) (\u201c[T]he Attorney General must inquire whether the country designated will receive the deportee ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">Because a substantive right is involved, we order the Immigration and Naturalization Service to resubmit the application with the petitioner\u2019s statement as part of the vindication of the right. Rodriquez-Agustin had no counsel when he designated Mexico as his \u00a7 1253(a) destination, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service failed to communicate relevant facts to the Mexican Consul. Deportation is stayed until such time as the Immigration and Naturalization Service resubmits the application under \u00a7 1253(a) and receives a response from the Mexican Consul.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">The decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals is affirmed but deportation is temporarily stayed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
