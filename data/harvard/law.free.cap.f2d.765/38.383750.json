Hahnemann sought an order both enjoining District 1199C from proceeding to arbitration over a dispute concerning Hahne-mann\u2019s dietary department, and defining the scope of Hahnemann\u2019s duty to arbitrate under the collective bargaining agreement between Hahnemann and District 1199C. Because we believe that federal court interference in the parties\u2019 dispute at this time would be inconsistent both with the parties\u2019 agreement and with federal labor policy, we will affirm the order dismissing Hahne-mann\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Hahnemann operates a medical school and teaching hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. District 1199C is a labor organization that is the certified bargaining representative of service and maintenance employees of Hahnemann, including all dietary department employees who regularly work twenty or more hours per week. The relationship between the parties is governed by a collective bargaining agreement, which, <em>inter alia, </em>provides for the resolution of disputes between the parties through a grievance and arbitration procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">Prior to July, 1983, Hahnemann operated and managed its dietary department with its own staff of supervisors. During this time, Hahnemann employed approximately fourteen full-time employees in the dietary department. In July, 1983, however, Hah-nemann hired ARA Services, Inc. to reorganize and manage its dietary department. As part of this reorganization, Hahnemann laid off two full-time employees, reduced the hours of the other twelve full-time employees to below twenty hours per week, and hired approximately thirty part-time employees. The effect of this reorganization was to remove the dietary department from coverage under the collective bargaining agreement by employing only workers who logged less than twenty hours per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">The union then filed a grievance under the collective bargaining agreement, characterizing the reduction in hours and subsequent removal from the bargaining unit as a lay-off subject to Article IX of that agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When the parties failed to settle the grievance in the first steps of the grievance procedure, the union submitted the dispute to arbitration. The parties appointed an arbitrator, and, after a postponement, scheduled the arbitration hearing for July 30, 1984. On the morning of the hearing, Hahnemann objected to the arbitration on the grounds that the collective bargaining agreement did not give the arbitrator \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to hear the dispute. After settlement negotiations failed, Hahnemann brought this action in the federal district court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-15\">Hahnemann\u2019s position centers on the contractual language outlining the grievance-arbitration procedure in the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement. Article VI of that agreement, entitled \u201cGRIEVANCE PROCEDURE,\u201d requires the parties to fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>low a three-step procedure for any grievance concerning the interpretation of or alleged violation of the agreement,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Step three of that procedure provides that \u201c[i]f no satisfactory settlement [at steps one or two] is reached the grievance may be appealed to arbitration by the Union----\u201d Thus, the grievance-arbitration procedure seemingly covers a broad range of disputes under the contract, <em>i.e., </em>any dispute involving the interpretation of or alleged violation of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Hahnemann contends, however, that the next article in the collective bargaining agreement, entitled \u201cARBITRATION,\u201d limits the broad scope of Article VI. Article VII provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\"><em>Authority of Arbitrator. </em>The arbitrator will make his findings and render his decision to resolve the disagreement. The arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction to add to, modify, vary, change or remove any terms of this Agreement or to determine that any provision of this Agreement establishes an implied limitation upon Hahnemann which is not herein specifically set forth. The scale of wages established by this Agreement shall not be changed by any arbitration decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">Hahnemann argues that this clause, particularly the phrase \u201cshall not have jurisdiction ... to determine that any provision of this Agreement establishes an implied limitation upon Hahnemann ...\u201d divests the arbitrator of jurisdiction over the dispute concerning the dietary department. Hah-nemann argues that because no express limitation on Hahnemann\u2019s right to reorganize departments exists in the agreement, and indeed because the agreement\u2019s Management Rights clause provides Hah-nemann with the authority to reorganize departments, the arbitrator cannot as a matter of contract find for the union.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>In essence, then, Hahnemann\u2019s position is that because the arbitrator could not find for the union in this dispute without implying a limitation on Hahnemann, the arbitrator does not have jurisdiction over the dispute. This argument is untenable, however, both as a matter of contract, and as a matter of federal labor law. For these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing Hahnemann\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The question of arbitrability under a collective bargaining agreement is for the courts, and not arbitrators, to decide. <em>See, e.g., United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., </em>363 U.S. 574, 582, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 1352, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960) (section 301 gives \u201cthe courts the duty of determining whether the reluctant party has breached his promise to arbitrate\u201d). Arbitrability, however, does not turn on the parties\u2019 use of words such as \u201cjurisdiction\u201d or \u201cpower,\u201d but rather on the issue of what types of disputes the parties agreed should be resolved by private processes. <em>See, e.g., Teamsters v. Western Pennsylvania Motor Carriers Assoc., </em>574 F.2d 783, 788-89 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 828, 99 S.Ct. 102, 58 L.Ed.2d 122 (1978); <em>Boeing Co. v. UAW, </em>349 F.2d 412, 413 (3d Cir.1965). Further, because arbitration is favored under federal labor law, a court should order the reluctant party to submit the dispute to arbitration \u201cunless it may be said with positive assurance that an arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.\u201d <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., </em>363 U.S. at 582-83, 80 S.Ct. at 1352-1353. The favored status of arbitration derives from Congress\u2019 declared policy of promoting industrial peace through the collective bargaining process, rather than through the courts or economic warfare. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 171, 173(d) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">To resolve the issue of whether Hahne-mann and District 1199C agreed to submit their dispute over the dietary department to final and binding arbitration, we need go no further than the facts and holding of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Co., </em>363 U.S. 574, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960). In <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf, </em>the collective bargaining agreement contained both a broad definition of disputes subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure and, in the same clause, a limit on matters subject to arbitration. The agreement defined grievance as \u201cany differences ... as to the meaning and application of the provisions ...\u201d of the agreement, and provided that a grievance unresolved in the first four steps would be referred to arbitration. 363 U.S. at 576, 80 S.Ct. at 1349. The agreement also provided, however, that \u201cmatters which are strictly a function of Management shall not be subject to arbitration.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">The grievance at issue concerned the contracting-out of work by Warrior &amp; Gulf. Although the court recognized that contracting-out may have been \u201cstrictly a function of Management,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 584, 80 S.Ct. at 1353, it refused to decide the scope of the vague exclusionary clause, particularly given the broad scope of the grievance and arbitration clause. Instead, the Court stated \u201c[i]n the absence of any express provision excluding a particular grievance from arbitration, we think only the most forceful evidence of a purpose to exclude the claim from arbitration can prevail. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584-85, 80 S.Ct. at 1353-54. Indeed, the Court warned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-11\">[A] court should view with suspicion an attempt to persuade it to become entangled in the construction of the substantive provisions of a labor agreement, even through the back door of interpreting the arbitration clause, when the alternative is to utilize the services of an arbitrator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">The supposed \u201cexclusion\u201d clause in Hah-nemann and District 1199C\u2019s agreement is even more ambiguous than the clause in <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf. </em>Rather than excluding types of disputes that an arbitrator may hear, the clause instead restricts how an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>arbitrator may resolve disputes that reach arbitration. Thus, although the arbitrator may be restricted as to the result she may reach in the dietary department dispute, we may not say with \u201cpositive assurance\u201d that the parties did not intend that an arbitrator <em>hear </em>the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Hahnemann argues, however, that it does not make sense to order the dietary department dispute to arbitration if the arbitrator is restricted to finding for Hahnemann because of the management rights clause. Despite the simplistic appeal of this argument, it ignores a central tenet of federal labor law. Regardless of the supposed strength of Hahnemann\u2019s position in the dietary department dispute, Hahnemann contractually agreed to submit disputes to arbitration, including disputes over an arbitrator\u2019s authority. The issue of an arbitrator\u2019s authority to resolve a dispute properly before her, as with other issues concerning interpretation of contractual provisions, rests in the first instance with the arbitrator. <em>See W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. Local Union 759, </em>461 U.S. 757, 765, 103 S.Ct. 2177, 2183, 76 L.Ed.2d 298 (1983) (\u201cBecause the authority of arbitrators is a subject of collective bargaining, just as is any other contractual provision, the scope of the arbitrator\u2019s authority is itself a question of contract interpretation that the parties have delegated to the arbitrator.\u201d). When an employer and union agree to submit their disputes to arbitration as a means of avoiding industrial strife, they agree to submit all disputes, whether or not meritorious. Because processing grievances may be an alternative to disrupting production, \u201c[t]he objection that equity will not order a party to do a useless act is outweighed by the cathartic value of arbitrating even a frivolous grievance and by the dangers of excessive judicial intervention.\u201d <em>United Steelworkers of America v. American Mfg. Co., </em>363 U.S. 564, 568 n. 6, 80 S.Ct. 1343, 1347 n. 6, 4 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1960) (quoting Cox, <em>Current Problems in the Law of Grievance Arbitration, </em>30 Rocky Mt.L. Rev. 247, 261 (1958)).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Because Hahnemann has agreed to arbitrate its disputes with District 1199C over matters arising from the collective bargaining agreement, it may not seek court determination of the contractual validity of the reorganization of the dietary department, nor court determination of the arbitrator\u2019s authority to resolve the dispute. Subject to limited court review after arbitration, the parties have bargained for the arbitrator\u2019s judgment, and it is with her judgment that they must live. We will affirm the judgment of the district court and order the parties to proceed to arbitration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-10\">. Initially, the union did not identify the specific clause under which the grievance was filed. In its brief before this court, however, the union relies on the following part of Article IX:</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">If it becomes necessary to reduce Hahne-mann\u2019s work force because of lack of work, funding or an emergency that curtails normal operation, the following shall apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-12\">1. In the event of a layoff within a job classification, all non-bargaining unit employees in the classification affected shall be laid off first.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-17\">Presumably, the union is arguing that this reduction in hours was actually a reduction in force, and that this clause both restricts reductions in force to those instances of lack of work, lack of funding, or emergencies, and specifies the order in which employees should be laid off.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b144-7\">. ARTICLE VI provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</p>\n<p id=\"AmB\"><em>Procedure. </em>Should any grievance arise as to the interpretation of or alleged violation of this Agreement, <em>the </em>employee <em>or </em>employees affected or the Union shall process the grievance in accordance with the following procedure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-9\">STEP ONE. The employee or employees affected shall take the matter up with his supervisor within ten (10) days of its occurrence, either directly or through a union delegate in an attempt to effect a satisfactory settlement. The supervisor shall have five (5) days after the grievance was first presented to settle the matter. If no satisfactory settlement is reached the grievant or Union may within five (5) days after the supervisor\u2019s answer appeal to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-10\">STEP TWO. The grievance shall be reduced to writing by the grievant or the Union and referred to the grievant's Department Head or his authorized representative. A hearing on the grievance shall be convened if requested by either party. The Department Head or his authorized representative shall have five (5) days after receipt of the grievance to give his answer. If no satisfactory settlement is reached within five (5) days after the Department Head\u2019s answer the grievant or the Union may appeal the matter to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-11\">STEP THREE. The grievant or the Union will submit the written grievance to the Personnel Director who shall have ten (10) days in which to give his answer. A hearing on the grievance shall be convened if requested by either party. If no satisfactory settlement is reached the grievance may be appealed to arbitration by the Union upon written notice to Hahnemann and the American Arbitration Association by registered mail within ten (10) days of the answer of the Personnel Director, except in cases of discharge, in which the time period shall be thirty (30) calendar days. The Arbitration shall proceed in accordance with the current rules of the American Arbitration Association.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b144-15\">. ARTICLE XXXII provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b144-16\">MANAGEMENT RIGHTS</p>\n<p id=\"AbB\">The management of Hahnemann and the direction of the working force is vested exclusively with Hahnemann.
