The district court held that the ap-pellees were entitled to absolute quasi-judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>cial immunity and therefore could not be held liable to the appellants for damages. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The appellants were the plaintiffs in a state court proceeding in Wayne County Circuit Court entitled <em>Mills v. Franco. </em>Pursuant to Wayne County Circuit Court Rule 403, the plaintiffs were ordered to submit their case to mediation. Rule 403 states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">Rule 403 Mediation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqk\">.1 Eligible Cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">The court may submit any civil case to mediation when the relief sought is exclusively money damages or division of property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">.2 Manner of Selection of Cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">A case may be selected for mediation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-9\">(1) by stipulation of the parties at any time as long as mediation does not interfere with trial of the case,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-10\">(2) on written motion by a party and order of the court, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-11\">(3) on order of the chief judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-12\">.3 Objections to Mediation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-13\">To object to mediation, a party must:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-14\">(1) file a written motion with the clerk of the court and a copy with the mediation tribunal clerk within 15 days after the date of the court\u2019s notice assigning the case to mediation, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-15\">(2) serve a copy on opposing counsel and the chief judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-16\">If the motion is filed, the case may not be assigned for a mediation hearing until the chief judge, or a judge he assigns, has ruled on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-17\">.4 Mediation Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-18\">(a) Mediation boards will be composed of three attorneys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-19\">(b) The Mediation Tribunal Association shall select the mediators.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-20\">.7 Procedure for Mediation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-21\">(e) Action on Board\u2019s Decision. Written acceptance or rejection of the board\u2019s evaluation must be given to the tribunal clerk within 40 days of the mailing of the board\u2019s evaluation. There may be no disclosure of a party\u2019s acceptance or rejection of the board\u2019s evaluation until the expiration of 40 days following notification. At the expiration of the above period, the tribunal clerk shall send a notice indicating each counsel\u2019s acceptance or rejection of the board\u2019s evaluation. If the evaluation of the mediation board is rejected, the tri-tribunal clerk shall place all mediation documents in a sealed manila envelope before forwarding them to the County Clerk for filing. The envelope may not be opened in a nonjury ease until the trial judge has rendered judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-23\">.15 Effect of Mediation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-24\">(a) If the board\u2019s evaluation is not rejected under rule 403.7(c), a judgment will be entered in that amount, which includes all fees, costs and interest to the date of judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-25\">(b) If any party rejects the board\u2019s evaluation, the case proceeds to trial in the normal fashion. If the evaluation is $10,000 or less, a date for hearing before the chief judge will be set for the purpose of determining whether the case should be removed to the district court. A notice of hearing will be served on counsel for the parties at least 5 days before the hearing date. The chief judge will enter an order of removal unless objection to removal is made at the hearing. The penalty provisions still apply to cases which are removed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-26\">(c) When the board\u2019s evaluation is unanimous and the defendant accepts the evaluation but the plaintiff rejects it and the matter proceeds to trial, the plaintiff must obtain a verdict in an amount which, when interest on the amount and assessable costs for the date of filing of the complaint to the \u25a0 date of the mediation evaluation are added, is more than 10 percent great<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>er than the board\u2019s evaluation in order to avoid the payment of actual costs to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">(d) When the board\u2019s evaluation is unanimous, and the plaintiff accepts the board\u2019s evaluation but the defendant rejects it and the matter proceeds to trial, the defendant must obtain a verdict in an amount which, when interest on the amount and assessable costs from the date of filing of the complaint to the date of the mediation evaluation are added, is more than 10 percent below the evaluation of the board or pay actual costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">(e) When the board\u2019s evaluation is unanimous and both parties reject the board\u2019s evaluation and the amount of the verdict, when interest on the amount and assessable costs from the date of filing of the complaint to the date of the mediation evaluation are added, is within 10 percent above or below the board\u2019s evaluation, each party is responsible for his own costs from the mediation date. If the verdict is in an amount which, when interest on the amount and assessable costs from the date of filing of the complaint to the date of the mediation evaluation are added, is more than 10 percent above the board\u2019s evaluation, the defendant shall be taxed actual costs. If the verdict is in an amount which when interest on the amount and assessable costs from the date of filing of the complaint to the date of the mediation evaluation are added, is more than 10 percent below the board\u2019s evaluation, the plaintiff shall be taxed actual costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The appellants did not object to the mediation order. A mediation panel awarded the appellants $18,000, and the appellants failed to reject the award within the time period provided by Rule 403.7(e). The appellants therefore were deemed to have accepted the mediation award under Rule 403.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">The appellants then filed the present action in federal court against the three lawyers who served on the mediation panel. The appellants allege that the mediation process somehow violated their fourteenth amendment rights to equal protection and due process. They did not ask for declaratory or injunctive relief, but sought only damages for their alleged injuries. The district court found that the mediators serve a quasi-judicial function and were absolutely immune from damages, and the court therefore dismissed the action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>See Johnson v. Granholm, </em>662 F.2d 449, 450 (6th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>457 U.S. 1120, 102 S.Ct. 2933, 73 L.Ed.2d 1332 (1982); <em>Campbell v. Patterson, </em>724 F.2d 41, 43 (6th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1613, 80 L.Ed.2d 142 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-12\">The appellants do not nor can they contest that the mediators serve a quasi-judicial function and should normally be entitled to immunity, but they instead argue that the use of mediation panels in Michigan is unconstitutional under the Michigan constitution and that the mediators were therefore without jurisdiction to mediate the case. Because the mediators were without jurisdiction, as their argument goes, they lost their immunity pursuant to <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978), where the Supreme Court held that a judge can lose his absolute immunity if \u201che has acted in the \u2018clear absence of all jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357, 98 S.Ct. at 1105 (citations and footnote omitted). <em>See also Pulliam v. Allen, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1970, 1983, 80 L.Ed.2d 565 (Powell, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-15\">Thus, for the appellants\u2019 argument to be correct, the mediators must not only have acted without jurisdiction, they must have acted in the <em>clear </em>absence of all jurisdiction. A judicial officer acts in the clear absence of jurisdiction only if he knows that he lacks jurisdiction, or acts despite a clearly valid statute or case law expressly depriving him of jurisdiction. <em>Rankin v. Howard, </em>633 F.2d 844, 849 (9th Cir.1980); <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 939, 101 S.Ct. 2020, 68 L.Ed.2d 326 (1981). <em>See also Dykes v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number><em>Hosemann, </em>743 F.2d 1488, 1497 (11th Cir. 1984), <em>reh\u2019g en banc granted, </em>743 F.2d 1505 (11th Cir.1984). In this case, there is no statute or case law expressly depriving the mediators of jurisdiction. In fact, there is constitutional and statutory support for jurisdiction. Rule 403 was adopted as a local rule with the approval of the Michigan Supreme Court. <em>See MGM Brakes Division of Indianhead, Inc. v. Uni-Bond, Inc., </em>111 Mich.App. 467, 315 N.W.2d 170 (1981). Mich. Const, art. VI, \u00a7 5 provides in part that \u201cthe [Michigan] Supreme Court shall by general rules establish, modify, amend and simplify the practice and procedure in all courts of [Michigan].\u201d Moreover, Mich.Comp.Laws Ann. \u00a7 600.223 allows the Michigan Supreme Court \u201cto promulgate and amend general rules governing practices and procedure in the Supreme Court and all other courts of record____\u201d Given those provisions, we do not believe there was any clear statutory or constitutional proscription against mediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Although appellants allege in their complaint that the mediators knew they were without jurisdiction, we find this conclusory allegation to be legally impossible. As was just discussed, no clearly valid statute or case law would apprise the mediators of their alleged lack of jurisdiction. In fact, the appellants in this case are presently trying to get a ruling on the constitutionality of the mediation rule in state court. We do not see how the appellees, who must simply follow the dictates of the Michigan Supreme Court, could possibly know that the mediation rule was unconstitutional\u2014 if, in fact, it is \u2014 without guidance from the Michigan courts or the state legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
