In <em>Georgia Public Service Commission v. United States, </em>704 F.2d 538, 541 (11th Cir.1983), we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1625-6\">[A] finding of public convenience or [sic] necessity involves balancing competing interests: \u2018[t]he benefits to particular communities and commerce of continued operation must be weighed against the burden thereby imposed upon other commerce.\u2019 <em>Colorado v. United States, </em>271 U.S. 153, 168, 46 S.Ct. 452, 456, 70 L.Ed. 878, 885 (1926). <em>E.g., State of Texas v. United States, </em>642 F.2d 87, 90 (5th Cir.1981); <em>State of Nebraska v. United States, </em>255 F.Supp. 718, 721 (D.Neb. 1966). As we stated in <em>State of Texas v. United States, </em>642 F.2d at 90:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1625-7\">The Commission\u2019s role in abandonment proceedings is to balance the immediate and local interests of the community and the shippers against the broader public interest in freeing interstate commerce from undue burdens. The ICC must consider whether the branch line is profitable or whether it imposes a drain on other income, as well as the likely expense of continued operation,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1625-8\">(citation omitted). Balancing requires the ICC to take into account a number of relevant factors, including the profitability of the line and the expense of continued operation, <em>Purcell v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 381, 384, 62 S.Ct. 709, 710, 86 L.Ed. 910, 914 (1942), the likelihood of the line\u2019s future profitability, <em>People of the State of Illinois v. United States, </em>666 F.2d 1066, 1079 (7th Cir.1981); <em>State of Texas, </em>642 F.2d at 89, the availability of alternative transportation, <em>People of the State of Illinois, </em>666 F.2d at 1080; <em>State of Texas, </em>642 F.2d at 89, and the congressionally mandated examination of the harm to rural communities. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10903(a). [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1625-9\">The standard of appellate review of an ICC decision is very narrow. <em>Bloomer Shippers Association v. ICC, </em>679 F.2d 668 (7th Cir.1982). The scope of our review is directed only at the conclusion of the ICC. <em>State of Texas v. United States, </em>642 F.2d 87, 89 (5th Cir.1981). \u201cWe may only overturn the decision if it is unsupported by substantial evidence, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(E), or if it is \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Georgia Public Service Commission, </em>704 F.2d at 542. \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is relevant evidence acceptable by a reasonable mind as supporting a conclusion. <em>Refrigerated Transport Company, Inc. v. ICC, </em>616 F.2d 748, 751 (5th Cir.1980). \u201cIt is something more than a scintilla of evidence, but something less than the weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>McHenry v. Bond, </em>668 F.2d 1185, 1190 (11th Cir.1982). If there is substantial evidence in the record, it is beyond the appellate court\u2019s function to \u201csubstitute its own conclusions for those which the Commission had fairly drawn from such findings.\u201d <em>Bowman Transportation, Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., </em>419 U.S. 281, 285, 95 S.Ct. 438, 441, 42 L.Ed.2d 447 (1974) (citing <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 823, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971)). Under the arbitrary and capricious standard, \u201call the agency must do is articulate a rational connection between the facts and its conclusion.\u201d <em>Georgia Public Service Commission, </em>704 F.2d at 543. <em>See Bowman Transportation, Inc., </em>419 U.S. at 285, 95 S.Ct. at 441. Once the ICC has drawn its conclusion, an appellate court must give deference to the expertise of the agency. <em>Georgia Public Service Commission, </em>704 F.2d at 543; <em>People of State of Illinois v. ICC, </em>698 F.2d 868, 871 (7th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1625-11\"><em>Finance Docket 30202: </em>Purchase, Track-age Rights and Montgomery Terminal Agreements</p>\n<p id=\"ATry\">Alabama Public Service Commission and the other petitioners contend that the anti-competitive effects of Finance Docket 30202 and of the other dockets outweigh the public interest in meeting significant transportation needs. Petitioners find an abuse of discretion and lack of substantial evidence in (1) the failure of the ICC while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1522\">*1522</page-number>considering the anticompetitive effects of Finance Docket 30202, to evaluate the anti-competitive effects of the overall plan (those agreements specified and implicated under the other dockets before the ICC); (2) the purported error of the ICC in restricting the geographic market area for consideration of anticompetitive effects to the Montgomery-Maplesville corridor and not considering the entire region covered by all the dockets; and (3) in its classifying Finance Docket 30202 as a \u201cminor\u201d transaction which also prevented Robert Serlin from presenting his plan for operation of the entire Tuscaloosa to Montgomery segment of the ICG line.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1626-4\">Petitioners\u2019 contentions are without merit. First, mindful of our limited scope of review, we find that the ICC\u2019s decision to consider the applications individually, even while evaluating the existence of anticompetitive effects, was not an abuse of discretion. If the Department of Transportation (DOT) had approved the plans which were before the ICC as individual applications, then the ICC would have been required by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10904(d)(2) to consider whether the detriment caused by the proposed abandonments exceeded the benefits of the \u201cproposal as a whole.\u201d Because the Secretary of Transportation chose not to approve the coordinated plan, the ICC was not bound by the section 10904(d)(2) standard. Without the approval of the Secretary of Transportation as to the proposed agreement as a whole, it was not an abuse of discretion for the ICC to decline to consider the overall benefits of all the agreements while determining whether to grant the certificates of public convenience and necessity for the abandonments. <em>See Louisville and Nashville Railroad Co.\u2014Abandonment, </em>366 I.C.C. 1, 9 (1981). Second, it is not for the court of appeals to disturb the ICC\u2019s definition of the geographic and product markets for purposes of an anticompetitive effect evaluation based on the bare allegations of petitioners that a more broad definition is appropriate. Third, the determination of what filing requirements are appropriate for the application is totally within the expertise and discretion of the ICC. Petitioners have not shown that the ICC\u2019s classification is based on less than a scintilla of evidence or has no rational connection to the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-9\"><em>Docket AB-28 and AB-J/.3: </em>The Abandonments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-10\">Petitioners contend that the ICC erred in waiving submission of overhead traffic data: traffic moving over the line for which a fee is paid. Petitioners argue that this waiver effectively conceals $6 million of lost revenue as the result of the abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-11\">The test for determining whether the ICC has abused its discretion in waiving the filing of overhead traffic data is whether the traffic can be rerouted efficiently. <em>People of State of Illinois v. ICC, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1523\">*1523</page-number>698 F.2d 868, 873 (7th Cir.1983). The ICC found that traffic could be rerouted efficiently and \u201c[s]ince the ICC accords little weight to bridge traffic revenues and since bridge traffic routing is a matter of managerial discretion, we do not believe that discovery of the bridge traffic revenue would have altered the determination of the ICC in this instance.\u201d <em>People of State of Illinois, </em>698 F.2d at 873. As a result, therefore, no abuse of discretion can be found in the failure to require provision of overhead traffic data.</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-5\">Petitioners also contend that the ICC erred in failing to perceive a serious adverse impact on rural and community development because of the abandonments. The ICC found that with the exception of two shippers, motor transportation was sufficient to support the needs of the other shippers in the Union Springs-Montgomery area, and regarding the Tuscaloosa-Maples-ville abandonment. The ICC found that \u201conly four shippers will actually lose rail service\u201d while a major shipper, Union Camp, will be provided more efficient service. We agree with the ICC that \u201cwhile shippers are likely to incur inconvenience and increased costs as a result of a rail line abandonment, these factors are not sufficient to offset the detriment to the public interest of continued operation of uneconomic and excess facilities. <em>Chicago and Northwestern Transportation Co</em>.\u2014Aban<em>donment, </em>354 I.C.C. 1, 7 (1977).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-6\">Petitioners also argue that the ICC erred in its consideration of the availability of alternative transportation. They argue that this case is similar to the facts of <em>Georgia Public Service Commission v. United States, </em>704 F.2d 538 (11th Cir.1983). In <em>Georgia Public Service Commission, </em>the only record evidence to support the ICC\u2019s determination that alternative services were available, was the testimony of one railroad employee which did not verify the actual ability of alternative carriers to provide service, the proximity of major highways, nor the general logistics of transporting the goods to the carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-7\">The ICC\u2019s determination in this case does not demonstrate a total lack of foundation, as found in <em>Georgia Public Service, </em>requiring a finding of abuse of discretion or lack of substantial evidence. The ICC found that \u201c[ajlthough numerous parties protested the proposed abandonment, only four shippers will actually lose rail service. The largest shipper, Union Camp, did not oppose the abandonment. The record shows, moreover, that all the protesting shippers have used motor service, some for a significant percentage of their transportation needs.\u201d The adequacy of alternative transportation is only one factor within the balancing required by the public convenience and necessity test. <em>Colorado v. United States, </em>271 U.S. 153, 46 S.Ct. 452, 70 L.Ed. 878 (1926); <em>Georgia Public Service, </em>704 F.2d at 543. The inadequacy of alternative transportation as to some shippers does not require a finding and decision that alternative transportation services are inadequate as a whole, nor that the certificate of public convenience ought not be granted. \u201cThe benefits to particular communities and commerce of continued operation must be weighed against the burden thereby imposed upon other commerce.\u201d <em>Georgia Public Service, </em>704 F.2d at 541 (quoting <em>Colorado v. United States, </em>271 U.S. 153, 168, 46 S.Ct. 452, 456, 70 L.Ed. 878 (1926)). It was not errofr, therefore, for the ICC to conclude that alternative transportation services are adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-9\">\n<em>Impartial Hearing Officer.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1627-10\">Petitioners contend that they were denied a fair hearing because ICC Commissioner Gradison was partial to the interests of the railroads. As evidence of partiality, they point to the fact that Commissioner Gradison was an employee of Southern during the time the negotiations which produced Finance Docket 30202 were taking place. While conceding that the Commissioner was not directly involved in those negotiations, petitioners assert that Commissioner Gradison was \u201cfriendly with other Southern employees who were so involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1524\">*1524</page-number>Petitioners argue for a rule which would invalidate the vast majority of administrative proceedings where hearing officers had transferred from the private to public sector or vice versa. As the former Fifth Circuit held in <em>Parrish v. Board of Commissioners of the Alabama State Bar, </em>524 F.2d 98, 104 (5th Cir.1975): \u201cThe allegation of lack of impartiality stemming from ... acquaintanceship or friendship with witnesses and defense counsel is ... tenuous. It does not exceed what might be expected as background or associational activities with respect to the usual\u201d ICC commissioner. It is understood and expected that the expertise and experience gained through employment in a regulated industry can be of substantial benefit when subsequently employed with the regulator administrative agency. This connection, and a reasonable familiarity of persons and process, is not a per se violation of procedural due process. On the bare allegations that petitioners put forth we do not believe that Commissioner Gradison lacked impartiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-4\">Petitioners also contend that the ICC abused its discretion in failing to impose conditions on the abandonment and in not accepting the Serlin proposal to purchase the Tuscaloosa to Montgomery line. The ICC was well within its discretion in imposing the conditions that it imposed, and further, the Serlin proposal was not properly before the ICC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-6\">We hold, therefore, that the ICC\u2019s decision to grant authority for Finance Docket 30202 and to grant the certificates of public convenience and necessity in Dockets AB-28 and AB-43 was based on substantial evidence and was not an abuse of discretion nor arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1628-7\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1622-12\">.

Petitioners also contend that Southern has agreed with Seaboard not to establish a TOFC (piggyback) facility in Montgomery, \"not to establish a through route from Union Springs via Autauga Creek to Maplesville, to leave Seaboard with a 6-1 advantage on routes to Montgomery, and to restrict itself to serving Montgomery only over tracks owned and controlled by Seaboard. This also means Southern is leaving the market between Montgomery and southeast Alabama to Seaboard____ Consequently, the Seaboard would have monopoly pricing opportunities in the city of Montgomery and the Southern would have monopoly pricing opportunities in Tuscaloosa under the proposed plan.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b1626-7\">We find that Southern\u2019s agreement not to establish a TOFC facility in Montgomery was not sufficient evidence of anticompetitive effect so as to make the ICC's decision an abuse of discretion and lacking in substantial evidence. In evaluating the finance transaction, the ICC balanced the pluses and minuses involved in the particular terms of the agreement. It found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a4r-dedup-0\">Southern will acquire a more efficient route into Montgomery for most traffic while retaining access to all the Montgomery shippers presently served by Central. <em>The restrictions on Southern's service between Au-tauga Creek and Montgomery and in Montgomery proper will not change the status quo. On the other hand, the agreements significantly enhance Southern\u2019s ability to serve the area's major shipper. Direct access to Union Camp will allow Southern to avoid paying switching charges and will provide a shorter route to its mainline at Maplesville. </em>The creation of its own agency station at Autauga Creek will also help improve service to Montgomery area shippers.
