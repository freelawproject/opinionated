HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Hartland Dean West, injured in an explosion on an offshore oil platform, sued Kerr-McGee Corporation, the platform operator and majority owner, along with three companies that held minority interests in the platform. The district court filed a thoughtful opinion granting Kerr-McGee's motion for summary judgment on the ground that West was Kerr-McGee\u2019s borrowed employee, and that Kerr-McGee thus enjoyed tort immunity under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(a). 558 F.Supp. 669 (E.D.La.1983). Later, finding that Kerr-McGee and its co-platform owners were joint venturers, and that West was the borrowed employee of the joint venture, the court granted the remaining defendants\u2019 summary judgment motions. 586 F.Supp. 493 (E.D.La.1984). We conclude that the 1984 amendments to the LHWCA did not abolish the borrowed-employee doctrine, but also hold that the evidence before the district court raised issues of material fact with respect to West\u2019s status as a borrowed employee. We must therefore reverse and remand for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">In August of 1980, West applied to work for Kerr-McGee. Kerr-McGee wanted to hire West, but because it had filled its employment quota, it arranged an interview for West with one of its labor contractors, Berry Brothers. Berry hired West and sent him to work on offshore platform 229-A, operated solely by Kerr-McGee and owned by Kerr-McGee, Cabot Corporation, Felmont Oil Corporation, and Case-Pomer-oy Oil Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">For five months, West worked on the night shift as a \u201cpumper\u201d on the platform, monitoring various gauges and recording data. West\u2019s tools, other than a hard hat and shoes which he supplied himself, were provided by Kerr-McGee. West was periodically given instructions from Kerr-McGee supervisors, but he was usually not under direct supervision while on duty. Kerr-McGee employees had the power to grant West leave time, to discipline him, and to dismiss him from the platform. Kerr-McGee was not authorized to fire West from his position with Berry Brothers, though. West, as an employee on the Berry Brothers payroll, had a lower priority than Kerr-McGee employees in selecting sleeping quarters and obtaining transportation to and from the mainland.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">The Master Service Contract between Berry Brothers and Kerr-McGee contained the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-12\">Contractor [Berry Brothers] is an independent contractor, free of control and supervision by Kerr-McGee as to the means or manner of performing all work or services hereunder____ Neither Contractor nor any person used or employed by Contractor shall be deemed for any purpose to be the employee, agent, servant, or representative of Kerr-McGee in performance of any work or services ... under this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-14\">In January of 1981, West was injured in a gas explosion allegedly caused when a Kerr-McGee employee lit a cigarette. West sued Kerr-McGee, alleging negligence, strict product liability under La.Civ.Code art. 2317, and \u201cruin,\u201d or strict premises liability, under La.Civ.Code art. 2322. Later, West amended his complaint to name Cabot, Felmont, and Case-Pomeroy, the platform co-owners, as defendants. The district court, as previously mentioned, granted all defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b632-16\">We first address an issue not briefed by the parties: whether the 1984 amendments to the LHWCA, Pub.L. No. 98-426, 98 Stat. 1639, 1641 (1984), eliminated the concept of a borrowed employee in LHWCA jurisprudence. Our review of the amendment\u2019s legislative history and the context of its passage persuades us that Congress did not intend such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Borrowed-servant disputes, as in this case, arise when a defendant who is not a plaintiffs formal employer argues that the plaintiff is <em>in fact </em>acting as the defendant\u2019s employee. In a second line of cases, where employees of subcontractors have sued general contractors in tort, the general contractors have also asserted immunity under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(a) (1976)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u2014 not because the plaintiff was a \u201cborrowed\u201d or <em>de facto </em>employee of the general contractor, but because of the general contractor\u2019s obligation under the pre-1984 LHWCA to guarantee the payment of compensation to subcontractors\u2019 employees. See 33 U.S.C. 904(a) (1976).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> General contractors argued that the <em>quid pro quo </em>for their assumption of this duty should be the extension of immunity to them as well as to the direct employer, the subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Most courts, including this one, rejected this position, holding that general contractors\u2019 statutory duty under the LHWCA was \u201csecondary [and] guaranty-like,\u201d and that immunity attached only in the event that a subcontractor failed to secure compensation and the general contractor was forced to pay it. <em>Probst v. Southern Stevedoring Co., </em>379 F.2d 763, 767 (5th Cir.1967); <em>Johnson v. Bechtel Associates Professional Corp., </em>717 F.2d 574, 582 (D.C.Cir.1983). In June of 1984, however, the Supreme Court reversed the cited D.C. Circuit decision, and adopted the general contractors\u2019 argument that they enjoyed LHWCA immunity from subcontractors\u2019 employees\u2019 tort suits \u201cunless the [general] contractor has neglected to secure workers\u2019 compensation coverage after the subcontractor failed to do so.\u201d <em>Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority v. Johnson, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2827, 2835, 81 L.Ed.2d 768 (1984). Under <em>WMATA, </em>immunity for general contractors became the rule rather than the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">Three months later, Congress approved a bill amending the LHWCA. Section 904(a) was rewritten to read, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae_\">In the case of an employer who is a subcontractor, only if such subcontractor fails to secure the payment of compensation shall the contractor be liable for and be required to secure the payment of compensation. A subcontractor shall not be deemed to have failed to secure the payment of compensation if the contractor has provided insurance for such compensation for the benefit of the subcontractor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">The following sentence was added to the end of \u00a7 905(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-11\">For purposes of this subsection, a contractor shall be deemed the employer of a subcontractor\u2019s employees only if the subcontractor fails to secure the payment of compensation as required by section 904 of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">As we have previously noted, these amendments overturn <em>WMATA, </em>and are applicable to pending cases. <em>Louviere v. Marathon Oil Co., </em>755 F.2d 428, 429-30 (5th Cir.1985); <em>Martin v. Ingalls Shipbuilding, </em>746 F.2d 231 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-13\">The bare language of the amendment to \u00a7 905(a) could also be interpreted as foreclosing any designation of any contractor as the employer of its subcontractors\u2019 employees \u2014 even if a borrowed-employee relationship existed \u2014 unless the subcontractor failed to secure compensation payments. If Congress meant for \u00a7 905(a) to be so read, the cases delineating indices of a bor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>rowed employee would be obsolete. In actions such as this one, where the subcontractor paid LHWCA benefits, the general contractor would have no immunity as a matter of law. Another possible reading, though, is that the \u201cshall be deemed\u201d language of the 905(a) amendment refers only to \u201cdeeming\u201d a contractor the employer of a subcontractor\u2019s employee when the contractor is not the employee\u2019s true employer as well. Under this view, if the contractor <em>is </em>the employee\u2019s \u201cemployer\u201d under the borrowed servant doctrine, the contractor is liable for \u00a7 904(a) compensation, and has \u00a7 905(a) immunity, whether or not its behavior as a general contractor and insurance guarantor would cause it to be \u201cdeemed\u201d an employer under the amended scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">When, as here, a statute contains \u201clatent ambiguities\u201d despite its superficial clarity, we turn to the statute\u2019s legislative history for guidance. <em>James v. United States, </em>760 F.2d 590, 593-94 (5th Cir.1985) (en banc). The legislative history of the 1984 amendments unambiguously demonstrates that Congress\u2019s sole purpose in amending \u00a7 904(a) and \u00a7 905(a) was to overrule <em>WMATA, </em>and not to amend the borrowed-servant doctrine or otherwise modify LHWCA law. The report of the Conference Committee that added the \u00a7 904(a) and \u00a7 905(a) amendments states that <em>WMATA </em>\u201cchanged key components of what had widely been regarded as the proper rules governing contractor and subcontractor liability under the [LHWCA],\u201d and recites that the amendments \u201cdisapprove]\u201d <em>WMATA. </em>After describing the amendments, the report concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\"><em>WMATA, </em>the conferees believe, does not comport with the legislative intent of the Act nor its interpretation from 1927 through 1983. The case should not have any precedential effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 98-1027, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 24, <em>reprinted in </em>1984 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 2734, 2771, 2774.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">The narrow Congressional focus on reversing <em>WMATA </em>is underscored by the Conference Committee\u2019s beginning and ending sentences. Congress characterized <em>WMATA </em>as an unwanted deviation from 56 years of precedent. That precedent includes the borrowed-employee doctrine, <em>Ruiz v. Shell Oil Co., </em>413 F.2d 310 (5th Cir.1969), as well as the general-contractor rule rejected by <em>WMATA, Probst v. Southern Stevedoring Co., </em>379 F.2d 763 (5th Cir.1967). Indeed, this court has explicitly recognized that <em>Probst, </em>whose rule is codified in the 1984 amendments, does not foreclose the possibility that a general contractor may be an employer under the borrowed-servant doctrine. <em>Champagne v. Penrod Drilling Co., </em>462 F.2d 1372 (5th Cir.1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 1113, 93 S.Ct. 927, 34 L.Ed.2d 696 (1973). The committee language shows that Congress intended to do no more than restore the understanding that existed at the time of <em>Ruiz, Probst, </em>and <em>Champagne. </em>We conclude that the 1984 amendments have no bearing on the borrowed-employee issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-13\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b634-14\">-1-</p>\n<p id=\"b634-15\">This court most recently summarized the inquiries relevant to whether a worker is a borrowed employee in <em>Alday v. Patterson Truck Line, Inc., </em>750 F.2d 375, 376 (5th Cir.1985): \u201c(1) Who has control over the employee and the work he is performing ... ? (2) Whose work is being performed? (3) Was there an agreement ... between the original and borrowing employer? (4) Did the employee acquiesce in the new work situation? (5) Did the original employer terminate his relationship with the employee? (6) Who furnished tools and place for performance? (7) Was the new employment over a considerable length of time? (8) Who has the right to discharge the employee? (9) Who had the obligation to pay the employee?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-17\">The district court, relying on <em>Hebron v. Union Oil Co., </em>634 F.2d 245 (5th Cir.1981) and <em>Ruiz v. Shell Oil Co., </em>413 F.2d 310 (5th Cir.1969), found control over the employee\u2019s activities to be most important. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>deposition testimony indicates that although West was not always under direct supervision, he was answerable to Kerr-McGee supervisory personnel. The record also reflects without dispute that Kerr-McGee could have dismissed West from work on the platform, although it could not have fired him as a Berry employee. Based on this evidence, the court found that Kerr-McGee had much the same control over West as did the employer in <em>He-bron, </em>where a directed verdict for the defendant was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">As we recognized in <em>Alday, </em>however, neither control nor any other single answer to the inquiries \u201cis decisive, and no fixed test is used to determine the existence of a borrowed-servant relationship.\u201d 750 F.2d at 376, <em>quoting Ruiz, </em>413 F.2d at 312. In <em>Alday, </em>despite facts indicating that the defendant, Patterson, had exercised supervisory control over the assertedly borrowed plaintiff, Alday, we reversed a summary judgment for Patterson because other factors weighed in favor of Alday. The most significant of these was a provision in the contract between Patterson and Al-day\u2019s nominal employer, Atchafalaya, which, like the contract between Kerr-McGee and Berry Brothers, recited that under no circumstances would an Atchafa-laya employee be deemed a Patterson employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\"><em>Alday </em>recognized that in <em>Gaudet v. Exxon Corp., </em>562 F.2d 351 (5th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>436 U.S. 913, 98 S.Ct. 2253, 56 L.Ed.2d 414 (1978), we affirmed a summary judgment for the defendant despite the existence of a similar contract clause. In <em>Gaudet, </em>though, all factors other than the contract overwhelmingly established the plaintiffs\u2019 borrowed-employee status. The <em>Gaudet </em>plaintiffs had worked on an Exxon platform for over 12 years, were furnished tools by Exxon, and were subject to dismissal by Exxon. In <em>Alday, </em>by contrast, Al-day had been working at Patterson\u2019s job-site for only one day, and Atchafalaya, not Patterson, had paid Alday, supplied his tools, and retained the power to discharge him.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Here, Kerr-McGee signed a contract expressly rejecting the designation of Berry Brothers workers as Kerr-McGee employees \u201cfor any purpose.\u201d Berry Brothers paid West and provided his LHWCA compensation benefits; West did not participate in any Kerr-McGee benefit scheme. Although Kerr-McGee could dismiss West from the platform, it could not fire him from his position with Berry Brothers. In addition, Kerr-McGee\u2019s preferential treatment of its own employees over Berry Brothers employees in transportation and bunking arrangements is inconsistent with the notion that a borrowed servant differs from a true employee only as a paper formality. Even though Kerr-McGee supplied West\u2019s tools and had the power to control his actions during his five months on platform 229-A, we hold that as in <em>Alday, </em>enough conflicting evidence has been surfaced to make summary judgment for the defense inappropriate. In so holding, of course, we express no opinion concerning the ultimate resolution of the borrowed-servant issue at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">\n<em>-2-</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">West argues that even if he is found to be a borrowed employee of Kerr-McGee at trial, the borrowed-servant doctrine cannot foreclose his claim for \u201cruin\u201d under La.Civ.Code article 2322. He asserts that because his ruin claim is addressed to the defendants in their capacity as owners of the platform, rather than as his employers, it is analogous to a suit against a vessel owner by the owner\u2019s employee. <em>See Pichoff v. Bisso Towboat Co., </em>748 F.2d 300 (5th Cir.1984); <em>Smith v. M/V CAPTAIN FRED, </em>546 F.2d 119 (5th Cir.1977). These cases, though, are based on the pre1984 section 905(b) of the LHWCA, a narrow exception to the exclusive employer\u2019s liability provisions of \u00a7 905(a). Section 905(b) permits tort suits only for injuries \u201ccaused by the negligence of a vessel.\u201d West\u2019s claim for ruin sounds in strict liability, not in negligence. Furthermore, as we held in <em>Olsen v. Shell Oil Co., </em>708 F.2d 976, 982 (5th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 715, 79 L.Ed.2d 178 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>(1984), a fixed offshore platform is not a vessel. If, on remand, West is found to be a borrowed Kerr-McGee employee, all of his claims against Kerr-McGee will be barred by \u00a7 905(a). <em>Barger v. Petroleum Helicopters, Inc., </em>692 F.2d 337, 341 n. 5 (5th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>461 U.S. 958, 103 S.Ct. 2430, 77 L.Ed.2d 1316 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The district court granted summary judgment for Cabot, Case-Pomeroy, and Felmont based on the following syllogism: (1) West was Kerr-McGee\u2019s borrowed employee; (2) Kerr-McGee and the other defendants were joint venturers; (3) therefore, West was the borrowed employee of the joint venture, and all the joint ventur-ers have LHWCA immunity from tort liability. Our reversal of the summary judgment for Kerr-McGee upsets the syllogism\u2019s first premise, and requires that we reverse the summary judgments granted to the other defendants as well. We therefore need not address the validity of the rest of the district court\u2019s reasoning at this time. If it becomes necessary for us to do so on a second appeal, we will then have the benefit of a factual record fully developed at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The district court\u2019s grants of summary judgment to all defendants are REVERSED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-6\">. Section 905(a), before 1984, read in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">The liability of an employer prescribed in section 904 of this title shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer to the employee ... except that if an employer fails to secure payment of compensation as required by this chapter, an injured employee ... may elect to claim compensation under the chapter, or to maintain an action at law or in admiralty for damages on account of such injury or death.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b633-14\">. Section 904(a), before 1984, read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-15\">Every employer shall be liable for and shall secure the payment to his employees of the compensation payable under sections 907, 908, and 909 of this title. In the case of an employer who is a subcontractor, the contractor shall be liable for and shall secure the payment of such compensation to employees of the subcontractor unless the subcontractor has secured such payment.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b636-7\">TATE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"aqp-dedup-0\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">I concur in the reversal result reached by the excellent and scholarly majority opinion. Even if the \u201cborrowed servant\u201d doctrine should be applicable to bar a tort-suit in the present circumstances, summary judgment was improvident under <em>Alday v. Patterson Truck Line, </em>750 F.2d 375 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">Nevertheless, I would prefer to rest our reversal on a broader basis. The plaintiff West sues Kerr-McGee, a platform operator, for tortious injuries received on its platform through Kerr-McGee\u2019s fault. The plaintiff West was not an employee of Kerr-McGee; he was working on Kerr-McGee\u2019s platform as an employee of Berry Brothers, which had entered into a contract with Kerr-McGee to supply labor services, including those rendered by West in the course of his employment with Berry Brothers. Berry Brothers had secured insurance to pay benefits to any of its injured during employment the benefits to which the employee was entitled under the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cthe Act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-14\">By its motion for summary judgment, Kerr-McGee \u2014 which is <em>not </em>West\u2019s employer \u2014 claims the benefit of the statutory immunity granted to <em>employers responsible for compensation benefits </em>by Section 905(a) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(a) (1984).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, Section 904(a) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 904(a) (1984), provides that \u201ca contractor [such as Kerr-McGee] be liable for ... the payment of compensation ... only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>if a subcontractor [such as Berry Brothers] fails to secure the payment of compensation.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Since the subcontractor Berry Brothers <em>did </em>secure the payment of the Act\u2019s benefits to its injured employees, the contractor Kerr-McGee, the present defendant, is not liable for compensation benefits. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 904(a), quoted at note 2 <em>supra. </em>Under the unambiguous terms of section 905(a), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(a) \u2014 \u201cThe liability of an employer <em>prescribed in section 90Jf </em>of this title shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer to the employee\u201d (emphasis added) \u2014 Kerr-McGee is not entitled to the immunity from tort liability granted only where the Act grants a compensation remedy against an \u201cemployer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">This Congressional intent is made explicit by the concluding section of section 905(a), as amended in 1984: \u201cFor purposes of this [\u201cExclusiveness of liability\u201d] section, a contractor [here, Kerr-McGee] shall be deemed the employer of a subcontractor\u2019s [here, Berry Brothers\u2019] employees <em>only if </em>the subcontractor fails to secure the payment of compensation as required by section 904 of this title.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The statutory language is explicit, and it makes functional sense: only where an employer is liable for the compensation remedy provided by the Act is that remedy made exclusive against him for the employee\u2019s injuries. It makes no functional sense to hold that a contractor, immune under the Act from compensation remedy for injuries received by a subcontractor\u2019s employees, is nevertheless also entitled to tort immunity because of the exclusive nature of the compensation remedy accorded, not at all against the contractor, but solely against the subcontractor. It is statutorily irrelevant under the Act\u2019s compensation scheme that, for third-party tort purposes, the subcontractor\u2019s employee may be a \u201cborrowed servant\u201d of the contractor for whose torts the contractor may be liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">The statutory language is explicit and free from ambiguity. No consideration of the statute itself or of its other provisions gives rise to any implication of doubt as to the legislative intent. \u201c[T]he starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself. Absent a clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary, the language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.\u201d <em>Consumer Product Safety Commission v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980). \u201cWhere, as here, a resolution of a question of federal law turns on a statute, we look first to the statutory language, and <em>then </em>to the legislative history <em>if </em>the statutory language is unclear.\u201d <em>Blum v. Stenson, </em>465 U.S. 886, -, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 1548, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984) (emphasis added). While this rule of statutory construction is \u201crather an axiom of experience than a rule of law, and does not preclude consideration of persuasive evidence if it exists,\u201d <em>Watt v. Alaska, </em>451 U.S. 259, 266, 101 S.Ct. 1673, 1678, 68 L.Ed.2d 80 (1981), here nothing in the legislative history nor the statutory scheme as a whole indicates any intent or rational reason why a contractor, immune under the Act from compensation remedy, should be accorded tort-immunity also, (based on the exclusive nature of the compensation remedy, when granted) as to the tortiously injured employee of a subcontractor (who, under the Act, <em>is </em>liable exclusively for the compensation remedy).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-15\">As the scholarly majority opinion notes, the 1984 amendments to the Act were spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>cifically adopted to overrule legislatively a Supreme Court decision that a general contractor enjoyed the tort-immunity conferred by the Act as to work-injuries sustained by a subcontractor\u2019s employees, and to make plain that such statutory immunity had never been intended to be conferred unless the contractor himself was liable for compensation benefits under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">The majority concludes that, because of this narrow purpose of the 1984 amendments (as stated by a legislative report) to overrule the unwanted deviation by the Supreme Court decision from 56 years of precedent, the 1984 Congressional clarifications did not intend to disturb the aberrational and thin line of precedent of this circuit that had accorded a general contractor tort immunity for injury to a subcontractor\u2019s employee under the \u201cborrowed servant\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The Congressional report did not refer to this thin line of mostly Fifth Circuit jurisprudence, totally inconsistent with the general purposes and express language of the 1984 amendments. I do not find the absence of reference to these decisions, in the brief conclusory statement of the legislative report, as any indication that the Congress desired to preserve the precedential effect of all and any pre-1984-Amendment judicial decisions, nor especially of any that were completely contrary to the unambiguous language of the 1984 amendments\u2014 which was specifically intended to clarify that a general contractor enjoyed no tort-immunity as to work-injuries sustained by a subcontractor\u2019s employee, where that subcontractor had (as here) secured the payment to the injured employee of compensation benefits accorded him by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">The majority notes that this \u201cborrowed servant\u201d immunity first surfaced in <em>Ruiz v. Shell Oil Company, </em>413 F.2d 310 (5th Cir. 1969). In <em>Ruiz, </em>a maritime personal injury suit involving an injured barge worker, the issue on the contractor\u2019s appeal from adverse tort judgment was raised by the contractor\u2019s contention that the district court had erroneously failed to grant a jury instruction exculpating the contractor from liability on the \u201cborrowed servant\u201d doctrine. (By this instruction, the contractor would receive the Act\u2019s immunity if the trier of fact found that the injured barge worker (who was employed by a subcontractor) had become the borrowed servant of the contractor).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">The <em>Ruiz </em>panel decision affirmed the non-application of the \u201cborrowed servant\u201d doctrine under the facts in that case; but, without discussion or analysis of the Act, assumed that the doctrine was applicable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Subsequently, on authority of <em>Ruiz, </em>a scattered line of decisions, <em>e.g., Hebron v. Union Oil Company of California, </em>634 F.2d 245 (5th Cir.1981) and <em>Gaudet v. Exxon Corporation, </em>562 F.2d 351 (5th Cir.1977), has recognized this defense as available to a general contractor when a subcontractor\u2019s employee sues the general contractor in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">Under the pre-1984 wording of Sections 904(a) and 905(a) of the Act, there may have been room for a construction that the general contractor might be immune from tort suit by a subcontractor\u2019s employee if the latter was a \u201cborrowed employee;\u201d or, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>at least, the Supreme Court apparently so found, in its decision that was immediately and retroactively overruled by the Congress as contrary to the legislative intent and statutory scheme of the Act. Whatever merit there may have been to the \u201cborrowed servant\u201d tort immunity judicially granted to that contractor \u2014 albeit, without judicial analysis of the Act or reasoned judicial explanation for the immunity \u2014 has disappeared with the 1984 clarification of language as above noted. The specific addition of the concluding sentence of \u00a7 905(a), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(a) (1984) (quoted at note 1 supra) states that, with regard to the exclusive liability of an <em>\u201cemployer\u201d </em>from the compensation remedy provided by the Act, \u201ca contractor shall be deemed the <em>employer </em>of a subcontractor\u2019s employees <em>only if </em>the subcontractor fails to secure the payment of compensation.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Under the present facts, Kerr-McGee (the contractor) was not statutorily liable to the plaintiff West for compensation benefits under the Act, for West\u2019s payroll employer, Berry Brothers (Kerr-McGee\u2019s subcontractor), had secured payment of the Act\u2019s compensation benefits to its employees injured at work on the Kerr-McGee premises. Likewise, not being an \u201cemployer\u201d liable for compensation benefits under the Act, Kerr-McGee is unambiguously not accorded by the Act any immunity from tort suit, in this immunity being essentially grounded on the exclusive nature of the Act\u2019s compensation remedy when accorded against an <em>\u201cemployer\u201d </em>liable for such compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">I concur in the majority opinion of my esteemed brethren, because it reverses the summary judgment as improvidently granted. I would hope that the majority\u2019s failure to reverse on the broader statutory ground enunciated by this concurring opinion, an issue raised sua sponte by the court at oral argument, will be reconsidered; if not now, then when the issue is squarely presented by an actual denial of tort recovery under present circumstances.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b636-9\">. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(a), as amended in 1984, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-10\">(a) <em>Employer liability; failure of employer to secure payment of compensation The liability of an employer prescribed in section 904 of this title shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer </em>to the employee, his legal representative, husband or wife, parents, dependents, next of kin, and anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages from such employer at law or in admiralty on account of such injury or death, except that if an employer fails to secure payment of compensation as required by this chapter, an injured employee, or his legal representative in case death results from the injury, may elect to claim compensation under the chapter, or to maintain an action at law or in admiralty for damages on account of such injury or death. In such action the defendant may not plead as a defense that the injury was caused by the negligence of a fellow servant, or that the employee assumed the risk of his employment, or that the injury was due to the contributory negligence of the employee. <em>For purposes of this subsection, a contractor shall be deemed the employer of a subcontractor's employees only if the subcontractor fails to secure the payment of compensation as required by section 904 of this title. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b637-8\">. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 904(a), as amended in 1984, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-9\">Every employer shall be liable for and shall secure the payment to his employees of the compensation payable under sections 907, 908, and 909 of this title. In the case of an employer who is a subcontractor, <em>only if such subcontractor fails to secure the payment of compensation shall the contractor be liable for and be required to secure the payment of compensation. </em>A subcontractor shall not be deemed to have failed to secure the payment of compensation if the contractor has provided insurance for such compensation for the benefit of the subcontractor. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b638-6\">. <em>Ruiz, supra, </em>413 F.2d at 312 n. 1, cites six decisions with regard to the application of the doctrine, all of which concerned the liability or not of the general contractor to third persons injured by the tort of a \"borrowed employee\" <em>(i.e., </em>the subcontractor's employee), and only one of which concerned a waterfront accident. None involved the issue of whether a contractor was relieved of tort liability because of the exclusive compensation remedy, if through his fault he injured the \"borrowed employee\u201d himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The one waterfront decision, <em>Standard Oil Company v. Anderson, </em>212 U.S. 215, 29 S.Ct. 252, 53 L.Ed. 480 (1909), concerned whether an injured longshoreman could recover against the owner and operator of a winch for injuries received through the negligence of the winch-man. The defendant's defense was that the winchman was a borrowed servant of the longshoreman\u2019s employer (a master stevedore), so that the stevedore not the winch operator was responsible for the winchman\u2019s tort. In holding that the payroll employer of the winchman (the winch operator) was liable for the winchman\u2019s negligence, the Court at no point referred to the longshoreman\u2019s compensation remedy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
