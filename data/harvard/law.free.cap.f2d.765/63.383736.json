Aldridge appeals the decision of the district court denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Petitioner argues that multiple constitutional violations were committed in his Ohio state court trial on charges of kidnapping, aggravated robbery and aggravated murder. As we agree with the district court\u2019s holdings on all issues, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-23\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b168-24\">At approximately 1:55 a.m. on June 7, 1979, Pamela Phillips pulled into the driveway of her North Kingsville, Ohio, home. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Having heard Pamela's van in the driveway, Pamela\u2019s mother looked out the window and watched as Pamela was abducted by a muscular man driving a black car. Approximately fifteen minutes later Pamela crawled onto the front steps of a nearby home where she died of multiple stab wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">On July 21, 1979, Pennsylvania police contacted the Ashtabula, Ohio, Sheriff\u2019s Department and Conneaut, Ohio, police concerning a suspect in a June 6, 1979, robbery which was unrelated, but similar in many respects', to the murder of Pamela Phillips.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The license number of the car used in the robbery was traced to petitioner Aldridge and at approximately 3:00 a.m. on July 22, 1979, Aldridge was arrested at his home. Aldridge consented to the search of his car, and evidence connecting him to the murder of Pamela Phillips was discovered. From sometime after his arrest until approximately 7:00 a.m. on July 22, 1979, Aldridge was questioned about the Pennsylvania robbery. Although Al-dridge was temporarily transferred to the Lake County jail, he was ultimately returned to the Ashtabula jail on July 23, 1979, and questioning was resumed and a polygraph examination was given. Shortly after the polygraph was completed, Al-dridge confessed to the murder, robbery and kidnapping of Pamela Phillips.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Petitioner Aldridge was indicted by the Ashtabula County, Ohio, Grand Jury on one count of aggravated murder, one count of aggravated robbery, and one count of kidnapping. He entered pleas of not guilty to the robbery and kidnapping charges and a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity to the charge of aggravated murder. After a jury found him guilty on all charges, he was sentenced to terms of life imprisonment on the aggravated murder charge, from seven (7) to twenty-five (25) years on the aggravated robbery charge and from seven (7) to twenty-five (25) years on the kidnapping charge. Aldridge appealed his conviction to the Ohio Court of Appeals where he raised thirteen assignments of error. The Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court on twelve grounds but reversed the conviction on the remaining error concerning the composition of the state grand jury. The Ohio Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Ohio Court of Appeals and reinstated the conviction. 69 Ohio St.2d 136, 431 N.E.2d 987 (1982). Aldridge then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court which was denied. <em>Aldridge v. Ohio, </em>459 U.S. 841, 103 S.Ct. 91, 74 L.Ed.2d 84 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">Thereafter, Aldridge filed his \u00a7 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Following the district court\u2019s denial of his petition, petitioner Aldridge filed this appeal raising the following issues: (1) whether the use of his confession at trial violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights; (2) whether his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated when he was required to answer potentially incriminating questions on cross-examination; (3) whether his Fourteenth Amendment due process right was violated when, pursuant to Ohio law, the trial court placed the burden of establishing the affirmative defense of insanity on him; (4) whether his Sixth Amendment rights to a fair trial and impartial jury were violated because of the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant a change of venue; and (5) whether his Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated when doctors, lawyers, clergy, the elderly, the sick, dentists, college students, and felons were excluded from the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">Citing <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), petitioner argues that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated by the use of his confession at trial. It is, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>course, fundamental that a criminal suspect can waive these rights \u201cprovided the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612. However, petitioner argues no such waiver occurred. This argument is based on the allegation that he was \u201cdenied food, sleep and the assistance of counsel.\u201d These same factual issues were considered by the state trial court and, as noted in the district court\u2019s opinion (adopting the magistrate\u2019s Recommendation and Findings), \u201c[t]he [state trial] judge\u2019s seven page written opinion reviewed the evidence, took into consideration the totality of the evidence and applied the correct legal standards in reaching his conclusion to admit the oral confession into evidence.\u201d App. 16. <em>Cf. Clark v. Jago, </em>676 F.2d 1099 (6th Cir.1982) (where the state court record was silent).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Once the district court has conducted an inquiry and determined that the state court \u201cadequately resolved the factual issues contained in the petitioner\u2019s constitutional claim,\u201d <em>Fowler v. Jago, </em>683 F.2d 983, 988 (6th Cir.1982), it is required to give the state court determinations a strong presumption of correctness. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). <em>See also Sumner v. Mata, </em>449 U.S. 539, 101 S.Ct. 764, 66 L.Ed.2d 722 (1981) <em>(Sumner I); Loveday v. Davis, </em>697 F.2d 135 (6th Cir.1983). Although the \u201cgoverning standard as to whether a plea of guilty is voluntary for purposes of the federal Constitution is a question of federal law, ... and not a question of fact subject to the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d),\u201d <em>Marshall v. Lonberger, </em>459 U.S. 422, 431, 103 S.Ct. 843, 849, 74 L.Ed.2d 646 (1983) (citations omitted), the historical facts are governed by \u00a7 2254(d). <em>Id. </em>Thus, the state court\u2019s determination that the petitioner was capable of making a knowing and intentional waiver and was not denied food, sleep or the assistance of counsel is to be accorded \u201ca high measure of deference____\u201d <em>Sumner v. Mata, </em>455 U.S. 591, 598, 102 S.Ct. 1303, 1307, 71 L.Ed.2d 480 (1982) <em>(Sumner </em>II). Since the petitioner has failed \u201cto establish by convincing evidence that the factual determination by the state court was erroneous,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), we accept these \u201chistorical facts.\u201d In applying the appropriate legal standards, we conclude that petitioner voluntarily, intelligently and knowingly relinquished both his right to remain silent and his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Petitioner\u2019s second argument is also based on his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and is based on the following sequence of events. At trial petitioner elected to take the witness stand and on direct examination, petitioner\u2019s attorney asked him a series of questions concerning his whereabouts on June 6, 7, and 8, 1979. Petitioner responded to each of the questions explaining at one point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-10\">[0]n June the 6th, I either was out fishing; I either was home; I could have been a dozen places. I have no set pattern. I get up in the morning about 10:00 o\u2019clock. I eat lunch. I go to work. I come home, eat dinner, go to bed, get up, eat lunch. It\u2019s on and on. But that day I didn\u2019t go to work, I am pretty sure I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">App. 499-500. On cross-examination petitioner was again questioned as to his whereabouts on June 6, 1979. After petitioner stated that he did not remember, the State\u2019s Attorney asked him specific questions regarding his involvement in a robbery of a young woman on that date. Although petitioner invoked the Fifth Amendment numerous times, the trial judge overruled each invocation and instructed him to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">The parties agree that by taking the stand petitioner waived his privilege against self-incrimination with respect to matters reasonably related to the subject matter of his examination. <em>Brown v. United States, </em>356 U.S. 148, 154-55, 78 S.Ct. 622, 626, 2 L.Ed.2d 589 (1958). However, petitioner argues that the cross-examination went beyond the scope of direct and that direct examination had not opened the door. At oral argument, counsel for peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>tioner stated that in order to have opened the door petitioner would have had to \u201cdirectly said <em>... \u2018I </em>was not in such and such a place at that time; I did not attack Miss Phillips or I did not attack Miss Blakeslee or Miss Eidens.\u2019 \u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">As this court has stated, \u201c[a]fter taking the stand, the defendant cannot proceed to answer those questions which reflect favorably upon his innocence and refuse to answer those questions which tend to indicate his guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Doremus, </em>414 F.2d 252, 253 (6th Cir.1969). This is especially true when, as here, the defendant\u2019s testimony focuses the court\u2019s attention on a time period when prior bad acts were alleged. As recently noted by the Supreme Court, \u201c[o]nce a defendant decides to testify, \u2018[t]he interest of the other party and regard for the function of courts of justice to ascertain the truth become relevant, and <em>prevail </em>in the balance of considerations determining scope and limits of the privilege against self-incrimination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jenkins v. Anderson, </em>447 U.S. 231, 238, 100 S.Ct. 2124, 2129, 65 L.Ed.2d 86 (1980) (quoting from <em>Brown v. United States, </em>356 U.S. 148, 156, 78 S.Ct. 622, 627, 2 L.Ed.2d 589 (1958)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">In the present case not only is there a reasonable relationship between petitioner\u2019s testimony on direct and the cross-examination but there is a direct relationship. The state prosecutor\u2019s questions never strayed from the focus of the petitioner\u2019s statement. Accordingly, we hold that by testifying as he did on direct examination, petitioner\u2019s waiver of his right against self-incrimination extended, at least, to his conduct and whereabouts on June 6, 7, and 8, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Petitioner\u2019s third argument is that the Ohio state law requiring him to prove the affirmative defense of insanity was violative of his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process of law. As both parties recognize, this court has held that \u201c \u2018so long as a jury is instructed that the state has the burden of proving every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, there is no due process violation\u2019 if the state places the affirmative defense of insanity upon the defendant.\u201d <em>Howze v. Marshall, </em>716 F.2d 396, 398 (6th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1015, 79 L.Ed.2d 245 (1984) (quoting <em>Krzeminski v. Perini, </em>614 F.2d 121, 123 (6th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 866, 101 S.Ct. 199, 66 L.Ed.2d 84). The petitioner, however, argues that <em>Howze </em>did not adequately consider several Supreme Court holdings and should now be reversed. We disagree, and since the jury in the petitioner\u2019s case was properly instructed, we hold that there was no due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">Petitioner argues, based on pre-trial publicity, that the state court\u2019s denial of a motion for change of venue violated his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to a fair trial and impartial jury. Petitioner concedes that the state court\u2019s holding on juror impartiality is subject to the statutory presumption of correctness. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Patton v. Yount, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 2885, 81 L.Ed.2d 847 (1984). Nevertheless, petitioner asserts that a review of the <em>voir dire </em>examination of the prospective jurors shows that the statutory presumption of correctness has been rebutted.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-15\">Petitioner\u2019s strongest argument is based on the fact that three of the jurors impaneled in petitioner\u2019s trial stated during <em>voir dire </em>that they had formed opinions on the issue of petitioner\u2019s guilt. Although all of the jurors in question also stated that they could set aside their opinions and render a verdict based on the evidence before the court, petitioner argues that they should not be believed. These determinations are particularly well-suited for the trial judge and, as the Supreme Court has long held, \u201c[t]he mere existence of any pre-conceived notion as to the guilt or innocence of an accused, without more, is [insufficient] to rebut the presumption of a prospective juror\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>Irvin v. Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 717, 722-23, 81 S.Ct. 1639, 1642, 6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>L.Ed.2d 751 (1961) (citations omitted). Consequently, federal courts have intervened in state court convictions because of pre-trial publicity only in extraordinary cases. <em>See, e.g., Patton v. Yount, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 2885, 81 L.Ed.2d 847 (1984) (no reversal although publicity of confession and prior plea of insanity and although when questioned about the case in <em>voir dire </em>it was discovered that all but two (2) of one hundred sixty-three (163) veniremen had heard of it and seventy-seven per cent (77%) had an opinion which they would take into the jury box); <em>Sheppard v. Maxwell, </em>384 U.S. 333, 86 S.Ct. 1507, 16 L.Ed.2d 600 (1966) (reversal where courthouse had \u201ccarnival atmosphere\u201d); <em>Estes v. Texas, </em>381 U.S. 532, 85 S.Ct. 1628, 14 L.Ed.2d 543 (1965) (reversal where a \u201ccircus atmosphere\u201d pervaded the various hearings in the case); <em>Rideau v. Louisiana, </em>373 U.S. 723, 83 S.Ct. 1417, 10 L.Ed.2d 663 (1963) (reversal where a twenty-minute confession was repeatedly broadcast on television); <em>Irvin v. Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 717, 81 S.Ct. 1639, 6 L.Ed.2d 751 (1961) (reversal where reports of a line-up identification, the defendant taking a lie detector test, confessions and a plea bargain were all publicized). <em>See also Brofford v. Marshall, </em>751 F.2d 845 (6th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">From our review of the record, we note that there was considerable publicity concerning the murder in question. However, publicity of this type almost inevitably surrounds crimes of this nature in small communities, and we hold that it was not so prejudicial as to deny petitioner a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">Petitioner\u2019s final argument is that his Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated when doctors, lawyers, clergy, the elderly, the sick, dentists, college students and felons were excluded by one of the jury commissioners from the <em>grand jury. </em>At the outset we note that cases challenging the makeup of state grand juries are analyzed under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Castaneda v. Partida, </em>430 U.S. 482, 97 S.Ct. 1272, 51 L.Ed.2d 498 (1977); <em>see also Rose v. Mitchell, </em>443 U.S. 545, 99 S.Ct. 2993, 61 L.Ed.2d 739 (1979), while the right to a representative state petit jury is protected under the Sixth Amendment fair cross-section requirement. <em>See Taylor v. Louisiana, </em>419 U.S. 522, 95 S.Ct. 692, 42 L.Ed.2d 690 (1975). The basis for this distinction results from the now well-settled constitutional holding that the Fifth Amendment right to a grand jury does not apply to state prosecutions, <em>Hurtado v. California, </em>110 U.S. 516, 4 S.Ct. 111, 28 L.Ed. 232 (1884), although the Sixth Amendment right to a petit jury made up of a fair cross-section of the community, of course, does apply to state prosecutions. <em>See Taylor, </em>419 U.S. 522, 95 S.Ct. 692, 42 L.Ed.2d 690 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">Although there is no right to be indicted by a state grand jury, \u201cif a state chooses to use grand juries, the jurors must be selected without discrimination because of race or color.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Rose, </em>570 F.2d 129, 133 (6th Cir.1978), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>443 U.S. 545, 99 S.Ct. 2993, 61 L.Ed.2d 739 (1979). In <em>Castaneda v. Partida, </em>the Supreme Court stated the test as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-11\">[i]n order to show that an equal protection violation has occurred in the context of grand jury selection, the defendant <em>must show </em>that the procedure employed resulted in substantial underrepresentation of his race or the identifiable group <em>to which he belongs. </em>The first step is to establish that the group is one that is a recognizable, distinct class, singled out for different treatment under the laws, as written or as applied____ Next, the degree of underrepresentation must be proved by comparing the proportion of the group in the total population to the proportion called to serve as grand jurors, over a significant period of time____ Finally, ... a selection procedure that is susceptible of abuse or is not racially neutral supports the presumption of discrimination raised by the statistical showing____ Once the defendant has shown substantial underrepresentation of <em>his group, </em>he has made a prima facie case of discriminatory purpose and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>burden then shifts to the state to rebut the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">430 U.S. at 494-95, <em>97 </em>S.Ct. at 1280 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">In the instant case, we need go no further than the first sentence of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding. The Court stated that the petitioner <em>must </em>show underrepresentation of the identifiable group <em>to which he belongs. </em>The petitioner has not claimed to be a doctor, lawyer, student, clergy, dentist, sick, or a felon. Consequently, his Fourteenth Amendment equal protection rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The judgment of the district court dismissing the petition for habeas corpus is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b169-8\">.
