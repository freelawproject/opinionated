Because we find that the Secretary improperly compressed Hammond\u2019s claim to fit within one of the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 recognized medical-vocational categories, we vacate the denial of benefits and remand for further individualized proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">Hammond, forty-four years old at the time of the incident precipitating this case, has graduated from high school and has received training as a hospital technician. This training prepared her to work at Pitt Memorial Hospital in Greenville, North Carolina, where her duties included assistance in the movement of bed-ridden patients. On May 29, 1980, Hammond sprained her back while lifting one such patient whom she later estimated to weigh two hundred thirty-five to two hundred forty pounds. Hammond found that the injury left her unable to perform substantial gainful activity, and she applied for social security benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">The Social Security Administration denied the claims in October 1982 and again on reconsideration in December 1982, upon which Hammond sought a hearing in her case. In April 1983, an administrative law judge listened to Hammond\u2019s testimony and received in evidence the medical records made at the time of the injury by Pitt Memorial Hospital and the medical reports made subsequently by Hammond\u2019s physician, Dr. Andrew Best, and by a consultative examiner, Dr. Richard Rawl. The AU concluded from this information that Hammond was too severely impaired to return to her position as a hospital technician but that she retained the residual functional capacity to perform a full range of sedentary work. After that step, the adjudicative process was entirely mechanical. The AU simply referred to a \u201cgrid\u201d published by the Department of Health and Human Services which stated that the national economy provides employment opportunities for a person of Hammond\u2019s age and experience who can perform sedentary work. <em>See </em>Rule 201.21, Table No. 1 of Appendix 2, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404, Subpart P. On the basis of that reading, the AU rejected Hammond\u2019s benefits claims. The decision became the final action of the Secretary when the Appeals Council declined Hammond\u2019s request for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-16\">This court has recently remarked that \u201cwhen an AU uses the grid, the most important finding that the AU must make is what kind of physical activity the claimant can sustain.\u201d <em>Gordon v. Schweiker, </em>725 F.2d 231, 235 (4th Cir.1984). Given the obvious difficulties in encompassing a very large number of cases within a few general categories, the questions of whether and how to classify claimants raise to a high level the special AU \u201cduty of inquiry\u201d described by Justice Brennan in <em>Heckler v. Campbell, </em>461 U.S. 458, 470-473, 103 S.Ct. 1952, 1959-1960, 76 L.Ed.2d 66 (1984). The regulations themselves accordingly require that individual attention be devoted to cases with parameters different from those in the official matrices. <em>See Heckler v. Campbell, </em>461 U.S. at 462 n. 5, 103 S.Ct. at 1955 n. 5. In applying this principle of caution, we have discussed two types of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>claimants that the grids inadequately describe: the claimant who suffers a disability present in the absence of physical exertion and the claimant who suffers in exertion a disability that restricts her from performing the full range of activity covered by a category. <em>Hall v. Harris, </em>658 F.2d 260, 265 (4th Cir.1981). In these types of cases, the AU may not give preclusive effect to the grids and must produce specific vocational evidence showing that the national economy offers employment opportunities to the claimant. <em>See respectively Grant v. Schweiker, </em>699 F.2d 189, 192 (4th Cir.1983); <em>Wilson v. Heckler, </em>743 F.2d 218, 221-222 (4th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Hammond\u2019s claim illustrates both of the limitations to the grid that are explained in <em>Hall v. Harris. </em>First, uncontradicted evidence shows that Hammond cannot perform the full range of sedentary work as defined by 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(a). Hammond suffers from chronic lumbar strain that requires her to wear a back brace, to take both oral and injected analgesics, and to return several times each week to her treating physician, Dr. Best. She testified that she can neither sit nor stand for a full hour, cannot bend, stoop, lift, or climb, and cannot walk more than a few hundred yards twice a week. Dr. Best, whose opinion is entitled to great weight, <em>DeLoatche v. Heckler, </em>715 F.2d 148, 150 n. 1 (4th Cir.1983), concluded that Hammond \u2014 even if she could find a position that required none of these prescribed activities \u2014 would be fifty to fifty-five percent disabled from performing the job. Hammond\u2019s testimony and Best\u2019s opinion are completely consistent with the consultative report of Dr. Rawl, which merely confirmed the presence of back strain with associated tenderness and noted the absence of arthritis and scoliosis. The evidence thus unanimously indicates that Hammond is in the same position as the plaintiff in <em>Wilson v. Heckler: </em>she cannot perform the full range of sedentary work because she cannot bend or squat or sit for six hours in an eight-hour day, even if she could perform the walking and standing that might be necessary. <em>Cf. Wilson, </em>743 F.2d 221-222.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Apart from Hammond\u2019s imperfect correspondence to the sedentary listing in the Health and Human Services\u2019 grid, reliance on the exertional table is inappropriate in this case because the Secretary has not adequately accounted for the nonexertional limitation suggested by Hammond\u2019s claim that she is constantly in pain. The AU simply stated that \u201cIn view of the objective medical evidence of record, the undersigned does not find credible the claimant's subjective symptoms including pain of a level of severity as to preclude sedentary work activity.\u201d In light of the apparent consensus among Hammond, Best, and Rawl that Hammond suffers steady pain, this statement may not stand without some support.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The AU is required to make credibility determinations\u2014 and therefore sometimes must make negative determinations \u2014 about allegations of pain or other nonexertional disabilities. <em>Smith v. Schweiker, </em>719 F.2d 723, 725 n. 2 (4th Cir.1984). But such decisions should refer specifically to the evidence informing the AU\u2019s conclusion. This duty of explanation is always an important aspect of the administrative charge, <em>see Gordon v. Schweiker, </em>725 F.2d at 235-236 (citing cases), and it is especially crucial in evaluating pain, in part because the judgment is often a difficult one, and in part because the AU is somewhat constricted in choosing a decisional process, <em>Van Huss v. Heckler, </em>572 F.Supp. 160, 167 (W.D.Va.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">As the grids may not alone support a denial of Hammond\u2019s disability claim, the Secretary retains the burden of producing evidence that the national economy offers employment opportunities to Hammond. The judgment of the district court is there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>fore vacated and the case is remanded to the district court with instructions to remand to the Secretary. If the Secretary offers additional evidence, Hammond\u2019s claim should be reconsidered in light of that evidence and any additional evidence that the plaintiff may choose to advance. If no additional evidence is presented, the judgment shall go for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b530-5\"> This case was decided prior to the enactment of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(5)(A), which created a requirement of medical corroboration for a claimant's allegations of pain. As the findings of \"pain\u201d and \"tenderness\" by Best and Rawl satisfy the burden of production imposed by the statute, we need not consider the application of the provision in detail.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
