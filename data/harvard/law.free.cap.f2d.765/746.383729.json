For reversal, Aero-Master argues that the administrative law judge (ALJ) erred in his determination regarding the safety of Aero-Master\u2019s shipping method and in imposing the civil penalty that he imposed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-21\">Aero-Master shipped a fogging machine for insect control from St. Louis, Missouri to a Minnesota restaurant. The fogging machine contained one gallon of Aero-Mas-ter pesticide; labeling information and operating instructions were wired to the handle of the machine when shipped. State inspectors and EPA officials cited Aero-Master for violating FIFRA because the pesticide was mislabeled due to the fact that the required labels and cautionary instructions were not \u201csecurely affixed\u201d to the shipping container.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-22\">The AU found that this method of shipment (in which the insecticide is shipped in the machine and the instructions and labels are wired to the machine\u2019s handle) violated FIFRA. He also found that Aero-Master\u2019s newly-developed shipping method (in which Aero-Master ships the fogging machine empty, accompanied by a one gallon container of pesticide which bears the pesticide labeling) conforms with FIFRA. For its misbranding violation under its former method of shipment, Aero-Master was assessed a civil penalty of $2,100.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-23\">Under FIFRA, a pesticide is \u201cmisbrand-ed\u201d if a label bearing certain information is not \u201caffixed to its container.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136(q)(2)(C).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The EPA\u2019s regulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>also require that the label \u201cappear on or be securely attached to the immediate container\u201d and that the label \u201ccan reasonably be expected to remain affixed during the foreseeable conditions and periods of use.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 162.10(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">Agency determinations under FIFRA are to be sustained on appeal if they are \u201csupported by sustantial evidence when considered on the record as a whole.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136n(b). <em>See Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 465, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). The Supreme Court has interpreted \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d to mean \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 217, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">After careful review of the record, we find that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. Within a week, the warning packet had been removed from the handle and was unavailable; in fact, removal of the packet was necessary for the user to read the warning instructions. This fact takes on additional importance in light of the ALJ\u2019s findings that fogging of a small area might take only a few minutes and the one gallon supply might not be consumed for up to a year, during which time the warning would be unavailable. In light of these facts, we sustain the ALJ\u2019s finding of a violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">With respect to the civil penalty, we note that the $2,100 was within the range of penalties prohibited by statute and that it reflects, to some degree, the specific circumstances underlying the violation. Although we recognize that the AU had the discretion to impose the civil penalty that he imposed, we observe that the violation was essentially technical and nonwillful, and that Aero-Master corrected it promptly by amending its shipping procedure when the EPA began its investigation. We decline to reduce the penalty but we suggest that, on remand for entry of final judgment, the agency may wish to consider reducing the civil penalty under the circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-13\">Accordingly, the judgment of the agency is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-16\">.
