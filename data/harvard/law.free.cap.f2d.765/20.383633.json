A vessel for which the plaintiff was acting as agent arrived at that port short of diesel bunker oil and hence unable to discharge its petroleum cargo; after four days of mooring with tug assistance, the vessel was towed out to an anchorage at sea by the port operator, an Indian governmental authority, which proceeded to assess the vessel, and when the vessel did not pay, to assess plaintiff $142,000 in \u201cpullback charges.\u201d When plaintiff refused to pay the charges, the port authority suspended plaintiff\u2019s stevedoring license. Thereafter plaintiff and its principal brought suit for damages in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, naming as defendants two corporations \u2014 the Liberian owner of the vessel and its New York-based operations manager \u2014 and one individual, the operation manager\u2019s port captain, who had been ordered to India by the operations manager to try to straighten matters out. The corporate defendants defaulted, and judgment was entered against them in the district court, after a court trial before Mary Johnson Lowe, <em>Judge, </em>for damages, punitive damages, attorneys fees, and expenses, in an amount totaling $1,009,-619.65. The district court then entered judgment in the same amount against the port captain on the theory that he is jointly and severally liable for the tort of conversion of the ship. Only he appeals. Since we are unable to fathom how there can be liability for conversion \u2014 a claim not pleaded in the amended complaint \u2014 where plaintiffs\u2019 possession or right to possession of the vessel is neither alleged nor proven, we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">The M/T IRINIO, a Panamanian flag vessel, was owned by codefendant Dutch-ess Shipping Co., Ltd. (\u201cDutchess\u201d), a Liberian corporation. Codefendant International Ship Management, Inc. (\u201cISM\u201d), a New York corporation, acted as operations manager of the IRINIO. Appellant and code-fendant Stavros K. Sorros was employed by ISM as a port captain; his job was to troubleshoot around the world for ISM, routinely meeting and inspecting vessels upon their arrival at foreign ports.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-13\">In December 1981, ISM entered on behalf of Dutchess into a charter party for the IRINIO with the Indian Oil Company (\u201cIOC\u201d), an Indian governmental agency exercising exclusive control over the importation and distribution of all oil products in India. The charter party called for the IRINIO to carry a cargo of crude oil from Venezuela to one or two discharge ports on the west coast of India, one of which was the port of Vadinar. Vadinar has no berthing facilities but does have an off-shore single-buoy mooring facility, or SBM, which is operated by IOC and at which vessels anchor to discharge their oil cargo through a submerged pipeline. The port nearest to Vadinar is some sixty kilometers away.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-14\">On February 5, 1982, while the IRINIO was en route, ISM entered into a general agency agreement with Cruickshank &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Company, Limited (\u201cCruickshank\u201d), a ship\u2019s agent operating in India. Because Cruickshank itself does not maintain an office near Vadinar, it appointed as sub-agent Pestonjee Bhicajee [Kutch] (\u201cKuteh\u201d), a sole proprietorship doing business as steamship agent, stevedore, clearing and forwarding agent, ship chandler, and container terminal operator. Although Kutch has an office at Jamnagar, the port sixty kilometers from Vadinar, communications with ISM were maintained through Cruickshank\u2019s office in Bombay.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">On February 6, the Master of the IRI-NIO transmitted a radiogram to Cruick-shank requesting that Cruickshank make arrangements for the vessel to bunker, <em>i.e., </em>to fill up with diesel fuel oil for her engines, upon her arrival. Thereafter, the IRINIO apparently encountered engine trouble and remained idle for some three days while repairs were being performed, during which she consumed most of her little remaining fuel oil. On February 10, the Master again transmitted a request to Cruickshank for delivery of seventy long tons of diesel oil upon the vessel\u2019s anticipated arrival the following day, similar requests for fuel having been sent by telex from ISM to Cruickshank that same day and on the two previous days. Kutch, however, directed Cruickshank to inform ISM that IOC would not release any fuel unless payment was received in advance, despite the fact that IOC owed Dutchess a considerable amount of money in charter hire earned on the voyage.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Apparently Cruickshank used the wrong telex number in attempting to communicate this demand to ISM, which remained unaware that IOC would not bunker the vessel until funds were remitted in advance. The following day, February 11, the Master requested \u201curgent urgent\u201d that Cruick-shank obtain the seventy long tons of diesel oil, and ISM continued to instruct Cruickshank by telex to provide the vessel with the required fuel. On arriving at the SBM off Vadinar on February 12, the IRI-NIO apparently had only 1.2 tons of diesel oil left on board, an amount insufficient to enable her to discharge. She therefore remained at the SBM awaiting a fuel delivery, meanwhile needing tug assistance from the port authority to remain at the mooring. By Friday, February 12, Cruick-shank and ISM were finally in mutual contact, but funds were not remitted to IOC until the following Monday, when $37,500 was sent to Cruickshank.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Meanwhile, the Kandla Port Trust (\u201cKPT\u201d), the Indian governmental port authority that was supplying tug boats to keep the IRINIO properly moored at the SBM, levied a fee known as \u201cpull-back charges\u201d against the vessel for the services provided by its tug boats. Although the original terms of the charter party obligated IOC to pay the pull-back charges assessed by KPT, IOC apparently refused to allow the vessel to discharge, even after the IRINIO had received three tons of fuel obtained by Kutch through local sources, until the Master signed a letter purporting to shift the obligation to pay the pull-back charges from IOC to Dutchess. On February 16, 1982, after finally discharging her oil cargo, the IRINIO went to an outer anchorage some five to seven miles at sea to await delivery of additional bunker fuel; at this point, the Master also sent Kuteh a letter of protest citing Kutch\u2019s failure to provide the diesel oil when requested. On the same day, KPT advised Kutch that Kutch was being held responsible for seeing to it that the pull-back charges were paid and that Kutch should therefore take steps to ensure that the IRINIO did not depart until the charges were satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">While the parties remained at odds over who was responsible for paying the pullback charges, ISM sent Sorros from New York to India to discuss the situation with Cruickshank, Kutch, and a Bombay attorney who represented the vessel\u2019s protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>and indemnity underwriters (\u201cP &amp; I Club\u201d). On March 12, Sorros met in Bombay with the attorney, who agreed to seek a bond from the P &amp; I Club in London that would secure the pull-back charges claim. On March 15, Sorros proceeded to Vadinar to inquire about the situation and to obtain Kutch\u2019s assistance in boarding the vessel. The next day, when Sorros boarded the IRINIO in the company of a Kutch employee, the ship\u2019s Master evidently expressed anger at Kutch for its failure to respond promptly to his repeated requests for diesel oil; the Kutch representative, however, attributed the delay to Cruickshank\u2019s failure to issue the necessary instructions. Sorros spoke with the Master, discussing the condition of the vessel and its fitness to sail, and upon leaving observed a barge delivering fuel that had been procured for the vessel by Kutch.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">Sorros then returned to Bombay, where he met with a Cruickshank representative and the P &amp; I Club attorney. The Cruick-shank representative blamed Kutch for the problems at Vadinar, but warned Sorros that the IRINIO would not be permitted to leave port unless the pull-back charges were paid and that Cruickshank and Kutch were preparing to seek a judicial order of arrest for the vessel. The attorney told Sorros that he had been unable to obtain a bond from the P &amp; I Club because liability for pull-back charges was not within the P &amp; I insurance coverage. Sorros testified that he then reported the status of the situation to ISM, which indicated that it would itself arrange for a bond. Sorros then left India to visit Greece.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Meanwhile, the IRINIO had departed from Vadinar before any order for its arrest had issued, proceeding to Singapore and then to Taiwan, where it was scrapped, the victim of a declining oil market. In June 1982, after a meeting in New York between ISM and Cruickshank at which ISM declined to pay Cruickshank and Kutch for the pull-back charges, Kutch and Cruickshank filed suit in the district court against Dutchess, ISM, and Sorros.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">The amended complaint stated three causes of action, the second and third advanced in the alternative. The first count alleged that, after the IRINIO had left Vadinar in breach of the corporate defendants\u2019 contractual obligation to pay the pullback charges, KPT not only assessed the charges against Kutch but threatened not to renew Kutch\u2019s stevedoring license, which was to expire on March 31,1982, and to withhold various other of KPT\u2019s exclusive port services and facilities, unless Kutch paid the charges by March 31, 1982. The complaint further alleged that Kutch challenged KPT\u2019s proposed action in an Indian court and that on May 5, 1982, the Indian court issued an order renewing Kutch\u2019s stevedoring license for two years and prohibiting KPT from discriminating against Kutch in providing port services pending the outcome of court proceedings to determine Kutch\u2019s liability for the pullback charges \u2014 with Kutch to post bond to secure those charges, a bond ultimately posted by Cruickshank on Kutch\u2019s guarantee of reimbursement. As a result of Cruickshank\u2019s having posted bond and against the possibility that the Indian court will at some point draw against it, plaintiffs requested that damages be assessed against the corporate defendants for $142,-000, the amount of the bond posted to secure KPT\u2019s claim against Kutch.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">The second count alleged that, as a result of the corporate defendants\u2019 breach of their contractual obligation to pay the pull-back charges, KPT refused to renew Kutch\u2019s stevedoring license,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> thus rendering the license \u201cimperiled\u201d and Kutch\u2019s business at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>the ports of Vadinar and Kandla damaged, as were its good will and reputation, in an amount totaling $1 million. The second count was advanced in the alternative with the third and last cause of action, which alleged a conspiracy among Dutchess, ISM and Sorros to cause Kutch damage by causing KPT to refuse to renew Kutch\u2019s steve-doring license, with a resulting loss of good will, reputation, business, etc., also in the amount of $1 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">No doubt to Sorro\u2019s chagrin, the corporate defendants defaulted, and judgment was entered against them on the first and third causes of action after a two-day bench trial in which the only witnesses were Kutch\u2019s sole proprietor and Sorros, though the testimony of ISM\u2019s president and sole shareholder had been taken by deposition. The district court awarded plaintiffs $142,000 plus interest, presumably on the first count. In addition, the court rendered judgment against the defaulting corporate defendants on the third count for $336,000, which is the sum of awards of (A) $84,000 for interest at 15% on each of the guarantees that Kutch and Cruickshank had been required to post in India, (B) $200,000 for lost earnings, (C) $39,000 in expenses for six round trips from India, (D) $8,000 for attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in India, and (E) $5,000 for salary and staff expenses to prepare for the litigation. In addition, the court awarded the plaintiffs reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, and $500,000 for loss of business and injury to reputation stemming from the suspension of Kutch\u2019s license as' a result of defendants\u2019 \u201ccausing the vessel, the IRI-NIO, to leave Vadinar port without paying properly assessed charges, together with interest from the date of this order.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court described the award of $500,-000 as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-10\">punitive damages, based upon the fact that, one, this Court finds that the evidence over and above the default is undisputed that the corporate defendants knew that the sum of money was due and owing; two, that they knew or had reason to know that it was an illegal act to leave port without proper authorization and without paying all sums due; three, that the act of taking the ship or causing the ship to leave the port without paying the sums due was not only an intentional tort but may have been and most possibly was a criminal act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">Sorros, an individual defendant below and now the sole appellant, was to fare identically. After requesting post-trial briefs addressing the extent of Sorros\u2019s liability for plaintiffs\u2019 damages, the district court found that Sorros had \u201cparticipated in a significant way in facilitating the departure of the M.V. IRINIO from her offshore anchorage without payment of port charges\u201d and that \u201cSorros did not act in good faith since he knew the port charges had been unpaid.\u201d Relying upon <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 233 (1965)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and <em>Restatement (Second) of Agency </em>\u00a7 343 (1958),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the court held that Sorros was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>jointly and severally liable with the defaulting corporate defendants \u201cfor the intentional tort of conversion\u201d and as such \u201cjointly and severally liable for all of the damages awarded [appellees] under the Third Cause of Action pleaded against defendants Dutchess Shipping Company, Ltd., and International Ship Management, Inc., and the First Cause of Action pleaded against defendant Sorros.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">It is, of course, basic to the law of conversion that liability runs only to a possessor of a chattel or one who was entitled to immediate possession of the chattel. <em>See Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 224A, 225 (1965); W. Prosser, <em>Handbook of the Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 15, at 93-97 (4th ed. 1971). As the New York courts have put it, \u201c[t]o establish conversion the plaintiff \u2018must demonstrate legal ownership or an immediate superior right of possession to a specific identifiable thing\u2019 [citing ease] and that the defendant exercised an unauthorized dominion over that property, which can be specific money, to the exclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>Meese v. Miller, </em>79 A.D.2d 237, 242-43, 436 N.Y. S.2d 496, 500 (1981); <em>accord General Electric Co. v. American Export Isbrandtsen Lines, Inc., </em>37 A.D.2d 959, 327 N.Y.S.2d 93, 95 (1971). Plaintiffs argue that \u201c[i]nchoate rights are sufficient\u201d to support an action for conversion, and that they \u201cwere deprived by Sorros's wrong of a right to perf\u00e9ct (by arrest) a \u2018personal\u2019 dominion over the IRINIO.\u201d But they concede that until the vessel had been formally arrested, no personal right of possession reposed in them, and this is fatal to a claim for conversion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nor do the admiralty decisions in <em>Sidney Blumenthal &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>30 F.2d 247 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>279 U.S. 847, 49 S.Ct. 345, 73 L.Ed. 991 (1929), or <em>The Poznan, </em>276 F. 418 (S.D.N.Y.1921), assist them. <em>The Poznan, </em>276 F. at 433, was simply a case in the classic mold involving inducement of breach of contract. It has nothing to do with conversion. <em>Sidney Blumenthal </em>does at least consider conversion, but only in language that is fully consistent with traditional tort law: the buyer of goods being shipped can make out a claim for conversion against the shipper that is analogous to a claim against a bailee who has possession for a limited purpose and \u201cuses the property beyond the terms of the contract.\u201d <em>Sidney Blumenthal &amp; Co., </em>30 F.2d at 248. The buyer in that case, as the owner of the goods, had a right to possession. But here neither Kutch nor Cruickshank had any interest in the IRINIO.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-13\">Perhaps the foregoing only serves to underscore the obvious: the district court mistook a case in contract for one in tort. Plaintiff\u2019s multiple claims for damages are based upon injury flowing from a single allegation of breach of obligation\u2014 the corporate defendants\u2019 refusal to pay the pull-back charges assessed by KPT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>against Kutch.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But the refusal to pay the pull-back charges, if wrongful, constitutes breach of an obligation of contract, not one of duty in tort, since the obligation arose only because of the corporate defendants\u2019 alleged agreement to pay the charges in modification of the arrangement determined by the charter party as originally drafted. Accordingly, it is not tort but contract law that determines the validity of the claim for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Given this view of the case, it is easy to see where the district court went wrong in finding Sorros jointly liable for the damages awarded against the defaulting corporate defendants, for the district court justified Sorros\u2019s individual liability to plaintiffs by reference to common law principles of agency applicable to tortfeasors, not to parties implicated in a contract. Sorros, not a party to the contract at issue, cannot be found liable for damages resulting from its breach, notwithstanding his status as an agent of one of the parties in breach. <em>See, e.g., </em>W. Prosser, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 92, at 613 (comparing obligations of contract with those in tort); <em>cf. Restatement (Second) of Agency </em>\u00a7 328 (agent authorized to bind principal in contract not liable for principal\u2019s breach). There is simply no basis for holding Sorros liable for the damages claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">This case is all the more puzzling for the fact that, even if the law were such that a claim in tort could be made out against Sorros and the defaulting defendants, the district court seems inexplicably not to have considered staying proceedings pending disposition of the two Indian lawsuits, <em>supra </em>note 2, which address two issues crucial to plaintiffs\u2019 claims \u2014 KPT\u2019s justification for imposing the pull-back charges upon Kutch, and KPT\u2019s justification for suspending Kutch\u2019s stevedoring license. Surely the Indian courts are far better positioned than we to resolve the issues of fact and law that even a cursory review of this case strongly suggests are material but inaccessible to us. It should not go without saying, for example, that Kutch\u2019s sole proprietor was considerably less than enthusiastic in his description of the conduct of the IOC and KPT, as well as the customs authorities, stating in his deposition testimony that \u201cwhenever they get an opportunity to get something out of you, they will try to make your life miserable.\u201d In other words, the courts in India may conclude that Kutch cannot be held responsible for the port charges and that KPT\u2019s action with respect to Kutch\u2019s license was pretextual. At this point, we have no idea whether under Indian law Kutch can or will be held responsible for these charges; we have only the factual situation that, in the midst of a dispute over responsibility for payment of the pull-back charges and immediately following Sorros\u2019s visit to the vessel \u2014 possibly as a result of directions given by Sorros on that visit as the district court doubtless viewed the case \u2014 the Master sailed out of Indian waters and away from the possible arrest of the vessel, leaving Kutch holding the bag, so to speak.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">We conclude that the judgment against Sorros must be reversed. We need not, therefore, address the propriety of the award of attorney\u2019s fees and punitive damages against him. The corporate defendants defaulted in the district court and do not now appeal; we therefore do not address the propriety of the judgment entered against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b126-6\">. The three-day delay before IOC received bunker fuel funds was not necessarily attributable to ISM. On February 13, a Cruickshank affiliate delivered a bank draft to IOC for approximately 117,400 with an urgent request that IOC provide fuel for the vessel, but IOC refused to accept the funds because, Sorros claims, delivery was attempted on a weekend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b127-9\">. The district court is not the only trial court to address issues in this case; according to the deposition testimony of Kutch\u2019s proprietor, there are two lawsuits pending in Indian courts \u2014 in one, Kutch and Cruickshank are plaintiffs challenging KPT\u2019s suspension of Kutch's license, while in the other, KPT is plaintiff in an action against Kutch and Cruickshank for nonpayment of the pull-back charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b127-11\">. The Kutch proprietor testified that, in apparent defiance of the Indian court\u2019s order, Kutch's stevedoring license was suspended in April 1982, and apparently continues to be suspended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b128-5\">. Presumably these damage awards are based on a finding that the charges were properly assessed, although the basis for such a finding is unclear since there was no proffer of Indian law by either party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b128-6\">. The district court quoted a subsection and comment to \u00a7 233 as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">\u00a7 233. <em>Conversion by Disposition by Agent as Against One Other Than Principal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"aq-dedup-0\">(1) Except as stated in Subsection (4) [footnote omitted], one who as agent or servant of a third person disposes of a chattel to one not entitled to its immediate possession in consummation of a transaction negotiated by the agent or servant is subject to liability for a conversion to another who, as against his principal or master, is entitled to the immediate possession of the chattel.</p>\n<p id=\"AKJ\">Comment (a) subsection (1) reads in part: Likewise an agent who delivers a chattel to his principal in consummation of a sale or other transaction which he has himself negotiated is within the rule stated in this Section, if the transaction purports to transfer a proprietary interest to the principal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b128-14\">. Section 343, quoted in full by the court, reads: \u00a7 343. <em>General Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-15\">An agent who does not act otherwise a tort is not relieved from liability by the fact that he acted at the command of the principal or on account of the principal, except where he is exercising a privilege of the principal, or a privilege held by him for the protection of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>principal\u2019s interests, or where the principal owes no duty or less than the normal duty of care to the person harmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">The court also quoted the following part of the comment to \u00a7 343:</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">d. An agent who assists another agent or the principal to commit a tort is normally himself liable as a joint tort feasor for the entire damage. Thus, those who assist in the wrongful removal of chattels, are subject to liability together with those for whom they act, except where their good faith creates a privilege in them to act. See the Restatement of Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 875-877. The act of the agent may play too small a part to render him legally responsible for the result, or the agent's innocence and purpose may create a privilege for him to act. In neither case, however, is he excused because he acts at the command of the principal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b129-15\">. The district court inadvertently stated that the first cause of action was pleaded against Sorros; it was not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b129-16\">. Even assuming an order for the IRINIO\u2019s arrest had issued before its departure, we are not informed that a possessory interest in the IRI-NIO would have risen in plaintiffs, let alone one sufficient to sustain a cause of action for conversion. Since execution on a maritime lien following arrest is made only by an admiralty court proceeding in rem, any possessory interest created by the arrest would seem to reside in the Indian court issuing the arrest, not in plaintiffs. <em>See </em>G. Gilmore &amp; C. Black, <em>The Law of Admiralty </em>587-90 (2d ed. 1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b130-6\">. The refusal to pay the pull-back charges is the direct cause of the alleged injury \u2014 the assessment of those charges against Kutch \u2014 grounding plaintiffs\u2019 claim for damages in the first cause of action; it is also the act that allegedly triggered KPT's suspension of Kutch\u2019s stevedor-ing license, which is the third-party act grounding the claim for consequential damages in the second and third causes of action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
