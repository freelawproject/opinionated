(sometimes Pyramid) reached an understanding that plaintiffs should construct a retail shopping mall in Pittsfield with the city\u2019s assistance. The questions are whether the evidence supports a finding that this understanding reached a point in form and substance sufficient to constitute a contract, and whether, if it did, it was legally binding on the city. Contract or not, the understanding was subsequently repudiated by defendant Charles L. Smith when he succeeded Brindle as mayor in 1980, for which action separate claims are made against him personally. As an affirmative defense, defendants claim that it was plaintiffs who failed to perform. We need reach only the question of enforceability.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">When plaintiffs rested on the sixth day of trial, the court directed a verdict for defendants on all counts on the ground that Mass.G.L. c. 43, \u00a7 29, applicable to certain municipal contracts of $2,000. or more, requires a written contract with the mayor\u2019s approval \u201caffixed thereto.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court stated \u201c[t]he purpose of the statute was not to give limitless power to the May- or to bind a city ... [but] to limit such power in order to protect a city\u2019s treasury.\u201d Unfortunately, it is just the opposite. The statute is directed not to restricting the mayor, but to restricting contracts made by a \u201cdepartment, board or commission,\u201d without the mayor\u2019s written approval. \u201cThe purpose ... is to limit the power of public officials ... so as to unify the control of the city\u2019s commercial transactions, and guard against waste by departments in the government____ [T]he mayor must be able to exercise his \u2018practical wisdom in the administration of the affairs of the city.\u2019 \u201d <em>Urban Transport, Inc. v. Mayor of Boston, </em>373 Mass. 693, 697, 369 N.E.2d 1135 (1977) (citations omitted). To say that a statute intended to give the mayor control over contracts made by departments, boards, and commissions limits his own contracts, misreads both its language and its purpose. And, indeed, defendants, in placing less than half-hearted reliance upon this statute in their brief, apparently recognize as much.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">It does not follow, however, that it was error to direct a verdict. We return to the beginning. There is no question of the city\u2019s authority to agree to a mall, parking garage and street improvements. Mass. G.L. c. 40 \u00a7 5 provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-14\">Section 5. Authorization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-15\">A town may at any town meeting appropriate money for the exercise of any of its corporate powers, including the following purposes: ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-16\">(4) For laying out, discontinuing, making, altering and repairing public ways, and for materials used and labor employed thereon____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-17\">(33) For acquiring land ... for public parking places and maintaining the same____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-18\">(64) For the purpose of establishing, constructing and maintaining shoppers' malls within the public ways, includng the paving, landscaping and beautification thereof and the installation of utilities and other public conveniences there-at____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-19\">We turn, accordingly, to the mayor\u2019s powers, and whether plaintiffs\u2019 asserted con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>tract complied with formal legislative prerequisites other than chapter 43 \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Plaintiffs allege that the mayor agreed, on behalf of the city, to construct a 3,000 car parking garage, and to make necessary improvements and additions to the streets adjacent to the mall and garage, all subject to the city\u2019s obtaining federal and state funding. Defendants, noting that the mayor\u2019s agreement was not in writing, invoke, as \u201cclearly applicable,\u201d Mass.G.L. c. 40, \u00a7 4B and Pittsfield City Charter Section 40. These require advertising for sealed bids on purchases of \u201cequipment, supplies or materials,\u201d and on construction, beyond certain costs. In agreeing to undertake the project, however, the mayor was not purchasing, nor was he designating the plaintiffs or any other contractor. It is only when those steps are reached that advertising is required. <em>See, e.g., Cerwonka, v. Saugus, </em>316 Mass. 152, 153, 55 N.E.2d 1 (1944); <em>Ryan v. Somerville, </em>328 Mass. 324, 325, 103 N.E.2d 707 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Equally mistaken is defendants\u2019 claim that Mass.G.L. c. 44, \u00a7 31, limiting the city\u2019s liability to the amount then appropriated, invalidates the mayor\u2019s contract, no appropriation having been made in October, 1978 when it was allegedly created. <em>Cf. Adalian Brothers, Inc. v. Boston, </em>323 Mass. 629, 630-32, 84 N.E.2d 35 (1949); <em>Ryan, </em>328 Mass. at 326,103 N.E.2d 707.. This section appears under a subchapter entitled \u201cDepartment Appropriations.\u201d It is inapplicable to the mayor for the same reasons as concern Mass.G.L. c. 43, \u00a7 29, ante.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Without proceeding further along this line, there is a much more serious and, indeed, fatal obstacle. With respect to streets, significant modifying and improving of public ways was an essential part of the mall undertaking. In their letter to Brindle of October 27, 1978, which they now describe as the contract, plaintiffs provided that their \u201ccommitment to construct such a shopping center is subject to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">2. Construction by the City of Pittsfield of adequate street and traffic improvements including____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Although throughout their brief plaintiffs state that the City\u2019s \u201cprincipal responsibility was to provide a free parking structure,\u201d the street improvements were of a substantial nature. The HUD loan application, dated October 31, 1978, refers broadly to \u201can improved streetscape ... [whereby] existing and future traffic congestion will be minimized.\u201d Even a casual glance at an over one-hundred page Traffic Impact Study accompanying the Plan would show, \u201cconstruction of the ... Francis Street extension to Old West Street;\u201d \u201cconstruction of new West Street;\u201d \u201cNorth Street Widening \u2014 An additional southbound lane;\u201d \u201cEast Street should be widened.\u201d While possibly not all of this was part of mall servicing, but related to the area\u2019s overall neighborhood improvement, much of it was needed for the increased flow that would be generated by the mall. It was beyond the mayor\u2019s powers to agree to this.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Assuming the mayor can contract on behalf of the City for many things, streets and ways are an exception. Section 35 of Pittsfield\u2019s charter provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-10\">\u201cThe city council, except as provided in section twenty-three,[<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>] shall have <em>exclusive </em>authority and power to order the laying out, locating anew or discontinuing of, or making specific repairs in all streets and ways, ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">The broadest possible general powers in a mayor to contract cannot override a specific statutory assignment of authority to another department. <em>Fiske v. Worcester, </em>219 Mass. 428, 429-30, 106 N.E. 1025 (1914). Accordingly, the project\u2019s enforceability hangs on city council approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-14\">Plaintiffs\u2019 first approach is to say that \u201cthe City Council was not required to vote on the project beyond making an ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>propriation,\u201d citing the charter generally, but without noting Section 35. They then add, \u201cNonetheless, the City Council, on October 30, 1978, December 20,1978, January 23, 1979, July 17,1979, September 25,1979, and December 26, 1979, voted to move forward with the Project as initially agreed to in October 1978.\u201d Unfortunately for plaintiffs, this is not the case. Whatever Un-gerer and Brindle testified that they orally agreed to in October, 1978, the council agreed to nothing, except to authorize an application for a $24,850,000. HUD grant. Not only did plaintiffs\u2019 commitment letter of October 27, 1978, state that their \u201cCommitment is made with the understanding that a legally binding agreement between (sic) the City will need to be executed upon approval of the City\u2019s Action Grant application,\u201d but by letter of October 30, contemporaneous with the council\u2019s vote, \u201cPyramid acknowledges that the submission of the UDAG application (including the commitment letter ... to the City contained therein) does not (1) constitute a commitment by the City of Pittsfield to undertake any of the activities outlined in the UDAG application____\u201d Consequently, its October 30 vote authorizing the application bound the council to nothing. Consistent therewith, it was stated at the meeting that the council \u201cwould have many opportunities to vote on the project.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">At the December 20, 1978 meeting the council adopted an order appropriating $8,500,000. \u201cas the city\u2019s share of the cost\u201d of the project. However, again there was no firm commitment. The order stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A28\">\u201cProvided that the City Council by vote hereafter determines that the funds appropriated herein, together with grant funds authorized by the United States of America and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are sufficient to meet the estimated public cost to complete the foregoing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Before voting, various councilors inquired as to the binding effect of the vote, viz-a-viz the project. Inter alia, Attorney Grand-champ said, \u201c[T]he traffic was wholly within the purview of the council ... [that] the critical vote was yet to come ... [and that] if the U.D.A.G. granted less than the twenty-four million dollars ... that would require a new vote and new legislation.\u201d The quoted proviso made this last point apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">The January 23, 1979 vote referred to by plaintiffs merely affirmed the December 20 vote. On July 17,1979 the council voted to approve \u201cthe general design, character, location, dimensions and siting of the regional shopping mall and the three-level parking garage,\u201d with several important reservations for reconsideration. This was a vote of confidence, and not formal adoption of a contract, as one of the council\u2019s reservations concerned certain traffic alterations and it authorized an \u201cinvestigation and [a] report in regard to the feasibility\u201d of certain other street alterations. On September 25, 1979 the council authorized the mayor to sign the Urban Development Action Grant Contract. But, this again, was not a contract with plaintiffs, the execution of which was not yet accomplished, as indeed, a recorded comment from the floor made clear. The crunch came on December 13, 1979, when it became apparent what were the consequences of HUD's grant of $14,200,000 rather than the $24,-850,000 originally requested. Plaintiffs would neglect this altogether and have submitted a 59 page brief without even mentioning, let alone discussing the consequences of, this very substantial reduction. All they say is,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-10\">\u201cThe evidence of the conduct of the parties confirmed the Ungerer-Brindle testimony that they had an agreement. Both parties performed pursuant to that agreement for over sixteen (16) months. The City sought and obtained a $14.2 million UDAG grant \u2014 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">It is true that when HUD said it would grant only $14.2 million the city made application therefor, but this was not a commitment. Rather, the council voted, \u201cthat the City Council move forward with the proposed concept,\u201d and \u201cA. That the council direct Attorney Philip H. Grandchamp to begin contract negotiations with Pyramid as suggested by H.U.D. to retain the $14,-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>200,000; ...\u201d Many proposed terms for such were noted. They were never agreed to.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Finally, contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, there was no vote on December 26, 1979.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">It is to be greatly doubted whether it could be found that the city council even provisionally agreed to the project, more particularly the street construction and improvements, on a $24,850,000 basis. In any event, it is plain that it never agreed on the basis of a HUD contribution of only $14.2 million. With no approval of the essential \u201ctraffic [requirements] wholly within the purview of the council,\u201d ante, plaintiffs must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">There is no need to pursue other doubtful questions, or possible personal liability of defendant Smith. He could not be liable for interfering with a contract, because there was none. As to claimed interference with advantageous business relations, even if the court had admitted the evidence that Smith had a friend who opposed the mall, offered to show he was not performing properly his official functions, it would have been insufficient. <em>Laurendeau v. Ke-waunee Scientific Equipment, </em>17 Mass. App. 113, 456 N.E.2d 767, 773 (1983). There was no other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The district court looked to the wrong statute, but its result was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b369-9\">. On this appeal, in urging need of a writing, defendants would also cite sections of the statute of frauds, Mass.G.L. c. 259. This statute is an affirmative defense that must be pleaded. F.R.Civ.P. 8(c). Defendants did not plead it, and the court did not consider it; nor will we. chapter 43, \u00a7 29, on which the court relied, was also not pleaded, but since, if applicable, it affected the making of the contract, it did not need to be pleaded. At the same time we confess to wondering why a case should be tried for six days if there was a complete statutory defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b370-11\"> Section 23 empowers the mayor to require the city council to reconsider and re-vote on its orders and decisions, leaving the ultimate power in the council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b372-10\">. Plaintiffs also offer two public referenda as council approval. But defendants aptly note that the December 1978 and April 1979 referen-da were nonbinding under Mass.G.L. c. 53 \u00a7 18A. The Pittsfield City Charter did not provide for a referendum procedure until October 1983. In any case, these referenda occurred before HUD awarded a greatly reduced grant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
