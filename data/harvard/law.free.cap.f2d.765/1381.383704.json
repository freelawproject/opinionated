In dismissing petitioner\u2019s appeal, the Board relied on <em>Tidelands Marine Serv. v. Patterson, </em>719 F.2d 126 (5th Cir.1983) <em>(\u201cTidelands\u201d), </em>which held that the Board lacked jurisdiction to review supplemental orders finding employers in default of their obligation to pay additional compensation owing under \u00a7 914(f). Petitioner contends that the Board misconstrued the LHWCA in holding that it lacked jurisdiction to review a supplemental order awarding additional compensation under \u00a7 914(f). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-14\">This dispute arises from a Compensation Order of an Administrative Law Judge (the \u201cALJ\u201d), entered on November 15, 1983, finding that respondent Constance Kain was entitled to disability payments from her employer, Marine Industries Northwest. Petitioner, the insurer of Marine Industries Northwest, filed both a motion for reconsideration and an appeal from the compensation order. On January 13, 1984, the ALJ denied the motion for reconsideration. Petitioner then filed an amended notice of appeal and that appeal remains pending before the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-15\">On January 25, 1984, respondent Kain applied for a supplementary order for 20 percent additional compensation under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914(f), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1487-16\">If any compensation, payable under the terms of an award, is not paid within ten days after it becomes due, there shall be added to such unpaid compensation an amount equal to 20 per centum thereof, which shall be paid at the same time as, but in addition to, such compensation, unless review of the compensation order making such award is had as provided in section 21 and an order staying payments has been issued by the Board or court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1487-17\">The Deputy Commissioner found that: (1) petitioner had not obtained a stay of its payment obligations under the November 15, 1983 compensation order; and (2) payment had not been made within 10 days, and held that petitioner was liable to Kain for the additional 20 percent under \u00a7 914(f). Petitioner appealed this supplementary order to the Board which, as noted, dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Petitioner now seeks review of the Board\u2019s order dismissing the appeal. We have jurisdiction under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-18\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b1487-19\">Whether the Board misconstrued the LHWCA, and thus erred, in holding that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1384\">*1384</page-number>lacked jurisdiction to review supplementary orders awarding additional compensation under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-5\">We review the Board\u2019s decision for errors of law. <em>Todd Shipyards Corp. v. Black, </em>717 F.2d 1280, 1284 (9th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 1910, 80 L.Ed.2d 459 (1984); <em>Duncanson-Harrelson Co. v. Director (OWCP), </em>686 F.2d 1336, 1338 (9th Cir.1982), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>462 U.S. 1101, 103 S.Ct. 2446, 77 L.Ed.2d 1329 (1983). In doing so, however, because the Board does not make policy, its interpretations of the LHWCA are not entitled to any special deference. <em>Potomac Elec. Power Co. v. Director (OWCP), </em>449 U.S. 268, 101 S.Ct. 509, 66 L.Ed.2d 446 (1980); <em>Duncanson-Harrelson Co., </em>686 F.2d at 1339.</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-9\">The LHWCA contains two distinct methods of obtaining review and enforcement of compensation orders. Petitioner asserts that supplementary orders assessing \u00a7 914(f) additional compensation are reviewable by the Board under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(3). Only after Board review, according to petitioner, could the claimant take the supplementary order to the United States District Court for enforcement. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(d). The respondent Director (\u201crespondent\u201d) adopting the position of the Board and the Fifth Circuit in <em>Tidelands,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>argues that \u00a7 914(f) penalty orders are to be treated as orders entered under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 918. Section 918 orders are final when issued and are not subject to review by the Board. Review of such orders is available only in an enforcement proceeding in the district court. The district court\u2019s role in such a proceeding is to determine whether the order was issued in accordance with law. Review of any judgment entered by the district court \u201cmay be had as in civil suits for damages,.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 918(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1488-12\">The abbreviated \u00a7 918 procedure is limited to situations where the employer\u2019s liability already has been determined under a compensation order and the employer is in default of its payment obligations under that order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1488-13\">In case of default by the employer in the payment of compensation due under any award of compensation for a period of thirty days after the compensation is due and payable, the person to whom such compensation is due may ... make application to the deputy commissioner ... for a supplementary order declaring the amount of the default____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1488-15\">33 U.S.C. \u00a7 918(a). Petitioner has misconstrued this section in arguing that it only applies to \u201cfinal\u201d compensation orders. Compensation is \u201cdue\u201d under this provision when the underlying compensation order becomes \u201ceffective.\u201d <em>Tidelands, </em>719 F.2d at 127 n. 1; <em>Arrow Stevedore Co. v. Pillsbury, </em>88 F.2d 446, 447 (9th Cir.1937). An order becomes \u201ceffective\u201d when filed in the office of the Deputy Commissioner; it does not become \u201cfinal\u201d until after appeal or after 30 days if no appeal is filed. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a). Thus, an employer is bound to pay an award even if an appeal is pending unless a stay is obtained.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1488-16\">The LHWCA is explicitly designed to encourage the prompt payment by employers of obligations under a compensation order notwithstanding the existence of an appeal. <em>See </em>H.Rep. No. 92-1441, 1972 <em>U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News </em>4698, 4709-10. Where employers fail to meet their obligations, \u00a7 918 constitutes \u201ca quick and inexpensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1385\">*1385</page-number>mechanism for the prompt enforcement of unpaid compensation awards____\u201d <em>Tidelands, </em>719 F.2d at 129. The principal differences between \u00a7 918 orders and \u00a7 921 orders are: (1) orders issued under \u00a7 918, unlike \u00a7 921 orders, are not appealable to the Board; (2) \u00a7 918 orders are final when issued unlike \u00a7 921 orders which do not become final until after 30 days or, if appealed, after appeal; and (3) as a result, \u00a7 918 supplementary orders can immediately be filed with the federal district court for enforcement. Thus, it is apparent that under \u00a7 918 the claimant is provided with a quicker and less cumbersome mechanism for enforcing compensation awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1489-7\">Section 914(f) is in essence a penalty provision that will apply in every instance (except where a stay is granted) where the employer fails to pay an award within 10 days after it has become due. The Fifth Circuit in <em>Tidelands </em>termed \u00a7 914(f) \u201cself-executing\u201d in that \u201cthe 20 percent additional compensation automatically becomes due immediately upon the expiration of the ten-day period____\u201d 719 F.2d at 128 n. 2. <em>See also Overseas African Constr. Co. v. McMullen, </em>367 F.Supp. 202, 207 (S.D.N.Y.1973), <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>500 F.2d 1291 (2d Cir.1974) (provision is \u201cmandatory\u201d). Indeed, the provision does not vest the Deputy Commissioner with any discretion. As the proceedings below demonstrate, his role is limited to making the following determinations: (1) that payment under a compensation award has become due; (2) that since payment has become due ten days elapsed without the employer either making a payment or obtaining a stay; and (3) the amount due and the calculation of the 20 percent penalty. The only difference between the \u00a7 914 determination and the standard declaration of default under \u00a7 918, is that in the former, the Deputy Commissioner must calculate the 20 percent to be added to the amount in default.</p>\n<p id=\"b1489-10\">As stated, the Board relied on <em>Tidelands </em>in dismissing petitioner\u2019s appeal. In <em>Tidelands, </em>on the claimant\u2019s request, the Deputy Commissioner \u201cnotified\u201d the insurer that 20 percent additional compensation was due to the claimant under \u00a7 914(f). More than 30 days thereafter, the Deputy Commissioner issued an \u201cAward of Compensation Under Section [9]14(f),\u201d finding the employer in default in the payment of the additional compensation. 719 F.2d at 128. In the Fifth Circuit\u2019s view, this second order was not a \u00a7 914(f) order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1489-13\">Although the deputy commissioner entitled his order an \u201cAward of Compensation Under Section [9]14(f),\u201d and although the Benefits Review Board on appeal referred to the order merely as being one based upon a \u201cSection [9]14(f) assessment,\u201d it is clear that in substance the order was a \u201csupplementary order declaring the amount of the default\u201d within the meaning of Section 18(a) of the LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 918(a) ... For jurisdictional purposes we view the order appealed from as a \u00a7 918(a) compensation default order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1489-14\">719 F.2d at 128 n. 3. The case at bench differs procedurally from <em>Tidelands </em>in that there was not, first, a \u201cnotice\u201d of additional compensation, followed by a \u201csupplementary\u201d default order. Here, in effect, the notice and order were combined into a single \u201csupplementary compensation order.\u201d Thus, the appeal to the Board was taken directly from the additional compensation order. Respondent contends that the supplementary compensation order at issue is a \u00a7 918 order declaring default of the underlying compensation award. In determining the amount of such default, respondent argues, the Deputy Commissioner may compute first any amounts not paid under the underlying compensation order and second any amounts that may have \u201cautomatically\u201d become due pursuant to \u00a7 914(f). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1489-15\">Section 914(f) states that the 20 percent additional compensation \u201cshall be paid at the same time as, but in addition to,\u201d the unpaid compensation. The section does not, itself, provide for the issuance of any orders. Consequently, the order had to have been issued under either \u00a7 918 or \u00a7 921. Under \u00a7 918 the claimant could in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1386\">*1386</page-number>one proceeding obtain a supplementary order declaring both the amount unpaid under a compensation order and the 20 percent additional compensation under \u00a7 914(f). The two determinations could then without delay be presented to the district court for enforcement in a single proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1490-4\">On the other hand, if \u00a7 914(f) supplementary orders were subject to \u00a7 921 procedures, it would be far more difficult and cumbersome for a claimant to collect both awards at the same time. Under this scheme, if the claimant were to receive supplementary orders both for the amount in default on the initial compensation order and for the 20 percent additional compensation, the former would be immediately enforceable under \u00a7 918 in district court. However, on the latter, if issued pursuant to \u00a7 921, the claimant would have to wait an additional 30 days and then return to the Deputy Commissioner for a second supplementary order under \u00a7 918 declaring the default of the first supplementary order. This latter scheme is obviously needlessly duplicative and time consuming and completely at variance with Congress\u2019 intent. <em>See Tidelands, </em>719 F.2d at 129 (\u201c[A] quick and inexpensive mechanism for the prompt enforcement of unpaid compensation awards\u201d is \u201ca theme central to the spirit, intent, and purposes of the LHWCA\u201d). Thus, \u00a7 918 enforcement of additional compensation awards under \u00a7 914(f) far better meets the Congressional purpose of a quick and streamlined mechanism for the collection of compensation under the LHWCA. We, therefore, agree with the Fifth Circuit in <em>Tidelands </em>that although the Deputy Commissioner mischaracterized his supplementary compensation order as an order made under \u00a7 914(f), \u201cin substance the order was a \u2018supplementary order declaring the amount of the [additional] default\u2019 within the meaning of Section 18(a) of the LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 918(a)....\u201d 719 F.2d at 128 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1490-5\">Petitioner argues that if this Court were to uphold the Board\u2019s ruling, much of the administrative appeals structure established by Congress in the 1972 Amendments to the LHWCA would be undermined. The argument is meritless. The Board\u2019s function is to determine appeals raising a substantial question of law or fact. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(3). Moreover, orders declaring defaults are not appealable. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 918(a). As noted above, an order awarding 20 percent additional compensation under \u00a7 914(f) is nothing more than a standard default order, plus an additional arithmetic computation. Like the standard default order, it does not raise substantial issues of law or fact. Conceivably, computational problems could arise. However, these could be easily resolved at the enforcement stage in federal district court without resort to a full administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1490-7\">Petitioner\u2019s attempt to distinguish the standard \u00a7 918 default order from the \u00a7 914(f) order in that the former awards \u201cexisting compensation\u201d while the latter awards \u201cadditional compensation\u201d is also meritless. It is worth reiterating that \u00a7 914(f) rejects such a distinction in requiring that both forms of compensation be paid at the same time. Moreover, the distinction is merely semantic. Both the \u00a7 914(f) award and the standard \u00a7 918(a) default award are purely mechanical and are based on an appealable prior compensation order that resolves the substantive rights of the parties. Upholding the Board's dismissal in this case would in no way interfere with any party\u2019s appeal to the Board of any substantive issues raised by the initial compensation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1490-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1490-9\">We conclude that the Board was correct in determining that it lacked jurisdiction to hear appeals of supplementary orders deciding amounts in default pursuant to \u00a7 914(f). The Board\u2019s decision is, therefore, affirmed and the petition for review is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1488-10\">. Respondent also has cited <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp. v. Wertz, </em>720 F.2d 324 (3d Cir.1983) (per curiam), for the same proposition. However, it is impossible to discern from the opinion what provisions were at issue in the case. Respondent has appended to his brief a copy of the supplementary order at issue in that case and it appears to involve the same issue present in the case at bench. All of the parties conceded that the Board lacked jurisdiction to review the order in question. <em>Id. </em>at 325.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1488-18\">.
