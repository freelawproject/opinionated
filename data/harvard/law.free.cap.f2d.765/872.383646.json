Taylor (hereinafter Taylor) appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment affirming the denial of her application for disability benefits by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (hereinafter the Secretary), 576 F.Supp. 1172. Taylor contends that the Secretary had no grounds for reversing the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (hereinafter AU) determination that she was indeed disabled as of May 1974, since that decision was supported by substantial evidence. She argues that the court should have reviewed the ALJ\u2019s decision to determine whether it was supported by substantial evidence, rather than reviewing only the Secretary\u2019s decision. Taylor also argues that her pain constitutes a recognized form of disability. Finally, she contends that the district court erred in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to review the Secretary\u2019s decision to not reopen Taylor\u2019s 1976 application for disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-24\">We address each of Taylor\u2019s contentions and the facts pertinent thereto under separate headings.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-25\">1. <em>Secretary\u2019s Review of ALJ</em></p>\n<p id=\"b978-26\">Taylor asserts that the Secretary could not reverse the ALJ\u2019s determination that Taylor was disabled if the ALJ\u2019s finding was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-27\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(b) specifically provides that the Secretary is authorized on her own motion to hold such hearings and conduct such investigations as she may deem necessary or proper for the administration of benefits. Further, under the administrative regulations which were promulgated to give effect to the scope and intent of the Social Security Act, the Secretary is authorized to review any decision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>an AU on her own motion. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.969. The regulations also provide for mandatory review where the ALJ\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.970(a)(3). In so doing, the Secretary may \u201cconsider the evidence in the [whole] record and any additional evidence it believes is material to an issue being considered.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-976(b). The Secretary thus had unlimited authority to review the merits of the ALJ\u2019s determination of disability under the Social Security Act and the applicable regulations. She was not required to adopt the particular findings of the AU even if those findings were supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">2. <em>District Court\u2019s Scope of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">Taylor contends that the district court erred by limiting its scope of review to determining whether the Secretary\u2019s conclusion that Taylor was not disabled was supported by substantial evidence. She argues that the district court should only have reviewed whether the AU\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence since the Secretary derived her authority to review the AU from 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-970(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">The Secretary is empowered to affirm, modify or reverse the AU\u2019s decision. Such decision then becomes final and is binding upon the parties unless review is sought in district court. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-981.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">\u201cThe court will set aside a denial of benefits only if <em>the Secretary\u2019s findings </em>are based upon legal error or are not supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Kail v. Heckler, </em>722 F.2d 1496, 1497 (9th Cir.1984) (emphasis added). Judicial review is limited to \u201cfinal decisions\u201d of the Secretary. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). The district court properly reviewed only the Secretary\u2019s final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">3. <em>Substantial Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">Taylor\u2019s application for benefits in 1976 was denied due to her failure to prove that she was disabled as of December 1976. Since Taylor failed to seek review of that initial determination, the decision became final and binding on all parties to the action. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.905. Taylor thus continued to carry the burden of proving disability in her 1981 application because the 1976 findings of non-disability created a presumption of continuing non-disability. <em>Lyle v. Secretary, </em>700 F.2d 566, 568 (9th Cir.1983). The claimant can overcome this presumption by proving \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d indicating a greater disability. <em>Booz v. Secretary, </em>734 F.2d 1378, 1379-80 (9th Cir.1984). Here, it appears that Taylor\u2019s condition had improved rather than deteriorated. The record indicates that between 1976 and 1978 Taylor experienced improvement in the nature of her limitations and pain allegedly suffered. She has therefore failed to show the requisite \u201cchanged circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b979-13\">Even if the presumption were not applied, however, the Secretary\u2019s decision must be affirmed. As we have noted, the Secretary's findings are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence. Substantial evidence means \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1427, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (quoting <em>Consolidated Edison Corp. v. N.L.R.B., </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 216, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)); <em>Sample v. Schweiker, </em>694 F.2d 639, 642 (9th Cir.1982). Because substantial evidence supports the Secretary\u2019s finding that Taylor was not under a \u201cdisability,\u201d as defined in the Social Security Act, at any time through the date of the decision, we cannot disturb it.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-14\">4. <em>Pain As Disability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b979-15\">Taylor contends that the Secretary failed to give adequate consideration to the evidence of pain in determining that a disability had not been proved. She argues that a claimant\u2019s complaints of pain cannot be disregarded solely because there is no objective evidence that proves the truth of the complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>A claimant\u2019s subjective complaint of pain is by itself insufficient to establish disability. <em>Sorenson v. Weinberger, </em>514 F.2d 1112, 1118 (9th Cir.1975). In order for pain to be disabling, subjective complaints must be accompanied by medical evidence. <em>See Gonzales v. Harris, </em>631 F.2d 143, 146 (9th Cir.1980) (despite claimant\u2019s testimony on pain, she failed to prove disability, in view of evidence of her activity and lack of medical evidence on her alleged disability); <em>Gallagher v. Schweiker, </em>697 F.2d 82, 85 (2d Cir.1983) (although alleging severe pain, claimant failed to produce medical evidence indentifying underlying impairment and was therefore denied benefits).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">The Secretary made a detailed review of the evidence presented in support of Taylor\u2019s contention that her pain rendered her unable to engage in gainful activity. The Secretary found that the record failed to reveal evidence of severe impairment and concluded that it did not find statements made by the claimant and her witnesses that Taylor suffered from severe unremitting pain to be credible due to the lack of medical evidence to explain the nature of her complaints. The record supports the Secretary\u2019s conclusion that Taylor\u2019s complaints of pain were unsupported by medical evidence. The Secretary can disregard a claimant\u2019s self-serving statements if they are unsupported by objective evidence. <em>Maounis v. Heckler, </em>738 F.2d 1032, 1034 (9th Cir.1984), <em>citing Coats v. Heckler, </em>733 F.2d 1338, 1340 (9th Cir.1984). In light of Taylor\u2019s failure to substantiate her claim by clear medical evidence, we must uphold the Secretary\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">5. <em>Administrative res judicata</em></p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">Taylor contends that the Secretary\u2019s 1976 denial of her benefits never became \u201cfinal\u201d because Taylor was not. afforded the opportunity to have an administrative hearing for purposes of reconsideration. She argues that the Secretary\u2019s contention that administrative finality, or res judicata, precludes review of the 1976 claim is incorrect. She further argues that it would be manifestly unjust to apply res judicata to her 1976 claim in the absence of a hearing held on the merits of the claim. Finally, she argues that the district court had jurisdiction over the Secretary\u2019s decision not to reopen Taylor\u2019s previous claim for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">The Secretary was correct in concluding that res judicata precluded the AU from reviewing the merits of Taylor\u2019s 1976 claim. After Taylor\u2019s 1976 claim was initially decided, she had the right to request a reconsideration within 60 days after the date she received notice of the determination. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.909. Taylor did not seek reconsideration. The initial determination therefore became binding and was considered to be the final decision of the Secretary. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.905. The principal of res judicata applies to findings and decisions on the merits which become final as a result of a claimant\u2019s failure to seek administrative review after notice of an adverse decision. <em>Stuckey v, Weinberger, </em>488 F.2d 904, 909-11 (9th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">Taylor\u2019s argument that res judicata should not bar a subsequent review of her claim because she was never afforded a hearing is unpersuasive. The regulations specifically provide that res judicata may be grounds for denying a hearing on a claim that has already become final. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.957(c)(1). Further, this court has held that res judicata may apply even where the claimant never had a hearing, if the claimant has failed to pursue an appeal and has presented no new facts in a subsequent application to demonstrate that there may have been inadequate grounds to support a determination of non-disability on the previous application. <em>Thompson v. Schweiker, </em>665 F.2d 936, 940 (9th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-10\">Further, a claimant is not entitled to a hearing where she has failed to seek reconsideration within 60 days after receiving notification of an adverse determination unless she can prove \u201cgood cause\u201d for missing the deadline. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.911. The Secretary\u2019s decision to allow a late reconsideration of an earlier claim is strictly discretionary. Taylor failed to prove she had \u201cgood cause\u201d for missing the deadline in seeking an administrative hearing on her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>1976 claim. She also failed to provide evidence that there were adequate grounds to prove disability based on the 1976 application. Consequently, the manifest injustice exception to res judicata does not apply to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\">The Secretary reviewed the AU\u2019s decision to \u201creopen\u201d the 1976 claim and found that there were no grounds to reopen the claim under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404,989. The district court concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to review the Secretary\u2019s decision not to reopen the 1976 claim. Taylor claims the court did have jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">Once a decision becomes administratively final, the Secretary\u2019s decision to reopen a claim is purely discretionary. <em>Davis v. Schweiker, </em>665 F.2d 934, 935 (9th Cir.1982); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.987(a). Discretionary decisions are not \u201cfinal decisions\u201d within the meaning of section 450(g). <em>Id. </em>at 935. Therefore, a refusal by the Secretary to reopen a previous decision is not a \u201cfinal\u201d decision subject to judicial review. <em>Singer v. Schweiker, </em>694 F.2d 616, 617 (9th Cir.1982). Thus, the district court did not have jurisdiction under section 405(g) to review the Secretary\u2019s decision to not reopen Taylor\u2019s 1976 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
