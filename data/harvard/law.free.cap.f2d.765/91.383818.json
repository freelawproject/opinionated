Earl had been sentenced to life imprisonment following his conviction of first-degree murder by a Wisconsin state court. After exhausting his state remedies he sought federal habeas corpus, arguing that he had not had effective assistance of counsel at his state trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-21\">Earl does not deny having stabbed to death Denise Stacy, a friend of his estranged wife, Nancy Earl. Nancy Earl testified that she overheard her husband say to a police officer, three days before Harold Earl killed Denise Stacy, \u201cDamn, Denise, if she doesn\u2019t stay out of my business, I am going to kill that bitch.\u201d This testimony is the focus of Earl\u2019s complaint about the effectiveness of his trial lawyer\u2019s efforts on his behalf. The testimony almost certainly was false. Both police officers denied under oath \u2014 but in post-conviction proceedings, not at the trial \u2014 that Earl had threatened Denise during the incident about which Nancy Earl had testified. But Earl\u2019s lawyer failed to interview the officers, and not knowing what their testimony would be did not call them as witnesses to rebut Nancy Earl\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>One of the officers had been listed before trial as a prosecution witness, with the notation beside his name, \u201cprior contact and threat.\u201d This notation led defense counsel, rather than investigate, to move the trial judge, before trial, to exclude from the trial any statements made by Harold Earl that had not been furnished to the defense pursuant to its discovery request. The trial judge granted the motion. He again ruled at the opening of trial that the prosecutor was not to go into the matter of threats unless defense counsel \u201copen[ed] the door on threats on direct or cross.\u201d During the trial defense counsel asked Harold Earl whether he had ever intended to kill Denise Stacy, and he answered \u201cno.\u201d On cross-examination, over objection, the prosecutor asked Earl whether he had ever threatened Denise Stacy\u2019s life. Earl answered \u201cno.\u201d After the completion of the defense case, the prosecutor called Nancy Earl as a rebuttal witness, and she gave the testimony we quoted earlier. Defense counsel asked for a continuance to enable him to interview Nancy Earl and other witnesses \u2014 presumably the officers who had been present when Harold Earl had made the alleged statement. The trial judge said, \u201cYou can talk to her right now,\u201d and when defense counsel came back with, \u201cWhat about witnesses to the statement?,\u201d the trial judge said: \u201cI think beyond that, I don\u2019t see any surprise to the defense____\u201d Defense counsel took this to mean that he was precluded from talking to the officers, and he did not talk to them or call them as witnesses. The Wisconsin court of appeals found that the judge had not intended to prevent defense counsel from interviewing the witnesses; there had been \u201ca mix-up in communication, but we now understand why Johnson [Harold Earl\u2019s trial lawyer] did not talk to the officers. He believed the trial court had foreclosed him from speaking with\u201d them.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The representation to which a criminal defendant is constitutionally entitled requires his lawyer, before trial, to look for evidence that will be helpful to the defendant; but of course if it is reasonable in the circumstances not to conduct a particular investigation, the lawyer\u2019s failure to do so will not establish ineffective representation. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2066, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Earl's lawyer testified in the Wisconsin post-conviction proceeding that preceded this habeas corpus action that he had figured that if his motion to exclude evidence of death threats was denied, he would then have time to investigate them; and if it was granted, he would not have to investigate them. He cannot be criticized for <em>making </em>the motion. He testified (in the state post-conviction proceeding) that by making the motion in the form he did \u2014 a motion to exclude all statements of Earl that had not been furnished to the defense in response to its discovery request \u2014 he had hoped to induce the prosecutor to make a more extensive response to that request, so that it would be easier to prepare a defense. This was not a foolish or reckless tactic, especially when it succeeded beyond the lawyer\u2019s expectations: the judge\u2019s granting the motion seemed to eliminate the issue of threats from the case, and to make the notation about threats next to the name of one of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">Of course there was always a chance that developments at trial would result in reopening the issue. But it was not so unreasonable as to be unprofessional for defense counsel to assume that he heed not conduct an investigation into the factual background of an issue that he had succeeded in getting excluded from the trial \u2014 to assume that if it should unexpectedly pop up in the trial he would have an opportunity to investigate then. A more cautious and far-seeing lawyer would have gone ahead and interviewed the policemen \u2014 not a burdensome undertaking. But a lawyer\u2019s failure to carry out his duties to his client with extraordinary skill and conscientiousness does not convict the lawyer of subminimum representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">This conclusion pretty much dooms Earl\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. For nothing that happened at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>trial indicates that Earl\u2019s counsel was professionally inadequate. It is true that if he had not asked Earl whether Earl had ever intended to kill Denise Stacy, Nancy Earl\u2019s testimony would not have been admitted. But counsel had no reason to think that asking that question would reopen the ruling on the admissibility of Earl\u2019s (alleged) statements. When during the trial the prosecutor had tried to get the judge to change his mind about the admission of the statement to Nancy Earl, the judge had said, \u201cthe prosecution will not go into the matter of threats of any nature with the witness, Nancy Earl, both against Stacy and Nancy Earl.\u201d This must have seemed pretty definitive, and emboldened Earl\u2019s counsel to question Earl about his intent to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Even if counsel should have realized that the judge\u2019s earlier warning about \u201copening the door\u201d remained in force, the judge had only warned against opening the door \u201con threats.\u201d Defense counsel could reasonably have understood by this that he was safe as long as he did not ask Earl whether Earl had ever threatened Denise Stacy. Counsel cannot be severely criticized for not having realized that <em>any </em>inquiry into Earl\u2019s intent to kill would \u201copen the door,\u201d when that intent was a central issue in the case and was analytically distinct from the matter of threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Earl had stabbed a defenseless woman to death with repeated jabs of a kitchen knife, one of which was seven inches deep and penetrated the heart. His intent to kill was not negated by the lack of advance planning. \u201cNo appreciable space of time is required to elapse between the formation of the intent to kill and the act of killing in order for the homicide to be first-degree murder.\u201d <em>Brook v. State, </em>21 Wis.2d 32, 45, 123 N.W.2d 535, 541 (1963); <em>State v. Clifford, </em>58 Wis. 477, 489, 17 N.W. 304, 308 (1883); see Wis.Crim.Code \u00a7 940.-01; cf. <em>United States v. Solina, </em>733 F.2d 1208, 1214-15 (7th Cir.1984). The defense presented some, but not convincing, psychological evidence; one witness inferred that Earl had not intended to kill Stacy by noting that there were no stab wounds in her back, and another inferred lack of intent to kill from the fact that the IQ test he administered to Earl showed an IQ of only 55, which is moderately retarded. Yet the IQ test contained on the one hand difficult questions (such as the height of the average American woman), and on the other hand questions easy to answer in a way suggestive of retardation (e.g., how many months are there in a year?), plus questions that have to do with morality rather than intelligence (such as, what would you do if you found a stamped, addressed envelope in the street?). Earl\u2019s principal defense, therefore, feeble though it was, was self-defense; Denise Stacy had come at him with a knife, and he had wrested it from her and killed her with it. Earl does not argue that his counsel was unprofessional in putting on such a defense; and there was no way to make out the defense without Earl\u2019s being called as a witness. Even if his counsel had not asked him whether he had ever intended to kill Stacy, the prosecutor could still have argued that Earl\u2019s testimony of self-defense opened up the issue of threats, since if Earl had threatened Stacy's life, this would make his defense of self-defense less believable.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Defense counsel objected vigorously when the prosecutor on cross-examination asked Earl about threats, and later when the prosecutor put on Nancy Earl as a rebuttal witness; counsel tried to interview witnesses to the statement; and though he misunderstood the judge as forbidding him to do so, the misunderstanding was a reasonable one. A more alert and determined lawyer might have pressed the point harder and a more daring lawyer might have taken a chance and called the officers as witnesses without first interviewing them (though it is not altogether clear that the trial judge would have allowed this); but it is not unreasonable for a lawyer to obey what he thinks is the judge's ruling, even though the ruling might not be 100 percent clear. Lawyers naturally hesitate to antagonize judges by pressing points after the judge appears to have ruled on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Considered all in all, the representation of Harold Earl did not fall below minimum professional standards; indeed, but for the judge\u2019s somewhat erratic conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>of the trial \u2014 of which however, Earl does not complain \u2014 the representation would have been flawless. In any event, we do not think that Earl was prejudiced; and prejudice is an independent requirement for finding that a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel has been violated. <em>Strickland v. Washington, supra, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2064. If the officers had testified, they would not have testified that Earl had made no threats; they would have testified, rather, that it was Nancy Earl\u2019s life, rather than Denise Stacy\u2019s, that Earl had threatened; and in the circumstance this would not have made a critical difference. Earl went to his wife\u2019s house. She wasn\u2019t there. Denise Stacy was. She was his wife\u2019s friend. He stabbed her repeatedly and ferociously. Bear in mind that the fact that he decided on the spot to kill her would not affect his guilt of first-degree murder, that his psychiatric evidence was weak, and that his only defense was self-defense. That defense, in part because it was uncorroborated and implausible, would not have been bolstered by Earl\u2019s proving that he had not threatened Denise Stacy \u2014 but had threatened his wife. It is true that after retiring to deliberate the jury asked the judge to repeat the instructions on first- and second-degree murder, but we do not think the jury\u2019s verdict would have been different \u2014 provided they followed the judge\u2019s instructions \u2014 if Nancy Earl had not been permitted to testify, or if Harold Earl had been permitted to rebut her testimony with testimony by the two officers. The evidence of Earl\u2019s guilt of first-degree murder was overwhelming. In Wisconsin second-degree murder (so far as relevant here) is causing the death of a human being \u201cby conduct imminently dangerous to another and evincing a depraved mind, regardless of human life.\u201d Wis.Crim.Code \u00a7 940.-02(1). It is illustrated by <em>State v. Bernal, </em>330 N.W.2d 219, 220-22 (Wis.App.1983), where the defendant shot at the victim\u2019s legs, but killed him. Harold Earl\u2019s killing of Denise Stacy was deliberate.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b199-7\">CUDAHY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A1\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">I do not agree that the failure of the police officers to testify was not prejudicial. The testimony seems to me to have been crucial in removing reasonable doubt about the defendant\u2019s intent in conducting his altercation with Denise Stacy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I am persuaded, however, that this failure to testify did not result from unconstitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel but rather from a series of misadventures relating in part, as the majority puts it, to \u201cthe judge\u2019s somewhat erratic conduct of the trial.\u201d I therefore concur in much of the analysis provided by the majority as well as in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-18\">. The majority suggests that the evidence against Earl was overwhelming. Not so. No witnesses were present when the scuffle between Earl and Stacy occurred. Further, Dr. Harold Wagner, an experienced forensic pathologist, testified that, based upon his review of the circumstances surrounding Stacy\u2019s death as well as the nature of the wounds inflicted, Earl\u2019s act was \u201cnot intended.\" Dr. McDonald, a clinical psychologist, administered a series of tests to Earl, including the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, from which he determined that Earl\u2019s \u201cfull scale IQ\u201d was fifty-five, which classified him as severely retarded and in the range of border and severe mental deficiency. Dr. McDonald concluded that it was probable that Earl\u2019s act was unplanned and committed on impulse.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
