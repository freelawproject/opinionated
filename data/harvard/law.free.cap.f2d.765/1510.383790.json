HILL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1614-26\">Plaintiff/appellant Clyde Davis commenced this action under the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 <em>et seq., </em>alleging that he was expelled from his union in retaliation for exercising his statutory right of free speech protected under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a)(2). The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1511\">*1511</page-number>granted summary judgment in favor of defendants/appellees on the ground that Davis failed to exhaust his internal union procedures before seeking judicial intervention. We do not reach the issue of exhaustion, determining instead that this suit is barred by the six-month statute of limitations borrowed from section 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-5\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-6\">From 1960 through 1976, Davis was an employee of Ford Motor Company and a member of the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), Local 970. During those years he held a variety of local union offices, including president and vice-president.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-7\">On March 16, 1976, Davis was charged with several violations of the UAW Constitution, based on alleged threats and intimidation of union members and threats to destroy the local union.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In April, 1976, a trial was held before a union trial board in Jacksonville. Davis was served with timely notice of this trial, but chose not to attend the trial or offer any defense, allegedly because of his apprehension that there might be physical altercations between himself and others. On September 14, 1976, Davis was informed that he had been found guilty of the violations as charged, and that he had been expelled from the local and international unions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1615-11\">Rather than availing himself of available internal UAW appeals processes, <em>see generally Monroe v. International Union, UAW, </em>723 F.2d 22, 24 (6th Cir.1983) (description of UAW appeal procedures); UAW Constitution, art. 33 (1977), Davis filed suit against the local and international unions. In June, 1977, he filed a complaint in Florida state court seeking damages for mental anguish, resulting from his alleged wrongful expulsion from the unions. This suit was removed to federal court, remanded to state court, and removed back to federal court, for good, in August, 1978. Meanwhile, in June, 1978, appellant filed a complaint in federal court alleging wrongful expulsion from the unions contrary to federal law and the unions\u2019 rules, and seeking damages for loss of wages and physical and mental suffering. In June 1981, the two cases were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1615-12\">In June, 1981, and again in July, 1982, appellant moved to file an amended complaint. In October, 1983, although the court had not yet ruled on the motions, appellant filed an amended complaint which added allegations that appellant\u2019s expulsion was motivated by plaintiffs criticism of union officers, in violation of his right to free speech under section 101(a)(2) of the LMRDA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a)(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant also added allegations that the UAW\u2019s internal appeals procedures were unreasonable and that it would be futile for him to exhaust them, and that exhaustion was not necessary because free speech violations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1512\">*1512</page-number>were involved. In April, 1984, appellant\u2019s motions to amend were denied and the amended complaint was stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-4\">In July, 1984, the district court granted the appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the ground that appellant did not exhaust available internal UAW appeals procedures before seeking judicial intervention.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although the court had stricken Davis\u2019 amended complaint, its order granting summary judgment addressed the allegations in the amended complaint. The court found that the UAW\u2019s intricate appellate grievance procedures were reasonable and adequately safeguarded a union member\u2019s interests; and that Davis, as a sixteen-year member who had held several local union offices, could not complain about lack of knowledge of the grievance procedures. It found further that appellant\u2019s alleged free speech claims involved \u201cthreats and intimidation ... against other union members as well as alleged disparaging statements against the organization;\u201d that these areas touched on the union\u2019s internal affairs; and thus that the conduct was not protected free speech either in the traditional sense or within the scope of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-6\">Appellant contends that the district court abused its discretion in granting summary judgment for failure to exhaust. He argues that exhaustion is not required when a free speech violation under the LMRDA is involved; that his allegations involve issues in the \u201cpublic domain\u201d which internal union procedures are inadequate to deal with; and that exhaustion should not be required because the UAW\u2019s internal remedies are unreasonable, inadequate, and unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b1616-11\">We do not address the merits of appellant\u2019s arguments on exhaustion, but instead affirm the grant of summary judgment on the basis that appellant\u2019s cause of action, filed at least eleven months after he was informed of his expulsion from the unions, is barred by the six-month statute of limitations borrowed from \u00a7 10(b) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1616-12\">Since the LMRDA does not provide an express limitations period for suits brought pursuant to it, a federal court must \u201cborrow\u201d the most appropriate limitations period from some other source. <em>Del-Costello v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, </em>462 U.S. 151, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 2287, 76 L.Ed.2d 476 (1983). Generally, this involves applying the statute of limitations of the most closely analogous state action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1616-13\">In <em>DelCostello, </em>however, the Supreme Court applied the six-month limitations period from \u00a7 10(b) of the NLRA<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to a \u201chy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1513\">*1513</page-number>brid\u201d section 301 <footnotemark>7</footnotemark>/fair representation suit brought by an employee against his employer and his union.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Court first noted that it was improper to apply mechanically a state statute of limitations to a federal statutory cause of action when such an application would frustrate federal policies, and then emphasized the important federal interests in promoting the formation of collective bargaining agreements and the speedy, private settlement of disputes under them. <em>Id. </em>at 2289. The Court felt that a hybrid section 301/fair representation claim amounted to a \u201cdirect challenge\u201d to the private settlement of disputes under a collective bargaining agreement; and that such a claim had no close analogy in ordinary state law. <em>Id. </em>at 2291. Therefore, the Court determined that the NLRA unfair labor practices statute, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160, was the closest analogy to the \u00a7 301/fair representation claim \u2014 because of the similarity in the rights asserted in fair representation claims and unfair labor practice charges (both involving allegations of unfair, arbitrary, or discriminatory treatment of workers by unions), and the similarity of considerations relevant to the choice of a limitations period in the two contexts. <em>Id. </em>at 2293-94.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1617-4\">In \u00a7 10(b) of the NLRA, Congress established a limitations period attuned to what it viewed as the proper balance between the national interests in stable bargaining relationships and finality of private settlements, and an employee\u2019s interest in setting aside what he views as an unjust settlement under the collective-bargaining system. That is precisely the balance at issue in this case. The employee\u2019s interest in setting aside the \u2018final and binding\u2019 determination of a griev-anee through the method established by the collective-bargaining agreement unquestionably implicates \u2018those consensual processes that federal labor law is chiefly designed to promote \u2014 the formation of the ... agreement and the private settlement of disputes under it.\u2019 <em>[International Union, United Auto., Aerospace and Agr. Implement Workers of America UAW v.] Hoosier </em>[Cardinal Corp.], 383 U.S. [, 696] at 702, 86 S.Ct. [, 1107] at 1111 [, 16 L.Ed.2d 192 (1966) ]. Accordingly, \u2018[t]he need for uniformity\u2019 among procedures followed for similar claims, <em>ibid., </em>as well as the clear congressional indication of the proper balance between the interests at stake, counsels the adoption of \u00a7 10(b) of the NLRA as the appropriate limitations period for lawsuits such as this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1617-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 2294 <em>(quoting United Parcel Service, Inc. v. Mitchell, </em>451 U.S. 56, 70-71, 101 S.Ct. 1559, 1567-1568, 67 L.Ed.2d 732 (Stewart, J., concurring)). Thus, the Court applied the six-month limitations period from 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(b), although it cautioned that its holding should not be taken as a departure from the usual practice of borrowing state limitations periods for federal causes of action, \u201cin labor law or elsewhere.\u201d <em>Id., </em>103 S.Ct. at 2294.</p>\n<p id=\"b1617-8\">Since <em>DelCostello, </em>three Circuit Courts of Appeals have relied on the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>DelCostello </em>to apply the same six-month limitations period to suits brought under section 102 of the LMRDA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 412. <em>Vallone v. Local Union No. 705, </em>755 F.2d 520, 521-22 (7th Cir.1984) (suit alleging violations of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411, including right to free speech); <em>Local Union 1397 v. United Steelworkers of America, </em>748 F.2d 180 (3d Cir.1984) (alleging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1514\">*1514</page-number>violations of \u00a7 411, including right to free expression); <em>Linder v. Berge, </em>739 F.2d 686, 690 (1st Cir.1984) (alleging violations of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 414, for failure to provide with copy of collective bargaining agreement).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We feel constrained by the rationale of <em>DelCostello </em>and the holdings of our sister circuits to reach the same conclusion in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-4\">The gist of appellant\u2019s complaint is that he was unlawfully expelled from the UAW in retaliation for exercising his rights of free speech, guaranteed by section 101(a)(2) of the LMRDA, in criticizing union officials and union management policies. As in <em>Del-Costello, </em>there are no closely analogous actions under the state law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In addition, there is a \u201cfamily resemblance\u201d between rights asserted under the LMRDA and unfair labor practice charges under the NLRA, in that both seek to \u201cprotect[ ] ... individual workers from arbitrary actions by unions, which have been appointed the exclusive representatives of such individuals in the workplace.\u201d <em>Local Union 1397, </em>748 F.2d at 183; <em>see DelCostello, </em>103 S.Ct. at 2293.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-5\">However, we note an important distinction between the present action and a hybrid \u00a7 301/fair representation claim as was alleged in <em>DelCostello. DelCostello </em>employed a balancing analysis \u2014 the Supreme Court applied section 10(b)\u2019s six-month limitations period only after concluding that such a period struck a proper balance between the national interests in stable bargaining relationships and finality of private settlements thereunder, and the employee\u2019s interest in setting aside an unjust settlement under the collective bargaining system. 103 S.Ct. at 2294. The present action, alleging a violation of statutorily-protected free speech, involves a different balance of interests. First, an action alleging a violation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411 is brought only against the union; the employer is not involved. Therefore, the national interests in stable labor-management bargaining relationships and the speedy, final resolution of disputes under a collective bargaining agreement are not implicated.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, the need for national uniformity in the application of limitation periods to such an action is not as great. <em>See DelCostello, </em>103 S.Ct. at 2289; <em>Auto Workers v. Hoosier Corp., </em>383 U.S. 696, 702, 86 S.Ct. 1107, 1111, 16 L.Ed.2d 192 (1966). Furthermore, a union member\u2019s interest in protection against the infringement of his rights of free speech rises to a national interest, as embodied in section 101(a)(2) of the LMRDA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a)(2), and thus seems of greater importance than an employee\u2019s interest in setting aside an individual settlement under a collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1618-10\">Nevertheless, we feel constrained by the analysis employed in <em>DelCostello </em>to apply the same limitations period to the present lawsuit. In <em>DelCostello, </em>the Supreme Court found a strong connection between the national interest in labor peace and the necessity of a short time period in which to bring an action based on a labor union\u2019s duty of fair representation to its members. We believe we are bound to find a similar connection between labor peace and an action based on a union\u2019s alleged mistreatment of its members by the denial of statutorily protected rights.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1515\">*1515</page-number>cordingly hold that the six-month limitations period of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(b) applies to LMRDA actions brought under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 412 alleging union violations of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1619-5\">Appellant contends that this limitation period should not be applied retroactively to his claim, citing <em>Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, </em>404 U.S. 97, 105-109, 92 S.Ct. 349, 354-357, 30 L.Ed.2d 296 (1971). We cannot agree. We are bound by our holding in <em>Rogers v. Lockheed-Georgia Co., </em>720 F.2d 1247 (11th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 292, 83 L.Ed.2d 227 (1984), to apply the six-month limitations period retroactively.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1619-8\">Appellant was notified of his expulsion from the Local and International UAW on September 14, 1976. He did not file suit until June, 1977. Therefore, summary judgment in favor of the defendants/appel-lees is AFFIRMED because the appellant\u2019s claims are barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-15\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-16\">In accordance with Article 17 Section 10 and Article 31 Section 1 &amp; 2 of the Constitution of the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, Charges have been made against Clyde L. Davis, member of Local 970 UAW.</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-17\">In accordance with Article 31 Section 3, the Local Union Executive Board of Local 970 UAW reviewed the charges listed below on March 11, 1976 and did not find them to be improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1516\">*1516</page-number>1. \u201cThere are two or three people I intend to get rid of to make this a better warehouse.\u201d (A threat)</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-5\">2.

Undermining Union officers in an attempt to create dissension between the Local Union President and Building Chairman. Davis\u2019s use of twisting the appropriate related acts to show that F. Shaffer was responsible for the Companies discriminatory practice of making up lost time. Davis stated to the Chairman the reason we had to stop letting people make up time was because of F. Shaffer. This was found to be untrue and it was Davis himself that stopped this procedure. (Refer to grievance A-70357)</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-12\">The above allegations can be substantiated in part or in whole by the following members: Tommy L. Crego, Larry E. Carpenter, Frank Y. Shaffer, Frank G. Atkinson, R.H. Adams, Hayward Mathis, and D.D. Beecher.</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-13\">C.L. Davis has made the statement that he would destroy this Local Union. He made his intentions very clear at the last Union meeting he attended. By the use of false accusations to the membership that we were in imminent danger of getting an Administrator due to poor leadership by the present Union Officers. He made false accusations that the Financial Secretary was not legitimately working on the books when paid by the Union to do so. This was found to be untrue since Davis had no proof to substantiate his charge. A charge of this nature by Davis without substantial evidence can only be considered a slanderous accusation in an attempt to create dissension in the Local Union and weaken the internal structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1620-15\">The above allegations can be substantiated by Tommy L. Crego.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1615-8\">. A copy of the notice of charges filed against Davis is attached as an appendix to this case. The majority of these charges appear to be allegations that Davis was vocal in his criticism of union officials and union management.

This reinforces our conclusion that we are bound to apply the same limitations period to the present cause of action filed solely against the union.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1619-10\">. We do note a potential problem with applying the six-month limitations period to a suit alleging a violation of \u00a7 101 of the LMRDA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411. A cause of action under section 411 accrues when the plaintiff union member discovers, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the act constituting the alleged violations; at which time the statute of limitations begins to run. <em>See Erkins </em>v. <em>United Steelworkers of America, </em>723 F.2d 837, 839 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 3517, 82 L.Ed.2d 825 (1984); <em>Vallone, </em>755 F.2d at 522. However, section 411(a)(4) provides that a union member may be required to exhaust reasonable internal union procedures for up to four months before proceeding with a suit under section 412. <em>See supra </em>note 4. Thus, union members might be forced into a \"Catch-22\u201d situation in which they could be barred from suing the union if they wait to sue for more than six months while exhausting union remedies, but could be dismissed from federal court for failure to exhaust internal remedies if they file suit within the limitations period without seeking to exhaust. <em>Cf. Vallone, </em>755 F.2d at 522 (plaintiff argues that federal claim under \u00a7 411 does not accrue until final disposition of grievances filed with unions).</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-13\">Two possible solutions come to mind. First, the limitations period might be tolled during the time a union member is exhausting his union remedies. <em>Cf. Gentilviso v. New York Public Library, </em>589 F.Supp. 587, 592 (S.D.N.Y.1984) (general federal rule on tolling of limitations period). Second, a court could require the filing of the lawsuit within six months, but stay the judicial proceedings pending completion of exhaustion of union remedies. <em>Cf. Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>421 U.S. 454, 465, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 1722, 44 L.Ed.2d 295 (1975) (suggesting that plaintiff might ask court to stay proceedings until administrative efforts completed); <em>Vallone, </em>755 F.2d at 522 (plaintiffs need not await final outcome of grievance before filing suit against union).</p>\n<p id=\"b1619-19\">We need not resolve this potential problem in the present case, since appellant filed his first suit approximately eleven months after his cause of action accrued (when he was notified of his expulsion from the union), without ever seeking to exhaust union remedies in the intervening time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1619-20\">. The present case appears closely analogous to the situation in the <em>Chevron Oil </em>case, where the Supreme Court held that, in an action commenced and prosecuted in reasonable belief (based on federal court decisions) that a short one-year statute of limitations did not apply, a United States Supreme Court decision requiring the contrary conclusion, announced while pretrial discovery proceedings were pending, would not be applied retroactively to bar the action. 404 U.S. at 105-09, 92 S.Ct. at 354-357. However, we are bound by our precedent in <em>Rogers, </em>which conclusively determined that the six-month limitations period borrowed from 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(b) should be applied retroactively in order to further the federal labor policies inherent in the rule and to prevent the inequitable results of different state limitations periods being applied to essentially similar federal causes of action. 720 F.2d at 1250.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
