J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In these consolidated cases, petitioners seek review of the Attorney General's certified ballot title for Initiative Petition (IP) 43 (2018), contending that various aspects do not comply with requirements set out in ORS 250.035(2). We review the certified ballot title to determine whether it substantially complies with those requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORS 250.085(5) (setting out that standard). For the reasons explained below, we refer the ballot title to the Attorney General for modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   IP 43, a copy of which is attached as an Appendix, proposes a statutory enactment that, with exceptions including a limited registration scheme, would prohibit the unlawful possession or transfer of an \"assault weapon\" or a \"large capacity magazine,\" as those terms are defined in the proposed measure. The measure defines \"[a]ssault weapon\" to include the following firearms, unless made permanently inoperable: (1) a semiautomatic rifle or pistol with the capacity to accept a detachable magazine, coupled with at least one additional listed feature;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) a semiautomatic\n   pistol, or a semiautomatic, centerfire, or rimfire rifle with a fixed magazine, with the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds of ammunition; (3) a semiautomatic, centerfire rifle with an overall length of less than 30 inches; (4) a semiautomatic shotgun with a variety of identifiable features; and (5) a shotgun with a revolving cylinder. IP 43, \u00a7 3(1). That definition also includes a conversion kit from which an assault weapon can be assembled if parts are in the possession or under the control of the same person. IP 43, \u00a7 3(1)(a)(F). \"Large capacity magazine\" is defined as \"any ammunition feeding device with the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds or any conversion kit or combination of parts from which such a device can be assembled,\" with exceptions that include a particular type of tubular magazine, a particular\n   type of feeding device, or a feeding device that has been permanently altered so as not to accommodate more than 10 rounds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 3(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After defining the weapons and magazines within its scope, IP 43 creates a new crime, \"unlawful possession or transfer of an assault weapon or large capacity magazine,\" for any person who \"manufactures, imports, possesses, purchases, sells or transfers any assault weapon or large capacity magazine,\" with exceptions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 4(1). Exceptions include possession or transfer involving government officers, agents, and employees; members of the United States Armed Forces; or peace officers (all while acting within the scope of duty),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 4(2)(a), as well as the related manufacture, sale, or transfer concerning the Armed Forces or state law enforcement,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 4(2)(b)-(c). The final exceptions include compliance with the provisions described next, which apply only to persons who own covered items prior to IP 43 becoming effective (January 1, 2019), or who inherit covered items after that date.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7\u00a7 4(1), 8. The new crime is a Class B felony.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 4(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For any person who already legally possesses an assault weapon or a large capacity magazine prior to the effective date, IP 43 requires that person to take one of the following actions within 120 days after that date: sell the weapon or magazine to a licensed dealer; surrender it to law enforcement for destruction; remove it from the state; render it permanently inoperable (weapons only, not magazines); or, if eligible, register it with the Oregon State Police (OSP), as explained below.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 4(3). Any person who inherits an assault weapon or a large capacity magazine after the effective date must take one of the same actions, within 120 days after acquiring title, except that removal from the state is not an available option.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 4(4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Although registration is permitted in the circumstances just described, an owner who registers a covered item may not purchase any additional assault weapon or large capacity magazine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 5(6). IP 43 thus would operate to impose a partial ban on the future acquisition of covered weapons or magazines in Oregon by nonexempt military, government, or peace officer users: Other than inherited items, only covered items owned prior to the effective date and then properly registered within 120 days would be permitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The registration process imposes additional conditions on the narrow categories of owners who are permitted to seek registration-that is, those who own an assault weapon or a large capacity magazine prior to the effective date of IP 43, and those who inherit covered items thereafter. First, the owner must submit a form application to OSP containing certain information, and the owner must allow OSP to conduct a criminal background check to ensure that he or she is not a \"prohibited possessor\" under ORS 166.250.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 5(2)-(3). Second, the owner must submit satisfactory evidence to OSP that he or she (1) has securely stored the weapon or magazine pursuant to existing law and any rules or regulations that OSP may adopt; and (2) will possess it only on his or her own property, on another's property with express permission, or on other permitted properties for certain purposes (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , on the premises of a licensed dealer or gunsmith for lawful repair purposes; at a public or private shooting range or gallery; at firearms competitions, exhibitions, or displays with additional restrictions; or while transporting to an authorized location).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 5(4). Once a weapon or magazine is registered, the owner may not sell or transfer it, except to a licensed dealer or gunsmith for certain purposes; and, as noted, the owner may not purchase any additional assault weapon or large capacity magazine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 5(5)-(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   IP 43 includes a number of provisions that facilitate OSP's involvement with the new requirements, including retaining a registry of information obtained through the registration process; OSP also must adopt rules to administer that registry (including renewal and revocation procedures, and storage for weapons and magazines).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 6(4). IP 43 further provides that the record of information collected for registration purposes is exempt from disclosure under the Public Records Law,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 6(5), and it expressly declares its provisions severable,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Attorney General prepared a draft ballot title for IP 43, ORS 250.065(3), and the Secretary of State circulated that ballot title for public comment, ORS 250.067(1). After receiving more than 1,000 comments, the Attorney General modified her draft ballot title, ORS 250.067(2)(a), and certified the following ballot title to the Secretary of State:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \"\n   <strong>\n    Prohibits 'assault weapons' (defined), 'large capacity magazines' (defined), unless registered with state police.

ANALYSIS\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Caption\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    We begin with the caption, which must, in 15 or fewer words, \"reasonably identif[y] the subject matter\" of the proposed measure. ORS 250.035(2)(a). Petitioners raise several challenges to the caption, and we agree that the caption must be modified in certain respects, as explained below.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    First, petitioners challenge the wording that refers to the registration requirements described in IP 43, sections 4(3)(e) and 4(4)(d)-that is, that the proposed measure would prohibit assault weapons and large capacity magazines \"unless registered with state police.\" They argue that that quoted phrase is misleading because it implies that the registration exception would apply to future acquisitions, but, under IP 43, only inherited items are subject to such an exception after the effective date.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    As an initial matter, we agree with the parties that the \"subject matter\" of IP 43, which the caption must identify, includes both the prohibition on assault weapons and large capacity magazines, and the accompanying registration exception.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Parrish v. Rosenblum\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=362%20Or.%2096\">\n     362 Or. 96\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 102,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=403%20P.3d%20786\">\n     403 P.3d 786\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2017) (\"subject matter\" refers to the \"actual major effect\" of a proposed measure or, \"if the measure has more than one major effect, all such effects within [the] applicable word limit\" (internal quotation marks omitted) );\n    <em>\n     Rasmussen v. Kroger\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674392\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/350/281/#p285\">\n     350 Or. 281\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 285,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674392\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/350/281/#p285\">\n     253 P.3d 1031\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2011) (to identify the actual major effect, the Attorney General must consider the \"changes that the proposed measure would enact in the context of existing law\"). The central major effect of IP 43 is the criminal prohibition on the possession or transfer of the covered weapons and magazines. IP 43, \u00a7 4(1).\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    The registration exception is another effect that flows from that prohibition, as do many other of the measure's effects. Unlike other effects, however, the registration exception is subject to extensive additional requirements. IP 43, \u00a7 5. And the registration exception is the only means by which a current owner of a covered, operable weapon or magazine may retain ownership, with continuing possession in Oregon, after the effective date. Given those considerations, the registration\n    exception is a major effect that is appropriately mentioned in the caption.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Swanson v. Rosenblum\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=362%20Or.%20143\">\n     362 Or. 143\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 146-47,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=404%20P.3d%20949\">\n     404 P.3d 949\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2017) (concluding that, to accurately convey the scope of a term limits measure, the caption must mention both the new limits and how they would be calculated; distinguishing that scenario from a ballot title that appropriately mentions the details of a complex measure in the result statements or the summary, instead of in the caption).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    We agree with petitioners, however, that the caption inaccurately describes the registration exception. By stating that assault weapons and large capacity magazines\n    are prohibited \"unless registered with state police,\" the caption implies that the exception generally permits registered ownership after IP 43 goes into effect. But, unless a covered weapon or magazine is inherited later, the exception applies only at the outset-that is, to any person who possesses a prohibited weapon or magazine prior to the proposed measure becoming effective (who then has 120 days to either register the weapon or magazine, or take a different required, alternative step). IP 43, \u00a7 4(3). (For inherited items, the registration exception applies for 120 days after the owner acquires title,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=404%20P.3d%20949\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at \u00a7 4(4)(d).) No other person is permitted to register a covered item, at any time. The caption must be modified accordingly.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Petitioners raise another challenge to the caption that merits discussion. They argue that the terms \"assault weapons\" and \"large capacity magazines\" do not reasonably identify the subject matter of IP 43, and, instead, are impermissibly deceptive, confusing, and underinclusive. They assert that voters would share no common understanding of either term, except perhaps in reference to military-style weapons and their magazines (\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , automatic weapons, such as machine guns; or military-style semiautomatic weapons, such as AR-15s or AK-47s). In petitioners' view, however, IP 43 would prohibit possession of a \"wide array of commonly owned\" semiautomatic weapons and their magazines. For example, one definition of \"assault weapon\" in IP 43 is a semiautomatic rifle with the capacity to accept a detachable magazine and having at least one of several other identified features, IP 43, \u00a7 3(1)(a)(A), but petitioners contend that many of the listed features-as well as detached magazine\n    capacity-are standard.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    They offer many additional examples, citing various IP 43 definitions involving rifles, shotguns, and pistols, to contend that the proposed measure is exceptionally broad in scope.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    The same is true, petitioners add, of magazines falling within the definition of \"large capacity magazine\"-that is, \"any ammunition feeding device with the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds\" or a conversion kit, with exceptions. IP 43, \u00a7 3(6). They emphasize that, (1) contrary to its own definition in IP 43, \"large\" suggests a number far exceeding 10; (2) most modern semiautomatic pistols are equipped with standard-issue magazines capable of holding 14-18 rounds; and (3) magazines holding more than 10 rounds also are standard for most handguns and rifles. It follows, they conclude, that \"virtually all,\" \"almost all,\" or \"most\" semiautomatic rifles, shotguns, and pistols, and their magazines, would be subject to IP 43, but voters likely would not recognize that many \"commonly used\" items would be so \"[en]snared.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    The Attorney General acknowledges the lack of a shared understanding of the terms \"assault weapons\" and \"large capacity magazines,\" but she contends that it is impossible to craft more accurate definitions-without omission or oversimplification-in the 15 words allotted for the caption.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    In the Attorney General's view, the use of quotation\n    marks surrounding those terms, coupled with the elaborating signals, \"(defined),\" sufficiently conveys that the measure itself defines the terms \"assault weapon\" and \"large capacity magazine.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Chamberlain v.

We cannot say whether that\n    is so, but we do agree (as does the Attorney General) that different voters reasonably could draw different meanings from the term \"assault weapons\"-some might think that it refers to only military-style weapons; some might think that it refers to the types of weapons that are described in IP 43; and some might think that it refers to an even more broad group of weapons.

They argue that the summary carries forward the same problematic content from the caption and vote result statements, and that other important aspects of IP 43 are either omitted or are described using only vague descriptions without any context. We agree with several of petitioners' arguments, as discussed below.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    First, as with our earlier evaluation of the caption and \"yes\" result statement, the summary inaccurately conveys that the registration exception in IP 43 is a general exception that would continue after the effective date of the proposed measure, when it in fact is limited to only existing weapons and magazines owned when the measure goes into effect, unless inherited at a later date. Inaccurate wording appears in two parts of the summary: (1) at the outset, in the phrase, \"unless registered with State Police after background check\"; and, (2) near the end, in the phrase, \"[c]overed items not registered must be sold/surrendered/ destroyed.\" We do not think that the later statement in the summary, \"[a]cquisition mostly prohibited after effective date,\" corrects the preceding inaccuracies-a voter easily could understand the three quoted parts of the summary, read\n    together, to mean that a later-acquired weapon or magazine would be permitted, if registered. In operation, however, ownership would be limited to existing covered items, once registered after the effective date (except for those acquired by inheritance or pursuant to other user exceptions). The summary must be modified to accurately describe the registration exception.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Second and relatedly, to substantially comply with ORS 250.035(2)(d), the summary must state that a current owner must take one of the required, alternative actions within 120 days of the effective date of IP 43 (that is, either register a covered assault weapon or a large capacity magazine, or sell, surrender, or destroy it). IP 43, \u00a7\u00a7 4(3), 4(4).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     McCann/Harmon v.

IP 43, \u00a7 4(6). The Attorney General responds that the summary's reference to \"[c]riminal penalties\" is sufficient. We agree with petitioners that the creation of a new felony-which carries far more significant penalties than a misdemeanor-must be mentioned in the summary.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    ORS 161.605(2) (maximum term of indeterminate sentence for Class B felony is 10 years); ORS 161.625(1)(c) (maximum fine for Class B felony is $250,000);\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    ORS 161.615 (maximum sentences for misdemeanors range between 30 and 364 days); ORS 161.635(1) (maximum fines for misdemeanors range between $1,250 and $6,250). The summary must be modified in that respect.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Fourth, petitioners challenge the statement in the summary that IP 43 \"\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    limit uses of covered items.\" (Emphasis added.) They argue that the registration conditions set out in section 5(4)(b) amount, in effect, to a ban on the use of registered assault weapons and large capacity magazines on public lands, even for the purpose of hunting, target-shooting, or self-defense. The Attorney General responds that the summary accurately conveys the proposed measure's restrictions on use; in her view, \"the measure specifies locations where registered firearms may be taken or held, which may limit the lawful uses of those firearms.\" For the reason set out below, we agree with petitioners that the summary does not accurately state that IP 43 would impose limits on the use of registered items.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    As explained earlier, IP 43 provides as follows. First, in section 4(1), the proposed measure creates the new crime of unlawful possession or transfer of an assault weapon or large capacity magazine, \"except as provided\" in subsections (2), (3), and (4) of section 4. Then, in subsections (3)(e) and (4)(d) of section 4, the measure provides that any person who owns a covered weapon or magazine prior to the effective date may seek to register it within 120 days, and any person who inherits such an item may seek to register it within\n    120 days after acquiring title. Both those subsections cross-reference section 5, which in turn sets out extensive requirements for registration. Most notably for our purposes here, a person seeking to register a weapon or magazine must submit satisfactory evidence that he or she possesses the item only in certain locations, or in certain circumstances, or both (\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , on his or her own property, or on another's property with the owner's express permission; on the premises of a licensed dealer or gunsmith for lawful repair purposes; at a public or private shooting range or gallery; at firearms competitions, exhibitions, or displays with additional restrictions; or while transporting to an authorized location). IP 43, \u00a7 5(4)(b). Stated another way, after the effective date, registration is the only means by which certain owners may legally possess a covered weapon or magazine, and, as a condition to registration, the measure imposes location and use restrictions on qualifying owners.\n    Returning to the summary, we conclude that the statement that IP 43 \"may limit uses of covered items\" is inaccurate. That statement conveys that the proposed measure may-or may not-limit the use of registered assault weapons or magazines. As explained, however, section 5 imposes several such restrictions as a condition to registration, which in turn is the only means of lawfully possessing a covered item after the effective date. The summary must be modified to state that the measure\n    <em>\n     would\n    </em>\n    limit the use of covered items.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Conroy v.

The initial operative section of the measure, section 4(1), creates a new crime (unlawful possession or transfer of an assault weapon or large capacity magazine); then, one of several exceptions is the registration of existing or inherited covered items. The regulatory aspects of IP 43, on which Chief Petitioners rely in arguing about the subject matter, are part of that registration exception.
