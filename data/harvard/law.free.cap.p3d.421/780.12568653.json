The State charged Tipton with sexual intercourse without consent of a minor under 16 years old. Tipton sought dismissal of the charges because the applicable statute of limitations had expired. The Thirteenth Judicial District Court denied Tipton's motion to dismiss. It determined that \u00a7 45-1-205(9), MCA, passed after the statute of limitations for the charged crime had expired, revived the otherwise time-barred prosecution. Tipton petitions this Court for a writ of supervisory control. We grant the petition and reverse the District Court's order. We restate the issues as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    (1) Whether \u00a7 45-1-205(9), MCA, applies retroactively;\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    (2) Whether applying \u00a7 45-1-205(9), MCA, to Tipton violates the\n   </em>\n   ex post facto\n   <em>\n    provisions of the Montana or United States Constitutions.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 During the early morning hours of March 20, 1987, eight-year-old L.T. was asleep in her home in Billings when an unknown male woke her. He gagged her with a cloth belt and threatened to kill her if she did not keep quiet. The stranger proceeded to rape L.T. orally, vaginally, and anally. The man then covered L.T.'s head with a pillow and fled from the home. After the man left, L.T. woke her parents and told them what had happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 The Billings Police Department responded immediately and the investigation moved quickly. Eight months later, a jury convicted Jimmy Ray Bromgard of the crime, based on substantial evidence, including L.T.'s description and identification of Bromgard as her attacker, testimony that Bromgard had not returned home that night until the early morning hours, and the recovery of the victim's parents' stolen checkbook near Bromgard's home.\n   <em>\n    State v. Bromgard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4597317\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/261/291/\">\n    261 Mont. 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4597317\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/261/291/\">\n    862 P.2d 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993). Bromgard was sentenced to forty years in prison. The case was considered closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 At the time of the crime, investigators recovered a pair of L.T.'s\n   underwear stained with bodily fluids from her attacker. The evidence did not undergo DNA testing at that time, but was preserved. In 1994, this Court upheld the use of DNA evidence for the first time in a criminal trial in Montana, seven years after the crime at issue here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4560155\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/268/20/#p31\">\n    268 Mont. 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4560155\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/268/20/#p31\">\n    885 P.2d 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 464 (1994). In 2002, upon the request of Bromgard, the biological material from the underwear underwent DNA testing. The DNA test proved conclusively that Bromgard had not committed the crime. Bromgard was released after additional court proceedings, and the Billings Police Department reopened the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Shortly after Bromgard's release, the DNA profile recovered from L.T.'s underwear was uploaded into the Combined DNA Index System known as CODIS. CODIS is a set of databases that allows law enforcement agencies to compare DNA profiles of forensic samples from unsolved cases with the DNA profiles of known offenders to generate investigative leads. The 1995 Legislature passed legislation requiring the Department of Justice to establish a central repository for DNA records for the State of Montana-what is now CODIS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1995 Mont. Laws ch. 251, \u00a7 2; Section 44-6-102, MCA. The Montana State Crime Lab uploaded its first DNA samples into CODIS in 2000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 The case remained open, but cold, until 2014. That year, Tipton submitted to DNA testing as part of a plea agreement to resolve felony drug charges against him in Meagher County. In November 2014, CODIS matched Tipton's DNA profile to the DNA profile recovered from L.T.'s underwear. Follow-up DNA testing confirmed that the\n   DNA from the underwear belonged to Tipton. In November 2015, within one year of the confirmed match, the Yellowstone County Attorney charged Tipton with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent in violation of \u00a7 45-5-503(3)(a), MCA (1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Tipton filed a motion to dismiss the charges because the statute of limitations for the crime had expired. At the time of the crime, the statute of limitations for rape was five years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 45-1-205(1)(b), MCA (1985). In 1989, just two years after L.T. was raped, the Legislature amended the statute to allow for prosecution up to five years after the victim turned eighteen, if the victim was a minor at the time of the offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1989 Mont. Laws ch. 294, \u00a7 1; \u00a7 45-1-205 (1989). L.T. turned eighteen on May 8, 1996. The statute of limitations for the\n   crime against her expired on May 8, 2001.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   When the statute of limitations for L.T.'s rape expired, Bromgard was still in prison for the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 In 2007, the Legislature added subsection (9) to the general statute of limitations codified at \u00a7 45-1-205, MCA. 2007 Mont. Laws ch. 446, \u00a7 1. The new subsection states, \"If a suspect is conclusively identified by DNA testing after a time period prescribed in subsection (1)(b) or (1)(c) has expired, a prosecution may be commenced within 1 year after the suspect is conclusively identified by DNA testing.\" Section 45-1-205(9), MCA. Subsections (1)(b) and (1)(c) provide the statutes of limitations for sexual crimes, including \u00a7 45-5-503(3)(a), MCA. The District Court held that \u00a7 45-1-205(9), MCA, applied retroactively to the charges against Tipton. Relying in part on the Dissent in\n   <em>\n    Stogner v. California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898590\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/607/\">\n    539 U.S. 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898590\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/607/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898590\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/607/\">\n    156 L.Ed.2d 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003), the District Court also determined that the subsection did not violate the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause. Because the County Attorney had filed charges within a year of the DNA identification, the District Court denied Tipton's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 This Court has supervisory control over all other courts in Montana, and may, on a case-by-case basis, supervise another court through a writ of supervisory control.

Finally, Tipton raises a constitutional question of state-wide importance: whether the State may prosecute cold cases in which DNA evidence has conclusively identified a suspect, but the statute of limitations expired before \u00a7 45-1-205(9), MCA, came into effect. We agree that this is\n   an appropriate case for review by supervisory control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611\n   <em>\n    (1) Whether \u00a7 45-1-205(9), MCA, applies retroactively.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 Tipton first argues that \u00a7 45-1-205(9), MCA, does not apply to revive statutes of limitations that expired before its passage. Tipton emphasizes that the 2007 amendment lacks any express legislative direction that it be applied retroactively as required under \u00a7 1-2-109, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b613 Section 1-2-109, MCA, states, \"No law contained in any of the statutes of Montana is retroactive unless expressly so declared.\" This rule creates a strong presumption that laws do not have a retroactive effect unless the Legislature specifically states otherwise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mordja v.

Court\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3557740\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/341/219/\">\n    2008 MT 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3557740\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/341/219/\">\n    341 Mont. 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3557740\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/341/219/\">\n    177 P.3d 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We have explained that not all statutes that draw on antecedent facts for their operation are retroactive, but that a statute is \"retroactive\" under the statute when it \"takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty or attaches a new disability in respect to transactions already past.\"\n   <em>\n    Mordja\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 18 (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Mordja\n   </em>\n   , the statute of limitations for the offense against L.T. expired before the 2007 amendment took effect. But the language of \u00a7 45-1-205(9), MCA, shows a plain legislative intent that the statute applies retroactively. The subsection applies\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   if the statute of limitations already has run. The very purpose of the amendment was to authorize prosecution of a sex offense when DNA evidence positively identified an offender, even if the time had expired to file charges.

Tipton challenges subsection (9) as a violation of the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause when applied to extend a statute of limitations that had expired before subsection (9) came into effect. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Stogner v. California\n   </em>\n   , Tipton argues that subsection (9), when applied to extend a limitations period that had expired before the subsection came into effect, threatens the kind of harm that the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause seeks to avoid: \"preventing governments from enacting statutes with 'manifestly\n   <em>\n    unjust and oppressive\n   </em>\n   ' retroactive effects.\"\n   <em>\n    Stogner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898590\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/607/\">\n    539 U.S. at 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898590\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/607/\">\n    123 S.Ct. at 2449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Calder v.

He argues that subsection (9) is indistinguishable for constitutional purposes from the statute struck down in\n   <em>\n    Stogner\n   </em>\n   under similar circumstances and thus falls into the second category of laws that Justice Samuel Chase explained in\n   <em>\n    Calder\n   </em>\n   the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause prohibits.

The State argued that the\n   <em>\n    Stogner\n   </em>\n   Court articulated three bases underlying its decision: (1) that the statute threatens the kinds of harm that the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause seeks to avoid; (2) that the statute \"falls literally within the categorical descriptions of\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   laws set forth by Justice Chase more than 200 years ago in\n   <em>\n    Calder v.

The State attempts to distinguish the holding in\n   <em>\n    Stogner\n   </em>\n   from this case on the first rationale; it argues that subsection (9) does not threaten the same type of harm that the statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Stogner\n   </em>\n   threatened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b618 Article I, Section 10, of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 31, of the Montana Constitution prohibit the Legislature from enacting an \"\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   law.\" The foundation for\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause analysis in the United States is Justice Chase's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Calder v. Bull\n   </em>\n   -written just a decade after the Constitution was ratified. Justice Chase explained that\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   , which literally means laws with retroactive effects, is a term of art that had an established meaning at the time of the framing of the federal constitution.\n   <em>\n    Calder\n   </em>\n   , 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) at 391. \"Every ex post facto law must necessarily be retrospective; but every retrospective law is not an ex post facto law: The former, only, are prohibited.\"\n   <em>\n    Calder\n   </em>\n   , 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) at 391. Justice Chase explained, \"The plain and obvious meaning and intention of the prohibition is ... that the Legislatures of the several states, shall not pass laws, after a fact done by a subject, or citizen, which shall have relation to such fact, and shall punish him for having done it.\"\n   <em>\n    Calder\n   </em>\n   , 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) at 390. More specifically, Justice Chase laid down four categories of laws that would violate the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause as the Framers understood those words:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   1st.

Nor does it advocate that this Court adopt the\n   <em>\n    Stogner\n   </em>\n   Dissent's interpretation, as the District Court did. Rather, the State argues that\n   the heart of the\n   <em>\n    Stogner\n   </em>\n   opinion is that the harm the California statute threatened was the kind of harm the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause seeks to avoid. The State argues that the harm caused in\n   <em>\n    Stogner\n   </em>\n   differs from the harm (or lack of harm) inflicted on Tipton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b628 The State argues that the statute Tipton challenges departs in meaningful ways from the statute struck down in\n   <em>\n    Stogner.\n   </em>\n   Section 45-5-205(9), MCA, revives an expired statute of limitations in only a very narrow class of cases: sex crimes in which DNA evidence positively identifies a suspect for the first time. The charges brought against the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Stogner\n   </em>\n   would not fall under this category. The State argues that there is not the same concern about stale evidence that existed in\n   <em>\n    Stogner\n   </em>\n   : Montana's statute requires that DNA evidence conclusively identify the suspect; the DNA evidence available now is stronger than any evidence that the State had at the time of its initial investigation; and most of the evidence from the original investigation was preserved. The State thus argues that \u00a7 45-1-205(9), MCA, is narrower, provides more safeguards, and does not inflict the same harm as the statute in\n   <em>\n    Stogner\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b629 The State's argument misses the mark. Ensuring fairness by preventing convictions based on stale evidence was not the main focus of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Stogner\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Stogner\n   </em>\n   did not discuss at all the evidentiary safeguards included in the California statute-requiring independent evidence that clearly corroborated the victim's report. Such safeguards were irrelevant because the California law \"\n   <em>\n    enabled punishment where it was not otherwise available\n   </em>\n   in the ordinary course of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Stogner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898590\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/607/\">\n    539 U.S. at 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898590\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/607/\">\n    123 S.Ct. at 2451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (internal quotations omitted). The harm that the Supreme Court identified in\n   <em>\n    Stogner\n   </em>\n   was not that evidence had gone stale, or that the State's case against the defendant was weak, or that the statute failed to provide sufficient safeguards, but rather that it had revived the government's expired ability to prosecute at all. The Supreme Court concluded \"that a law enacted after expiration of a\n   previously applicable limitations period violates the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause when it is applied to revive a previously time-barred prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    Stogner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898590\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/607/\">\n    539 U.S. at 632-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898590\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/607/\">\n    123 S.Ct. at 2461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

L.T.'s rape was a crime when it was committed, and it remains a crime today.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA (1985)\n   <em>\n    , with\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA (2017). The Legislature's repeated extensions of the statute of limitations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   n.1\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , demonstrate that Montana considers the prosecution of these crimes against minors to be an important State interest. The State also points out that the punishment is not more burdensome, because Tipton could face only the punishment that was available in 1987 and not the higher sentences available under current law.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 45-5-503(3)(a), MCA (1985) (providing that the sentence for sexual intercourse without consent when the victim is under 16 years old is \"not less than 2 years or more than 40 years\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 45-5-503(3)(a) (2017) (providing that such offender can be sentenced to life in prison or \"not less than 4 years or more than 100 years\"). The State opines that fairness to the victim requires that this case be allowed to proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b631 The State emphasizes a number of factual differences between this case and\n   <em>\n    Stogner\n   </em>\n   : L.T. did not delay reporting the attack, and the crime was investigated and prosecuted promptly; the State and the victim both thought the perpetrator had been brought to justice; Tipton's connection surfaced only because he committed another felony; and technological advances in DNA testing have made evidence available today that was not available in 1987. The State argues, and the District Court held, that this is not the factual scenario the Supreme Court contemplated in\n   <em>\n    Stogner\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b632 The Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Stogner\n   </em>\n   , however, leaves no room to balance the State's and the victim's interests against the defendant's constitutional right to be free from\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   laws.

But none of those differences distinguishes the\n   cases for constitutional purposes. The Court in\n   <em>\n    Stogner\n   </em>\n   listed three features of the law that, \"taken together, produce the kind of retroactivity that the Constitution forbids\": (1) the law \"created a new criminal limitations period that extends the time in which prosecution is allowed\"; (2) \"[i]t authorized criminal prosecutions that the passage of time had previously barred\"; and (3) \"it was enacted after prior limitations periods for [the] alleged offenses had expired.\"\n   <em>\n    Stogner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898590\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/607/\">\n    539 U.S. at 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898590\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/607/\">\n    123 S.Ct. at 2449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Montana statute shares all three attributes with the statute struck down in\n   <em>\n    Stogner\n   </em>\n   . Thus, \u00a7 45-1-205(9), MCA, threatens the same constitutional harm when applied to Tipton that concerned the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Stogner\n   </em>\n   : the revival of a statute of limitations enacted after the limitations period had expired.

Applying the rule of law from\n   <em>\n    Stogner\n   </em>\n   , as we must, the State's arguments fail.\n   <em>\n    Stogner\n   </em>\n   compels us to hold that the charges against Tipton must be dismissed. We conclude that \u00a7 45-1-205(9), MCA, violates the\n   <em>\n    Ex Post Facto\n   </em>\n   Clause when applied-as here-to cases in which the statute of limitations expired before subsection (9) came into effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b635 THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that the petition for writ of supervisory control is GRANTED. The District Court's order is\n   REVERSED and the case is remanded with instructions to grant Tipton's motion to dismiss the charges with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We Concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   JIM RICE, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   JAMES JEREMIAH SHEA, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   LAURIE McKINNON, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   DIRK M.

Laws ch. 530, \u00a7 1. This extension did not go into effect until October 1, 2001, however-after the period of limitations applicable to L.T.'s rape already had expired.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 1-2-201, MCA. The 2017 Legislature extended the statute of limitations for sexual crimes against minors until twenty years after the victim's eighteenth birthday. 2017 Mont. Laws ch. 413, \u00a7 1. It is undisputed that neither of these extensions applies to extend the statute of limitations in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
