J.\n </judges>\n <attorneys id=\"p-9\">\n  In this case, we consider defendant's challenge under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution, to a warrant that authorized the search, seizure, and examination of his computer. Police investigated the injury of defendant's infant son while in defendant's care on June 12, 2011. The infant later died at the hospital. Defendant told the police that his son had struggled to breathe and that he had used his computer to look online for first aid advice before calling 9-1-1. For that and other reasons, police seized and then searched defendant's computer as part of their investigation. The forensic examination of the computer found internet search history shortly before the 9-1-1 call that was generally consistent with defendant's statements, but the examination also revealed that defendant had visited websites and entered search terms related to the abuse of infants several times in the months and weeks prior to the infant's death. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the latter evidence, and defendant was convicted of murder and other crimes. The Court of Appeals reversed the convictions, concluding that the warrant authorizing the search of the computer violated the particularity requirement of Article I, section 9, because it permitted the examination of everything on defendant's computer.\n  <em>\n   State v. Mansor\n  </em>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12167760\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/279/778/#p801\">\n   279 Or.

We allowed the state's petition for review of that decision and now affirm, although our analysis differs in some respects from that of the Court of Appeals.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion id=\"p-10\">\n  For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the application of Article I, section 9, to warranted searches of personal electronic devices requires a test that protects an individual's right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures while also recognizing the government's lawful authority to obtain evidence in criminal investigations, including through searches of digital data. A warrant to search a computer or other digital device for information related to a crime must be based on probable cause to believe that such information will be found on the device. To satisfy the particularity requirement of Article I, section 9, the warrant must identify, as specifically as reasonably possible in the circumstances, the information to be searched for,\n  including, if available and relevant, the time period during which the information was created, accessed, or otherwise used. We acknowledge that, for practical reasons, searches of computers are often comprehensive and therefore are likely to uncover information that goes beyond the probable cause basis for the warrant. In light of that fact, to protect the right to privacy and to avoid permitting the digital equivalent of general warrants, we also hold that Article I, section 9, prevents the state from using evidence found in a computer search unless a valid warrant authorized the search for that particular evidence, or it is admissible under an exception to the warrant requirement.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-11\">\n  In this case, police had probable cause to believe that defendant's computer would contain information regarding defendant's internet searches shortly before his 9-1-1 call. We refer to that information as \"the June 12 internet search history.\" Defendant moved to suppress all of the information found through the forensic examination of the computer, which, as noted, included the evidence of child abuse and other crimes dating from weeks and months before the 9-1-1 call, as well as the June 12 internet search history. The trial court found that the police lacked probable cause to search the computer for any information beyond the June 12 internet search history. Nevertheless, the trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress, and virtually all of the relevant forensic evidence was admitted at trial. That was error. In our view, the warrant was sufficiently particular to permit a search of the computer; however, the trial court erred in admitting the proffered evidence that was obtained as a result of the forensic examination, because, as we read the warrant, it authorized the police to search only for the June 12 internet search\n  history. Accordingly, we conclude that defendant's motion to suppress should have been granted in part and denied in part. Because that error was not harmless, we affirm the Court of Appeals' decision reversing defendant's convictions and remand the case to the trial court.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-12\">\n  I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-13\">\n  On June 12, 2011, defendant called 9-1-1 at 2:22 p.m. and reported that his 11-week-old son, B, had stopped\n  breathing. After an ambulance took the infant to the hospital, Detective Rookhuyzen of the Washington County Sheriff's Office child abuse unit interviewed defendant at his home. On the basis of information learned in that interview and a pediatrician's examination of B at the hospital, Rookhuyzen applied for and obtained the warrant which defendant now challenges.\n </opinion>\n <footnote label=\"**\">\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Landau, J., retired December 31, 2017, and did not participate in the decision of this case. Brewer, J., retired June 30, 2017, and did not participate in the decision of this case.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Rookhuyzen prepared a seven-page affidavit in support of his warrant application. The Court of Appeals summarized the affidavit's contents, which recounted Rookhuyzen's interactions with defendant and observations of the home:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"At the beginning of the interview, Rookhuyzen noted that defendant was 'non-emotive'-which, in Rookhuyzen's training and experience, was 'highly unusual' in such circumstances because '[p]arents are usually crying, sobbing, and exhibiting signs of sadness or anxiety.' Defendant told Rookhuyzen that he had been home alone with B and his twin brother, while his wife was working. According to defendant, as he had been feeding B a mixture of formula and liquid vitamins, the mixture had started to come out of the baby's nose and the baby had started coughing, so defendant had turned him over, shaken him, and 'smacked' him on the back. The baby's eyes became 'fixed' and 'droopy,' and his breathing became 'very much labored.' Defendant told Rookhuyzen that he then shook B more, and the baby began going 'a minute or two between breaths.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Defendant did not call 9-1-1 at that point. Instead, he told Rookhuyzen, he 'went online' on a computer in the baby's room to conduct research about what he should do. When, after 15 minutes, the baby's condition did not improve, defendant called 9-1-1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"Defendant did not call his wife during that period-and, indeed, had not attempted to contact her by the time Rookhuyzen began to interview him. In Rookhuyzen's experience, that was 'extremely unusual': '[W]ith these kind of incidents, spouses want to call each other instantly, even before speaking with law enforcement.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"Rookhuyzen's affidavit further recounted that, at the hospital, B was examined by a pediatrician, Dr. Lindsay, who determined that the baby had no brain activity and\n   would die soon. Lindsay further determined,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the baby had experienced head trauma resulting in a skull fracture, bi-lateral retinal hemorrhages, and an 'old rib fracture.' In Lindsay's opinion, defendant's account was not consistent with the baby's condition, and he ultimately rendered a diagnosis of 'shaken baby syndrome ' as a result of intentionally inflicted abuse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"*** Further, as specifically pertinent to the lawfulness of the seizure and search of defendant's computers, the affidavit included the following averment:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \" 'I know based upon my training and experience that computers can be connected to the internet to find information using computer software that browse internet sites for information. Internet search engine sites such as Google and Yahoo! are often used to search the internet for information related to a user's requests. I know that the computer will retain a history of internet sites visited and the search terms used on the internet. I know that to retain the integrity of a computer's memory and how the system was used, the computer needs to be searched in a laboratory and carefully examined by a trained computer forensic examiner in order to ensure that the data is not corrupted, damaged, or otherwise changed from the time when the machine was seized. [Defendant] told me that he searched the internet between the time he noticed [B] was\n   having difficulty breathing and the time he called emergency dispatch. He told me that he was using a computer to search the internet for advice on what he should do. When I was in the residence, I saw two laptop computers and two desktop computers. [Defendant] did not specify which computer he was using just before he called 9-1-1.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"The affidavit also included a detailed description of defendant's residence. Finally, in a section titled 'Conclusion,' the affidavit stated Rookhuyzen's belief that there was probable cause to seize and search 11 types of evidence, including '[t]wo laptop computers in the residence' and '[t]wo desktop computer towers located in the office/baby room.' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Mansor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12167760\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/279/778/#p801\">\n    279 Or.

The search warrant instructed executing\n   officers to \"seize and search and forensically examine the following objects: See attachment A.\" (Emphasis omitted.) Attachment A was captioned \"items to be searched for, to be seized, and to be analyzed.\" It repeated verbatim the list of eleven items included in Rookhuyzen's affidavit, including \"[t]wo laptop computers\" and \"[t]wo desktop computer towers.\" The warrant itself contained no instructions or limitations regarding how the computers were to be analyzed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The warrant was executed that night. Two laptop computers, two desktop computers, and other items from B's room were seized. The computers were taken to the Northwest Regional Computer Forensics Laboratory, operated by the FBI, which performed the forensic analysis. The lab's report summarized the request:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"[Rookhuyzen] requested that the [seized computer drives] be examined for internet history and internet search terms input by the user on [June 12] especially from 2pm onward. Per a discussion with Det. Rookhuyzen, the suspect searched the internet 15 minutes prior to calling 9-1-1 in regards to his 11-week old child suffering injuries. Suspect claimed that the internet searches were regarding how to aid an injured infant. Pertinent examination results should be regarding child abuse and a possible history thereof.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   When Rookhuyzen made the initial request to the lab, he provided a list of 19 search terms. A week later, another detective, Hays, added eight more search terms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The scope of the analysis of the computers expanded further. The report noted that about a month after the initial request, a detective directed that the search of the computer be expanded to include email, although no relevant emails were ultimately located. The forensic examiners also included in the report search terms that were not provided by the detectives, but that, in their opinion, \"yielded possibly pertinent results.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The forensic examiner stated that\n   he had no knowledge of the case itself, other than what he had learned from the detective's request regarding the examination of the computers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The report also summarized the lab's methods and findings. For each computer and laptop, the storage media were removed and imaged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   An initial analysis revealed that some of the hard drives had last been used in 2009, and those were not examined further. For the remaining drives, the forensic examiner assembled a \"complete Internet history\n   ,\" including \"deleted Internet history records.\" \"Internet history\" is a broad term. The software used by the lab-\"Net Analysis\"-compiled many types of data, for example, cookies, cached data, \"leaks,\" and other types of data that are generated as part of normal internet browsing activity, to create the internet history dataset.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each piece of internet history data might contain or be associated with information useful to investigators, such as the identity of the computer user logged in at the time, the time and date that a particular web page was visited, or search terms entered into search engines, but each piece of data was not associated with all of those types of information. For example, not all records were associated with a date and time or revealed how the user navigated to a particular web page.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The internet history dataset was compiled into a large spreadsheet containing over 360,000 records dating back to 2005-six years before B was born. Net Analysis allowed the forensic examiner to search for text in any of the\n   websites visited and to organize the internet history records by date and time. In addition to a printed summary of its findings, the lab provided detectives with a DVD containing that dataset and several lengthy reports on specific searches requested by detectives. For example, one report listed all web URLs visited on the date of the 9-1-1 call, beginning with a visit to Netflix nine seconds after midnight and continuing until that afternoon. That report is 630 pages long. Another report that listed results for the search term \"abuse\" was 101 pages long, and contained URLs dating from a 16 month period as well as many other URLs not associated with a date and time. The lab also provided reports for the search terms that \"originated during the examination\" as yielding \"possibly pertinent results,\" listed above. Similarly, the DVD contained files that were not internet history, but that the forensic examiner believed might be relevant, such as a Microsoft Word document containing a narrative description of the child's birth, photos of B, and a downloaded computer game that allowed the user to simulate child abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Before trial, defendant moved to suppress the evidence discovered on the computers, arguing that the warrant was \"worded so broadly as to constitute a general warrant.\" Defendant suggested that \"search protocols\" should have been included in the warrant to restrict the potentially unlimited search of the computer hard drives. A search protocol, for example, could limit the search to specific files or types of data on the computer-such as emails, internet searches, or photographs-or to search terms used in an internet browser.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Comprehensive Drug Testing, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783527\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/621/1162/#p1179\">\n    621 F.3d 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1179 (9th Cir. 2010) (on rehearing en banc) (Kozinski, C.J., concurring) (discussing search protocols in warrants to search computers).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The trial court denied the motion in a written opinion. The trial court first noted that defendant had conceded that the search warrant properly permitted law enforcement officials to search the computers for the June 12 internet search history. The court then rejected defendant's argument that the lack of search protocols in the warrant rendered the warrant unconstitutional, noting that the majority view is that such protocols are not constitutionally required. The court found that the affidavit did not provide\n   probable cause to search the computer for evidence of any crimes other than those related to B's injuries on June 12. Nevertheless, and apparently relying on the \"traditional rules for the plain view exception,\" the court concluded that \"all evidence obtained through the execution of the warrant [was] admissible.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   At trial, Detective Hays relied on the forensic lab's reports to testify about defendant's internet history. He stated that shortly before the 9-1-1 call, defendant searched the term \"baby pulse no breathing\"-a search consistent with defendant's explanation of events. The focus of Hays's testimony on defendant's internet history, however, was computer activity that occurred before that day. Interpreting reports generated by the forensic examiner, Hays concluded that on five separate occasions-the day of the 9-1-1 call and four earlier occasions, the earliest 54 days before the call-the computer had been used to conduct searches about or related to child abuse. The prosecutor implied that the search terms typed into the computer, often in quick succession, provided a snapshot of defendant's thought process and conduct. For example, three days before the 9-1-1 call, there were many relevant searches, including, at 6:24 a.m., a search for \"afraid of abusing my baby,\" then shortly after that, \"how do I deal with a screaming baby,\" then three minutes later, \"baby, swelling, back of head.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The evidence gathered from defendant's computer was undoubtedly helpful to the state's case. In the state's closing argument, the prosecutor called internet search history \"a looking glass\" into a person's character and \"a record\n   of what's going on in [defendant's] head.\" The prosecutor recited strings of sequential search terms to the jury, such as those quoted above, and used those to speculate about defendant's thought process. Defendant's ex-wife and B's mother also relied on the internet history to understand what had happened. She said that in the first two weeks after B's death, she supported defendant because she couldn't believe that he would hurt B. But \"[w]hen the evidence came to light about [defendant's] computer searches, I stopped supporting him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The state charged defendant with six counts relating to three discrete incidents of abuse against B and B's twin in the weeks before B's death, and four counts relating to the incident that caused B's death. After an eleven day trial, the jury convicted defendant of all charged counts: murder, assault in the first degree, three counts of assault in the third degree, and three counts of criminal mistreatment in the first degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On appeal, defendant challenged the warrant as facially invalid because it failed to satisfy the particularity requirement of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution. Defendant also asserted that, to determine whether the warrant was valid, the court should look at the warrant alone and not consider information contained in the affidavit that supported the warrant application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court of Appeals first addressed whether its review of the warrant was limited to the face of the warrant or whether it also could look at the affidavit.\n   <em>\n    Mansor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12167760\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/279/778/#p801\">\n    279 Or.

THE DIGITAL CONTEXT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Before addressing the parties' legal arguments, it is helpful to identify some of the ways that digital data, whether stored on a computer or other digital device, differs from physical evidence. First, raw digital data-the 1s and 0s that make up binary signals-must be processed and displayed by intermediating programs and hardware to be meaningful. A user may conceive of the information on her computer as being \"files,\" organized into \"folders\" that are stored in various locations on the computer and accessed through particular software programs. But a computer forensic examiner views the same data differently. As demonstrated by the facts of this case, a category of information that is a likely source of evidence-say, the internet search history on a given computer-may be composed of many types of data and files, and the physical locations of data on a computer hard drive and even the software's organization of those data and files may be unrelated to the user's perception of how their data is organized.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Josh Goldfoot,\n   <em>\n    The Physical Computer and the Fourth Amendment\n   </em>\n   , 16 Berkeley J.

L. 112, 128 (2011) (explaining that \"files do not correspond to organizational choices made by computer users\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Similarly, some data on a computer may not be in the form of \"files.\" For example, when a user deletes a file, fragments of the file's raw data often continue to exist on the hard drive. A forensic examiner may be able to reconstitute a new file from that residual data that can then be read by a program. That concept-that digital information is perceived in fundamentally different ways by users than by forensic examiners-means that a user's honest statements about a file, such as \"it's in the 'My Documents' folder,\" \"that document is gone, I didn't save it,\" or \"no one can use my computer without my password,\" may not be \"true\" to a forensic\n   examiner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We discuss the implications of the foregoing context below.\n   Digital evidence also differs from physical evidence in that, for most files, there is no way to know what data a file contains without opening it, meaning that desired data may be located in any part of the digital media or organizational structure. Indeed, data stored on a computer hard drive may be physically located in multiples places on the drive, and it is unhelpful and often inaccurate to think of the data as being located at any particular \"place\" or \"places.\" In the physical world, a handgun cannot be disguised as-and will not be mistaken for-a kitchen table, nor will it be found in a pill bottle. But in the virtual world, that kind of deception-or error-is possible. A picture file may be intentionally disguised as a text file, for example, by changing the extension of the file name or by including the picture in a Microsoft Word document, which would be properly saved as a .doc (or similar) file. A picture file may contain text information if, for example, the picture is of a page of a book. Sophisticated users can hide digital data in much more complex ways, including changing date and time metadata and encrypting files so that they cannot be opened.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Orin S.

Similarly, information can be hidden unintentionally. Most of us have had the experience of neglecting to name or properly \"save\" a document, only to have it disappear into an obscure temporary file, with its sole identifier a number assigned by the software. And even those with limited computer skills can easily delete their internet search \"history\" on a particular internet browser,\n   although evidence of those searches will likely remain elsewhere on the hard drive. A forensic examiner who locates intentionally (or unintentionally) hidden information on a computer likely has responded to clues, followed instincts, and pursued many dead ends before being successful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Orin S.

MAY THE AFFIDAVIT BE CONSIDERED WITH THE WARRANT?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We first address the issue of whether the information contained in Rookhuyzen's affidavit is properly considered part of the warrant itself. In the Court of Appeals, the state asserted that the affidavit was \"attached to and referenced by\" the warrant and, as a result, the court should consider the contents of the affidavit as part of the warrant in deciding defendant's challenge to the warrant's facial validity. In his response, defendant agreed that an affidavit may be considered part of the warrant if it physically accompanies the warrant and the warrant\n   explicitly incorporates it by reference; however, defendant disputed that the state had established that the warrant here met those requirements, and, therefore, he claimed that the contents of the affidavit should not be considered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Court of Appeals observed that, when a search is conducted pursuant to a warrant, the defendant bears \"the burden of establishing facts pertaining to his 'challenge [to] the validity of the warrant itself.' \"\n   <em>\n    Mansor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12167760\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/279/778/#p801\">\n    279 Or.

Here, the state's contention that the affidavit was attached to and referenced in the warrant at the time of execution was supported, as the Court of Appeals said, by \"permissible, albeit hardly indubitable, inference.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674252\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/350/540/#p553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant presented no evidence to controvert that inference.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674252\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/350/540/#p553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On that record, the Court of Appeals concluded that defendant fell short of his burden of production and therefore considered the affidavit to be part of the warrant for purposes of its review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We agree with the Court of Appeals that defendant failed in the trial court to establish the factual basis for his argument on appeal; for purposes of this case, we consider the text of the affidavit to be part of the warrant. That said, we note that parties may spend substantial time litigating whether the contents of an affidavit should be considered in a challenge to a warrant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LaFave, 2\n   <em>\n    Search and Seizure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.6(1) at 778 (noting a \"great variety of viewpoints\" on the issue). In our view, rather than relying on indirect inferences to establish a connection between the warrant and an affidavit, the better practice is for the warrant to include specific text from the affidavit or to incorporate the affidavit by express reference in the warrant. Merely attaching the affidavit or an exhibit with an attached affidavit to the warrant, without some textual reference, creates the ambiguous situation apparently present here. Moreover, as we discuss in greater detail below, in order to guide the persons conducting the forensic examination of a properly seized computer, the warrant itself should describe, with as much specificity as reasonably possible, the category or categories of information to be searched for on the computer, including, if available and relevant, the time period when the information was created, accessed, or otherwise used. That description, of course, must be based on affidavits or other record evidence that establishes probable cause to search the computer for such information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Because we have concluded that the affidavit should be considered as part of the warrant in this case, it follows that the contents of the affidavit assist us in determining the scope of the search that the warrant permitted. The warrant itself authorized police to \"seize and search and forensically examine\" certain items listed in an attachment, and the listed items included defendant's computers. The affidavit also referred to, and sought authority to search for and seize, those items, and an exhibit to the affidavit refers to \"items to be searched for, to be seized, and to be analyzed.\" The only reference in the affidavit to relevant information that Rookhuyzen believed was on the computer was the paragraph set out above, 363 Or. at 204, 421 P.3d at 328 (and one related sentence in the affidavit), regarding defendant's statements about searching the internet for first aid advice in the 15 minutes before he made the 9-1-1 call. Although the warrant, supplemented by the affidavit, authorized the \"search,\" \"analy[sis],\" and \"forensic[ ] examinat[ion]\" of all the items seized, including the computers, the only description of any relevant information that Rookhuyzen believed might be found on the computers was that of the June 12 internet search history. We therefore view that description of the information to be searched for as a limitation on the search, analysis, and forensic examination authorized by the warrant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   IV.

Although defendant's motion to suppress challenged the seizure of the computers as well as the forensic examination of the computers for evidence and the use of that evidence at trial, defendant no longer argues that the seizure of the physical computers violated Article I, section 9. That argument would fail in any event. The warrant recounted defendant's statements to Rookhuyzen about his internet searches, identified two laptop computers and two desktop computer towers in the apartment, and included statements by Rookhuyzen about how internet search engines are used to seek information (as defendant stated that he had done when B was not breathing) and about the need to have an examination conducted by a trained computer forensic examiner. The warrant was sufficiently particular in its description of the computers to be seized and the grounds for believing that evidence related to the criminal investigation was likely to be found on one or more of them to meet the particularity requirement of Article I, section 9, with respect to the seizure of the computers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Search of a lawfully seized computer\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The more difficult issue is whether the warrant's authorization of lawful seizure of the computers similarly authorized the state to conduct a search of the computers to locate and seize information or data on the computers for evidence of a crime. The principles underlying Article I, section 9, establish that an individual generally has a privacy interest in the information on his or her personal computer. A computer often is either located in a private space, such as a home, or secured by a password or biometric identification, or both. Those \"barriers to public entry\" are the sort contemplated in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"701795\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/327/366/#p372\">\n    327 Or. at 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"701795\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/327/366/#p372\">\n    963 P.2d 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that indicate the presence of constitutionally protected privacy interests. The state does not disagree. The state argues, however, that if police obtain a valid warrant to search for and seize a computer, they are \"free to examine it as they see fit.\" The state asserts that \"a computer is a thing, and a warrant to examine it need only identify the particular computer, not the data that the examination is intended to find.\" The state relies on cases involving other \"things\" seized in warranted searches and argues that once a \"thing\" is seized and examined for any purpose, \"any privacy interest in that object is destroyed, and no purpose would be served by further limitation on the nature of examinations that may be performed on the object.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   We agree with defendant and the Court of Appeals that the state's argument is not well taken. For reasons that we will explain, the fact that police have a warrant, based on probable cause, to search for and seize \"things,\" including computers, does not necessarily mean that they may conduct a comprehensive forensic examination of a computer that they seize, and then use at trial anything they find on the computer, without limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   As noted, the state accepts that individuals have a protected privacy interest in their computers and the information on them. The state's legal argument, however, fails to account for the fact that, unlike most other \"things\" that may be seized in a search, a computer or other digital device is a repository with a historically unprecedented capacity to collect and store a diverse and vast array of personal information. Moreover, that information is stored in a manner that ordinarily makes it inaccessible to others. We discussed in detail above the reasons that\n   computers and digital devices are different from most other \"things\" that can be seized in the course of criminal investigations and the Supreme Court's recognition in\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   that different search and seizure rules apply to those devices than to other \"things.\" Indeed, the state's argument here is similar to the argument that the government made in\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   and that the Supreme Court rejected: If the item (the phone or computer) is lawfully seized, then any information that can be discovered within the item also is legitimately seized and can be used at trial. Although\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   involved a warrantless search incident to arrest and this case involves a computer seized pursuant to a warrant, defendant urges us to follow the Court's approach in\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   and hold that computers deserve more protection than other \"things\" under Article I, section 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The state argues that this court has previously held that an individual retains no privacy interest in storage media that is lawfully in the possession of the police. In\n   <em>\n    State v. Munro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3026081\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/339/545/\">\n    339 Or. 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3026081\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/339/545/\">\n    124 P.3d 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005), the police raided a home pursuant to a warrant in connection with a drug investigation and seized a beta format videotape and various contraband. The defendant was prosecuted for possession of the other contraband, but the videotape appeared to be blank. About a year later, acting on new information, police were able to view the contents of the tape, discovered that it contained child pornography, and prosecuted defendant based on that evidence. The defendant challenged the later examination of the tape-which the state conceded was a \"search\"-as violating Article I, section 9. This court held that no violation had occurred, because \"[o]nce the police seized the videotape under the authority of the warrant, any privacy interest that defendant had in the contents of the videotape was destroyed by the authority of the warrant permitting the examination and exhibition of the contents of the videotape.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 552,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3026081\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/339/545/\">\n    124 P.3d 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The state erroneously assumes, however, that the videotape in\n   <em>\n    Munro\n   </em>\n   is analogous to a computer or a cell phone. Of the unique characteristics of the cell phone described in\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   -such as containing many types of information, having immense storage capacity, and playing a role in many aspects of life-a videotape has none. In contrast with a cell phone, which continually creates and stores data as it is used, the only possible \"search\" of a videotape is for the police to view the tape as it was recorded.\n   <em>\n    Munro\n   </em>\n   held only that a single analog videotape is a \"thing\" for purposes of search and seizure analysis, and once it was seized pursuant to a valid warrant, the owner lost all privacy interest in it. That holding does not assist the state here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Further, the state's semantic observation that a computer is literally a \"thing\" is a truism that does not compel a legal conclusion. And the state provides no persuasive rejoinder to the Court's description in\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   of the technological changes that led the Court to exempt cell phones from the \"search incident to arrest\" doctrine. The data contained on a personal computer is qualitatively and quantitatively different from the sort of information that could be found in other single objects, or even an entire house not containing digital data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We reject the state's argument that a computer is merely a \"thing to be seized\" and that, once lawfully seized, the state is free to analyze or examine the computer without limit and to use any information that is found.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   We observe at this point that the state does not rely on the plain view doctrine-or any other exception to the warrant requirement-to justify the seizure and use at trial of information from defendant's computer; instead, its remaining arguments,\n   which we discuss in detail below, turn on the scope of the warrant. The plain view doctrine permits police to seize evidence without a warrant if they are in a place where they have a right to be and have probable cause to believe that the evidence that they see in \"plain view\" is contraband or evidence of a crime.\n   <em>\n    Carter,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561709\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/342/39/#p42\">\n    342 Or. at 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561709\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/342/39/#p42\">\n    147 P.3d 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Following\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   -and, indeed, general principles of search and seizure law-we agree that to satisfy the particularity requirement, a warrant must describe, with as much specificity as reasonably possible under the circumstances,\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   investigating officers believe will be found on the electronic devices.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6807397\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/135/282/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant clarifies that that element does not necessarily mean the type of computer file, such as an email, text, or photograph. Rather, for the reasons discussed above regarding the nature of digital evidence, the \"what\" is a description of the\n   <em>\n    information\n   </em>\n   related to the\n   alleged criminal conduct which there is probable cause to believe will be found on the computer. Given the protean variety of factual settings in which such warrants are likely to be sought, it would be a fool's errand to set out, in the abstract, detailed guidelines for determining how specific the \"what\" of the search must be to meet the particularity requirement of Article I, section 9, in the computer search context, and we decline to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Defendant also argues that, to be sufficiently particular, a warrant authorizing a computer search must identify \"where\" the search may be conducted on the computer. Defendant contends that any search must be limited to \"the place or specific location in the computer where the evidence is likely to be found without much effort or rummaging-in this case, defendant's 'internet browsing history.' \" Defendant suggests that locations on a computer hard drive are like rooms in a house, and that the warrant must limit the search to specified rooms, such as \"internet browsing history, document files, hard drive, emails, call logs, and varying application folders.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   It is certainly true that many warrants authorizing computer searches will identify commonly used software programs-email clients, internet browsers, document management tools-where relevant evidence is likely to be found. For the practical reasons explained above, however, a search warrant may be sufficiently particular without being limited to searching in those \"places.\" Imposing such limits on a computer search would require police and the reviewing magistrate to know the technological specifications, including the configuration of the operating system and applications software on a computer, before a warrant could be obtained. Limiting a search to certain \"places\" on a computer, defined in terms of the computer's internal organization, such as the \"My Documents\" folder, is an\n   <em>\n    ex ante\n   </em>\n   limitation on the search. Such\n   <em>\n    ex ante\n   </em>\n   limitations would require a valid warrant to be based on more detailed knowledge of a specific computer and its software than would be required to meet the usual probable cause standard for the information being sought. And defining \"places\" on a computer in terms of a person's particular use of them, such as \"places where a user may store documents,\" is essentially redundant of the \"what\" element discussed above. Moreover, information on a computer easily can be moved from one virtual location to another, either intentionally or by mistake. We do not think that it is useful to conceive of a computer as consisting of multiple \"rooms\" or containers, and a valid warrant to search a computer need not identify \"places\" to search at that level of abstraction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Defendant also argues that a warrant for a computer search should include a \"temporal limitation\" or \"when\" requirement, if one is available and relevant. In\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   , the court held that the warrant was unconstitutionally broad because, among other things, it failed to \"limit the search to the relevant time frame.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6807397\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/135/282/\">\n    135 A.3d at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reaching that conclusion, the court noted that federal and state courts have concluded that \"warrants lacking temporal constraints, where relevant dates are available to the police, are insufficiently particular.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6807397\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/135/282/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 304 n. 117, 305 n. 118 (listing cases). Certainly, consideration of the time when relevant documents were created or internet sites visited can be helpful in ensuring that the warrant describes that which the executing officers may search for with sufficient specificity, but without impermissible overbreadth. And we agree with the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Wheeler\n   </em>\n   and the cases cited there that when a time-based description of the information sought on a computer is relevant and available to the police, it ordinarily should be set out in the affidavit, and the warrant should include that description. That said, analytically, \"temporal limitations\" are more accurately seen as a way of identifying with greater specificity the \"what\" that is being searched for, rather than as a separate, independently required element, in meeting the particularity requirement for a computer search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   We thus agree in substantial part with defendant. The warrant to search a computer must be based on affidavits that establish probable cause to believe that the computer contains information relevant to the criminal investigation. To meet the particularity\n   requirement of Article I, section 9, the warrant must identify, as specifically as reasonably possible in the circumstances, the information to be searched for, including, if relevant and available, the time period during which that information was created, accessed, or otherwise used. We emphasize, however, based on our discussion of digital devices and computer searches above,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   363 Or. at 196-203, 421 P.3d at 331-34, that the forensic examination likely will need to examine, at least briefly, some information or data beyond that identified in the warrant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Was the warrant here sufficiently particular?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Returning to the facts of this case, the affidavit established probable cause to believe that child abuse was the cause of B's injuries and probable cause to believe that evidence related to the crime would be found on the computer. When Rookhuyzen interviewed defendant in his apartment, defendant was \"completely non-emotive\" and had not called his wife, behavior that Rookhuyzen called \"highly\" and \"extremely\" unusual. Based on defendant's statements regarding his searches shortly before the 9-1-1 call, there also was probable cause to believe that one or more of the computers at the apartment contained information that would confirm or refute defendant's statements about what happened in the minutes before that call:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   \"[Defendant] told [Rookhuyzen] that he searched the internet between the time he noticed [B] was having difficulty breathing and the time he called emergency dispatch. He told [Rookhuyzen] that he was using a computer to search the internet for advice on what he should do.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Additionally, the affidavit recited statements of the pediatrician who examined B that B's injuries were \"clearly the result of intentionally inflicted abuse\" and that \"[defendant's] version of events was not consistent with [B]'s condition\"; that B had a brain injury\"unrelated to choking\"; and that B had a recent skull fracture and bilateral retinal hemorrhages. Finally, the affidavit stated Rookhuyzen's view, based on his training and experience, that computers retain a history of internet use and that examination of a computer needs to be done in a forensic laboratory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The affidavit thus established probable cause to believe that a crime had occurred on June 12 and explained, based on case-specific facts and the officer's training and experience, that there was probable cause to believe that evidence relevant to the investigation would be found on the computer. The affidavit described with particularity certain evidence likely to be found on the computer. Indeed, as the Court of Appeals noted, defendant twice conceded at the suppression hearing \"the lawfulness of a search of the computers with respect to the 15 minutes preceding the 9-1-1 call.\"\n   <em>\n    Mansor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12167760\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/279/778/#p801\">\n    279 Or.

It sufficiently described the \"what\" to be searched for and the relevant time frame: The June 12 internet search history. It informed those executing the warrant as to what they were to look for \"with a reasonable degree of certainty.\"\n   <em>\n    Blackburn/ Barber\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2130981\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/266/28/#p34\">\n    266 Or. at 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2130981\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/266/28/#p34\">\n    511 P.2d 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And, because that description limited the extent of the search that was authorized by the warrant, as we read it, the permitted search was not \"broader than the supporting affidavit supplie[d] probable cause to justify.\"\n   <em>\n    Reid,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2212256\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/319/65/#p71\">\n    319 Or. at 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2212256\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/319/65/#p71\">\n    872 P.2d 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For that reason, although we agree with much of the Court of Appeals' learned analysis, we disagree with its legal conclusion that the warrant was overbroad on its face and therefore invalid\n   <em>\n    in toto.\n   </em>\n   In our view, the warrant was not facially invalid because it authorized a search for only the June 12 internet history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   V. USE OF RESULTS OF COMPUTER SEARCHES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   It does not follow, however, that the trial court was correct in denying defendant's\n   motion to suppress the results of the forensic examination in their entirety. As we have discussed, the warrant authorized a search only for the June 12 internet search history. That search was supported by probable cause, was sufficiently specific, and was not overbroad. The nature of a computer search, however, means that, in searching for that history, that the forensic examiners were likely to come across or discover additional information. And, in this case, the forensic examination searched for and uncovered information, later used at trial, that went far beyond the scope of the warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   To ensure the protection of Article I, section 9, rights, we must consider what restrictions, if any, should be imposed on the use of information police obtain through reasonably executed warranted computer searches when those searches uncover evidence beyond that authorized in the warrant, and when no exception to the warrant requirement supports the collection or use of that evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In our view, the privacy interests underlying Article I, section 9, are best protected by recognizing a necessary trade-off when the state searches a computer that has been lawfully seized. Even a reasonable search authorized by a valid warrant necessarily may require examination of at least some information that is beyond the scope of the warrant. Such state searches raise the possibility of computer search warrants becoming the digital equivalent of general warrants and of sanctioning the \"undue rummaging that the particularity requirement was enacted to preclude.\"\n   <em>\n    Mansor,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12167760\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/279/778/#p801\">\n    279 Or.

Although such searches are lawful and appropriate, individual privacy interests preclude the state from benefiting from that necessity by being permitted to use that evidence at trial. We thus conclude that the state should not be permitted to use information obtained in a computer search if the warrant did not authorize the search for that information, unless some other warrant exception applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kerr, 48 Tex Tech L Rev at 24 (suggesting use restrictions for data \"nonresponsive\" to the warrant). Put differently, when the state conducts a reasonably targeted search of a person's computer for information pursuant to a warrant that properly identifies the information being sought, the state has not unreasonably invaded the person's privacy interest, and the state may use the information identified in the warrant in a prosecution or any other lawful manner. But when the state looks for other information or uncovers information that was not authorized by the warrant, Article I, section 9, prohibits the state from using that information at trial, unless it comes within an exception to the warrant requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   That approach is consistent with our explanation that the purpose of rules requiring the suppression of evidence gathered in violation of the constitution is to restore the parties to the position they would have been in had the violation not occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   \"[R]ules of law designed to protect citizens against unauthorized or illegal searches or seizures of their persons, property, or private effects are to be given effect by denying the state the use of evidence secured in violation of those rules against the persons whose rights were violated, or, in effect, by restoring the parties to their position as if the state's officers had remained within the limits of their authority.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <em>\n    State v. Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2187208\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/295/227/#p237\">\n    295 Or. 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 237,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2187208\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/295/227/#p237\">\n    666 P.2d 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983). Here, the warrant authorized the police to search for specific information on defendant's computer-the June 12 internet search history. The state properly searched for and found that evidence and used it at trial. But the state also searched for and obtained, and used at trial, a substantial amount of evidence from the computer that was not within the scope of the warrant. We have rejected the state's arguments that the warrant authorized the seizure of that additional evidence, and the state has identified no exception to the warrant requirement that supported its acquisition, and use, of that evidence. To restore defendant to the position he would have been in had the police not obtained that additional evidence, the evidence other than the June 12 internet search history should have been suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   VI. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   In summary: Article I, section 9, prohibits general warrants that give \"the bearer an unlimited authority to search and seize.\"\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561709\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/342/39/#p42\">\n    342 Or. at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561709\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/342/39/#p42\">\n    147 P.3d 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Reid\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2212256\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/319/65/#p71\">\n    319 Or. at 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2212256\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/319/65/#p71\">\n    872 P.2d 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Instead, subject to certain exceptions, that provision requires a warrant based on probable cause and describing with particularity that which the state may search for and seize. As the Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   , digital information on cell phones-and, by logical extension, computers and similar digital devices-implicates privacy interests entitled to constitutional protection under the Fourth Amendment, and those interests are equal to or surpass those of a home.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581677\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2473/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court's reasoning is persuasive and informs our understanding of the proper application of the Oregon warrant requirement to searches of computers and other digital devices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   As explained above, we reject the state's initial argument that a computer is like any other \"thing\" and that, if it is lawfully seized pursuant to a warrant or is otherwise lawfully in the state's possession, any information that is discovered on the computer is also lawfully seized and can be used at trial. We also reject the state's alternative argument that a warrant to seize and search a computer is sufficiently particular if it simply identifies the crime or crimes being investigated. We instead conclude that, to meet the particularity requirement of Article I, section 9, a warrant to search for and seize a computer-and to search the computer itself for information related to a crime-must be based on probable cause to believe that such evidence will be found on the computer and must describe the information the state seeks (the \"what\") with as much specificity as reasonably possible under the circumstances, including, if available and relevant, a temporal description of when the information was created, accessed, or otherwise used. As a practical matter, a forensic examination of the computer that reasonably seeks to discover the evidence described in the warrant may reveal evidence that is beyond the scope of the warrant. We also hold that, because of the possibility that a computer search will uncover information that is not authorized by the warrant, a defendant's Article I, section 9, privacy rights prevent the state from using such information unless it comes within an exception to the warrant requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In this case, the trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the \"material discovered as the result of a warranted search of his home computers.\"\n   <em>\n    Mansor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12167760\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/279/778/#p801\">\n    279 Or.

The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the warrant was impermissibly overbroad and that the trial court should have granted the motion to suppress.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12167760\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/279/778/#p801\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12167760\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/279/778/#p801\">\n    at 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12167760\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/279/778/#p801\">\n    381 P.3d 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As discussed at length above, we conclude that the warrant, as limited by the affidavit, was not facially invalid, because the accompanying affidavit established probable cause to search the computers and specifically identified the information to be sought. However, the warrant, as limited by the affidavit, did not authorize police to search for and recover much of the other voluminous material that was contained in the computer and that also was subject to the motion to suppress. The trial court's decision denying the motion to suppress and allowing the evidence beyond the scope of the warrant to be used at trial was erroneous. That error was not harmless. We therefore reverse and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
