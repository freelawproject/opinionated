Striking the right balance is no easy task, especially in the context of an appellate legal landscape that is in flux and does not always set clear standards.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-10\">\n  \u00b62 Brandon Johnson's case is one where the trial court's efforts to impose appropriate community custody conditions unfortunately fail to meet the rigors of appellate scrutiny. Mr. Johnson has challenged five of his community custody conditions, imposed pursuant to his child molestation conviction. Four of the challenged conditions prohibit Mr. Johnson's access to images or media containing some form of sexual content. The fifth condition prohibits Mr. Johnson from being present at locations where children congregate. Mr. Johnson's challenges to the prohibitions on media access must be sustained as either overbroad or not crime related. The condition restricting Mr. Johnson's access to certain locations is affirmed, but warrants slight modification so as to define the word \"children\" to mean individuals under 16 years of age. We therefore remand for resentencing\n  as to Mr. Johnson's community custody conditions.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-11\">\n  FACTS\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-12\">\n  \u00b63 Mr. Johnson's criminal charges arose from conduct with his female adolescent cousin. Mr. Johnson had been living with his aunt and uncle (the cousin's parents) when his uncle discovered Mr. Johnson rummaging through his cousin's clothes. Later, Mr. Johnson asked his uncle for lotion to use for masturbation. Mr. Johnson's uncle subsequently found women's underwear in Mr. Johnson's room.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Around the same time as the discoveries by Mr. Johnson's uncle, the cousin reported to her mother that Mr. Johnson had twice snuck into her room after dark. Mr. Johnson's aunt subsequently caught Mr. Johnson sneaking into his cousin's room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Mr. Johnson's cousin subsequently informed her mother that Mr. Johnson had touched her breasts twice, her bottom once, and had attempted to kiss her. The cousin reported that Mr. Johnson frequently sought to talk to her about masturbation and about her breasts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 Mr. Johnson's aunt and uncle immediately reported Mr. Johnson's behavior to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 The State of Washington charged Brandon Johnson with second degree child molestation. During a bench trial, Mr. Johnson testified and denied any sexual contact with his cousin. The trial court convicted Mr. Johnson of second degree child molestation based on one of the two episodes described by his cousin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 The trial court sentenced Mr. Johnson to 18 months' confinement with an additional 36 months' community custody. The community custody conditions include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (14) Avoid places where children congregate to include, but not limited to: parks, libraries, playgrounds, schools, school yards, daycare centers, skating rinks, and video arcades.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (17) Do not possess or view material that includes images of nude women, men, and/or children.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (18) Do not possess or view material that includes images of children wearing only undergarments and/or swimsuits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (19) Do not possess or view material that shows women, men, and/or children engaging in sexual acts with each other, themselves, with an object, or animal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (20) Do not attend X-rated movies, peep shows, or adult book stores.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 41. Mr. Johnson did not object to any of the conditions during sentencing. The trial court entered no findings of fact that relate the community custody conditions to Mr. Johnson's crime of child molestation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b69 Mr. Johnson appeals the trial court's imposition of the aforementioned community custody conditions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He contends the trial court lacked statutory authority to enter conditions 17-20. He further contends that all challenged conditions (including condition 14) are unconstitutional. Although no objection was raised to the conditions during the superior court proceedings, Mr. Johnson's contentions are amenable to review for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v.

While Mr. Johnson was convicted of an offense against a minor and appears to have had an interest in undergarments and masturbation, there is no indication that Mr. Johnson was aroused by the type of nonerotic images described in conditions 17 and 18. At the same time, conditions 17 and 18 encompass broad swaths of materials with significant social value. For example, condition 17, prohibiting possession or viewing material that includes images of nude men, women, and/or children, would extend to medical text books, health-related internet sites, and most art museums. Condition 18, prohibiting possession or viewing material that includes images of children wearing only undergarments and/or swimsuits, would extend to countless advertisements for diapers and sunscreen that are depicted in newspapers and magazines. There is no indication that such a broad prohibition on constitutionally-protected materials is reasonably necessary for public order or safety.

Given these applicable definitions, condition 14 fairly instructs Mr. Johnson about what locations are prohibited. Under the terms of his community custody, Mr. Johnson must avoid locations where individuals under 16 collect together in groups. Outside of special circumstances (such as a children's day or event), universities, national parks, and adult areas of worship would not be covered.

The condition demands that Johnson \"[a]void places where children congregate to include, but not limited to: parks, libraries, playgrounds, schools, school yards, daycare centers, skating rinks, and video arcades.\" Clerk's Papers at 41. Since vagueness challenges focus on the precise language of the community custody condition, I note that condition 14 lists eight nonexclusive prohibited areas. Johnson could violate the community custody by entering other unlisted places where children congregate. Also, the sentencing court did not employ the phrase \"such as\" before listing the eight location examples. Thus, the court did not limit community custody condition 14 to locations similar in nature to the eight examples. Johnson could violate his conditions by entering an area disparate in character from the identified sites. I deem these observations controlling and would hold that community custody condition 14 lacks constitutional specificity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b623 The law demands that the legislature describe a crime in specific, not vague, language, so that citizens and law enforcement may comprehend the variety of human conduct that the legislature intends to proscribe, prevent, and punish.\n   <em>\n    City of Spokane v.

On appeal, the State conceded the unconstitutionality of the condition, so this court did not analyze the constitutionality in depth. This court relied on\n   <em>\n    State v.

The\n   <em>\n    Norris\n   </em>\n   decision mentioned that Samuel Irwin's community custody condition allowed the community custody officer discretion in determining the banned sites. In dicta, this court agreed with\n   <em>\n    Norris\n   </em>\n   that removing the language \"and or any places\" would right the community custody condition. Stated differently, this court approved of the language: \"Do not enter any parks/playgrounds/schools where minors congregate.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Norris\n   </em>\n   , 1 Wash.

Irwin\n   </em>\n   . Presumably the State's argument would extend to concerns also raised by this court in\n   <em>\n    State v. Magana\n   </em>\n   . I agree, in part. Johnson's community custody condition no longer delegates to an officer the prerogative of identifying outlawed sites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b633 I would still hold that Brandon Johnson's condition 14 suffers from imprecision. The condition precludes Johnson from visiting any place where minor children congregate. Johnson likely can ascertain what human beings constitute minor children, although an ordinary person might question whether the phrase \"minor children\" extends to all minors or only people below an age lower than eighteen. Nevertheless, the words \"place\" and \"congregate\" lack specificity. Condition 14 does not limit itself to an exclusive list of locations.\n   <em>\n    State v. Irwin\n   </em>\n   suggests that listing places survives constitutional challenge but included in the decision's suggestion lies the assumption that the prohibited locations be exhaustive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b634 I note the statutory construction principle of ejusdem generis, that a general term when used in conjunction with specific terms incorporates only those things similar to or comparable to the specific terms.\n   <em>\n    State v.

I decline to employ this principle to save condition 14 from constitutional defeat. No court has applied ejusdem generis to restrict the extent of a community custody condition. The ordinary person would encounter difficulty in discerning the extent to which locations parallel parks, libraries, playgrounds, schools, school yards, daycare centers, skating rinks, and video arcades.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b635 Brandon Johnson also argues that community custody condition 14 breaches his First Amendment rights. He contends that the condition violates his rights to the exercise of religion, since the condition precludes his attending worship services. He also maintains that the condition breaches his right to assembly. The majority does not address these contentions. I would remand the case for restructuring of condition 14, during which resentencing Johnson could again raise his First Amendment objections.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Mr. Johnson also initially challenged the trial court's failure to enter written findings of fact and conclusions of law following his bench trial.
