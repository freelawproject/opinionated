Traffic Stop and Vehicle Search\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b63] On September 6, 2016, at around 2:45 p.m., Deputy Derrick Colling of the Albany County Sheriff's Office was on patrol in Laramie, Wyoming. He was traveling south on 3rd Street when he observed an oncoming truck with a basketball-sized crack in the windshield, covering about a quarter of the passenger side, just to the right of center. Because Deputy Colling believed the crack obstructed the driver's view and was thus a traffic violation, he made a U-turn with the intention of stopping the truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b64] Before Deputy Colling activated his overhead lights, the truck turned left at Clark Street and onto a bridge over the railroad tracks. Deputy Colling waited through a red light at the intersection and then turned onto the bridge and saw the truck turn left off Clark Street onto Cedar Street. As Deputy Colling caught up to the truck, it signaled briefly and pulled abruptly to the right curb. Deputy Colling then activated his overhead lights and initiated a traffic stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b65] Deputy Colling approached the truck and asked for the driver's identification, and learned that he was Joshua Pier. Deputy Colling described his initial interactions and observations when he spoke to Mr. Pier.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Q. So what did you say to the-to Mr. Pier when you approached his vehicle?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A. Well, first off, before I ever said anything, he looked at me and he said, \"What's going on, man?\" very abruptly. After that, I told him the reason for the stop. I told him that I stopped him for-for having the broken windshield and for not signaling for 100 feet before pulling over.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Q. When you first spoke with Mr. Pier, did you notice anything about his demeanor?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A. Yes. He was extremely nervous.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Q. And how could you tell he was extremely nervous?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   A. His hands were visibly shaking. He was very, very erratic with his movement. He was very fidgety with his hands, fidgety with his legs. He had his leg kind of propped up, his right leg kind of propped up in a very awkward-in a very awkward manner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Q. Did you know-did you notice anything behind that leg?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A. Yes, I did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Q. What was that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A. I saw a-a black pouch. It was about the size of a fist and it was-it was kind of like a shaving kit looking sort of pouch. And it appeared to me that he was attempting to conceal that pouch behind his right leg.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Q. How did your interaction with Mr. Pier go on after you told him that you had-why you pulled him over?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   A. I asked him for his information, for his driver's license, registration, proof of insurance. He reached into his glove box and pulled out a large stack of papers, set those papers on his lap, and for-for several seconds, he shifted through those papers and I could-I could-I could see his hands shaking while he was sorting through the papers as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Q. And what happened after that? Was he able to find all of the documentation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   A. I know that he found his driver's license. I believe he found [the] registration. I'm not sure about insurance. But he handed me the documents and I went back to my vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b66] When Deputy Colling returned to his vehicle, he conducted a records check and found out Mr. Pier's license was valid and that he had no outstanding warrants or anything else of note. As he was completing the records check, he recalled information he had learned months earlier about Mr. Pier.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A. Well, after seeing-after seeing his name, I realized that this was an individual that had some previous history and-and I had heard previous-I had heard information about his previous history being drug convictions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Q. Where did you hear about this information?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   A. From other deputies in the sheriff's office.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Q. When were you talking to the other deputies about Mr. Pier?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   A. It was a few months prior.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Q. What did you learn specifically about Mr. Pier?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A. Specifically, I learned that he had prior drug convictions for distributing methamphetamine. I learned that he had served time in the Wyoming state prison and was a very prolific gang member in the prison. I also learned that he was out of prison and was suspected of currently selling drugs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Q. And to be clear, those were just suspicions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   A. That's correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Q. Did you personally do any investigating of Mr. Pier prior to this day?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   A. I had a citizen source that I spoke with a few months prior to the stop as well, and this person told me that Mr. Pier was also actively selling drugs in Albany County.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   [\u00b67] Deputy Colling began preparing a citation for the cracked windshield, and because he needed Mr. Pier's contact information to complete it, he returned to Mr. Pier's vehicle. On his return, Deputy Colling saw that the black pouch that had been behind Mr. Pier's right leg was no longer there, which further raised his suspicions.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Q. What was suspicious to you about this black bag?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   A. Well, I've been in this line of work for 12 years and I've seen thousands of drug cases. It's very common that people who carry drugs, use drugs, sell drugs, possess drugs in sort of fashion use a small-a small kind of pouch, and it's their-it's their drug kit, so to speak.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Q. Was that your suspicion on that day?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A. Yes, it was.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Q. Okay. Was it buoyed by the fact of your prior knowledge of Mr. Pier's past?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   [\u00b68] Deputy Colling proceeded to ask Mr. Pier for his contact information so he could complete the citation. He \"really stuttered over his words\" when he gave Deputy Colling his address and then inverted the numbers when he repeated his address. He did the same thing with his telephone number, which caused Deputy Colling to believe that he was trying to conceal where he lived. Deputy Colling then asked Mr. Pier where he was coming from and where he was headed. His responses caught Deputy Colling's attention because his destination was a mile or more away from where he pulled over. Deputy Colling then asked Mr. Pier why he had pulled over on Cedar Street. He stated that he stopped in front of the house to see a friend or someone who lived there, but when Deputy Colling asked who lived in the house, he could not provide a name and just stated, \"I don't know.\" Deputy Colling then asked Mr. Pier if he had any weapons in the vehicle, to which he responded that he had some knives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   [\u00b69] After this second contact, Deputy Colling decided to detain Mr. Pier and request that a K-9 unit be dispatched to his location. He explained his decision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Q. And why did you have Mr. Pier step out of the vehicle?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   A. Well, it was really the totality of the circumstances. He-he pulled over very abruptly without being signaled. His intent look into the mirror. His-without me even talking to him, he asked me what was going on and continually asked me what was going on during the stop. He was very paranoid, very fidgety with his hands, shaking like a leaf, so to speak. It appeared he was trying to conceal that black bag initially with his leg, and then the second time I approached him, the black bag was gone. He had prior convictions for-for drug-for drugs, and I had prior information that he was actively selling drugs. It was just a very, very, very strange situation. He had lied about his-about his address, about his phone number, and didn't really have a legitimate reason for stopping where he was. So it was just a very strange thing. I thought there was some kind of crime afoot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   [\u00b610] When Mr. Pier exited his vehicle, he left his door open and Deputy Colling was able to see that the black pouch had been tucked underneath the truck's center console. Deputy Colling directed Mr. Pier toward the front of his patrol vehicle, conducted a pat-down\n   of his person, and then called for a K-9 unit. Deputy Colling described what occurred during the time they waited for the K-9 unit.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Q. * * * Particularly what happened while you were waiting with Mr. Pier for the K9 unit to get there?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   A. When Mr. Pier opened his door, when I asked him to exit the vehicle, he left his door open. And that would be the driver side door of his [pickup] truck. I directed him back to the front of my vehicle and again, like I said, conducted the pat down. During those several minutes that we were waiting for the-for the dog to come, Mr. Pier became very angry that his door was open and he ordered me to shut his door. I told him that I was not going to shut his door.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   I also walked towards his vehicle and Mr. Pier again became very angry. He told me that I didn't have permission to search his vehicle, and I told him I wasn't going to search his vehicle, and Mr. Pier started walking towards me, just kind of bowing out his arms, puffing out his chest, like he wanted to fight and again ordered me to shut the door. I told him I wasn't going to shut the door and I wasn't going to let him anywhere near the vehicle. Based on his actions and the fact that there were knives in the vehicle, I wasn't going to let him touch his vehicle nor shut his door.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   [\u00b611] A Wyoming Highway Patrol K-9 unit reported to the scene about fifteen to twenty minutes after Deputy Colling called in his request. Trooper Aaron Kirlin was the handler and his K-9 was Frosty, a springer spaniel. Trooper Kirlin had Frosty on a leash approximately ten feet long, and began Frosty's exterior sniff at the back driver's side of Mr. Pier's truck. Deputy Colling described Frosty's actions during the exterior sniff.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Q. And how exactly did that go?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   A. He led his dog around from the-from the driver's side, so he started at the back, the back driver's side of the truck. He led his dog towards the front of the vehicle. I saw Trooper Kirlin walk past the open door and directed [sic] Frosty towards the front quarter panel of the vehicle in front of the open door. Frosty stopped by the driver's side door that was already open. I saw Frosty sniff in the air and then Frosty jumped into the vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   I'm not a K9 handler, but it appeared that Frosty stuck his nose right by that black bag and kind of stiffened up. Trooper Kirlin told me later that Frosty had alerted to the odor of a controlled substance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   [\u00b612] Based on Frosty's alert, Deputy Colling determined he had probable cause to believe controlled substances would be found in Mr. Pier's vehicle, and he searched it. He found approximately three grams of marijuana in plant form in the black pouch under the truck's center console. In another black pouch, Deputy Colling found fifty anabolic steroid tablets with a total weight of approximately five grams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Proceedings Below\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   [\u00b613] On September 8, 2016, the State filed an information charging Mr. Pier with felony possession of marijuana, third or subsequent offense, and felony possession of anabolic steroids. Mr. Pier was arraigned and pled not guilty to the charges, and on December 19, 2016, he filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained in the search of his vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   [\u00b614] On March 30, 2017, the district court held a hearing on Mr. Pier's motion to suppress. Noting that the State bore the burden of proving the legality of the search, the court directed the State to put on its evidence first. The State offered the testimony of only one witness, Deputy Colling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court then heard argument on the motion and took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   [\u00b615] On April 3, 2017, the district court issued an order denying Mr. Pier's motion to suppress. The court found that Frosty's leap into the vehicle during his exterior sniff was spontaneous and not in response to a command or encouragement by Trooper Kirlin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The court also found that because it was Mr. Pier, and not Trooper Kirlin, who opened and left open the vehicle's door, Trooper Kirlin did not facilitate Frosty's entry into the vehicle. For these reasons, the court concluded Frosty's alert did not violate the Fourth Amendment and provided probable cause for Deputy Colling's search. The court further concluded that even in the absence of Frosty's alert, Deputy Colling had probable cause to search the vehicle. It reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Additional probable cause came from the culmination of the information known to Deputy Colling at the time he asked Mr. Pier to exit the vehicle combined with Mr. Pier's extreme and aggressive dealings with Deputy Colling while awaiting the arrival of the K-9 unit. Mr. Pier was insistent, to the point of near-violence, on closing his vehicle door and not allowing Deputy Colling near the vehicle. The Court places no emphasis on Mr. Pier's constitutional right to deny a search, or even his desire to have his vehicle closed. However, Mr. Pier's extreme reactions are noteworthy and, under a totality of the circumstances, justified a search of the vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   [\u00b616] The State and Mr. Pier reached a plea agreement. In exchange for the State's agreement to dismiss the felony marijuana possession charge and make a sentencing recommendation, Mr. Pier agreed to plead guilty to felony steroid possession, subject to his right to appeal the district court's suppression ruling. On May 31, 2017, the district court issued its order accepting Mr. Pier's conditional guilty plea, and on that same date the court entered its judgment, which sentenced Mr. Pier to the State-recommended prison term of eighteen to twenty-four months. Mr. Pier filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   [\u00b617] When a defendant challenges a warrantless search, the State bears the burden of proving the legality of the search.\n   <em>\n    Pena v.

The third sentence informed the district court that additional authority would be presented at the suppression hearing. During the suppression hearing itself, Mr. Pier presented only two arguments: that Frosty's vehicle entry was illegal and that without Frosty's alert, Deputy Colling did not have probable cause to search his vehicle. Mr. Pier did not offer a separate state constitutional analysis, and he did not challenge the traffic stop or Deputy Colling's grounds for extending the traffic stop. Because Mr. Pier failed to present the district court with his arguments about probable cause for the stop or reasonable suspicion to continue his detention, we decline to consider those claims here. Similarly, we decline to consider Mr. Pier's argument about the Wyoming Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    Independent Probable Cause to Search\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   [\u00b621] The district court found that (1) the K-9's entry into Mr. Pier's car was not facilitated by law enforcement but was spontaneous, and (2) even without the K-9's actions Deputy Colling's search of the car was supported by probable cause.

The district court based its probable cause determination on the factors it found supported Deputy Colling's reasonable suspicion to detain Mr. Pier, combined with the additional factor of Mr. Pier's belligerent and aggressive behavior in objecting to a search of his vehicle. The court summarized its findings in paragraphs 35, 36, and 46 of its decision.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   35. At the time Deputy Colling made the decision to extend the traffic stop, the entirety of his actual observations were as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   a. Mr. Pier immediately had turned and pulled over his car, seemingly upon observing Deputy Colling's patrol vehicle, for no other apparent reason;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   b.

Mr. Pier was propping up his right leg as if trying to conceal the black pouch;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   f.

Mr. Pier was stopped nowhere near his professed destination; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   i. Mr. Pier told Deputy Colling he knew the person who lived at the home he was parked in front of and later told Deputy Colling he did not know who lived at the home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   36. In addition to these observations, Deputy Colling also had knowledge of Mr. Pier's prior criminal convictions for illegal controlled substances and gang association in prison from other law enforcement officers.

Additional probable cause came from the culmination of the information known to Deputy Colling at the time he asked Mr. Pier to exit the vehicle combined with Mr. Pier's extreme and aggressive dealings with Deputy Colling while awaiting the arrival of the K-9 unit. Mr. Pier was insistent, to the point of near-violence, on closing his vehicle door and not allowing Deputy Colling near the vehicle. The Court places no emphasis on Mr. Pier's constitutional right to deny a search, or even his desire to have his vehicle door closed. However, Mr. Pier's extreme reactions are noteworthy and, under a totality of the circumstances, justified a search of the vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   [\u00b633] In my view, the district court elevated reasonable suspicion to probable cause without a sufficient basis to do so.

Lastly, at trial, Selby recounted that before entering defendant's vehicle, he looked inside and saw a \"white\" napkin lying on the floorboard, and that otherwise the vehicle was very clean and \"free of any other debris or trash.\" We find the totality of the evidence easily supports that the officers had probable cause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313263\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/842/330/\">\n    842 So.2d at 336-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted and emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

At this time, the officer had no reason to suspect that defendant had committed any other offense. When the defendant stopped his auto, he walked 'abruptly' back to the police car, and he appeared to be nervous according to the officer's testimony. On the officer's request, the defendant readily presented his operator's license. He reentered his vehicle and began to search in the glove compartment for the vehicle registration when the officer requested it. In the course of this search, defendant removed from the glove compartment a leather pouch and placed it behind him. The officer also observed in the glove compartment a brown wooden pipe which the defendant surrendered to the officer on request. The defendant twice refused to surrender the leather pouch to the officer who thereupon seized and searched it. It contained a single white pill, which later proved to be an amphetamine. Following this discovery, the officer radioed for assistance, and was shortly joined by a detective. The defendant was arrested, and thereafter a thorough search of the vehicle was conducted. It revealed a single marijuana cigarette, and a brown paper bag containing LSD tablets.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   <em>\n    Goessl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4590537\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/colo/186/208/\">\n    526 P.2d at 664-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   [\u00b655] The Colorado Supreme Court rejected the state's argument that the pouch combined with the defendant's furtive actions gave the officer probable cause to search the defendant's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-179\">\n   The People further contend that the wooden pipe and leather pouch which were seen by the officer are sufficient to establish probable cause for the search. But neither the pipe, nor the pouch, are contraband. The fact that both items could be used in an unlawful manner does not negate the fact that the normal use of either item is lawful.

It may be that the State can make the required showing that a drug dog acted instinctively with other qualified evidence. In this case, however, Deputy Colling was by his own admission unable to interpret either Frosty's or Trooper Kirlin's actions, and the State offered no other evidence to aid in that\n   interpretation. Additionally, while this Court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, this does not give the Court leeway to interpret the actions of Trooper Kirlin and Frosty. The record does not tell us how Frosty was trained to respond to open vehicles, Frosty's past experience with open vehicles, how Trooper Kirlin handled Frosty on the leash, or the cues, if any, Trooper Kirlin may have given Frosty. Without that information, any meaning this Court may attach to the actions of Trooper Kirlin and Frosty would go beyond drawing favorable inferences from the evidence and amount to no more than speculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   [\u00b682] Based on the lack of evidence explaining or interpreting the actions of Trooper Kirlin and Frosty, I would conclude that the district court clearly erred when it found the State had met its burden of proving the legality of Frosty's vehicle entry. I therefore dissent, and I would suppress the drugs seized during the search.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-257\">\n    The record does not indicate whether the State intended to present the testimony of Trooper Kirlin. After Deputy Colling testified, the prosecutor requested and was granted a five-minute recess to contact someone.

The Third Circuit stated:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-265\">\n    In our view, McLaughlin's efforts to reach the bag during his arrest as well as the fact that officers could see cash inside the bag in plain view supplied them with probable cause to believe they would find evidence of drug transactions in the bag or vehicle.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-266\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 149.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-267\">\n    <em>\n     McLaughlin\n    </em>\n    differs from the case before us in a couple of respects. First, the incriminating nature of the cash was immediately apparent to the officers, whereas the pouch in this case did not have distinctive characteristics that would make its incriminating nature immediately apparent. Additionally,\n    <em>\n     McLaughlin\n    </em>\n    addressed a search warrant, not a warrantless search. This is significant because different presumptions attach to warrantless searches and those conducted pursuant to a warrant.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Owens v.

As one commentator has observed:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-268\">\n    The United States Supreme Court has expressed a strong preference for the making of searches and seizures pursuant to search warrant, even to the point of declaring that \"in a doubtful or marginal case [of probable cause] a search under a warrant may be sustainable where without one it would fail.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-269\">\n    2 LaFave,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , \u00a7 4.1 (footnote omitted) (quoting\n    <em>\n     United States v.

In that case, an officer observed baggies and a scale with white powder on it that were left in the vehicle in plain view, and the officer testified that in his experience when these items are in a vehicle, they are indicative of narcotics trafficking.\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Again, the incriminating nature of the scale and baggies was immediately apparent, distinguishing\n    <em>\n     Hicks\n    </em>\n    from the case before us.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-271\">\n    <em>\n     West\n    </em>\n    also involved a significant distinguishing factor: the officer knew the odor of methamphetamine and he detected that odor.\n    <em>\n     United States v.

In upholding the search, the Tenth Circuit considered all the circumstances, but it also observed, \"An officer's detection of the smell of drugs, such as methamphetamine, in a car is entitled to substantial weight in the probable cause analysis and can be an independently sufficient basis for probable cause.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1178. I agree. Had Deputy Colling detected the scent of drugs, this case no doubt would have gone the way of\n    <em>\n     West\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Phippen\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 15,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6971546\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/297/104/\">\n     297 P.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    109 (citing\n    <em>\n     McKenney\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6\u00b6 9-10,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8347216\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/165/96/\">\n     165 P.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    98 ) (\"[T]he odor of contraband, standing alone, can supply probable cause.\"). Unfortunately, that did not happen, and\n    <em>\n     West\n    </em>\n    is therefore distinguishable.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-272\">\n    Mr. Pier's arguments pertain to the period when he was detained away from his vehicle.

The drug dog entered Pier's truck through a door he left open, and both officers testified that they did not encourage the dog to enter the car. Did the district court clearly err in finding that the dog's entry and sniff of the car was spontaneous?\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-277\">\n    As I have indicated, both officers did not testify. Only Deputy Colling testified, and he provided no testimony on the question of whether Frosty was encouraged to enter the vehicle. Additionally, the State asserted in its briefing that \"[t]he evidence in the record shows that Frosty does not make a habit of bursting into vehicles.\" In making this assertion, the State provided a record cite that was to the district court's suppression order. The order is not evidence, and, in any event, the order itself contained no such finding. I urge counsel to use caution when making assertions of fact and to ensure that those assertions accurately reflect the record evidence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
