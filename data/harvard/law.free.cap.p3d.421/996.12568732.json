We consider the insurance policy as a whole, giving the policy a fair, reasonable, and sensible construction as would be given to the contract by the average\n   person purchasing insurance. Where possible, we harmonize provisions of the contract that appear to be in conflict to give effect to all of the contract's provisions. But we avoid a literal, strained or forced interpretation which could lead to absurd results. In this case, Lazuri Daniels purchased an automobile insurance policy from State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm). Under the terms of the policy, State Farm has the right to recover payments it is obligated to make, but it may only exercise that right after Daniels has been fully compensated for damage or loss. The policy also provides that Daniels pay a deductible to cover the first $500 of the loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 When Daniels' vehicle was damaged in a collision, she paid the deductible and State Farm paid the remaining amount of the cost to repair her car. When State Farm recovered 70 percent of the amount it paid for the repair from the tortfeasor's insurance company, it also recovered 70 percent of Daniels' deductible payment and paid it to her. Daniels contends State Farm violated the policy because it did not pay her the full amount of the deductible. She claims that before State Farm could exercise its right to recover the payments it made, the policy requires that she be \"fully compensated\" for her loss which she argues includes the full amount of the deductible. State Farm contends that it satisfied the policy's terms because Daniels was fully compensated when it paid the cost to repair her car. It disputes that, as that term is used in the policy, \"fully compensated\" includes Daniels' deductible. The trial court agreed with State Farm and dismissed Daniels' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 We hold that State Farm fully compensated Daniels for her loss when it paid for the repairs of the car and properly exercised its right to recover that payment. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Lazuri Daniels' car was damaged in a three car accident. State Farm insured her vehicle for collision coverage with a $500 deductible. Daniels paid the deductible and State Farm paid the remaining cost to repair the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 In subrogation, State Farm sought payment for the repairs from Geico, which insured one of the other drivers. Attributing 70 percent fault to its client, Geico agreed to pay 70 percent of the cost to repair Daniels' car. Pursuant to insurance regulation, State Farm also sought reimbursement for Daniels' deductible. It returned $350, or 70 percent, of her deductible to Daniels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 Daniels filed a complaint asserting that State Farm violated the insurance policy by failing to fully reimburse her deductible with funds obtained in its subrogation effort against Geico. She pleaded claims for breach of contract, tort of bad faith, and conversion, and she requested class action certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 State Farm moved to dismiss the complaint. Meanwhile, not satisfied with the reimbursement amount from Geico, State Farm sought arbitration. The arbitrator determined that Geico's client was 100 percent at fault for the accident. State Farm recovered and gave Daniels the remaining $150 of her deductible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 The trial court granted State Farm's motion to dismiss.

(Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 13 Daniels contends that the policy unambiguously conditions State Farm's right to recover its payments on Daniel's full compensation for her property loss, including her full deductible. Daniels argues that in the absence of a conflicting policy definition, the term \"loss\" can only mean \"the total amount of the insured's damages.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant's Reply Br. at 7. Thus, she contends that State Farm has no right to subrogation until she receives full compensation for the total amount of her loss, which would include that part of the loss covered by her deductible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 14 State Farm argues that \"fully compensated\" means payment of the insured's property loss less the deductible. And, because it paid this amount, State Farm contends that under the policy, it is entitled to subrogation of her claims. We agree with State Farm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 15 Daniels reading of the insurance contract is flawed in a number of respects. First, Daniels asserts that under the contract, State Farm has no right to seek recovery at all, unless and until its insured obtains a full refund of his or her deductible. \"Whatever rights State Farm may have to recover its payments, it does not have those rights until after its insured has been fully compensated for the loss.\" Br. of Appellant at 15. And to the extent State Farm has a right to seek recovery, it \"has no such rights until its insured receives full compensation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. But reading the contract to preclude State Farm's subrogation unless Daniels first obtains a full refund of her deductible leads to absurd results. Under Daniels reading of the contract, before State Farm could assert a subrogation claim against a third party, one of two things would have to occur. First, State Farm would have to refund the deductible that Daniels paid, which would make the provision requiring the payment of the deductible\n   meaningless. Or, second, Daniels would have to obtain reimbursement from the third party on her own. And if she failed to do so for any reason, or simply chose not to, State Farm would be barred from seeking recovery of the payments it made from the responsible third party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 16 In addition, Daniels' reading of the contract is inconsistent with WAC 284-30-393, which places the burden of pursuing a refund of the insured's deductible on the insurer. Under that regulation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The insurer must include the insured's deductible, if any, in its subrogation demands. Any recoveries must be allocated first to the insured for any deductible(s) incurred in the loss, less applicable comparable fault. Deductions for expenses must not be made from the deductible recovery unless an outside attorney is retained to collect the recovery. The deduction may then be made only as a pro rata share of the allocated loss adjustment expense....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The regulation recognizes that insureds often lack the resources or incentive to pursue recovery of what is very often a small amount of money. It therefore places the burden of collecting the refund on the insurer. But the regulation assumes that the insurer's ability to proceed with a subrogation claim precedes a refund of the deductible to the insured. Daniels reading of the contract does just the opposite. The logical result of her interpretation is that State Farm is either precluded from subrogating its claim and thus its ability to obtain a refund of Daniels' deductible or Daniels would have to seek the refund on her own. In either event, the purpose of the regulation would be frustrated. State Farm either was or was not entitled to exercise a subrogation right. If it was, then by Daniels' own definition, she was \"fully compensated.\" If it wasn't, then the issue isn't how State Farm allocated the funds it received, but instead that it was subrogating its claim at all. Daniels can't have it both ways.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 17 We conclude that the only reasonable interpretation of the term \"fully compensated\" as used in the insurance contract at issue in this case, does not include the amount of deductible paid by the insured. The trial court did not err in dismissing Daniels' complaint on this ground.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 18 Daniels also argues that she stated a claim for recovery under WAC 284-30-393, which requires that a subrogating insurer also seek recovery of the insured's deductible, less applicable fault. Daniels argues that State Farm violated this provision by not reimbursing her full deductible because it was later determined by an arbitrator that she was not at fault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 19 State Farm complied with WAC 284-30-393. It included Daniels' deductible with its subrogation demand and originally reimbursed her 70 percent based on Geico's initial determination that its insured was 70 percent at fault. It then fully reimbursed her when an arbitrator concluded that she was not at fault. Daniels relies on hindsight to argue that, because she was ultimately found not at fault, she should have been originally reimbursed her full deductible. But State Farm's incremental implementation of WAC 284-30-393 was reasonable and complied with the plain language of the regulation. In addition, because Daniels did not plead lack of fault in her complaint, the record does not support\n   her argument that she had no \"applicable comparable fault\" at the time she was first reimbursed her deductible. The trial court did not err in finding that there was no violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Amendment of Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 20 Daniels argues that the trial court erred by denying her request that she be granted leave to amend her complaint \"to address any deficiencies found by the trial court.\" Br. of Appellant at 27-28.

Respondent State Farm relies on\n   <em>\n    Averill\n   </em>\n   as the primary basis for affirming the\n   trial court's dismissal of Daniels' complaint for failure to state a claim. Daniels maintains that\n   <em>\n    Averill\n   </em>\n   was wrongly decided, but argues in the alternative that she is entitled to relief under the policy language even if the common law made whole doctrine does not apply. The majority focuses exclusively on the contract language and does not address\n   <em>\n    Averill\n   </em>\n   except to say in a footnote that it is inapposite because the contract language at issue in that case was different from the language in Daniels' policy.

But first, I must disagree that the case can be decided in favor of State Farm without discussing\n   <em>\n    Averill\n   </em>\n   . Because Daniels has squarely presented the argument that the made whole doctrine applies to the recovery of deductibles notwithstanding\n   <em>\n    Averill\n   </em>\n   , we cannot ignore it.

I would hold that the made whole doctrine applies, that\n   <em>\n    Averill\n   </em>\n   is inconsistent with Washington case law on subrogation and reimbursement, and that the subrogation provision in the State Farm policy incorporates the made whole rule of\n   <em>\n    Thiringer\n   </em>\n   . The order of dismissal should be reversed, and Daniels should be allowed to proceed with her lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 28 The broad issue, as presented by Professor Robert Keeton, is, \"After an insurer has paid to an insured the benefits specified in the insurance contract, what are the interests of the insurer and the insured in the insured's claim against a third party allegedly responsible for the loss?\" ROBERT E. KEETON, BASIC TEXT ON INSURANCE LAW \u00a7 3.10(c)(2), at 160 (1971). Keeton summarizes five theoretical approaches to the problem of allocating proceeds of a recovery from a third-party tortfeasor. They range from a rule that entitles the insurer to the full amount recovered on the theory that the insurer is the sole beneficial owner of the claim against the third party, to the opposite rule that rejects subrogation and entitles the insured to the full amount recovered whether or not the total received from the third party and the insurer exceeds the insured's loss.\n   <em>\n    Keeton\n   </em>\n   , at 161-62. In the middle, Keeton's \"Third Rule\" is a proration approach, whereby the recovery from the third person \"is to be prorated between the insurer and the insured in accordance with the percentage of the original loss for which the insurer paid the insured under the policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Keeton\n   </em>\n   , at 161.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 29 Professor Keeton's \"Fourth Rule\" is, \"Out of the recovery from the third party the insured is to be reimbursed first, for the loss not covered by insurance, and the insurer is entitled to any remaining balance, up to a sum sufficient to reimburse the insurer fully, the insured being entitled to anything beyond that.\"\n   <em>\n    Keeton\n   </em>\n   , at 161. This approach, followed by most courts, is termed the \"Insured: Whole\" rule in Elaine M. Rinaldi,\n   <em>\n    Apportionment of Recovery Between Insured and Insurer in a Subrogation Case\n   </em>\n   , 29 TORT &amp; INS. L.J. 803, 805-06 (1994). The Rinaldi article recognizes Washington as an \"insured-whole\" state that follows Keeton's Fourth Rule, citing\n   <em>\n    Thiringer\n   </em>\n   as the basis for this classification. 29 TORT &amp; INS.

The insurer argued that the proceeds \"should be allocated first to the special damages covered by the PIP provision or, in the alternative, prorated between the general damages and the PIP damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Thiringer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1101850\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/91/215/\">\n    91 Wash.2d at 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=588%20P.2d%20191\">\n    588 P.2d 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court rejected this argument and held that the insurer was not entitled to reimbursement until the insured had been made whole. \"While an insurer is entitled to be reimbursed to the extent that its insured recovers payment for the same loss from a tort-feasor responsible for the damage, it can recover only the excess which the insured has received ... after the insured is fully compensated for his loss.\"\n   <em>\n    Thiringer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1101850\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/91/215/\">\n    91 Wash.2d at 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=588%20P.2d%20191\">\n    588 P.2d 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Covering losses is what insurance companies do and the collection of premiums is what enables them to do it. State Farm received a premium from Daniels to assume the risk that someone else's car would collide with hers and cause more than $500 worth of damage. In this particular case, the risk materialized, and State Farm had to make a payout to Daniels for the cost of repair less the deductible. But this payout was not a loss to State Farm, it was the cost of doing business. Daniels suffered a loss, while State Farm incurred a business expense. State Farm was able to establish that a tortfeasor was liable for 70 percent of Daniels' loss, and as a result, State Farm was able to obtain for itself an amount equivalent to 70 percent of the payout. Receipt of this amount by State Farm was over and above the coverage premium it had already received\n   from Daniels. Just as in the\n   <em>\n    Thiringer\n   </em>\n   context, it is equitable that the first dollars received from the tortfeasor be given to Daniels, who is the actual victim of the tort.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 54 The general purpose of subrogation is to facilitate placement of the financial consequences of loss on the party primarily responsible in law for such loss.\n   <em>\n    Mahler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"812868\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/135/398/#p413\">\n    135 Wash.2d at 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=957%20P.2d%20632\">\n    957 P.2d 632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=966%20P.2d%20305\">\n    966 P.2d 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

So it is not surprising that State Farm uses moralistic terms like \"penalizing\" and \"rewarded\" to justify its position. But State Farm's argument constructs a false moral and equitable equivalency between the respective positions of insurer and insured. It is the insured who suffered a loss. The insurer received payment from the insured to cover the loss. If the loss was caused by a third-party tortfeasor, and the insurer is able by its own efforts to shift its cost of covering that loss to the tortfeasor, the insurer has acted in its own interest and is not entitled to be rewarded for doing so. The obligation to first make the victim whole does not penalize State Farm for subrogating; it embodies the \"socially desirable\" policy of fostering \"the adequate indemnification of innocent automobile accident victims.\"\n   <em>\n    Thiringer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1101850\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/91/215/\">\n    91 Wash.2d at 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=588%20P.2d%20191\">\n    588 P.2d 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b6 56 To the extent an insurer has to make extraordinary efforts to achieve recovery from the tortfeasor, there might be an equitable argument for cost sharing, similar to\n   <em>\n    Mahler\n   </em>\n   's requirement that insureds and insurer share the expenses necessary to secure recoveries of personal injury protection benefits from tortfeasors. But this is a different question than whether it is good or bad policy to make a victim whole. As for cost sharing, the insurance commissioner's regulation already allows insurers to make a deduction from a deductible recovery for the expense of collecting it but only if an outside attorney is retained to collect the recovery and only as a pro rata share of \"the allocated loss adjustment expense.\" WAC 284-30-393.

We do not have the cover page, the definitions page, or any other part of the policy. We do not know the amount of Daniels' original loss or the amount of State Farm's subrogation recovery. We do not know how State Farm achieved its recovery from the tortfeasor, whether doing so required extraordinary efforts, or whether Daniels did anything to impair these efforts. We do not know if State Farm proceeded according to a uniform practice. We do not know whether State Farm's practice differs from the practices of other insurers. We do not know if State Farm or other insurers would handle a large deductible differently than a $500 deductible.

The facts of the\n   <em>\n    Winkelmann\n   </em>\n   case, where the insurer and insured jointly sued the tortfeasor and there was an issue of delay, furnish an example of a nuance that might call for a more flexible rule.

They claim Daniels is taking the untenable and easily defeated position that State Farm must return the full deductible to her\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   asserting a subrogation claim against a third-party tortfeasor or wait until she recovers it for herself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is a straw man argument. Daniels' position is that State Farm had to reimburse her for the full deductible\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   obtaining any recovery from assertion of a subrogation claim. She states, \"Reading the plain language of the policy as written, Daniels was entitled to get the rest of her loss taken care of before State Farm could keep any third party money for itself.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Daniels, the record \"indisputably establishes that State Farm kept money it received from Geico-money that should have gone to Daniels.''\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b6 68 At oral argument before the trial court, State Farm correctly stated Daniels' position. State Farm informed the court that after paying out on the property damage coverage, it filed an arbitration demand against the insurance carriers for the other two drivers involved in the accident. State Farm included Daniels' deductible in the claim. One insurer paid 70 percent of the repair costs representing what it agreed was its insured percentage of fault. State Farm gave Daniels $350, or 70 percent of her deductible. Daniels sued at this point, claiming that she should have received 100 percent of her deductible from this initial recovery. State Farm correctly told the trial court that Daniels was claiming \"that we should have paid her a 100 percent of her deductible out of our recovery of our subrogation right before we kept any of that subrogation right. That's the basis of this lawsuit.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   And this is exactly what Daniels claims on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 69 Because the majority's analysis sets off on the wrong foot, it lands in the wrong place. It is unfair to Daniels to recast her argument as a claim that she must receive a refund of the deductible\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   State Farm is permitted to exercise its right to subrogation. Daniels straightforwardly defines the issue in terms of how State Farm allocated the funds it had already received in subrogation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 70 Under the contract, State Farm's \"right to recover\" its payments from funds received in subrogation \"applies only after the\n   <strong>\n    insured\n   </strong>\n   has been fully compensated\" for the loss. Courts construe insurance policies as a whole, giving them a fair, reasonable, and sensible construction. Insurance policies are construed liberally, in order to provide coverage whenever possible. Terms that are defined within a policy should be interpreted in accordance with the policy definition. An undefined term is interpreted according to its ordinary meaning, unless there is a legal, technical meaning that both parties clearly intended to apply.

And even with\n   <em>\n    Averill\n   </em>\n   , there is no other basis in statute or case law for the reduction of an insured's recovery of a deductible by \"applicable comparable fault.\" By statute, the basis for contribution among liable persons is the \"comparative fault\" of each person, not comparable fault. RCW 4.22.040(1). But assuming these two terms mean the same thing,\n   <em>\n    Sherry\n   </em>\n   has already held that full recovery under the made whole principle is not limited to the nonnegligent.\n   <em>\n    Sherry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3630901\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/160/611/#p618\">\n    160 Wash.2d at 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20P.3d%2031\">\n    160 P.3d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Rather, our opinions suggest insureds are not fully compensated until they have recovered all of their damages as a result of a motor vehicle accident.\"\n   <em>\n    Sherry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3630901\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/160/611/#p618\">\n    160 Wash.2d at 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20P.3d%2031\">\n    160 P.3d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b6 76 And even if the insurance regulation could lawfully authorize reduction for comparative fault, it does not apply in this case because there is no evidence that Daniels was at fault. State Farm contends the phrase \"applicable comparable fault\" is not limited to the fault of the insured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   But it is a stretch to imagine that it means anything else, considering that the amendment was adopted in response to Farmers' petition that referred specifically to \"an insured's comparative fault.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b6 77\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   's discussion of the regulation reinforces the impression that its analysis is driven by the desire to justify an existing practice of returning the deductible to its insured after reducing it by the percentage of State Farm's own payment that it was able to recover. In this case, State Farm recovered 70 percent, so State Farm deemed it fair to return only 70 percent of her deductible to Daniels-even though Daniels was free of fault.\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   has not presented a sound theoretical basis for this result. It somewhat resembles Professor Keeton's Third Rule: \"The recovery from the third person is to be prorated between the insurer and the insured in accordance with the percentage of the original loss for which the insurer paid the insured under the policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Keeton\n   </em>\n   , at 161. But it is not the same, because in the\n   <em>\n    Keeton\n   </em>\n   formulation, the variable is the percentage of original loss, not the amount of the recovery from the tortfeasor or the tortfeasor's percentage of comparative fault. And as Keeton reports, the typical application of the Third Rule is found not in contested cases, but rather as \"the result achieved by compromise settlement between the insured and insurer, whether or not it is consistent with the legally enforceable rule of allocation.\"\n   <em>\n    Keeton\n   </em>\n   , at 163-64. With respect to the legally enforceable rule of allocation, as previously noted, Washington-like most jurisdictions-is in the camp of Keeton's Fourth Rule, the made whole rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   7.\n   <em>\n    Attorney fees should abide the result\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b6 78 Daniels requests an award of attorney fees under the rule of\n   <em>\n    Olympic Steamship Co. v.
