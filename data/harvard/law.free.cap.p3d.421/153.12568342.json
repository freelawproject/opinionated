The court ruled that the prosecutor forfeited those three strikes and restored the three jurors to the venire. Urrea moved\n   for a mistrial and dismissal of the entire venire.

Where, as here, the strikes,\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenges, and trial court ruling occurred outside the jurors' presence, restoring the wrongfully excluded jurors to the venire is the preferable remedy.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Parker,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9987625\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/836/930/#p936\">\n    836 S.W.2d at 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting restoration \"better protects the equal protection rights of defendants and venirepersons and facilitates the efficient administration of justice\").

The California Supreme Court observed in\n   <em>\n    People v.

Restoring the improperly excluded jurors is also the only remedy that vindicates the rights of jurors to serve free from discrimination, and it advances the right of crime victims to a speedy trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2.1 (10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 16 Like the court of appeals, we do not adopt a bright-line rule that trial courts must follow in fashioning\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   remedies. As the Supreme Court has recognized, the trial court plays a \"pivotal role\" in the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   process,\n   <em>\n    Snyder v. Louisiana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675742\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/472/#p477\">\n    552 U.S. 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 477,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675742\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/472/#p477\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675742\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/472/#p477\">\n    170 L.Ed.2d 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008), and it is in the best position not only to evaluate the claims but also to assess the most appropriate remedy under the circumstances. For that reason, a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard is appropriate in reviewing such remedies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3477130\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/490/1282/#p1294\">\n    490 F.3d at 1294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 17 Nor do we construe\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   to forbid different or additional remedies. Given that a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   violation is, by definition, the conscious exclusion of a potential juror based on impermissible criteria,\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4054007\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/224/1/\">\n    224 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   10 \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4054007\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/224/1/\">\n    226 P.3d at 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , additional trial remedies such as forfeiting the misused peremptory challenges are also permissible, subject to abuse-of-discretion review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 18 Beyond restoring the wrongfully excluded jurors to the venire in this case, for instance, the trial court also forfeited the three challenges that the State attempted to use in a discriminatory fashion. Both the dissenting judge on the court of appeals and amici argue for additional remedies here, but Urrea waived such arguments by exclusively seeking a mistrial. (Nor did he preserve the state constitutional arguments advanced by amici.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 19 We disavow any suggestion in\n   <em>\n    State v.

That decision dealt only with the proper timing of\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenges, not remedies. \"A defendant is not entitled to be tried by any particular jury but only by one which is fair and impartial.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Hilliard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"641943\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/89/129/#p133\">\n    89 Ariz. 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 133,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"641943\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/89/129/#p133\">\n    359 P.2d 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1961) ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial court vindicated that right by restoring the improperly challenged jurors to the positions they would have occupied absent discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 20 We reiterate that\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   made clear that the two remedies it described, mistrial or restoration, were constitutionally adequate. The touchstone of a minimally adequate remedy is to place the defendant in the position he or she would have occupied absent discrimination. We are satisfied that the remedy here was not an abuse of the trial court's considerable discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 21 We affirm Urrea's conviction and sentence. We vacate paragraphs 13-33 of the court of appeals' opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
