She argues that the trial court failed to recognize the long-term marriage and to allow her to maintain her predissolution economic status, improperly imputed income to her for child support, and failed to award her attorney fees. We reverse the trial court's decision to impute income for child support. We affirm on all other issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    FACTS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Donald Kaplan and Heidi Kaplan married on October 7, 1990.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After a marriage of 25 years, Donald and Heidi separated on July 20, 2015. Donald filed a dissolution action on July 6, 2015, in Harris County, Texas. Heidi filed her petition for dissolution in the King County Superior Court on July 15, 2015. After concluding that Washington had jurisdiction over the dissolution, the Texas court dismissed Donald's petition without an award of costs to either party. A five-day bench trial in King County Superior Court began on June 20, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 At the time of the dissolution, Donald was a business development manager at Phillips 66. Donald had worked for Phillips 66, or its predecessor company, since 1990. Donald's\n   career required the family to move four times for different positions. The family had lived in Seattle since 2001. Donald accepted a promotion in 2014 and transferred to Houston. Heidi and their two children remained in Seattle. At the time of trial, Donald's gross monthly salary was $19,802 monthly and $237,624 annually. Including his average annual bonus, Donald's annual salary was approximately $387,000 per year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 In 2014, Donald and Heidi discussed Donald's desire to retire after their youngest daughter, Sophie, graduated from high school. During trial, Donald testified that he intended to retire in roughly four years. Donald also testified he had concerns about his continued employment at Phillips 66. Brent Longnecker, a consultant who advises energy companies in strategy, governance, and executive pay testified on behalf of Donald. Longnecker testified that Donald's position in business development and acquisitions was at risk because oil companies are less inclined to make capital expenditures and expand their business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 Heidi graduated from Syracuse University in 1985 with a Bachelor of Science degree in speech communications and rhetorical studies. After graduating, Heidi pursued a career in product development and merchandising until their older daughter, Jillian, was born in 1996. The Kaplan's second daughter, Sophie, was born in 1999. Heidi remained at home to take care of Jillian and Sophie from 1996 until the time of trial in June 2016. At the time of the trial, Jillian was 20 years old and in college in California; Sophie was 17 and a high school senior in Seattle. Over the years, Heidi volunteered at Jillian and Sophie's schools, including acting as president of the parent teacher association. In doing so, she organized fundraisers and events, engaged in community outreach, and managed volunteers. Heidi also attended workshops and courses, such as a grant writing course and an art history course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 At trial, Heidi argued that she was at the time unemployable. David Goodenough, a vocational counselor, testified in support of this contention. Goodenough assessed both Heidi's immediate employability and her long-term career capabilities as of May 2016. Goodenough offered his expert opinion that Heidi was not currently employable except at a \"low end\" job. Goodenough testified that Heidi required retraining to secure marketable skills, a process that would require time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 The trial court entered findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a final dissolution decree on October 25, 2016. As for the distribution of property, the court found, and the parties do not dispute, that the overall value of the estate was $5.2 million. Donald asked the court to effectively award him 50 percent of the community property. Heidi asked the court to effectively award her 60 percent of the community property. The trial court concluded that \"[w]hen the Court considers the nature and extent of all the property, the duration of the marriage and the financial position of each party, it finds that a fair and equitable division is the allocation of 55% of the assets to Ms. Kaplan and 45% to Mr. Kaplan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 The trial court next addressed maintenance for Heidi. The trial court found that Donald's salary was likely to stay flat or experience only small increases and that future bonuses were unlikely. The trial court also found that Donald hoped to retire in 2020. Heidi requested maintenance in the amount of $18,850 per month for 12 years, until Donald was 66 years old in 2028. Donald agreed that Heidi should receive maintenance, but asked the court to order maintenance for 5 years at $9,500 per month. After finding that Donald would continue working for roughly four more years, that Heidi was healthy, well educated, and had maintained a basic skill set, and that both parties' monthly expenses were approximately $10,000, the trial court awarded maintenance to Heidi at $10,000 per month for 6 years, until August 2022. The court also noted that Heidi may \"choose to enroll in an education program,\" but stated the court \"is not specifically awarding maintenance in consideration of any such possible program.\"\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    We refer to the parties by their first names in order to avoid confusion. No disrespect is intended.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    \u00b6 9 The parties agreed to a parenting plan. The court entered a child support order imputing a monthly income of $2,714 after finding Heidi was \"voluntarily underemployed\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    under RCW 26.19.071(6). The trial court declined to award fees.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    \u00b6 10 Heidi appeals.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    <em>\n     Distribution and Maintenance\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Effect of Long-Term Marriage\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    \u00b6 11 Heidi's primary argument is that the trial court erred, as a matter of law, in failing to place the parties in roughly the equivalent financial position they had before the dissolution. We disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    \u00b6 12 Heidi's argument appears based on two incorrect premises. First, Heidi repeatedly asserts that the trial court \"must endeavor to place the parties in roughly the equivalent financial position they had before the dissolution after the dissolution.\" Heidi offers no legal authority for this assertion. Upon dissolution, the trial court must provide for a just and equitable distribution of the parties' assets, liabilities, and income. The predissolution economic circumstances of the parties is just one factor that the trial court must consider. RCW 26.09.080(4) (disposition of property); RCW 26.09.090(1)(c) (maintenance). Heidi is not \"entitled to maintain her former standard of living as a matter of right.\"\n    <em>\n     Cleaver v.

Heidi's argument is based on an overly narrow reading of the statement made by this court in\n    <em>\n     Marriage of Rockwell\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856968\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/141/235/#p243\">\n     141 Wash.

The trial court did not, however, limit its consideration to the length of the marriage or conduct a mathematical analysis to ensure equal financial positions for the rest of the parties' lives. Instead, the trial court examined a variety of factors in reaching its decision to award an unequal distribution. As this court explained,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    This requires considering the combination of the division of property and the expected income and earnings of the parties. And, where one spouse is older, semi-retired and dealing with ill health, and the other spouse is employable, the court does not abuse its discretion in ordering an unequal division of community property. Peter was younger, in good health and employable at a substantial wage. Moreover, substantial evidence showed that Carmen was retired, older and in poor health. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it compared Peter's age, health and employability (and thereby, future earning capacity) against Carmen's as a basis for its 60/40 split of the community property.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    <em>\n     Rockwell\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856968\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/141/235/#p243\">\n     141 Wash.

She argued that under\n    <em>\n     Rockwell\n    </em>\n    , the court was required to equalize the financial circumstances of the parties because they had a long-term marriage.\n    <em>\n     Doneen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12453196\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/197/941/#p950\">\n     197 Wash.

The court rejected this argument, holding that the objective established in\n    <em>\n     Rockwell\n    </em>\n    \"was permissive in nature, not mandatory, in nature.\"\n    <em>\n     Doneen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12453196\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/197/941/#p950\">\n     197 Wash.

In affirming, the court noted that the trial court properly \"declined to utilize an inflexible rule, but rather properly considered all of the circumstances of the marriage and exercised its discretion to attain a result in accordance with RCW 26.09.080.\"\n    <em>\n     Doneen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12453196\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/197/941/#p950\">\n     197 Wash.

An objective of placing the parties to a long-term marriage in \"roughly equal\" financial\n    positions, is not a mandate for trial courts to predict the future, divide assets with mathematical precision, or guarantee future equality. The trial court must still exercise its discretion to consider all of the statutory factors set out in RCW 26.09.080 and RCW 26.09.090(1)(c) and reach a just and equitable distribution. We decline Heidi's request to hold that failure to place the parties in roughly the equivalent financial position for the rest of their lives constitutes an error of law. The objective stated in\n    <em>\n     Rockwell\n    </em>\n    , is just that, an objective, which is to be considered as the trial court determines the \"fair, just, and equitable division of the property.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    \u00b6 17 Accordingly, we review the trial court's distribution of property and award of maintenance.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Distribution of Property\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    \u00b6 18 \"The trial court's distribution of property in a dissolution action is guided by statute.\"\n    <em>\n     Rockwell\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856968\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/141/235/#p243\">\n     141 Wash.

The high value community property items included: (1) the parties' house in the Montlake area of Seattle, appraised at $1.3 million, with an existing mortgage of $370,057, for a net value of $944,943; (2) Donald's Vanguard 401(k) savings account, with a net value of $1.8 million; and (3) a commonwealth account with a net value of $1.19 million. The parties also split\n    several lower value accounts. The trial court distributed the full value of the Seattle house to Heidi; making Heidi also responsible for the mortgage. The trial court unevenly divided the Vanguard 401(k) account, with over $1 million being distributed to Heidi, and $768,225 being distributed to Donald. The trial court split the commonwealth financial network account 50/50. In the end, Heidi received a net value of $2,627,298 in community property and Donald received $2,149,434. It is undisputed that Heidi received slightly over 55 percent of the community property.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    \u00b6 22 Heidi acknowledges the trial court distributed the community property on a 55/45 basis in Heidi's favor, but argues the trial court erred by largely giving \"Donald liquid assets while giving her nonliquid assets like the marital home.\" Heidi argues that Donald was left with his income and limited debts, whereas, she received the Seattle house, which is \"burdened with a substantial mortgage and major repair needs.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    \u00b6 23 We hold the trial court did not abuse its discretion in its distribution. At trial, Heidi specifically requested that she be awarded the house in Montlake, maintaining she did not wish to put it up for sale and divide the proceeds. Heidi testified that she intended to live in the house then sell it after Sophie left home. Heidi does not contest the stipulated net value of the house was $944,943, which took into account the mortgage that encumbered the house. Heidi also received a larger share of the 401(k), totaling more than a million dollars. The combined value of the house and the 401(k) account established nearly half of the parties overall assets.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    \u00b6 24 Because the house and the 401(k) each have such a high net value, they necessarily would affect the other assets that Heidi would receive.

Heidi had two assets identified as separate property: (1) the Michigan condominium Heidi co-owns with her brothers with the net value of $35,417 and (2) her Bank of America checking account with the net value of $16,227. Donald's personal property was worth $373,642 and Heidi's was worth $51,644. Adding the separate property to the community property each party received, Donald received $2,523,076 and Heidi received $2,678,942.

The trial court is required to impute income to a parent when the parent is \"voluntarily unemployed or voluntarily underemployed.\" RCW 26.19.017(6). The determination of whether a parent is voluntarily\n    unemployed or underemployed is \"based upon that parent's work history, education, health, and age, or any other relevant factors.\" RCW 26.19.017(6). \"A court shall not impute income to a parent who is gainfully employed on a full-time basis, unless the court finds that the parent is voluntarily underemployed and finds that the parent is purposely underemployed to reduce the parent's child support obligation.\" RCW 26.19.017(6).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    \u00b6 42 The trial court found that based on her work history, education, health, and age, Heidi was able to work and was therefore voluntarily unemployed.

Because RCW 26.19.071 (3)(q) requires the court consider maintenance as income during the time that Heidi is receiving maintenance, the court erred in finding Heidi was voluntarily unemployed. Finding Heidi was voluntarily unemployed is contrary to the purpose of awarding maintenance and the child support statute. Moreover, the court failed to consider its own finding that \"Ms. Kaplan put her employment advancement on hold in support of the community; specifically, so that she could care for the children as well as support Mr. Kaplan's career goals that took him out of town extensively.\" Care for the community and children are \"other relevant factors\" that the trial court must consider in determining whether Heidi was voluntarily unemployed.

Then, based on the holding in\n    <em>\n     Jonas\n    </em>\n    , Division Two affirmed the trial court's imputation of $300 per month income to the mother because she was working only halftime at a hospital while raising her five children.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    \u00b6 47 In\n    <em>\n     Pollard\n    </em>\n    , Division Three reviewed the trial court's decision failing to impute income in a modification proceeding. Under the terms of the initial dissolution, the mother was required to pay the father, the primary residential parent, $217 per month for child support. After the mother remarried, she sought modification of the child support because she had left full time employment and was instead staying home to work \"full time as a mother and homemaker.\"\n    <em>\n     Pollard\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"180768\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/99/48/\">\n     99 Wash.
