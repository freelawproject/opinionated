They learned from Antwuan Adamson that Vallon Broadus might be holding Kelli against her will. On the evening of October 21, Appellant, Carrie Lira, and Antwuan Adamson met at Megan Burkett's residence in Tulsa, expecting that Vallon Broadus might be there with Kelli. Neither Broadus nor Kelli were there when they arrived. They parked their car around the corner, and sat waiting in Antwuan Adamson's car just down the street from the residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 Within an hour or two, Vallon Broadus drove up to Burkett's house in a red car and parked in the driveway. Antwuan Adamson had gone inside the Burkett residence before Broadus arrived, and saw some of the incident that followed on a home video surveillance monitor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   By Appellant's own account, he got out of a vehicle and quickly approached the car driven by Vallon Broadus, carrying a 12 gauge shotgun and yelling for Kelli to \"get out of the car!\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Carrie Lira began driving Adamson's car toward the driveway to block Broadus's exit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 According to Appellant, the red car suddenly lurched backward in his direction, spinning its tires in the gravel, requiring him to step to the left side to avoid being hit. Appellant later admitted to police that he pointed the shotgun's attached flashlight into the driver's eyes as the car went by. He also admitted that the shotgun discharged as he pointed it at the driver, sending several pellets through the driver's windshield, striking and killing Vallon Broadus. The car backed into a large post and stopped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 After seeing part of the incident on camera, Antwuan Adamson quickly walked outside the house. There he saw the Appellant lowering the barrel of the shotgun from a shooting position. Appellant was standing about ten feet to the front side of the red car. Adamson got into his car. Appellant, still carrying the shotgun, jumped in the back seat and told Adamson to drive him around the corner. He drove to a nearby apartment, where Appellant and Carrie Lira got out. Adamson said Appellant took the shotgun with him. Adamson drove away. The shotgun was never recovered. Appellant and Carrie Lira were later arrested in Oklahoma City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6 In a subsequent recorded interview with investigators, which was played for the trial jury, Appellant stated as Broadus's car came toward him, \"I think I shot him. I think I shot the windshield.\" He denied intending to kill Broadus, saying he wanted to intimidate him and make him cooperate in efforts to find Carrie's sister, Kelli. After the shooting, Appellant and Carrie got in Adamson's car, rode with Adamson around the corner to their own car, and escaped the scene. Appellant essentially claimed he committed an accidental shooting, and fled in a panic because of his past run-ins with the law. The recording also showed that Appellant declined the investigator's request that he provide a DNA sample for comparison. Further facts will be discussed as necessary to the resolution of the issues on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 In Proposition One, Appellant argues that the trial court erred in finding prosecution witness Antwuan Adamson unavailable to testify at trial and admitting the\n   transcript of his preliminary examination testimony. He also argues the admission of the transcript violated his constitutional right to confrontation. This Court reviews the trial court's finding of a witness's unavailability for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Mathis v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6983480\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/271/67/\">\n    2012 OK CR 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6983480\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/271/67/\">\n    271 P.3d 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 75. An abuse of discretion is a clearly erroneous conclusion, contrary to the logic and effect of the facts presented.\n   <em>\n    Pullen v.

Because the witness was unavailable, and Appellant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the witness at preliminary examination, admission of the transcript at trial did not violate Appellant's right to confrontation.\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6983480\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/271/67/\">\n    2012 OK CR 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6983480\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/271/67/\">\n    271 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   75 ;\n   <em>\n    Crawford v.

Proposition One is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9 In Proposition Two, Appellant argues that the flight instruction given by the trial court was reversible error. He waived review for all but plain error when he failed to object or request different instructions at trial.\n   <em>\n    Simpson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1994%20OK%20CR%2040\">\n    1994 OK CR 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 2,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10352673\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/876/690/#p693\">\n    876 P.2d 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 693.

Proposition Two is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10 Proposition Three argues that the trial court's violation of section 894 of Title 22 in two written communications to the jury was reversible error. These communications answered two simple questions by referring jurors back to their instructions. The communications met no objection at trial, waiving all but plain error, as defined above. Section 894 requires that when the jury desires further instruction after retiring to deliberate, the trial court should conduct the jury to the courtroom and instruct them in the presence of, or after notice to, the prosecutor and defense counsel. The written response procedure used here, though it happens in trial courts every day, and was agreed to by counsel after consultation, is a plain violation of the statute.\n   <em>\n    Cipriano v.

This presumption of prejudice was said to be rebuttable, and could be \"overcome if, on appeal, this Court is convinced that, on the face of the record, no prejudice to the defendant occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   , the Court found the presumption of prejudice rebutted where \"the court's written response accomplished the same result as if the court had brought the jury into the courtroom and responded verbally.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12 However, upon closer review of prior cases, we find this presumption of prejudice unjustified when the trial court communicates with the jury in writing after affording counsel notice and an opportunity to be heard.\n   <em>\n    Smallwood v.

Neither party requested that the jury be returned to the courtroom for these instructions.

He failed to object to the evidence and waived all but plain error, as defined above. Evidence that the defendant in a criminal trial has been convicted of a felony is admissible to attack his credibility as a witness \"if the court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to the accused.\" 12 O.S.2011, \u00a7 2609(A)(1). Convictions involving dishonesty or false statement are also admissible. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or bad acts is inadmissible to prove action in conformity therewith, but can be admissible for other purposes not relevant here. 12 O.S.2011, \u00a7 2404(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 16 The evidence of Appellant's criminal record was incidentally admitted through Appellant's own references in his statement to police. The evidence was not offered for a specific purpose, and was not otherwise emphasized by the State or defense. The jury was never informed of the precise nature of Appellant's criminal history. The better practice would have been to exclude this evidence by redacting the videotape; but in light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt, this error did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 17 We reach the same conclusion regarding evidence that Appellant refused to voluntarily provide a DNA sample upon request.

The alleged misconduct drew no objection at trial and will be reviewed only for plain error, as defined above.

We found error in the trial court's non-compliance with section 894 in its communications to the jury, and the failure to redact references to Appellant's criminal history and exercise of his Fourth Amendment rights from his taped interview with police. These unpreserved errors had no serious effect on the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the conviction or sentencing proceedings; and any constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

Presiding Judge Lumpkin correctly outlines the established test for plain error developed under the\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   case. However, I completely disagree that the\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Hogan\n   </em>\n   language, which we all understand fully, has to be drafted word for word in every opinion we release. A paraphrase of the\n   <em>\n    Hogan\n   </em>\n   language, properly attributed, is the legally correct way to cite to the plain error test. Mandating that judges of this Court must quote\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Hogan\n   </em>\n   completely in every analysis is inappropriate, and at times completely unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 2 I would like to note that if a plain error is not found during an analysis, then 1) the language regarding any \"affect the [error] had on the outcome of the trial\", or 2) the fourth \"prong\" that is delineated in\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hogan\n   </em>\n   -to weigh the harm in an error to correct it-are not only unnecessary to discuss, but are completely irrelevant to the analysis. No error means nothing in the jury's decision was affected and there is nothing to weigh.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 3 Also, if the Court finds error occurred, then citing to cases that outline the entire test in support of the argument, is not only an appropriate legal writing skill, it is a fundamental way to inform the reader of the standard the Court is applying to the facts. To insinuate that anything less than a verbatim recitation of\n   <em>\n    Hogan\n   </em>\n   in each analysis will lead to straying arguments and chaos in deciphering the standard is nonsensical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 4 By citing to\n   <em>\n    Hogan\n   </em>\n   , the reader knows that the test that was applied is the\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   test. To be exact, the reference to paragraph 38 in\n   <em>\n    Hogan\n   </em>\n   will lead the reader to the following language in\n   <em>\n    Hogan\n   </em>\n   : \"To be entitled to relief under the plain error doctrine, Hogan must prove: 1) the existence of an actual error (i.e., deviation from a legal rule); 2) that the error is plain or obvious; and 3) that the error affected his substantial rights,\n   meaning the error affected the outcome of the proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Simpson v.
