The neighbors were friendly with one another until 2010, when they had a dispute over the property line of their parcels. They have not spoken civilly to one another since that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b64] On November 1, 2016, Mr. Birch visited his friend and neighbor, Howard Leeper. Mr. Birch told Mr. Leeper he wanted to shoot Mr. Johnson in the leg because he believed Mr. Johnson had sabotaged some of his equipment. This statement was consistent with other statements Mr. Birch had made to Mr. Leeper in the prior ten days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b65] During the night of November 2, 2016, Mr. Johnson was awakened by gunfire. He opened a window in his home and could see and hear Mr. Birch yelling Mr. and Mrs. Johnson's names and firing his gun. Mr. Birch also yelled, \"Come over here, I'm going to kill you.\" The next morning, Mr. Johnson reported Mr. Birch's conduct to the Sublette\n   County Sheriff's Department. Deputy Zack Semmons responded to the Johnson home, and after speaking with Mr. Johnson, spoke with Mr. Birch. Mr. Birch told Deputy Semmons that he \"fucking hates\" Mr. Johnson and that Mr. Birch was an expert marksman when he was in the Army. He also freely admitted he shot his gun thirty times while yelling obscenities at the Johnsons the evening before. Mr. Birch showed Deputy Semmons where he was shooting his gun, and from that location Deputy Semmons could clearly see the Johnson property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b66] On November 7, 2016, the Johnsons met with Sheriff K.C. Lehr to discuss concerns the Johnsons had about their welfare and property due to Mr. Birch's actions. Sheriff Lehr explained how to obtain a protection order and also advised them to continue to report and attempt to record any similar behavior by Mr. Birch in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b67] Later in the evening of November 7th, the Johnsons arrived at the home of their neighbors, Pete and Melanie Peterson, for dinner. Shortly after arriving at the Peterson home, Mr. Johnson received a text message from another neighbor, who informed Mr. Johnson that Mr. Birch was shooting his gun near Mr. Johnson's home again. Mr. Johnson and Mr. Peterson made the approximately ten-minute drive to the Johnson property to assess the situation. When the men arrived, they could see Mr. Birch outside shooting his gun while screaming vulgarities about the Johnsons. They listened to Mr. Birch for twenty to thirty minutes and then Mr. Birch got into his truck and left. The two returned to the Peterson home and Mr. Johnson reported the incident to the Sublette County Sheriff's Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b68] The Johnsons returned to their home at approximately 7:30 p.m., and shortly thereafter Mr. Birch again began to shoot his gun while screaming at the Johnsons. Mr. Birch yelled at the Johnsons using their first names and copious amounts of profanity and vile name-calling, saying things such as, \"I'm gonna fuckin' shoot your ass, you fuckin' piece of shit[,]\" and \"I'm gonna fuckin' kill you, you fuckin' piece of shit. Whoo. Call the cops. Are you scared, Gordon? Are you scared, motherfucker? Are you scared, fucker? You should be, you fuckin' piece of shit.\" The Johnsons could see Mr. Birch during his tirade. The couple turned off the lights in their home and used Mr. Johnson's cellphone to audio record Mr. Birch's behavior. Mr. Birch continued shooting his gun and yelling until approximately midnight. The next day, Mr. Johnson contacted the sheriff's department again about the incident and provided the cell phone recordings. On November 17, 2016, Mr. Birch was arrested and charged, based upon the November 7th conduct, with aggravated assault and battery, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-2-502\">\n    Wyo.

The district court sentenced Mr. Birch to three to five years imprisonment for the aggravated assault and battery conviction, but suspended that sentence in favor of five years of probation. The court sentenced Mr. Birch to a concurrent 180 days in jail for the breach of peace conviction, but suspended that sentence in favor of six months of probation. Mr. Birch filed a timely notice of appeal. Other facts will be discussed as necessary below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jury Instructions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b610] The district court gave the jury the following instruction regarding the elements of aggravated assault and battery:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   INSTRUCTION NO. 16\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The elements of the crime of Aggravated Assault and Battery-Threat to Use Drawn Deadly Weapon, as charged in Count I of the Criminal Information in this case, are:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   1.

The phrase \"threatens to use\" requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of an actual threat of physical injury during the act of employing a deadly weapon.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A threat is an expression of an intention to inflict pain, injury, or punishment. A threat may be expressed by words or acts or a combination of words and acts. Considering all of the circumstances of the case, you must decide whether the defendant's words and acts amounted to an express or implied statement of his intention to use a drawn deadly weapon to inflict pain, injury, or punishment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The district court declined to give the proposed instruction, concluding it would cause confusion regarding the required intent. Instead, the court opted to give the pattern jury instruction defining \"threatens to use\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   INSTRUCTION NO. 17\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \"Threatens to use\" means more than mere presence of a weapon.

Specifically, the proposed instruction would have given further clarity of the \"actual threat\" necessary to convict Mr. Birch.

Mr. Birch argued the evidence at issue is uncharged misconduct and is inadmissible under Rule 404(b). The district court concluded that, because Deputy Semmons referred to Mr. Birch's statements to Mr. Leeper and the November 2nd incident in his affidavit of probable cause in support of the Information, the proposed evidence is part of the charged conduct and not prohibited by Rule 404(b).

Once a defendant has filed a pretrial demand for notice of the State's intent to introduce uncharged misconduct evidence, the State must identify the evidence.

The district court is then required to hold a pretrial hearing where the State must demonstrate the proper purpose of the evidence under Rule 404(b), the relevance of the evidence, and explain why the evidence is more probative than unfairly prejudicial.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

The district court based its conclusion on the fact that Deputy Semmons included the November 2nd incident in his affidavit of probable cause that was attached to the Information setting out the charges from the November 7th incident. The court relied on our holding in\n   <em>\n    Marquess v.

This Court has defined \"intrinsic\" evidence as follows: \"Other act evidence is 'intrinsic' when the evidence of the other act and the evidence of the crime charged are 'inextricably intertwined' or both acts are part of a 'single criminal episode' or the other acts were 'necessary preliminaries' to the crime charged.\"\n   <em>\n    Roeschlein v.

In making its argument, the State provided an analysis of this Court's 404(b) precedent, pointing out that in some cases we have held \"intrinsic\" evidence is uncharged misconduct requiring a\n   <em>\n    Gleason\n   </em>\n   analysis and in other cases we have held it is not uncharged misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Leyva v.

While the State argues this is intrinsic evidence, based upon its analysis, it concludes the evidence must be tested by the required Rule 404(b) analysis before being admitted at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   [\u00b622] We disagree with the district court's and the State's characterization of the evidence. The State charged Mr. Birch with\n   aggravated assault and battery and breach of peace based on his conduct on November 7th, not November 2nd, and his conduct on November 2nd was not necessary to prove any of the elements of the charged crimes. Simply because Deputy Semmons included the November 2nd incident in his affidavit of probable cause does not mean that information is necessary to prove the facts of November 7th. Therefore, the district court's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Marquess\n   </em>\n   was misplaced. However, this evidence is not \"intrinsic\" as the State alleges, either. While Mr. Birch's statements to the Johnsons to \"call the police\" may have been premised on the fact the Johnsons had called the police on November 2nd, that fact was not crucial for the jury to understand and put into context the events of November 7th. Thus, those facts are not so \"inextricably intertwined\" to one another to classify the November 2nd incident as \"intrinsic\" to the November 7th events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   [\u00b623] Instead, the November 2nd incident clearly falls into the category of uncharged misconduct, and the district court was required to analyze the evidence using the\n   <em>\n    Gleason\n   </em>\n   factors before deeming it admissible at trial.\n   <em>\n    Lindstrom\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6887179\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/343/792/\">\n    343 P.3d at 798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court did not conduct that analysis and, therefore, abused its discretion when it admitted the evidence at trial.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . However, despite the error, we must still consider whether Mr. Birch was prejudiced.\n   <em>\n    Magnus\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6977390\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/293/459/\">\n    293 P.3d at 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on the other evidence presented by the State, we cannot say there is a reasonable possibility the verdict might have been more favorable to Mr. Birch had the error not occurred.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   [\u00b624] Both Mr. and Mrs. Johnson testified about the November 7th events, explaining Mr. Birch's screaming and yelling and the fact they could see the muzzle flash when he shot his firearm. This testimony was corroborated by Mr. Peterson, who testified he saw Mr. Birch yelling vulgarities on November 7th. The most damning evidence of all is the recording Mr. Johnson made of Mr. Birch's tirade. Mr. Johnson identified the voice on the recording as belonging to Mr. Birch and testified the recording accurately reflected the events of November 7th. When the jury listened to the recording, it heard Mr. Birch's taunts and threats toward Mr. Johnson and the gunshots. This evidence was more than satisfactory for the jury to conclude Mr. Birch was guilty of the charged crimes. Therefore, the district court's error in admitting evidence about the November 2nd incident without conducting a\n   <em>\n    Gleason\n   </em>\n   analysis was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Sufficiency of the Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   [\u00b625] Mr. Birch's final argument is the State failed to present sufficient evidence that Mr. Birch \"threatened to use a drawn deadly weapon\" because there was a lack of evidence from which the jury could infer from Mr. Birch's words or acts that he intended to use his firearm to inflict pain, injury, or punishment upon Mr. Johnson. When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   This Court examines the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.

For example, he asserts that, while Mr. Peterson testified he could see Mr. Birch yelling vulgarities, he testified he did not hear the vulgarities directed at a particular person, and he did not mention hearing gunshots during the tirade. Mr. Birch also relies upon the fact that law enforcement did not respond to the November 7th incident and, therefore, there was no evidence regarding the crime scene or the weapon used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Although he acknowledges the jury heard a recording of the incident, he argues the date the recording was made had not been verified by law enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   [\u00b627] Mr. Birch's argument ignores our applicable standard of review. When we review the evidence presented in the light most favorable to the State, it is clear the jury was presented with sufficient evidence to conclude Mr. Birch was guilty of aggravated assault and battery. Mr. Johnson testified that on November 7th he received a text message from a neighbor that \"[t]he SOB is shooting again.\" When he arrived at his home with Mr. Peterson, he heard Mr. Birch saying \"[v]ery vulgar obscenities directed at Cheri and I over and over and over again.\" He explained that later in the evening, after he and his wife returned from their dinner with the Petersons, they \"[e]ventually [ ] heard the yelling, the ranting, the screaming and the shooting start up again.\" Mr. Johnson saw Mr. Birch outside, discharging his firearm, while saying \"I'm going to fucking kill you.\" This behavior continued from 7:30 p.m. until approximately midnight. Mr. Johnson also explained that he recorded thirty-two minutes of the incident on his cell phone, and the recording accurately captured the events of November 7th.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   [\u00b628] Mrs. Johnson also testified that she saw Mr. Birch clearly while he was \"using our names a lot and a lot of profanity, vulgarities, threatening, calling us to come out.\" He was yelling things such as, \"Turn the lights on. Come outside so I can kill you.\" She also explained that the gunshots were \"very loud and very scary, very close. You could see a muzzle blast each time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   [\u00b629] Finally, the jury heard Mr. Birch's behavior when the State played Mr. Johnson's cell phone recording at trial. The jury heard approximately thirty-two minutes of Mr. Birch calling the Johnsons names while taunting and threatening to shoot or kill them: \"Fuck you, Gordon, you fuckin' piece of shit. You (redacted) motherfuckers. I'm gonna fuckin' kill you, you fuckin' piece of shit. Whoo. Call the cops. Are you scared, Gordon? Are you scared, motherfucker? Are you scared, fucker? You should be, you fuckin' piece of shit.\" Over the course of the recording, Mr. Birch mentioned killing or shooting Mr. Johnson six different times and gunshots could be heard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   [\u00b630] Based upon this evidence, a jury could reasonably conclude that Mr. Birch's conduct demonstrated he used his firearm as an expression of an intention to inflict pain, injury, or punishment against Mr. Johnson. For four and a half hours, Mr. Birch shot his firearm in the dark while threatening to shoot and kill Mr. Johnson. Mr. Birch was close enough to the Johnson home that the Johnsons could see the muzzle blasts from the firearm. This evidence satisfies the elements of the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   [\u00b631] The fact that the evidence did not show Mr. Birch pointed the firearm directly at Mr. Johnson does not change this conclusion.

Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   , the defendant argued that because he did not make any verbal threats towards the officers and there was no evidence that he pointed his rifle at the officer, the State failed to prove he \"threatened\" the officers with the rifle.\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6803343\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/371/553/\">\n    371 P.3d at 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
