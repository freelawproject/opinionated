Downs, claiming he and his daughter had improperly interfered with Homax's business relationship with RKI Exploration &amp; Production. After a bench trial, the district court granted judgment in favor of Homax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b62] On appeal, Mr. Downs claims the district court abused its discretion by allowing Homax to present damages evidence that was not properly disclosed during discovery and improperly awarded damages to Homax. We conclude Homax violated its duty under W.R.C.P. 26 to provide its computation of damages and the documents supporting its damages claim to Mr. Downs, and the district court abused its discretion by admitting Homax's damages evidence at trial. We also conclude the district court's finding on damages was clearly erroneous. Consequently, we reverse the district court's judgment in favor of Homax and direct that judgment be entered in favor of Mr. Downs on Homax's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b63] Although the parties present several issues related to the district court's damages award, the following issues are dispositive:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   1. Whether the district court abused its discretion by admitting Homax's damages evidence at trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   2. Whether the district court's damages award was supported by the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b64] Mr. Downs owns a ranch in Converse County, Wyoming, which is the site of oil and gas development activities. Mr. Downs' daughter, Amanda Horr, works on the ranch. RKI had oil and gas operations on the Downs Ranch and entered into a surface use agreement with Mr. Downs. RKI contracted with\n   landman, Adam Hughes, to act as its liaison with landowners, including Mr. Downs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b65] Homax sells refined petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel and lubricants. Prior to the events in question, Homax delivered petroleum products to RKI's operations on the Downs Ranch approximately three times per week. RKI and Homax did not, however, have an agreement that required RKI to continue to purchase petroleum products from Homax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b66] On March 23, 2015, a Homax fuel truck drove on a private road within the Downs Ranch, without permission or other authority to do so. Ms. Horr was in Casper, Wyoming, that day, so Mr. Downs told her to go to Homax's office and give it a bill for trespassing on Downs Ranch. Ms. Horr purchased an invoice book, filled out a trespass bill for $1,500, and went to Homax's office to present the bill. Darin Homer, the president of Homax, refused to pay the bill. According to Mr. Homer, Ms. Horr stated that his refusal would affect Homax's business with RKI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b67] After leaving Homax's office, Ms. Horr called Mr. Hughes and told him that she had been treated rudely by Mr. Homer. Mr. Hughes informed RKI representatives of Ms. Horr's report. Later that day, RKI terminated its business relationship with Homax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b68] Homax filed suit against Mr. Downs, claiming improper interference with Homax's business relationship with RKI. It sought damages for \"lost business, punitive damages, attorney's fees, and further relief as the Court deems just and proper, including pre and post judgment interest incurred in the prosecution of this action.\" Mr. Downs counterclaimed for trespass. The district court's order on the pretrial conference set out deadlines for witness and exhibit lists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b69] During the discovery period, Homax produced to Mr. Downs a one-page document purportedly setting out its damages. The document was a simple two-line accounting spreadsheet showing Homax's monthly gross revenue from RKI, with totals of $2,162,542.31 for 2014 and $307,615.21 for 2015. Homax's witness list designated Mr. Homer, Darla Homer, and Peggy Bagner as witnesses on damages, but Homax called only Mr. Homer to testify at trial about its damages. Homax's witness designation provided the following information about Mr. Homer's proposed testimony on damages:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Homer has been the President/CEO of Homax Oil Sales, Inc. for 13 years and is involved in all aspects and knowledge of the company. Mr. Homer will testify concerning all facts and allegations made in the Complaint, and all facts concerning the damages Homax Oil Sales has incurred as a result of the actions of Defendant in this matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   ... Mr. Homer will testify that Homax has had no business dealings with RKI after RKI terminated its business with Homax.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Mr. Homer will testify to the damages in the loss of 2.15 million dollars in revenue in 2014, $306 [t]housand dollars in revenue in early 2015, the [sic] resulting in 2014 Gross Profit damages of $345,279 [and] 2015 Gross Profit damages of $83,573.00 at the time of termination. Mr. Homer shall testify to the computations, the accounting systems, and all associated computations of damages, including the future.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Mr. Homer shall testify to all the aspects of the attempts to mitigate the damage to Homax Oil Sales, Inc., along with the damage to RKI's successor Devon Energy and their unwillingness to allow Homax Oil Sales[ ] to provide fuel to locations on Down[s'] property, as before.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b610] Mr. Downs filed two motions challenging Homax's damages evidence-a motion for summary judgment based, in part, upon lack of evidence of lost profit damages and a motion in limine for exclusion of damages evidence because Homax failed to comply with the disclosure requirements of Rule 26. After a hearing, the district court denied Mr. Downs' motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b611] A bench trial was set to begin January 3, 2017. The week before trial, Homax's counsel filed its third amended exhibit list, indicating that Plaintiff's Exhibit 4 was the same one-page document showing its 2014 and 2015 revenue from sales to RKI that had previously been disclosed. Homax provided\n   copies of its exhibits on a CD, and the copy of Exhibit 4 on the CD only contained the previously disclosed single page. On the first day of the scheduled trial, January 3, 2017, Homax's attorney gave Mr. Downs' attorney a folder with its trial exhibits and asked her to stipulate to their admission. In the paper copy, Exhibit 4 contained three pages, although Homax did not amend its exhibit list to reflect the added pages. Apparently without knowing about the additional pages in Exhibit 4, Mr. Downs' attorney stipulated to the admission of Homax's exhibits contained in the folder, including the expanded Exhibit 4. Because Mr. Hughes did not appear pursuant to his subpoena, the trial proceedings were continued until February 14, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b612] During Mr. Homer's testimony at trial, defense counsel realized that Plaintiff's Exhibit 4 contained three pages. The first page was the same revenue information for 2014 and 2015 previously provided by Homax. The two additional pages, one for 2014 and one for 2015, were each titled \"Customer Inquiry\" and listed RKI as the customer. The pages contained tables showing, for each month, \"Sales,\" \"Costs of Sales,\" \"Profit %,\" \"Profit $,\" \"Cash Recvd,\" and \"No. Invcs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b613] Plaintiff's counsel claimed that he told defense counsel that he had \"added a couple in there for foundation on damages.\" Defense counsel \"vehemently\" denied that Homax's counsel had informed her that he had added pages to the stipulated exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b614] Mr. Downs' attorney objected to admission of the extra pages and Mr. Homer's testimony about the information contained in those pages. The district court allowed Mr. Homer to testify about all three pages in Exhibit 4 because defense counsel had stipulated to the exhibit, although she was apparently unaware of the additional pages. Mr. Homer testified that Exhibit 4 showed \"gross revenue\" and \"gross profit\" from RKI for each month in 2014 and 2015. Homax's counsel then questioned Mr. Homer about Homax's net losses:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Q. So have you calculated your losses, financial losses, from the time you were run off of RKI till [sic] today?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   A. Yes, I have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Q. And what is that amount?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   A. It's $330,000 of net income.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   According to Mr. Homer, the $330,000 figure represented lost net profits of $132,000 for 2015, $176,000 for 2016, and $22,000 for the beginning of 2017. He estimated future net profit losses from losing RKI's business at $176,000 per year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [\u00b615] Defense counsel objected to Mr. Homer's testimony about net profits or income because only gross profit was disclosed in Mr. Homer's witness designation and the documents. The district court overruled the objection, concluding Mr. Homax's witness designation was sufficiently broad to include his testimony about net income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   [\u00b616] On cross examination, Mr. Homer explained that Homax's gross profit from sales to RKI in 2014 and 2015 was shown on pages two and three of Exhibit 4 and gross profit was calculated by deducting the \"costs of goods\" from total sales. He also stated that gross profit differs from net profit. To calculate net profit, Mr. Homer testified that \"all associated expenses\" had to be deducted from gross profit. He testified that he had not produced a list of \"all associated expenses\" to the defense because he was \"never asked for it.\" Mr. Homer identified what he believed to be \"associated expenses\" as wages, utilities, truck expenses, advertising, bank charges, cash over short, credit card fees, insurance, laundry and uniform expenses, lease expense, office expense, and payroll tax expense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [\u00b617] When asked about the specific expenses incurred by Homax for its business with RKI, Mr. Homer admitted that he did not have that information. Instead, he explained that he had calculated Homax's net profit by applying \"a gross profit to net income percentage\" for Homax's entire Douglas, Wyoming operation. Mr. Homer also said that he did not believe Mr. Downs \"would be liable for gross profit.\" Defense counsel asked Mr. Homer whether he was reading from a document when listing the various expenses that had to be deducted from gross profit to arrive at net profit. He admitted that he was testifying from some additional spreadsheets, that had never been disclosed to Mr. Downs, because he could not\n   remember the numbers. Mr. Homer's testimony was the only evidence Homax presented about computation of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [\u00b618] After the trial, the district court granted Homax a judgment of $250,000 for Mr. Downs' tortious interference with prospective contractual relation. It explained that it was awarding damages of $25,000 per month for ten months. The district court referenced the numbers set out in Exhibit 4 in its decision. The ten-month period was based upon testimony from one of Homax's employees as to when RKI's interests in Converse County had been acquired by Devon Energy. The district court found that Homax has ongoing business relationships with Devon Energy in other parts of Wyoming. However, Devon would not use Homax's services in the Downs Ranch area because of Mr. Downs' directive that Homax not provide fuel on his property. The district court ultimately decided that Homax did not present evidence about the agreements it had with Devon \"or the sales or profit of those services that are being provided to Devon. So, [it could not] award any amounts from the time that Devon took over to the present time.\" The district court also granted Mr. Downs nominal damages of $10 for his trespass counterclaim. Mr. Downs appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [\u00b619] District courts have discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence, controlling discovery, and selecting the proper means of sanctioning a discovery violation.\n   <em>\n    In re Paternity of HLG,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6813671\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/368/902/\">\n    2016 WY 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6813671\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/368/902/\">\n    368 P.3d 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 904 (Wyo. 2016) ;\n   <em>\n    Roemmich v.

On appeal, Homax still does not expressly recognize that it violated its discovery obligations and, consequently, does not assert that its failure to provide the information was substantially justified. Although it does not make a specific argument on harmlessness, Homax does cite\n   <em>\n    Dishman\n   </em>\n   as supporting the district court's admission of the evidence at trial.

As we explained above, Mr. Downs stipulated to admission of Exhibit 4, which included two pages not previously disclosed. Homax's attorney claimed he told Mr. Downs' attorney that he had \"added a couple in there for foundation on damages.\" Mr. Downs' attorney denied that conversation and pointed out that the Exhibit 4 provided by Homax in its exhibit list just prior to trial did not contain the additional pages. In any event, the district court held that the entire Exhibit 4 was admissible because Mr. Downs' attorney had stipulated to its admission. As Homax points out, our precedent supports enforcing stipulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackman Constr., Inc.,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-33,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12191679\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/385/311/\">\n    385 P.3d at 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We do not need to address the disputed question of whether Mr. Downs' stipulation should have been set aside because Exhibit 4, in its entirety, still did not adequately disclose Homax's damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   [\u00b631] The two additional pages provided information about Homax's gross profits from sales to RKI in 2014 and 2015. Mr. Homer testified gross profit is determined by subtracting the costs of goods from total sales. However, net profit, not gross profit, is the proper measure of damages.\n   <em>\n    Hopper,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10352992\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/861/531/#p548\">\n    861 P.2d at 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Evidence about the other expenses which had to be deducted to arrive at a net profit figure was not provided prior to trial. In fact, Mr. Homer testified about those expenses from documents he brought to trial that had never been disclosed to Mr. Downs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   [\u00b632] Homax violated its obligation under Rule 26 to disclose its computation of lost profits and the documents supporting such computation. Homax does not analyze the factors identified in\n   <em>\n    HLG,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6813671\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/368/902/\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   as relevant in determining whether a discovery violation was harmless. It is Homax's obligation to show harmlessness, so we will not conduct a comprehensive review of each of the factors. However, we note that Homax's discovery violation clearly was not harmless because Mr. Downs was surprised and prejudiced by the undisclosed damages information. He had no idea until Mr. Homer testified at trial the amount of net profit Homax claimed to have lost as a result of his actions. Mr. Downs also did not have any information prior to trial about the expenses that should be deducted from Homax's total revenues from RKI to arrive at net lost profits. Without that information, Mr. Downs had no way to challenge the reasonableness of the expenses or the accuracy of Homax's claimed damages. Thus, pursuant to Rule 37(c)(1), Homax's damages evidence should not have been admitted at trial, and the district court abused its discretion by allowing Mr. Homer to testify about Homax's lost profits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   [\u00b633] Homax argues that the district court's damages award can be affirmed because other types of damages are available for tortious interference with prospective contractual relation under Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 774A (1979, updated 2018) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   (1) One who is liable to another for interference with a contract or prospective contractual relation is liable for damages for\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   (a) the pecuniary loss of the benefits of the contract or the prospective relation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   (b) consequential losses for which the interference is a legal cause; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   (c) emotional distress or actual harm to reputation, if they are reasonably to be expected to result from the interference.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   [\u00b634] This Court has never expressly adopted \u00a7 774A as the appropriate measure of damages.

Homax's Rule 26 disclosure listed its claimed damages as: $2,470,157.52 in lost profits and sales; attorney fees; and punitive damages. It did not list the other categories of damages set out in \u00a7 774A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   [\u00b636] In its complaint, Homax only requested damages for \"lost business, punitive damages, attorney's fees, and further relief as the Court deems just and proper, including pre and post judgment interest incurred in the prosecution of this action.\" It made no claim for emotional damages or loss of reputation. It is unnecessary for us to decide whether and to what extent \u00a7 774A might apply in Wyoming because Homax did not claim these types of damages in its complaint or in its disclosures.

As we stated above, the proper measure of damages for tortious interference with prospective contractual relation is net lost profits. The district court awarded Homax $250,000, which represented ten months\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   of damages at $25,000 per month. It relied upon Exhibit 4 to determine the $25,000 per month figure. However, that exhibit showed only gross profits. Mr. Homer testified to a much smaller amount for Homax's net profit from its business with RKI. Mr. Homer estimated that its business with RKI would generate approximately $176,000 per year in net profits, which is $14,666 per month. Consequently, the district court's finding that Homax had lost $25,000 per month because of Mr. Downs' action was clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   [\u00b638] Additionally, Mr. Homer's testimony about Homax's net profit from RKI's business did not meet the reasonable certainty standard.\n   <em>\n    Hopper,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10352992\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/861/531/#p548\">\n    861 P.2d at 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He testified that he calculated net profit by using a sixty-two percent (62%) \"gross profit to net income percentage\" for Homax's entire Douglas operation.

The necessary costs of doing business, such as costs of drugs dispensed, accounting charges, staff wages and depreciation on the value of equipment, were never established. Calculating the cost and expense of operation is an essential item in the proof of damages in a suit seeking net lost profits .... Without these calculations, All Pet's and Alpine's damage claims fail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   [\u00b640] Homax's net lost profit evidence was similar to that presented in\n   <em>\n    Hopper.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Homer calculated an estimated net profit loss using net profit margins based upon its entire Douglas operation without prorating expenses to its business with RKI and without applying any specific expense values. Consequently, even if Homax had not violated the rules of discovery, its lost profits damages evidence would not have met the reasonable certainty requirement. The district court's damages finding was, therefore, clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   [\u00b641] Furthermore, the trial evidence did not support Homax's claim for the other measures of damage under \u00a7 774A. In closing argument, Homax's attorney suggested that the district court double its damages award to account for the other measures of damages in \u00a7 774A. First, we know of no principle related to actual damages permitting the trial court to simply \"double\" other damages in making an award for a category of damages unsupported by any evidence. Second, Homax does not direct us to any evidence of emotional distress, so no award would be appropriate for that measure of damages. Finally, there was no evidence to support any damage award for lost reputation or other consequential damages. Perhaps the evidence that Devon Energy refused to use Homax for its operations in the Downs Ranch area could be viewed as evidence of lost reputation or consequential damages resulting from Mr. Downs' actions; however, the district court specifically found Homax had presented insufficient evidence to support an award for the period after RKI sold its interests to Devon Energy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   [\u00b642] Homax did not comply with its obligation under Rule 26 to disclose the computation of its damages and the documents that supported its damages claim. It failed to demonstrate that its failure was substantially justified or harmless, so Rule 37(c)(1) required automatic exclusion of the evidence. Therefore, the district court abused its discretion by admitting Homax's damages evidence at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   [\u00b643] In addition, the district court's finding that Homax had suffered $25,000 per month in damages was clearly erroneous. The trial evidence was not consistent with the amount awarded to Homax, and Homax's method of proving damages did not meet the requirement that damages be proven with reasonable certainty. The record is entirely devoid of proper net income evidence, which is essential for an award of lost profits.

Mr. Downs, therefore, claims the district court's finding that Homax lost ten months of business with RKI was clearly erroneous. Given we conclude that Homax's method of proving its damages was legally insufficient, it is unnecessary for us to examine the accuracy of the district court's finding that Homax's losses extended for ten months.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
