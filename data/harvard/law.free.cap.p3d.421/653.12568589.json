Meeds contends that A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1202(B)(2), which enhances the consequence for a criminal street gang member who threatens or intimidates another person, is unconstitutionally vague because it fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited and allows for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. He also argues that the statute is unconstitutionally overbroad because it impinges on First Amendment rights. We hold that A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1202(B)(2) is neither unconstitutionally vague nor overbroad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 Over a period of two days, Meeds sent a series of threatening text messages to his then-girlfriend, N.F., who was trying to end their 15-year relationship. After Meeds threatened to \"blow [her] face off,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   he showed up at her workplace to make sure that she was there. After Meeds texted, \"im here,\" N.F. responded, \"you have threatened my life too many times. Just leave[.]\" When Meeds did not leave and told N.F. to come talk with him, N.F. texted \"I can't do face to face with you, you've threatened my life one too many times and I just don't understand why[.]\" Meeds responded that N.F.'s words and actions were \"going [to] get [her] hurt[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Meeds drove off when police arrived at N.F.'s workplace and resumed sending threatening texts to her that night. In one, he sent N.F. a photograph of her nephew's house, where she lived with her son, and\n   threatened to shoot up the house or set it on fire. He continued, \"im here,\" and warned her, \"do i need [to] go to the door or send them in[,] your choice because when i pull off the next car is going [to] light that bitch up[.]\" In another, he threatened her nephew's wife by stating that she \"will ... enjoy my firework show,\" which N.F. interpreted as \"he was threatening her life.\" He continued, \"i told you befor i dont got [to] be around to make it hot[.]\" He followed up by texting N.F. that she and her nephew had 24 hours to get out of the city or he would \"gun [them] down! ! ! ! !\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 An Arizona Department of Public Safety detective interviewed N.F. two days later. The detective reviewed reports from the officers that responded to N.F.'s place of work, collected the security footage, and gathered the text messages Meeds sent to N.F. After the interview with N.F., the detective described N.F. as \"scared shitless.\" The detective subsequently arrested Meeds and the State charged him with (1) stalking and (2) threatening or intimidating, which included an allegation that Meeds was a criminal street gang member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 During trial, N.F. testified to the text messages exchanged during that two-day period. N.F. also testified that she believed Meeds was a gang member, had seen him with other gang members, and had heard him reference the \"Crips\" gang. She stated, however, that she was not sure about whether Meeds was a gang member. She further testified that Meeds's violent conduct and threats had previously escalated before this incident and \"[t]hat's why I started fearing for my life, because it escalated.\" During N.F.'s testimony, Meeds moved to represent himself. The court granted Meeds's motion and Meeds's former counsel remained as advisory counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 A Phoenix police detective, an expert in criminal street gangs, testified that Meeds met at least four criteria identifying him as a member of the Lindo Park Crips criminal street gang. The gang expert testified that he had contact with Meeds two years earlier when Meeds was at Lindo Park with about ten documented Lindo Park Crips. Because of this contact, the gang expert had filled out a \"gang member information card\" (\"GMIC\") on Meeds; a card that officers use to report when potential gang members meet one or more of the gang criteria listed. The gang expert also testified that he had discussed Meeds with senior detectives and discovered several police reports that documented Meeds as a Lindo Park Crip and noted that Meeds often wore baby blue-Lindo Park Crips colors. Meeds objected to the gang expert's testimony about discussions with the senior detectives and about the prior police reports reviewed, which the trial court denied. The gang expert stated that Meeds's text messages to N.F. satisfied the \"written or electronic correspondence\" element of GMIC. The gang expert opined that based on what he heard during trial, Meeds had extensive knowledge of documented gang members, locations within the neighborhood, and gang colors. Thus, the gang expert concluded that \"from the time that I've contacted him in 2014 to this trial,\" Meeds satisfied \"at least four\" of the seven GMIC criteria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 Meeds objected during his cross-examination of the gang expert that the State had violated its disclosure obligations by failing to produce copies of the pre-2014 police reports that the expert referred to for past documentation of Meeds's gang membership. Meeds's advisory counsel informed the court that the gang expert had disclosed the prior police reports in an interview with her before trial. Counsel told the court she had not requested copies of the reports at the time because \"it[ was] not an area [she] would have wanted reports or needed them.\" She also noted that she had given Meeds her notes of the detective's interview, which included the \"years and reports and dates of information\" the detective relayed to her. The court found that the State had not violated its disclosure obligations, but ordered the prosecutor to redact copies of the cited police reports and furnish them to Meeds. Meeds, however, refused to accept the reports and instead moved for dismissal, mistrial, or to strike the expert's testimony. The court treated the motion as seeking reconsideration of the prior ruling and denied it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 The jury convicted Meeds of the charged crimes of stalking and threatening\n   or intimidating, and found that he was a gang member on the dates of the latter offense. The court found that Meeds had been convicted of eight prior felony convictions and sentenced him to concurrent terms totaling 11.25 years' imprisonment. Meeds timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Sufficiency of Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 Meeds argues that insufficient evidence supported his conviction for the class 3 felony of stalking because no evidence showed that the victim feared for her life or the lives of family members. We review de novo the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction.\n   <em>\n    State v. West\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755292\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/226/559/\">\n    226 Ariz. 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 562 \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755292\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/226/559/\">\n    250 P.3d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1191 (2011). We consider both direct and circumstantial evidence to determine if substantial evidence exists to support the jury's verdict.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16. Because substantial evidence supports the jury's verdict, no error occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 Substantial evidence is evidence that reasonable persons could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The statute defines \"immediate family member\" to include any \"person who regularly resides in a person's household[.]\" A.R.S. \u00a7 13-2923(C)(2) (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to support the conviction, was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Meeds engaged in conduct that caused N.F. to fear for her life or for the life of a family member, and that fear was reasonable under the circumstances. N.F. testified that Meeds's conduct and threats had previously escalated before and that is why she feared for her life. Meeds texted N.F. that he was going to blow her face off and that N.F. was going to get herself hurt if she did not acquiesce to his demands. N.F. testified at trial that when Meeds arrived at her place of work she felt threatened and felt that he was going to harm her. Later that evening, Meeds went even further. He texted her a photo of where she lived and stated that her nephew's wife would enjoy his \"firework show.\" N.F. testified that she interpreted this message as a direct threat against the life of her nephew's wife, with whom she lived. Ultimately, Meeds texted N.F. that she and her nephew had 24 hours to leave the city or he would gun them down. This was a direct threat to N.F. and her nephew's lives. Further, the Department of Public Safety detective who interviewed N.F. two days later testified that she appeared to be \"scared shitless.\" He testified that she conveyed to him that she felt her life and her family's lives were in danger. The evidence supports the jury's finding that a reasonable person would have felt threatened and that N.F. subjectively felt that her life was in jeopardy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Gang Expert Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13 Meeds argues next that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing a gang expert to testify to the ultimate issue in this case, based on what other officers told the expert or police reports the expert had read. We ordinarily review a trial court's ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v. Ortiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041916\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/238/329/\">\n    238 Ariz. 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 333 \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4041916\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/238/329/\">\n    360 P.3d 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 129 (App. 2015). Because Meeds did not raise any objection at trial to the expert testimony on the ground it improperly addressed the ultimate issue, however, we review this issue only for fundamental error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Henderson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"648475\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/210/561/\">\n    210 Ariz. 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 568 \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"648475\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/210/561/\">\n    115 P.3d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 608 (2005). On fundamental error review, the defendant has the burden of proving that the court erred, that the error was fundamental in nature, and that he was prejudiced thereby.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"648475\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/210/561/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 567 \u00b6 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"648475\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/210/561/\">\n    115 P.3d at 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 14 Membership in a criminal street gang is an element of the charged offense of threatening or intimidating.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1202(B)(2). A \"criminal street gang member\" is statutorily defined as a person to whom at least two of the following criteria apply: self-proclamation; witness testimony or official statement; written or electronic correspondence; paraphernalia or photographs; tattoos; clothing or colors; or any other indicia of street gang membership.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 13-105(9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 15 The gang expert testified that Meeds met at least four of the criteria, based first on his personal observation of Meeds in 2014 at Lindo Park with about ten other documented criminal street gang members. He testified that he also recognized indicia of Lindo Park Crips' membership in the spelling of the text messages sent to the victim in this case; in the calendar entries on Meeds's cellphone seized upon his arrest; in Meeds's extensive knowledge of the Lindo Park Crips, revealed in his questions of N.F. at trial; and in N.F.'s testimony about Meeds's statements to her about the Crips. The expert testified that based on this evidence, Meeds met at least four criteria for being a criminal street gang member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 16 Meeds offers no argument and cites no authority for the proposition that the gang expert improperly testified on the ultimate issue, and has accordingly arguably waived this claim of error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Moody,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1327335\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/208/424/\">\n    208 Ariz. 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 452 n.9 \u00b6 101,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1327335\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/208/424/\">\n    94 P.3d 1119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1147 (2004) (failure to present significant arguments, supported by authority in an opening brief waives an issue). Moreover, the argument lacks support in both the law and the facts. Arizona Rule of Evidence 704(a) provides that \"[a]n opinion is not objectionable just because it embraces an ultimate issue.\" Rule 704(b) prohibits only an opinion that addresses \"whether the defendant did or did not have a mental state or condition that constitutes an element of the crime charged or of a defense.\" The gang expert did not testify about Meeds's mental state or condition. The gang expert testified only about his own knowledge and experience of the Lindo Park Crips, and offered his opinion that Meeds met at least four criteria for membership in the criminal street gang, based on his review of the evidence and his observations at trial. Meeds's claim of error, even if not waived, is not supported by the law or the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 17 Nor did the court abuse its discretion by overruling Meeds's objection that the expert was improperly relying on hearsay in the police reports and discussions with other police officers. An expert may base an opinion on facts or data that experts in the particular field would reasonably rely on, even if those facts would otherwise be inadmissible at trial, and he may disclose these facts to the jury \"if their probative value in helping the jury evaluate the opinion substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.\" Ariz. R. Evid. 703. The gang expert testified that he reasonably relied upon prior police investigations in forming his opinion. The trial court could have reasonably concluded that the investigations had probative value that substantially outweighed their prejudicial effect because they showed that Meeds met at least two criteria for gang membership even before the threats that occurred in this case. On this record, the court did not abuse its discretion by overruling Meeds's objection to the expert's brief reference to what senior detectives told him and what he learned from other police reports about documentation of Meeds's past gang membership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Purported Disclosure Violation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 18 Meeds argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by failing to disclose police reports or other evidence of Meeds's gang membership and that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his requests for mistrial, dismissal, or to strike the expert's testimony. We review the scope of disclosure required under Rule 15.1 de novo and the trial court's assessment of the adequacy of disclosure for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The disclosure rules require the State to disclose \"[t]he names and addresses of experts who have personally examined ... any evidence in the particular case, together with the results of physical examinations and of scientific tests, experiments or comparisons that have been completed[.]\" Ariz. R. Crim. P. 15.1(b)(4) (2015). The rules also require the State, upon written request, to \"make available to the defendant for examination, testing and reproduction ... [a]ny completed written reports, statements and examination notes made by experts ... in connection with the particular case.\" Ariz. R. Crim. P. 15.1(e)(3) (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 20 Six months before trial, the State disclosed that the gang expert would testify and summarized the subject matter of his testimony. Meeds's advisory counsel confirmed that the expert had disclosed in an interview two weeks before trial the specific police reports that he had reviewed showing past documentation of Meeds's gang membership. Advisory counsel told the court that she did not request copies of the reports when she learned of them before trial because she did not want or need them. She also noted that Meeds had her notes of the detective's interview and that her notes had the information about the pre-2014 reports. The trial court found no disclosure violation had occurred because no obligation existed under the rules to produce this information without a specific request and no such request was made before trial. Meeds has failed to cite any authority for his claim that the prosecutor violated disclosure obligations by failing to furnish his defense counsel with copies of the reports absent her request, and we know of none. On this record, the prosecutor did not engage in misconduct and the court did not abuse its discretion by denying Meeds's request for mistrial or dismissal, or to strike the expert's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

The statute, however, on its face applies only to a person who \"is\" a criminal street gang member. A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1202(B)(2).
