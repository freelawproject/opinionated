It was uncontested that plaintiff's grievances regarding his medical care were unaffected by the transfer, and that the decision to deny plaintiff the procedures he sought was controlled by a centralized Department of Corrections committee, rather than by the superintendent of a particular prison. We allowed review, and now hold that transfers of inmates in circumstances such as these do not render moot an inmate's claim of constitutionally deficient medical care. The trial court's primary concern was that the currently named defendant no longer has custody of plaintiff; that fact, however, does not render the case moot. Accordingly, we remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In September 2015, while incarcerated at Oregon State Penitentiary (OSP), plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Marion County, naming as defendant OSP superintendent Jeff Premo. Plaintiff alleged that he was being denied necessary medical treatment for an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear to one of his knees. He asserted that defendant's conduct amounted to cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, section 16, of the Oregon Constitution. Plaintiff alleged that he had severe pain and mobility problems, and that the Oregon Department of Corrections (DOC) had denied him both an MRI and surgery. The trial court issued the writ, requiring defendant to file a return. In his return, filed in November 2015, defendant asserted that the conditions of plaintiff's confinement were constitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   By the time plaintiff filed his replication in December 2015, DOC had transferred him to Snake River Correctional Institution (SRCI) in Malheur County. In his replication, plaintiff asserted that the alleged deficit in medical care had continued after his transfer, and he reiterated the ongoing problems with his knee. Plaintiff submitted various exhibits, including a letter from his physician who had recommended knee surgery, medical progress notes from DOC documenting his pain and incapacitation, and communications with DOC personnel. Plaintiff also submitted a note from DOC physician Dr. Becker, which recommended an MRI of both knees. Further documentation revealed that Becker's recommendation went to DOC's Therapeutic Level of Care committee (TLC) for review, and that the TLC had denied the MRI for unknown reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After plaintiff filed his replication, defendant moved to dismiss on the ground that plaintiff's claim was moot because of his transfer to SRCI. Defendant argued that the proper defendant in a habeas corpus proceeding is the person having physical custody of the prisoner, and that defendant Premo,\n   the OSP superintendent, no longer had physical custody of plaintiff. Defendant did not challenge the factual assertions in plaintiff's replication, but argued that an Oregon Court of Appeals case,\n   <em>\n    Keenan v.

He submitted a declaration in which he asserted that DOC had transferred him five times since September 2014,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that his medical care at each new institution was based on information contained in records transferred from the institutions where he previously had been incarcerated. At the hearing on defendant's motion to dismiss, defendant admitted that plaintiff's medical care is controlled by \"DOC, generally\" rather than by a particular superintendent. Nevertheless, the trial court granted defendant's motion, agreeing with defendant that plaintiff's claim was moot because defendant Premo no longer had physical custody of plaintiff or authority over his medical care.

Plaintiff argued that his habeas claim was not moot because he continues to suffer from constitutionally deficient medical care, and he provided evidence in the form of letters and medical records in support of his allegations. Defendant did not address plaintiff's factual assertions, and in fact conceded that plaintiff's medical care was controlled by \"DOC, generally\" rather than by the superintendent of a particular prison. Defendant had the burden of demonstrating that the \"effects or consequences\" that plaintiff identified \"are either legally insufficient or factually incorrect.\"\n   <em>\n    A.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12565141\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/412/1169/\">\n    362 Or. at 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12565141\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/412/1169/\">\n    412 P.3d 1169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The habeas court did not hold defendant to that burden of persuasion; rather, it held that plaintiff's case was moot solely because he had been transferred to a new prison and defendant, the superintendent of OSP, did not have custody of plaintiff or control over his medical care. In his briefing to this court, defendant fully acknowledges that the substance of plaintiff's claim did not necessarily become moot upon transfer, because \"[p]laintiff's claim relates to the denial of his requests for an MRI and for surgery[,]\" and \"[t]he evidence supports the conclusion that the Therapeutic Level of Care Committee denied [plaintiff's] request for an MRI[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Consistent with the mootness analysis described above, the plain text of ORS 34.320 indicates legislative intent that the transfer of a habeas plaintiff from one prison to another will not necessarily moot the plaintiff's claim for relief. ORS 34.320 states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"If a [habeas] plaintiff has filed a petition in a court with jurisdiction over the proceedings, and the plaintiff is thereafter transferred to a place that is outside of the jurisdiction of that court, the court shall transfer the proceedings to the circuit court for the judicial district in which the party is imprisoned or restrained. If the court in which the petition was filed determines that by reason of the plaintiff's transfer the claims of the plaintiff do not require immediate judicial scrutiny, or are otherwise subject to dismissal, the court shall dismiss the petition.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   ORS 34.320. The text of ORS 34.320 states that the court \"shall\" transfer a habeas proceeding when the plaintiff is moved to a new jurisdiction, unless the court determines that the plaintiff's claims are subject to dismissal \"by reason of the plaintiff's transfer.\" In other words, pursuant to ORS 34.320, the habeas court makes a case-specific determination as to whether a plaintiff's transfer to a different facility has rendered that plaintiff's case subject to dismissal. ORS 34.320 does not make transfer contingent on a plaintiff filing a new petition or amending his or her pleadings to reflect a change in custody; rather, it states that the court \"shall transfer\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   proceedings\", suggesting transfer of a proceeding that preexisted the plaintiff's move to the new jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The legislative history of ORS 34.320 confirms that understanding. In 1999, the legislature amended ORS 34.320 to add the sentences regarding transfer of jurisdiction. Or. Laws 1999, ch. 114, \u00a7 1. The Oregon Department of Justice requested those amendments to address the common-place occurrence that inmates would file petitions for habeas corpus and subsequently be transferred to facilities in other districts. Testimony, Senate Judiciary Committee, S.B. 395, Feb. 8, 1999, Ex. C (statement of Assistant Attorney General Thomas Castle). Judicial practice at that time was \"not consistent,\" in that some courts ordered transfer of such cases, while others routinely dismissed.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The amendments would allow a habeas case to \"follow\" the plaintiff, unless the court determined that the transfer had altered the plaintiff's circumstances such that his or her claim had become moot.

Neil Bryant) (bill would allow the writ to follow an inmate to the county where he had been moved); Tape Recording, Senate Judiciary Committee, S.B. 395, Feb. 8, 1999, Tape 29, Side A (statement of Judge Ochoa) (dismissal is appropriate when transfer removes the harm at issue); Testimony, Senate Judiciary Committee, S.B. 395, Feb. 8, 1999, Ex. C (statement of Assistant Attorney General Thomas Castle) (\"claims [that] are dependent on the particular institution where the inmate is housed * * * should not survive transfer\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant may be correct that he is not a proper party to this action, and that the habeas pleadings will need to be amended to reflect that fact. As noted, ORS 34.360(1) provides that a habeas corpus petition must state the \"officer or person by whom the party is imprisoned or restrained.\" In\n   <em>\n    Barrett v.

For example, ORS 34.360(1) provides that a habeas corpus petition is required to allege \"the place where, and officer or person by whom the party is imprisoned or restrained, naming both parties if their names are known,\n   <em>\n    or describing them if not known\n   </em>\n   .\" ORS 34.360(1) (emphasis added).

Rather, mootness is a case-by-case determination that the court must make,\n   based on facts regarding the requested relief. In this case, the facts dispositive to the mootness analysis are uncontested. Plaintiff alleged that he continued to suffer from constitutionally deficient medical care, which is controlled by a centralized DOC committee rather than by the superintendent of any specific penitentiary. Defendant did not prove that transfer of plaintiff to SRCI rendered it \"impossible for the court to grant effectual relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Hamel v.

Instead, he acknowledged that decisions regarding plaintiff's medical care were made by \"DOC, generally,\" and otherwise failed to respond to plaintiff's factual assertions. On review in this court, defendant further conceded that the substance of plaintiff's claim did not necessarily become moot upon transfer, because \"[p]laintiff's claim relates to the denial of his requests for an MRI and for surgery[,]\" and \"[t]he evidence supports the conclusion that the Therapeutic Level of Care Committee denied [plaintiff's] request for an MRI[.]\" On that record, the habeas court erred as a matter of law in dismissing plaintiff's habeas claim on mootness grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed. The judgment of the circuit court is reversed, and the case is remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    The parties at oral argument acknowledged that plaintiff has been transferred yet again and is now at the Two Rivers Correctional Institution in Umatilla County.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Defendant has been equivocal about whether he believes the director of DOC could or should have been named as a defendant. He suggested in his brief to this court that the director might be the proper defendant, but at oral argument, he took the position that the superintendent at the facility where plaintiff is currently incarcerated is the only proper defendant, and that DOC might oppose joinder of the DOC director. Given our conclusion regarding the habeas court's ability to bring the necessary parties before the court, we do not address defendant's argument in that regard.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
