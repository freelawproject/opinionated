Gillette, Wright, and Campbell County Fire Fighters\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b66] The City of Gillette, the Town of Wright, and Campbell County formed a Fire Protection Joint Powers Board (the Campbell County Joint Powers Board), which oversees the Campbell County Fire Department (CCFD). CCFD covers 5,000 square miles and responds to \"approximately 2,000 calls for assistance each year.\" CCFD employs two categories of fire fighters: full-time, career fire fighters and volunteer fire fighters. Currently there are 23 career fire fighters and 200 volunteer fire fighters in the CCFD.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b67] Full-time, career fire fighters earn between $35,006.40 and $62,732.80 per year and are scheduled to work up to 240 hours every 28 days. In 2016, CCFD career fire fighters' total payroll was $1,370,916.61. In addition to their salaries, full-time, career fire fighters receive health insurance, dental insurance, flexible benefits plan participation eligibility, basic term-life insurance, supplemental life insurance, long-term disability insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, participation in the Wyoming Retirement System (Paid Firefighter Plan B), vision insurance, deferred compensation, and holiday and sick leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b68] Unlike full-time, career fire fighters, CCFD volunteer fire fighters do not have a set schedule and receive no consequences for refusing a shift. They are not eligible for sick or vacation leave. Like their full-time counterparts, however, volunteers are compensated for their efforts. They earn compensation\n   for responding to incidents and attending trainings and meetings. In 2015, CCFD paid volunteers a total of $213,051.41 for 23,383.56 hours of work, an average of $9.11 per hour. Volunteer fire fighters also receive periodic physical exams (depending on age, every one, two, or three years), Wyoming workers' compensation coverage, supplemental wage coverage, use of CCFD maintenance shop and exercise facilities, CCFD contribution to and participation in the Volunteer Fire Fighter and EMT Pension Account, and unemployment insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b69] In July 2015, a majority of the CCFD career fire fighters voted to select IAFF Local 5058 as their sole and exclusive bargaining agent pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-10-103\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 27-10-103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Full-time, career fire fighters with the rank of Captain or below were eligible to vote for the establishment of IAFF Local 5058. Volunteer fire fighters were not allowed or invited to vote in the election. The IAFF approved the constitution and by-laws of IAFF Local 5058 on September 10, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b610] On July 22, 2015, Bryan Borgialli, president of IAFF Local 5058, advised the Campbell County Joint Powers Board that \"the firefighters of the Campbell County Fire Department have organized as a local union\" and that the IAFF had authorized IAFF Local 5058 to act as their representative. After receiving this notice, the Campbell County Joint Powers Board asked the Campbell County Attorney to request an Attorney General's opinion regarding whether the Campbell County Joint Powers Board is a \"corporate authority\" able to participate in negotiations with IAFF Local 5058, and whether volunteer fire fighters are \"paid members of any regularly constituted fire department,\" who should have been allowed to vote to select a bargaining agent, pursuant to the Wyoming statutes governing collective bargaining for fire fighters. By letter dated September 11, 2015, a copy of which was provided to IAFF Local 5058 President Borgialli, the Campbell County Attorney requested the opinion, and on November 16, 2015, the Wyoming Attorney General's office responded. The Attorney General concluded that the Campbell County Joint Powers Board is the appropriate corporate authority to negotiate with IAFF Local 5058 and that volunteer fire fighters are \"paid members\" of the CCFD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b611] On February 18, 2016, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2027-10-104\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 27-10-104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , IAFF Local 5058 submitted written notice to the Campbell County Joint Powers Board, requesting a meeting to collectively bargain. The Campbell County Joint Powers Board responded on February 25, 2016, and, relying upon the Attorney General's opinion, it concluded that it would \"not recognize Local Union No. 5058 as the collective bargaining unit for the Campbell County Fire Department because the volunteer firefighters were not included in the election process.\" IAFF Local 5058 subsequently filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment, asking the court to find that IAFF Local 5058 is the bargaining agent for the CCFD fire fighters and that the Campbell County Joint Powers Board is obligated to meet and confer with IAFF Local 5058 for collective bargaining, pursuant to the Act. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and the district court held that the volunteers are \"paid members,\" and therefore should have been allowed to participate in the election of the collective bargaining agent. Accordingly, the court ruled IAFF Local 5058 cannot be the collective bargaining agent for the department, granted summary judgment in favor of the Campbell County Joint Powers Board, and dismissed IAFF Local 5058's petition for declaratory relief. This appeal followed and was consolidated with a similar appeal arising from Teton County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Jackson and Teton County Fire Fighters\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b612] The Town of Jackson and Teton County entered into a joint power agreement, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2016-1-105\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 16-1-105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to form a joint fire and emergency medical services department known as the Jackson Hole Fire/EMS Department (JHFD). JHFD employs 18 full-time, career fire fighters; 7 part-time \"pool\" fire fighters; and 79 volunteer fire fighters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b613] JHFD full-time, career fire fighters receive monetary compensation at hourly\n   rates, including double time special event pay if outside of regular shift, and other benefits, including vacation and sick leave, paid holidays, health, dental, and vision insurance, eligibility to participate in a flexible benefits plan, life insurance, blanket accident insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, supplemental life and death and dismemberment insurance, employer contribution to Wyoming Retirement System (Firefighter Plan B), deferred compensation, workers' compensation, unemployment insurance, annual vaccines and immunizations, and annual physical examinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b614] JHFD volunteer and pool fire fighters also receive compensation for their work. Volunteers are paid pay per call for responding to incidents and approved training, and receive hourly pay for ambulance transfers and special events. Pool fire fighters receive hourly pay, including a $1 per hour bonus for each hour worked in each shift completed, and special event pay (double time if the event is outside their normal shift). Volunteer and pool fire fighters in JHFD receive other compensation that includes Wyoming workers' compensation coverage, accidental death and dismemberment insurance,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   blanket accident insurance, and annual vaccines and immunizations. In addition, volunteers receive supplemental insurance benefits, JHFD contribution to the Volunteer Fire Fighter and EMT Pension Account, unemployment insurance, and annual physical exams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b615] On July 13, 2015, the full-time, career fire fighters employed by the JHFD formed the IAFF Local 5067, Jackson Hole Professional Firefighters union. Only \"paid full-time firefighters\" are eligible for membership in IAFF Local 5067. Neither the volunteer nor the pool fire fighters were included in the union voting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b616] On October 26, 2015, John Tobey, the president of IAFF Local 5067, notified Teton County of the formation of the union and its status as the \"sole representative of the full time firefighters of\" the JHFD, and on February 22, 2016, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2027-10-104\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 27-10-104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , IAFF Local 5067 submitted its written request for a meeting to collectively bargain with the Town of Jackson and Teton County. The parties met on February 29, 2016, and during that meeting, IAFF Local 5067 presented a draft collective bargaining agreement. The parties met two more times in March 2016, additional drafts of the collective bargaining agreement were exchanged, and a fourth meeting was scheduled for March 22, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b617] However, on March 20, 2016, an article discussing the Attorney General's opinion and the issues surrounding the recognition of IAFF Local 5058 in Campbell County appeared in the Gillette News Record. After receiving notification of that article, Teton County and the Town of Jackson obtained a copy of the Attorney General's opinion issued in response to the Campbell County Joint Powers Board inquiry. On March 21, 2016, relying upon the Attorney General's opinion, Teton County and the Town of Jackson informed IAFF Local 5067 that they would not recognize the union as the exclusive bargaining agent for the fire fighters and that negotiations would cease. They explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Based on the Wyoming Attorney General's opinion it does not appear that the International Association of Firefighters Local 5067 is the proper entity that is empowered to negotiate on behalf of the firefighters of the Jackson Hole Fire/EMS Department. Wyoming Statute \u00a7 27-10-103 states that the organization that shall be the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for all of the members of the department must be selected by a majority of the firefighters. This does not appear to have occurred since only a very small fraction of the total number of firefighters actually were permitted to vote.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b618] IAFF Local 5067 filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment, asking the court to declare that Teton County and the Town of Jackson were obligated to meet and confer with IAFF Local 5067 for collective bargaining, pursuant to the Act. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and the district court held that the volunteers\n   and pool fire fighters fall under the statutory definition of \"fire fighter,\" and therefore should have been allowed to participate in the election of the collective bargaining agent. Accordingly, the court ruled IAFF Local 5067 is not the collective bargaining agent for the department and granted summary judgment in favor of the Town of Jackson and Teton County. This appeal followed and has been consolidated with IAFF Local 5058's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\u00b619] We affirm summary judgment decision when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

In addition, they receive many other benefits to compensate them for their work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b68.

We therefore find no basis to depart from the plain meaning of the statutory definition of \"fire fighters.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   [\u00b631] Even if we were to consider the context beyond that of the statutory framework and the legislature's stated policy, the \"context\" of the pending cases does not \"require\" a conclusion that only full-time, career fire fighters can collectively bargain. The Unions claim that an interpretation of the statute that includes volunteers as fire fighters who can collectively bargain in the same unit as full-time, career fire fighters would disregard the discrepancy in interests between the full-time and volunteer members of their departments. However, the record belies this contention and illustrates that the full-time and volunteer fire fighters have numerous common interests. Mr. Borgialli, president of IAFF Local 5058, set forth the reason for unionizing in Campbell County in an email to the president of Federated Fire Fighters of Wyoming:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   The points we would like to stay away from is pay, insurance and benefits. Our reason for joining the union at this point is Staffing, Safety, Job Security/Protection, Due Process, and Communication. We do not wish to drive a wedge between career and volunteer staff. We look forward to building a relationship with them and continue\n   to move the fire department in a positive, forward direction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Staffing, safety, and communication are all topics that apply to both full-time, career fire fighters and volunteer fire fighters. Similarly, according to Mr. Tobey, president of IAFF Local 5067, the intent of the proposed collective bargaining agreement in Teton County was to \"ensure public safety, firefighter safety, and utilize best practices for the operation of the department.\" He also asserted that \"equitable working conditions\" was another concern of IAFF Local 5067. Again, these topics are of concern to all fire fighters, not just full-time, career fire fighters. Thus, we cannot conclude that the interests of the full-time and volunteer fire fighters provide a \"context\" that \"requires a different interpretation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   [\u00b632] The Unions also contend that in our examination of \"context,\" we should look to other states' laws regarding collective bargaining for fire fighters. They argue that because other states such as Utah, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Colorado specify that only full-time or permanent members of any fire department are considered \"fire fighters\" for collective bargaining purposes,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   we should likewise conclude that our legislature meant to exclude volunteers from collective bargaining. Those other states' statutes, however, expressly define \"fire fighters\" as either \"permanent\" or \"full time\" employees of their fire departments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   [\u00b633] In contrast, our statute contains no such language.
