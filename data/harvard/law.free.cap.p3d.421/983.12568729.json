This appeal requires us to determine whether this rule extends to an accused's offer to stipulate to a postconviction no-contact order. We hold that it does. We, therefore, reverse Brendan Taylor's conviction for felony violation of a no-contact order and remand for retrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 A no-contact order prohibited Brendan Taylor from being within 1,000 feet of Anna Kelly. But they decided to live together nevertheless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 On Christmas Day of 2016, their landlord drove past their residence and saw Kelly using a snow shovel \"like a hatchet\" against the windshield of Taylor's car. Report of Proceedings (RP) at 140. The landlord called 911.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 When the police arrived, Taylor was gone. Kelly claimed that Taylor had assaulted her. At the time, Taylor was under supervision by the Department of Corrections for a prior offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 The State charged Taylor with several crimes, including the two crimes that are at issue on appeal: felony violation of a no-contact order and escape from community custody.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   PROCEDURE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 The day prior to trial, Taylor chose to plead guilty to some of the charges, including escape from community custody. At the plea hearing, he presented a written statement that provided the factual basis for his plea. The statement reads in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   On or about December 27, 2017 [sic\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ], I did willfully discontinue making myself available to the Department of Corrections for supervision, by making my whereabouts unknown or by failing to maintain contact with the Department as directed by the Community Corrections Office.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 19. Taylor signed the statement, attesting to its accuracy. When asked by the trial court if the statement was true, Taylor responded,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   I was out of gas in Oregon. But it's-Yeah, it's basically true. ... I was making my way to get back up here ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   ... I was on the phone with [my community corrections officer] and then he had left a message that I wasn't going to be able to make an appointment, but it's still-it's still the same as-as missing out on-on that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   RP at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b67 On the morning of trial, Taylor asked that the no-contact order be excluded in light of his stipulation that he knew of its existence. The State responded that it planned on admitting two no-contact orders. The following discussion occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   THE COURT: ... [S]ometimes ... we'll have a case where there's a charge of felon in possession of a firearm,-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   THE COURT: One of the things the state would have to prove is the underlying felony conviction. Often-times the defense will stipulate to that in an effort to avoid the prejudice of having the specific named felony brought into the mix. And I think that's been approved pretty regularly as [an] appropriate thing to do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [THE DEFENSE]: Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [THE STATE]: And the law actually requires two [elements]. The state's-state's not willing to accept the stipulation; we'd like to use the order, both of them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   But there's two elements the state has to prove; number one that there existed a no-contact order, number two that the defendant knew about it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [THE COURT]: ... [Y]ou're saying that the defendant Mr. Taylor is willing to stipulate to both of those things.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [THE DEFENSE]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   RP at 20-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b68 After a short recess, the trial court denied Taylor's request to accept his stipulation in lieu of the no-contact order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b69 At trial, and over Taylor's ER 403 objection, the trial court admitted the no-contact order. The defense asked to review the order, but the court noted, \"I don't see anything on here that's objectionable.\" RP at 183.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b610 The no-contact order was signed by the same judge who presided over the trial. It is entitled a \"Domestic Violence No-Contact Order,\" and is marked \"Post Conviction.\" Plaintiff's Ex. 35 at 1. The trial court's findings of fact are also part of the order. Finding of fact 5 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Based upon the record both written and oral, the court finds that the defendant has been charged with, arrested for, or convicted of a domestic violence offense, that the defendant represents a credible threat to the physical safety of [Kelly], and the court issues this Domestic Violence No-Contact Order ... to prevent possible recurrence of violence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff's Ex. 35 at 2. The date of the order is less than one week before the alleged assault for which Taylor was being tried.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b611 After all of the evidence was presented, the jury convicted Taylor of felony violation of a no-contact order. The trial court sentenced Taylor to five years of imprisonment and one year of community custody. Taylor timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   A. ADMISSION OF NO-CONTACT ORDER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b612 Taylor contends that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his stipulation and admitted the no-contact order. Taylor argues that the rule established in\n   <em>\n    Old Chief\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   and adopted by this court in\n   <em>\n    State v.

That rule requires the trial court to accept the accused's offer to stipulate to his felony status and exclude documentary proof when the accused's felony status is an element of the offense charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b613 The State contends that stipulating to a no-contact order is not the same as stipulating to a prior felony. For the reasons explained below, we disagree. We hold that the trial court abused its discretion under ER 403 when it refused to accept Taylor's offered stipulation and then admitted the postconviction no-contact order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b614 Whether a trial court properly applied ER 403 is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"428712\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/90/54/#p63\">\n    90 Wash.

This risk is particularly high when the prior conviction is for an offense similar to the one for which the accused is currently on trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595223\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/172/#p191\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595223\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/172/#p191\">\n    at 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595223\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/172/#p191\">\n    117 S.Ct. 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b619 Whether the\n   <em>\n    Old Chief\n   </em>\n   doctrine applies with equal effect to postconviction no-contact orders is an issue of first impression. For the reasons set forth below, we hold that the rationale of\n   <em>\n    Old Chief\n   </em>\n   applies to postconviction no-contact orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b620 First, similar to a prior conviction, the existence of a postconviction no-contact order is dependent on a judgment rendered independent of the subsequent charges against the defendant. As with offenses where a prior conviction is an element of the crime-in the present case-the defendant's legal status is at issue.\n   <em>\n    Old Chief\n   </em>\n   held that if the justification for admitting the evidence was to prove some issue other than legal status-such as motive, opportunity, intent, or knowledge-the opposing party could seek the admission of the conviction. Here, Taylor offered to stipulate that the order was an existing order, and he knew of it. The State fails to explain how the order has any relevance beyond that to which Taylor offered to stipulate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b621 Once the defendant stipulates to the existence of, and his knowledge of, the no-contact order, the order itself has no additional probative value. The difference between proof by stipulation and proof by admitting the order is only that the latter will carry a risk of unfair prejudice to the defendant. No-contact orders generally contain prior charges, convictions, and allegations that the defendant acted violently against the victim. They also often include other language that makes the accused appear particularly dangerous or violent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b622 All of these considerations are present here. The no-contact order contained the phrase, \"Post Conviction.\" Plaintiff's Ex. 35 at 1. It told the jury that Taylor had been found guilty of assaulting Kelly not long before the charged felony assault. It further told the jury that Taylor \"represents a credible threat to the physical safety of [Kelly].\" Plaintiff's Ex. 35 at 2. The threat was sufficient that the order required Taylor to immediately surrender all firearms and other dangerous weapons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b623 Here, there was no additional probative value to the no-contact order beyond Taylor's offered stipulation. But the risk of unfair prejudice was substantial. In light of Taylor's offered stipulation, the risk of unfair prejudice from admitting the no-contact order substantially outweighed its probative value. We conclude that the trial court abused its discretion when it admitted the no-contact order and refused to accept Taylor's stipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b624 The State does not argue that the error, if any, was harmless. We therefore reverse Taylor's conviction for felony violation of a no-contact order and remand for retrial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   B. ACCEPTANCE OF GUILTY PLEA TO ESCAPE FROM COMMUNITY CUSTODY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b625 Taylor argues that the trial court violated his due process rights when it accepted his guilty plea to escape from community custody. He contends that the record establishes that his plea was not knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. As a preliminary matter, the State asserts that Taylor may not raise this issue for the first time on appeal. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b626 RAP 2.5(a)(3) provides that \"manifest error affecting a constitutional right\" may be raised for the first time on appeal. We first consider whether the issue raised affects a constitutional right. A defendant gives up constitutional rights by agreeing to plead guilty and, because fundamental rights of the accused are at issue, due process considerations come into play.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Specifically, he seems to claim that he did not\n   <em>\n    willfully\n   </em>\n   commit the offense because his car ran out of gas so he missed a scheduled appointment.
