The King County Superior Court overturned the suspension because of insufficient evidence of compliance with the statutory requirements for blood sample collection and testing. A commissioner of this court granted discretionary review as an issue of public interest. We agree that the Department's evidence failed to prove compliance with the statutory requirements and affirm the superior court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 In November 2015, Singh hit another vehicle while driving his car. The responding police officer attempted to administer a preliminary alcohol breath test. Singh did not speak English and the implied consent warnings for breath testing Were not immediately available in his primary language. When Singh struggled to comply with the responding police officer's directions for the preliminary breath test, the officer decided to forego the breath testing and obtained a search warrant for a blood sample to test for alcohol or drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 Singh was taken to Valley Medical Center, where a phlebotomy technician drew a sample of his blood and sent the sample to the Washington State Toxicology Laboratory. Forensic scientist Elizabeth Wehner tested Singh's blood sample for the presence of alcohol. She prepared a report that included her signed certification that the testing procedures complied with the methods approved by the state toxicologist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 Wehner's certification stipulated that she performed all the testing, and \"technically reviewed all relevant pages of testing documentation in the case record. The tests were administered according to methods approved by the state toxicologist pursuant to [Washington Administrative Code (WAC) ] 448-14-010, - 020, - 030 and/or RCW 46.61.506(3).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wehner's report also identified the lot numbers of the test tubes used to collect and store Singh's blood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 The test showed that Singh's blood alcohol content was 0.20 grams per 100 milliliters, which exceeds the legal limit for driving in Washington.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6 After receiving Singh's arrest report and test results, the Department notified Singh that it intended to suspend his license for 90 days. Singh requested an administrative hearing before a Department hearing examiner to contest the suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 7 At Singh's license revocation hearing, the Department offered as evidence two separate documents: Wehner's certification of the testing process and a \"CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The company that\n   manufactured the tubes created the certificate of compliance. It described the technical specifications for the lot number of the tubes used to collect Singh's blood for testing. The certificate of compliance specified that the tubes were manufactured for blood alcohol determination and certified that the tubes were compliant with the requirements for sterility and additives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 8 Singh argued that the certificate of compliance should be excluded because the document was notarized rather than signed under penalty of perjury. The hearing examiner admitted Wehner's certification of the testing process but excluded the certificate of compliance. The Department did not submit other evidence pertaining to Singh's blood sample and testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 9 Even without the certificate of compliance, the hearing examiner determined that there was prima facie evidence that the analysis of Singh's blood sample complied with the statutory requirements for blood draws and testing. The hearing examiner sustained the Department's suspension of Singh's driver's license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 10 Singh appealed the hearing examiner's decision to King County Superior Court. The superior court ruled that the hearing examiner's conclusion that the blood testing met all statutory requirements was not supported by substantial evidence. The superior court determined that Wehner's conclusory declaration failed to prove compliance with all statutory requirements for blood sample collection and testing. The superior court stated, \"I truly think that she talks about tests, and I just think [that] I would be intellectually dishonest to say the testing includes a finding that the enzyme sample was appropriate and the anticoagulant was present with the-which really relates to the sample itself.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The superior court concluded that the hearing examiner's reliance on this evidence to prove compliance was an error of law and reversed the Department's suspension of Singh's license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 11 The Department petitioned this court for discretionary review as an issue of public interest and because the superior court's decision conflicted with precedent that reviewing courts should not reweigh evidence. A commissioner of this court determined that the Department failed to demonstrate that the superior court's decision was inconsistent with Washington precedent. But the commissioner granted review because the issue involved sufficient public interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12 The Department argues that the forensic scientist's sworn statement certifying compliance with the approved methods for blood alcohol testing establishes a prima facie case of compliance with the statutory requirements for preservation of blood alcohol test evidence. We disagree, as evidence of compliance with the WAC's analytical testing procedures is not evidence of compliance with the mandatory sample preservation requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 13 The implied consent statute provides an informal and streamlined administrative process for hearings in order to avoid lengthy litigation of license suspension and revocation proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Ingram v.

The hearing examiner did not admit the certificate of compliance describing the blood sample collection tubes. The Department offered no other evidence to establish that the collection tubes were chemically clean and contained enzyme poison and anticoagulants as required by WAG 448-14-020(3)(a), (b). Without evidence that the collection tubes met the WAC requirements, the Department did not establish a prima facie case that preservation of Singh's blood complied with the statutory requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 20 According to the Department, Wehner's statement that she administered the tests in accordance with WAC 448-14-010, - 020, - 030 and RCW 46.61.506(3) implies that she ensured that Singh's blood sample was properly preserved in compliance with the requirements of WAC 448-14-020(3). But Wehner's report refers only to the blood tests that she administered. She cannot certify the performance of tasks that she did not perform herself. While her report lists the numbers of the tubes used to collect Singh's blood, Wehner did not provide information about the contents of those tubes. Therefore, Wehner's report lacks the crucial information about the presence of anticoagulants and enzyme poison required to prove compliance with WAC 448-14-020(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 21 The Department argues that Wehner's certification was properly admitted and proved compliance under the lower evidentiary standards of the implied consent statute. While the implied consent statute has a lower threshold for admitting evidence, the Department still has the burden of proving a valid blood test based on compliance with the WAC requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cannon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"103689\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/147/41/#p52\">\n    147 Wash.2d at 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20P.3d%20627\">\n    50 P.3d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; RCW 46.61.506(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 22 Wehner's report was the only evidence offered by the Department to show that the preservation and testing of Singh's blood samples complied with all WAC requirements.
