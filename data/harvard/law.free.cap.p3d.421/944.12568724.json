The statute allows an offender to petition for restoration of firearm rights \"after five or more consecutive years in the community without being convicted ... or currently charged with any felony, gross misdemeanor, or misdemeanor crimes.\" RCW 9.41.040(4)(a)(ii)(A). At issue is whether this required five-year period must immediately precede the petition for restoration or if any conviction-free five-year period suffices. We reverse the Court of Appeals and hold that any five-year conviction-free period satisfies this requirement for eligibility to petition for restoration of firearm rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 In 1991, Edgar Dennis III was convicted of second degree robbery, third degree assault, and two counts of felony violation of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, chapter 69.50 RCW. His convictions disqualified him from possessing a firearm. Dennis was also convicted of third degree assault in 1998. After serving his sentence, he lived in the community for over 15 years without a conviction. Then, in 2014, he was convicted of first degree negligent driving, a misdemeanor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 In April 2016, Dermis petitioned the court for restoration of his firearm rights. He did not disclose his 2014 conviction. The State objected to his petition and informed the court of his 2014 conviction, arguing the statutory requirement of a five-year conviction-free period must immediately precede a petition for restoration. The superior court denied the petition. In a motion for reconsideration, Dennis argued that the trial court had erred in not following the Division Two of the Court of Appeals' interpretation of the statute that any conviction-free five-year period satisfies the requirement.\n   <em>\n    Payseno v\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Kitsap County,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4172226\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/186/465/#p473\">\n    186 Wash.

Dennis argues that the State's interpretation requires reading \"immediately preceding\" into the statute. It is a well-established principle of statutory interpretation that we may not add words \"to an unambiguous statute when the legislature has chosen not to include that language.\"\n   <em>\n    Delgado,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"609197\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/148/723/#p727\">\n    148 Wash.2d at 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=63%20P.3d%20792\">\n    63 P.3d 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . No language in the statute states the five-year period must immediately precede the petition. If the legislature wanted the five-year period to immediately precede a petition for restoration, it would have said so; we may not read language into a statute that is not there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 9 In response, the State argues that the language \"five\n   <em>\n    or more\n   </em>\n   consecutive years\" has no effect unless the five years must immediately precede the petition. Another tenet of statutory interpretation is that we must interpret a statute so as to \"render no portion meaningless or superfluous.\"\n   <em>\n    Rivard v\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    State,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4007614\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/168/775/#p783\">\n    168 Wash.2d 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 783,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=231%20P.3d%20186\">\n    231 P.3d 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). Per this tenet, the State argues that if the legislature had intended any five-year period to qualify, it would have said \"five-year period\" without including the \"or more\" language. As an example, the State points to the washout provision of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1981, chapter 9.94A RCW, that says a class C felony washes out if \"the offender spent five years in the community without committing any crime that subsequently results in a conviction\" since the last date of release from confinement. RCW 9.94A.525(2)(d). The State argues that because of the way the legislature wrote the washout provision, the legislature knew how to establish that any five-year period would suffice, but the legislature instead chose to add the words \"or more\" to signal the five years must immediately precede the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 10 The washout provision is somewhat different from the restoration provision in that an offender's conviction automatically washes out after the required time period, whereas the restoration provision requires affirmative action in the form of a petition from an eligible offender to trigger restoration of rights. Given this procedural distinction, the legislature may have understandably used different language in the restoration provision to put offenders on notice about when they could petition for restoration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 11 The restoration provision cites the washout provision in the last part of the statute: \"if the individual has no prior felony convictions that prohibit the possession of a firearm counted as part of the offender score under RCW 9.94A.525.\" RCW 9.41.040(4)(a)(ii)(A). Dennis argues this reference to the washout provision is crucial to understanding the legislature's inclusion of the words \"or more.\" Dennis's argument situates the language at issue within the context of the restoration provision as a whole. For a class C felony, the washout provision is five years, so an offender does not need to wait any more than the five years already required by the restoration provision. RCW 9.94A.525(2)(c). The washout period for a class B felony is 10 years, so depending on his or her criminal history, not every offender\n   will be able to petition five years after his or her last conviction. RCW 9.94A.525(2)(b). Thus, the \"or more\" language lets those petitioners who must wait more than five years know that they can still petition once any prior convictions that would affect their offender scores have washed out. Class A felonies and felony sex offenses never wash out, so offenders who have committed those crimes will never be able to petition for restoration of their firearm rights. RCW 9.94A.525(2)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 12 Although not necessary for our interpretation of the restoration provision's plain language, a review of the bill reports supports Dennis's argument. The final bill report states that an offender may petition for restoration of firearm rights \"after five years in the community without a conviction or current charge for any crime,\" but \"the person must also have passed the 'washout' period under the Sentencing Reform Act before he or she may petition the court.\" FINAL B. REP. ON SUBSTITUTE H.B. 2420, at 2, 54th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 1996). Thus, the legislature seemed focused on offenders' prior convictions washing out before they could become eligible to petition for restoration of firearm rights. The \"or more\" language reflects the legislature's concern for those offenders who may need to wait more than five years to petition while their prior convictions wash out. This interpretation is consistent with our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Rivard,\n   </em>\n   where we held that \"prior felony convictions\" refers only to felonies occurring prior to the offense that causes an offender's loss of firearm rights.\n   <em>\n    Rivard,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4007614\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/168/775/#p783\">\n    168 Wash.2d at 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=231%20P.3d%20186\">\n    231 P.3d 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Although [an offender] had remained crime-free for the requisite 5 years for the purpose of his disabling felony, a prior conviction still included in his offender score delays his eligibility.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 13 The parties also dispute the significance of the language that a petitioner may not petition if he or she is \"currently charged with any felony, gross misdemeanor, or misdemeanor crimes.\" RCW 9.41.040(4)(a)(ii)(A). \"[Statutes should receive a sensible construction to effect the legislative intent and, if possible, to avoid unjust and absurd consequences.\"\n   <em>\n    State v\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Vela,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1142054\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/100/636/#p641\">\n    100 Wash.2d 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 641,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=673%20P.2d%20185\">\n    673 P.2d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983) (citing\n   <em>\n    Crown Zellerbach Corp. v\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Labor &amp; Indus.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1151215\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/98/102/\">\n    98 Wash.2d 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=653%20P.2d%20626\">\n    653 P.2d 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982) ). The State points out that the statute does not limit pending charges only to those crimes that would result in the renewed loss of firearm rights but instead prevents restoration when any charges are pending. Thus, the State argues the only logical reading of the statute is that the legislature did not want courts to restore firearm rights while any new criminal charges were pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 Dennis argues that the prohibition on petitioning while charges are pending makes sense because in any given case, charges may be amended upward, even from a misdemeanor charge, meaning someone facing charges could possibly petition for restoration only to be disqualified upon conviction for a crime that results in the loss of firearm rights. If an offender who is otherwise eligible to petition for restoration is facing current misdemeanor charges, one of three things may happen. First, the charge could be amended upward to a felony. If convicted, even if the offender had already satisfied the five-year requirement, the felony conviction would start the clock over and the offender would not be eligible to petition. Second, as in Dennis's situation, the charge could result in a misdemeanor conviction. Because he has already satisfied the five-year requirement, his misdemeanor conviction does not prevent him from successfully petitioning. Third, the charge could be dismissed, which the State seems to agree would not affect eligibility to petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 The State argues, and the Court of Appeals below agreed, that Dennis's interpretation would lead to absurd results because under his interpretation, an offender cannot petition while a misdemeanor charge is pending, but the moment he or she is convicted of that misdemeanor he or she can successfully petition for restoration of firearm rights. We disagree-it is not an absurd result to read and apply a statute as expressly written; the provision's plain language states that an offender may not petition while a charge is pending, nothing more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16 The State further argues that Dennis's interpretation would lead to absurd results\n   because a person could be convicted of hundreds of misdemeanors after a five-year conviction-free period and still recover his or her firearm rights. This ominous prediction does not seem to be an absurd result because the legislature has created a specific list of crimes that result in the loss of firearms, and Dennis's negligent driving conviction is not on that list.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whether it is 1 misdemeanor conviction, a dozen, or 100, the statutory language does not change. Dennis has lived in the community without a conviction for over a decade and has satisfied the five-year conviction-free period; a simple misdemeanor conviction does not prevent restoration of firearm rights to an offender who has otherwise met the statutory requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 17 Dennis points out that had he petitioned once the five-year period had run, his rights would have been restored and his later misdemeanor conviction would not disqualify him from possessing a firearm. He argues that the State's interpretation leads to absurd results because it arbitrarily rewards the petitioner who rushes into court as soon as five years have passed. Given that a court's role in the restoration process is purely ministerial, the precipitating event for eligibility for restoration is when the statutory requirements are met, not when the petition is filed.

If the legislature intended the five-year period to immediately precede a petition for restoration, it could have said so, but where the legislature omits language from a statute, we may not read language into the statute.\n   <em>\n    State v\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Moses,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314615\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/145/370/#p374\">\n    145 Wash.2d 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 374,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20P.3d%201216\">\n    37 P.3d 1216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002) (citing\n   <em>\n    Jenkins v\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Bellingham Mun.

One of those prerequisites is that the petitioner must be crime-free for at least five years at the time of petition. The majority concludes that a person previously convicted of a felony may successfully petition for the restoration of their firearm rights, even if they have had a new conviction in the last five years, so long as they were crime-free for five years at some point in the past.

Because of these convictions, Dennis lost his right to possess firearms. He had the opportunity to restore that right. Dennis remained crime-free for 16 years following his last conviction in 1998, but, in 2014, two years before petitioning for the restoration of his firearm rights, Dennis was convicted of first degree negligent driving-a misdemeanor.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    \u00b6 24 Under the majority's interpretation, Dennis would be prohibited from petitioning to restore his firearm rights while charged, but not after conviction because first degree negligent driving is a misdemeanor.

A person whose firearm rights have been lost because of a felony conviction and who is later convicted for a crime that itself typically does not result in the loss of firearm rights (for example, misdemeanor negligent driving) remains barred from restoring their right to possess a firearm.

The restoration provision at issue was included in the Hard Time for Armed Crime Act, which enhanced sentencing to \"sufficiently stigmatize the carrying and use of deadly weapons by criminals.\" LAWS OF 1995, ch. 129, \u00a7 1(c). Before 1995, the\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    people eligible for restoration were those who lost their rights to possess firearms because they were convicted of three or more DWIs (driving while intoxicated) in five years, and those who had been involuntarily committed. LAWS OF 1994, 1st Spec. Sess., ch. 7, \u00a7 404(2), (3), (4)(a)(i). In addition, before 1995, the law did \"not provide similar procedures for the other\n    classes of people who are subject to unlawful possession of a firearm.\" H.B. REP. ON INITIATIVE 159, at 2, 54th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 1995). Thus, it is highly unlikely, given this history, that the people intended to prevent someone from possessing a firearm while a misdemeanor charge was pending, but then allow that the same person to obtain a firearm following a conviction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    \u00b6 26 The majority spends a considerable amount of time parsing out the statutory meaning of \"or more.\" The phrase \"or more\" simply denotes that an offender must be\n    <em>\n     crime-free\n    </em>\n    for a minimum of five years in order to petition for restoration. RCW 9.41.040(4) requires no involvement in criminal activity at for least five years, while recognizing the petitioner may have more than five crime-free years at the time of petition. Dennis remained crime-free for at least five years before being convicted again in 2014. Once Dennis was charged and convicted, the clock restarted. Dennis is eligible to petition for the restoration of his firearm rights five years after his\n    <em>\n     2014 conviction,\n    </em>\n    which, if he remains crime-free, is next year. RCW 9.41.040(4) places the responsibility on the defendant to petition for the restoration of their firearm rights. Here, Dennis' opportunity to restore his right lapsed because of his own criminal behavior.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    \u00b6 27 Because the majority would restore Dennis' firearm rights sooner than the people intended, I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Fairhurst, C.J.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Yu, J.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
