We affirm and address the following issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Did the District Court err by quashing Boehm's petition for writ of mandate?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Boehm owns property located in the 9th Street island floodplain on the Yellowstone River near Livingston. Boehm operated an unpermitted \"cesspool\" septic system on the property, and wanted to install a permitted septic system. On March 24, 2016, Boehm submitted a septic permit application to the Park County Environmental Health Department. On March 29, Park County Sanitarian and Floodplain Administrator, Barbara Woodbury, approved the application and issued a permit for Boehm to construct the system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Soon thereafter, Woodbury retired and Park County appointed Craig Caes as the new Sanitarian. Caes reviewed Boehm's application and identified several deficiencies that would, in his determination, allow the proposed septic system to be operated in violation of the Park County Water Onsite Treatment Regulations (Regulations), and potentially create a threat to public health. Consequently, on May 27, Caes mailed Boehm a certified letter informing him the permit issued to him \"has been voided\" and instructing him to cease construction of the septic system, citing the following grounds, in summary:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (1) Boehm had failed to complete the required section on the permit application indicating that the property was in a floodplain, the omission of which constituted a material misrepresentation under Regulation 9.2, entitling Caes to void the permit;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (2) Because Boehm had failed to disclose that his property was in a floodplain, the required floodplain 100-foot setback boundary had not been addressed\n   in the application, in violation of Admin. R. Mont. 17.36.918(1); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (3) Boehm had incorrectly classified his proposed septic system as being a \"replacement\" system rather than a \"new\" system, as there had never been a permitted system in place on Boehm's property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the letter, Caes addressed re-applying for a permit to construct a \"new\" septic system and complying with the floodplain requirements, including the need for a variance from the Park County Board of Health, but also advised that \"variances are not guaranteed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b64 Boehm filed a Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for\n   Libel in the District Court, seeking an order \"directing that Park County rescind its cease and desist order of May 27, 2016.\" Park County moved for summary judgment, which the District Court granted, quashing Boehm's petition. The court reasoned that Boehm was not seeking to enforce a legal duty not yet performed, but rather \"to undo the action already taken by Park County, that of voiding his Septic Permit,\" which was, \"as a matter of law, not a simple, ministerial task,\" but instead a discretionary action. Thus, the court determined that a writ of mandate was inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b65 Boehm appeals the denial of his petition for writ of mandate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b66 We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   a district court's grant or denial of summary judgment, applying the same criteria of M.

Caes' authority as Sanitarian for the Park County Board of Health originates with \u00a7 50-2-116, MCA, which allows the Board to \"identify, assess, prevent and ameliorate conditions of public health\" and \"bring and pursue actions and issue orders necessary to abate, restrain, or prosecute the violation of public health laws, rules, and local regulations.\" Pursuant thereto, the Park County Regulations were adopted to ensure the \"[s]afe disposal of all human and domestic wastes ... to protect the health of the individual family and community and to prevent the occurrence of nuisances.\" Regulations, Purpose. Generally, the Regulations explain that when the regulatory \"criteria are met, and where soil and site conditions are favorable,\" individual sewage disposal\n   systems can provide \"safe and satisfactory service.\" Regulations, Purpose. Septic permits may be issued only \"upon compliance by the Applicant with provisions of these regulations.\" Regulations, 4.5. The Sanitarian may deny a permit if the proposed treatment system will not comply with the regulations, or the applicant has failed to supply all necessary data for the Sanitarian to decide whether the system is or is not compliant.

Regulations, 4.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b615 Caes attested that he voided the permit because Boehm's application failed to disclose material information that would aid in the County's review and decision on the permit, and because Caes wished \"to protect public health and a Montana waterway that could be negatively affected by [Boehm's] non-complaint Septic System and Drainfield.\" Therefore, Caes's voiding of the permit was a discretionary action in response to a public health concern, not a matter of him failing to act in violation of a duty to act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Statutes governing local boards commonly make express reference to those boards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 75-5-305(3), MCA (\"An applicant for a variance from minimum requirements adopted by a local board of health pursuant to 50-2-116 may appeal the local board of health's final decision to the department ....\"). Park County adopted local regulations pursuant to statutory authority\n   provided by \u00a7 50-2-116, MCA, entitled \"Powers and duties of local boards of health,\" including regulations governing the notice and process to be followed by the Park County Sanitarian for asserted violations of local regulations. Regulations, 1.1. The Regulations provide that \"[A]ny denial of a Permit shall be made with detailed reasons for such a denial ....\" Regulations, 6.6. The notice \"shall be in writing and shall state the violation, the required corrective action, and provide a reasonable time for correction.\" Regulations, 9.1. The Regulations also address the remedy available to applicants for adverse decisions. Regulations, 6.7 (\"Decisions made by the Park County Board of Health may be appealed to the Montana Department of Environmental Quality pursuant to A.R.M. 17.36.924.\"). A decision by the Department is further \"appealable to the district court under the provisions of Title 2, chapter 4, part 7.\" Section 75-5-305(5), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b618 Caes' letter to Boehm gave notice of his decision and referenced potential remedies for him to pursue, including re-applying and seeking a variance, in accordance with Park County Regulations. Boehm could have corrected his application, addressed the floodplain issues, and/or applied for a variance. If denied a permit, Boehm could have appealed to the Department and, if necessary, to the district court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Admin. R. Mont. 17.36.924; \u00a7 75-5-305, MCA.

Assuming,\n    <em>\n     arguendo\n    </em>\n    , that this proposition as stated is correct, Boehm failed to make any showing that Caes' voidance of the previously-issued permit out of his concern for public health over the installation, as proposed, of a septic system on a floodplain, was impermissible under the Regulations, or that it amounted to a failure to exercise discretion at all.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
