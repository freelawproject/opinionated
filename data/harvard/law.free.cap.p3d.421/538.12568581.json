Did the district court err when it found that Mr. Larson breached the contract before Burton Construction, Inc.'s performance was due by making a clearly erroneous finding of fact, and as a matter of law?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b63] In December 2015, Ken Burton, on behalf of Burton Construction, Inc.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Mr. Larson entered into a written contract (the Contract) in which Mr. Larson agreed to purchase from Burton a 2015 Skyline mobile home for $43,000. The Contract was a \"form\" contract, consisting of boilerplate provisions and blank lines on which parties could enter information. Mr. Larson's agent completed the form by hand, obtained Mr. Larson's signature, and delivered the document to Burton with $500 in earnest money. Burton went through the Contract carefully, made a few minor changes, and countersigned it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b64] Although the Skyline mobile home was new and the parties intended to convey a new mobile home, the form was designed for the sale of a used mobile home. Thus, the Contract required Burton, as the \"Owner\" of the mobile home, to execute and deliver a Wyoming title at closing (handwritten portions in italics):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   6. At closing, Owner shall execute and deliver a Wyoming title and Bill of Sale free and clear of all liens and encumbrances except:\n   <em>\n    all will be free and clear\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   7. Title shall be conveyed to the following named purchaser(s):\n   <em>\n    Justin James Larson\n   </em>\n   as\n   <em>\n    Sole Owner\n   </em>\n   . Title and the Bill of Sale shall be executed but escrowed if sold under contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   8. Title shall be merchantable in the Seller, except as stated in this paragraph. Subject to payment or tender as above provided and compliance with other terms and conditions hereunder by Purchaser, the Seller shall execute and deliver a good and sufficient title in favor of those persons named in Paragraph 7 above, and a good and sufficient Bill of Sale, and deliver the same to said Purchaser at closing, which shall occur on or before\n   <em>\n    January 15, 2016\n   </em>\n   , conveying said personal properties free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, except:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (a) Personal property taxes for\n   <em>\n    2016\n   </em>\n   , which shall be prorated to date of closing;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (b) Purchaser shall be responsible for sales tax, if any.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b65] Despite the Contract's clear language, Burton testified that it was not his custom to deliver a Wyoming title to purchasers of new mobile homes at closing. As a reseller, Burton did not take title himself. Burton would purchase the mobile home from the manufacturer with borrowed funds, and the manufacturer would deliver the mobile home with a Manufacturer's Certificate of Origin (MCO). The lender held the MCO as collateral until the mobile home was sold. At closing, Burton would use the purchaser's funds to repay the lender, and the lender would return the MCO. Burton would collect sales tax from the purchaser, submit it to the state, and\n   record the taxes as paid on the Bill of Sale. Under his reseller's tax exemption, Burton would pay no sales tax on his initial purchase from the manufacturer so long as he resold the mobile home directly to the consumer. After closing, Burton or the purchaser would bring the MCO and the Bill of Sale to the County Treasurer to issue a Wyoming title in the purchaser's name as the first assignee of the mobile home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b66] Accordingly, Burton never intended to deliver a Wyoming title to Mr. Larson at closing because \"[t]hat's not how you do it.\" Burton testified that he \"couldn't\" deliver the Wyoming title at closing for three reasons. First, he would have to repay his lender in full to obtain the MCO necessary to issue title, which he presumably could not do before receiving Mr. Larson's purchase money. Second, if Burton obtained a Wyoming title before closing, he would become the first \"owner\" of the mobile home, which would require him to pay sales tax on his initial purchase of the mobile home from the manufacturer, and, because the State of Wyoming taxes only the first sale of a mobile home, Mr. Larson would pay no sales tax on his purchase from Burton.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, Burton testified that the manufacturer's warranty extended only to the first titleholder. Mr. Larson, as the second titleholder, would be deprived of the warranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b67] Burton's realtor, however, did not know the difference between an MCO and a Wyoming title. Thus, each time the escrow officer inquired, the realtor confirmed that Burton would deliver a Wyoming title for the closing. Based on the language of the Contract, confirmed by the realtor's assurances, the escrow officer expected Burton to deliver a Wyoming title at closing and therefore prepared settlement statements indicating that no sales tax was due from Mr. Larson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b68] When the parties agreed to move the closing date forward by two days, the escrow officer and the parties' agents rushed to assemble the paperwork. Shortly before closing, for the first time, Burton instructed his realtor to pick up the MCO from his lender and bring it to the escrow officer. When Mr. Larson's agent arrived at closing, she discovered that Burton had provided an MCO instead of a Wyoming title, which added $1,806 in sales tax to Mr. Larson's purchase obligation. She called Mr. Larson, who was outside the building:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   A. [Mr. Larson] ... She actually called me and told me what the deal was; that I was required to pay $1,800 more for sales tax that was never agreed upon anywhere, or had ever showed up on anywhere, even in our closing paper that we had.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   And, I said, \"Well, that's not what we agreed to. We agreed to the 43,000-something.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Q. [Burton's counsel] Well, did you ever look at the Contract and ask her about Page 2, Line 61, that said you promised to pay the sales tax at that point?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A. No, because I saw up here on the-What line is it?-like, 49 and 50, it says all will be free and clear. She'll deliver a Wyoming Bill of Sale and a, and a Title, and it will all be free and clear, meaning, to me, that there was nothing above and beyond after what we had agreed upon the price of the house.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   I had to pay the closing cost and whatever. The only thing I would have to pay after that would be the ten or $15 at the Courthouse to transfer the Title from Mr. Burton's name to my name.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b69] Mr. Larson never entered the building. He cancelled the closing before Burton arrived, refusing to complete the sale upon the delivery of an MCO instead of a title. That same day, Mr. Larson sent a letter to Burton requesting the return of his earnest money and declaring the Contract null and void due to, among other things, Burton's failure to deliver a Wyoming title. Burton's attempts to reschedule the closing before the January 15 deadline failed. Mr. Larson would not close the sale without Burton providing a Wyoming title, which Burton would not do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b610] Burton brought suit in circuit court for breach of contract, seeking either specific performance or damages, as well as attorney fees and costs. After a bench trial, the circuit court found that the parties made a mutual mistake, cancelled the Contract, and ordered Burton to return Mr. Larson's earnest money. On appeal, the district court reversed, ruling that the circuit court erroneously applied the doctrine of mutual mistake, that it was \"factually unknown\" whether Burton delivered a Wyoming title at closing, and that Mr. Larson breached the Contract when he refused to attend closing and to pay sales tax. Pursuant to W.R.A.P. 13, we granted Mr. Larson's petition for writ of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I.

The Buyer, his agent and Seller knew that the purchase agreement was for a new mobile home. When reading the contract in its entirety [it] is ... clear that the contract contemplates the transfer of a currently titled or pre-owned mobile home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   [\u00b613] The district court determined that the circuit court improperly applied the doctrine of mutual mistake-a conclusion with which we agree. \"Our first task ... is to define precisely the mutual mistake that is purportedly at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Gumpel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12343846\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/393/1279/\">\n    2017 WY 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 76,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12343846\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/393/1279/\">\n    393 P.3d at 1299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The circuit court identified the parties' antecedent agreement to be that the mobile home was new. The purported mistake was that the Contract contemplated the sale of a used mobile home. Whether the mobile home was \"new\" is not at issue. The purported mistake at issue is the process of the purchase transaction-in particular, whether the Contract mistakenly required either Burton to deliver a Wyoming title at closing or Mr. Larson to pay sales tax. The record contains no suggestion, let alone clear and convincing evidence, that the parties had an antecedent agreement as to the details of how ownership would be transferred to Mr. Larson. Specifically, the record does not show that prior to the Contract the parties had agreed that Burton would deliver an MCO or that Mr. Larson would necessarily pay sales tax on the transaction. With no prior agreement, the first element of a mutual mistake is unproven and we go no further. The district court correctly found that the circuit court erred as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

The district court disagreed, concluding that it is \"factually unknown\" whether Burton delivered a Wyoming title at closing because Mr. Larson abandoned the closing before Burton arrived. The district court instead held Mr. Larson in breach, finding that he refused to attend closing and tender sales tax as required by the Contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [\u00b615] To prove a breach of contract, the proponent must show \"a lawfully enforceable contract, an unjustified failure to timely perform all or any part of what is promised therein, and entitlement of injured party to damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Schlinger v.

Here, the Contract is lawfully enforceable. Mr. Larson delivered the Contract to Burton with his signature and $500 earnest money as an offer to purchase the mobile home. Burton countersigned and accepted the earnest money, thus perfecting the Contract. Next, the Contract entitles a nonbreaching party to damages.

Here, the Contract plainly requires Burton's delivery of a Wyoming title. In this light, the Contract requires Mr. Larson to pay the sales tax associated with Burton's delivery of a Wyoming title.

To obtain a Wyoming title before closing, Burton would become the first\n   owner of the mobile home and would have to pay sales tax on his initial purchase of the mobile home from the manufacturer. The State of Wyoming taxes only the first sale of a mobile home.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2039-15-101\">\n    Wyo.

Although Burton testified that by obtaining a Wyoming title, the mobile home would no longer be \"new,\" thus voiding the warranty to Mr. Larson; he also testified that he never discussed this concept with Mr. Larson. In fact, there is no evidence of any agreement regarding a warranty at the time the Contract was made: the listing agent could not say for sure that the online listing advertised the mobile home as having a warranty, and the Contract did not refer to a warranty. The only evidence that the parties discussed a warranty was testimony of a conversation that occurred during a walk-through of the mobile home after the Contract was signed, just before closing. \"Our primary purpose is to determine the true intent and understanding of the parties\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     at the time and place the agreement was made\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Pennaco Energy, Inc. v.

In preparation for the rescheduled closing, he directed the escrow officer to create a new settlement sheet showing an additional $1,806 in sales tax due from Mr. Larson, based on his planned delivery of an MCO.

It is equally as impossible to conclude that the contract required Burton to provide an official title. This inconsistency between the written language in the contract about the documents to be used to transfer ownership and the actual method used in these transactions is a latent ambiguity. As a result, we must look at the evidence to determine the parties' intent about the documents to be used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Sales Tax\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   [\u00b643] The evidence indicates that Mr. Larson's true complaint with the process of closing on the purchase of the new mobile home was not with the documents used to obtain title, but instead with his obligation to pay sales tax associated with the transfer. He argues that the written contract his broker prepared required Burton to transfer the mobile home to him \"free and clear,\" and that this requirement eliminates any obligation for Mr. Larson to pay sales tax. This position ignores the plain language in the contract stating Mr. Larson \"will be responsible for sales tax, if any.\" This portion of the parties' contract is not ambiguous. It obligated Burton to provide \"free and clear\" title (without specifying the type of documents used), and obligated Mr. Larson to pay any sales tax associated with the transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   There is no other reasonable interpretation of this language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Uniform Commercial Code\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   [\u00b644] The majority opinion correctly points out the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in Wyoming applies to this transaction, even though the parties did not present arguments based on the UCC.

Because he did not (and could not) the majority then concludes Mr. Larson was permitted to reject the transaction and terminate the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   [\u00b645] Other portions of the UCC, however, show that in this circumstance Mr. Larson was required to accept the manufacturer's certificate of origin as the document used to transfer title. Assuming the parties' contract actually required Burton to provide an official certificate of title, when the buyer (Mr. Larson) objected to the certificate of origin, the UCC then required the seller (Burton) be given the opportunity to cure the defect (\u00a7 34.1-2-508) or to substitute (\u00a7 34.1-2-504 and 614). The official UCC comment to \u00a7 34.1-2-504 addresses the exact situation present here, stating \"when a prescribed document cannot be procured, a question of fact arises under the provision of the Article on substituted performance as to whether the agreed manner of delivery is actually commercially impracticable and whether the substitute is commercially reasonable.\" In this case, the evidence showed it was not just impracticable, but impossible, for a dealer to provide a title on a new mobile home. The evidence also showed that a manufacturer's certificate of origin was not only reasonable, but was the statutorily recognized method of transferring title on a new mobile home.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2034.1-2-614\">\n    Wyo.

The evidence is uncontroverted and uncomplicated. No evidence was presented indicating that either party anticipated or required that the transfer be accomplished by delivery of an official certificate of title. Rather, the clear intention of the parties was that Burton provide Mr. Larson with the necessary documentation for Mr. Larson to obtain a certificate of title, free and clear. The clear intention of the parties was that Mr. Larson would pay any sales tax associated with the transaction. The contract in this case should be interpreted in accordance with this obvious, uncontroverted intent.
