Leon's appeal to the Pima County Superior Court argued the justice court \"err[ed] as a matter of law in finding that benzoylecgonine [ (BE) ], an inactive metabolite of cocaine, satisfied the requirement of a metabolite of a drug as used in [ \u00a7 28-1381(A)(3) ]\" and in its related instructions to the jury. The respondent judge affirmed Leon's conviction, and this special action petition followed.

As set forth in the respondent judge's ruling, in May 2015, law enforcement officers were responding to a single-vehicle accident in the median of I-19 when they made contact with Leon, who was standing by his broken-down truck. After conducting field sobriety tests and suspecting impairment, the officers charged Leon with driving under the influence in violation of \u00a7 28-1381(A)(1) and (2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and conducted a blood draw. Leon's blood tests were negative for the presence of alcohol, but positive for two drug metabolites, Carboxy-THC\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and BE. The state eventually amended the charges to replace the count related to alcohol concentration, \u00a7 28-1381(A)(2), with a charge under \u00a7 28-1381(A)(3), which proscribes driving \"[w]hile there is any drug defined in [A.R.S.] \u00a7 13-3401 or its metabolite in the person's body.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Justice Court Proceedings and Jury Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 Relying on\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324600\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/234/343/\">\n    234 Ariz. 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324600\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/234/343/\">\n    322 P.3d 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Leon filed a pretrial motion to dismiss the \u00a7 28-1381(A)(3) charge, arguing he could not be convicted for the presence of Carboxy-THC, a metabolite of cannabis, or BE, a metabolite of cocaine, because neither metabolite \"can cause impairment\" and they are instead \"by-products of the breakdown of other substances.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The justice court denied\n   the motion as to BE, citing the lack of expert testimony \"to suggest that a BE metabolite is non-impairing or at what rate it becomes non-impairing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 Leon renewed his argument just before trial, when the justice court was settling jury instructions. He asked the court to include the following instruction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"Metabolite,\" as used in these instructions, means only a metabolite that itself is capable of causing impairment. Thus, to prove a violation of A.R.S. \u00a7 28-1381(A)(3) based on metabolites of proscribed drugs, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that any metabolite found in the blood of Jorge Leon while he was driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle is both a metabolite of a proscribed drug AND the metabolite is capable of causing impairment in and of itself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The state conceded that BE was a non-impairing metabolite, but it opposed any such instruction, arguing that \u00a7 28-1381(A)(3) is a \"strict liability\" statute and \"that the\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   case is expressly limited to Carboxy[-]THC because of the nature of how it metabolizes, whereas cocaine, which is a very fast metabolizing drug, will metabolize very quickly in the system.\" The court agreed with the state and denied Leon's request, stating it would instruct the jury using the language of the statute, but modified, as urged by the state, to replace \"any drug defined in \u00a7 13-3401 or its metabolite\" with \"[BE], a metabolite of cocaine.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 6 At trial, a forensic scientist for the Arizona Department of Public Safety testified Leon's blood sample contained BE, \"one of the main metabolites of cocaine.\" She explained that cocaine metabolizes rapidly, would remain present in someone's blood for \"just a few hours,\" and continues to metabolize after blood is drawn. In contrast, she said BE, as a metabolite of cocaine, would be detectable for \"about a day,\" or, in the case of \"chronic heavy binges,\" \"up to ... five days.\" She explained cocaine is a stimulant drug that has multiple effects; BE, in contrast, is \"an inactive metabolite, which means it's not having any effect on the body.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 7 In moving for acquittal pursuant to Rule 20, Ariz. R. Crim. P., Leon's attorney argued, \"Because of the jury instruction on the [ \u00a7 28-1381(A)(3) charge], I must concede that there is substantial evidence to go to the jury,\" but added, \"I would disagree with the jury instruction and I believe it doesn't accurately state the law[ ] that now stands.\" With respect to the \u00a7 28-1381(A)(3) charge, the justice court instructed the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The State has charged the Defendant with driving or being in actual physical control of a motor vehicle within the State while there is BE in the Defendant's body.... The central elements that the State ... must prove are:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   1. The Defendant was driving [or in] actual physical control of a motor vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   2. This occurred within Pima County, Arizona, at or near the vicinity and on ... or about the time alleged in the Complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   3. That at the time of the driving o[r] being in actual physical control of the vehicle, a drug [BE], a metabolite of cocaine[,] was in the Defendant's body.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The jury acquitted Leon of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs while impaired to the slightest degree,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 28-1381(A)(1), but convicted him of the \u00a7 28-1381(A)(3) charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Appeal to Superior Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 8 Leon appealed from his conviction, again relying on our supreme court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   . He argued the trial court had erred as a matter of law in rejecting his proposed instruction and \"in ruling that a non-impairing metabolite of a drug satisfied the prohibition of [ \u00a7 28-1381(A)(3) ],\" thereby resulting in his wrongful conviction under that section of the statute. In its answering brief on appeal, the state again characterized\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   as \"a narrow decision addressing only Carboxy-THC.\" It argued BE is distinguishable because \"[c]ocaine is quickly metabolized directly into BE\" and Carboxy-THC \"is a second metabolite of THC and can stay in a\n   person's body for as many as twenty-eight to thirty days.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 9 In affirming Leon's conviction, the respondent judge concluded the justice court had not erred in rejecting Leon's proposed jury instruction or \"in ruling that the prohibition of the statute is satisfied by a non-impairing metabolite of a drug.\" The respondent further concluded the court's final jury instructions \"did not misstate the law or the statute.\" Citing \"distinctive\" features of BE and this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v.

In response, no longer relying on the authorities it cited in the courts below, the state argues the holding in\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   \"should not be extended to BE because of the numerous differences between BE and Carboxy-THC.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 11 Special action relief is available for a respondent's abuse of discretion, Ariz.

The court found the statute's reference to \"its metabolite\" ambiguous, and it engaged in analysis to construe the statute \"sensibly\" and consistent with legislative intent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. The court rejected the state's suggestion \"that 'its metabolite' includes\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   byproduct of a drug listed in \u00a7 13-3401,\" finding that construction \"leads to absurd results,\" \"[m]ost notably\" because it \"would create criminal liability regardless of how long the metabolite remains in the driver's system or whether it has any impairing effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-15. And, citing a non-impairing metabolite that bufotenine, a proscribed substance, shared in common with \"a legal serotonin supplement,\" the court further observed, \"the State's interpretation would permit prosecution if the discovered substance is a metabolite of a proscribed drug even if the proscribed drug was never ingested,\" rendering the state's argument \"untenable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 16 Nor did the court in\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   suggest the meaning of \"its metabolite\" was contingent on the length of time a metabolite remained in someone's system, whether twenty-eight days in the case of Carboxy-THC or the one to five days that, according to testimony at Leon's trial, BE remains in one's\n   bloodstream after ingesting cocaine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Focusing instead on whether a metabolite was capable of causing impairment, our supreme court also rejected the defendant's suggestion that the statute's meaning was limited to a proscribed substance's \"primary metabolite\" \"because there are drugs proscribed under \u00a7 13-3401 that have multiple primary or secondary impairing metabolites.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 17 In its consideration of legislative purpose, the court further stated, \"[I]n enacting the (A)(3) charge, the legislature sought to proscribe driving by those who could be impaired from the presence of illegal drugs in their body\" by establishing \"that a driver who tests positive for any amount of an impairing drug is legally and irrefutably presumed to be under the influence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. But, the court continued, \"Although the legislature could rationally choose to penalize the presence of any amount of an impairing metabolite, we do not believe that [it] contemplated penalizing the presence of a metabolite that is not impairing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court concluded, \"Because the legislature intended to prevent impaired driving, we hold that the 'metabolite' reference in \u00a7 28-1381(A)(3) is limited to any of a proscribed substance's metabolites that are capable of causing impairment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 18 In light of our supreme court's express holding, limiting the meaning of \"metabolite\" in \u00a7 28-1381(A)(3) to those \"capable of causing impairment,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   cannot fairly be characterized as \"narrow\" or as \"pertain[ing] only to Carboxy-THC\" as the respondent judge suggested in his ruling and the state argues here.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dobson v.
