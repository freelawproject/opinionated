Smith\n   </em>\n   that a dismissal with prejudice is a judgment on the merits that carries preclusive effect.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5180119\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/62/261/#p269\">\n    62 Ariz. 261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 269-70,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5180119\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/62/261/#p269\">\n    157 P.2d 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1945). We today hold that a stipulated dismissal with prejudice of an agent-surgeon does not preclude a party from asserting a claim against the surgeon's principal for its own independent negligence. This is true even when the independent negligence claim requires proof of the surgeon's negligence. This conclusion comports with our more recent holding in\n   <em>\n    Chaney Building Co. v. City of Tucson\n   </em>\n   that a stipulated dismissal does not trigger issue preclusion because only issues that have been \"actually litigated\" may be precluded.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1471881\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/148/571/#p573\">\n    148 Ariz. 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 573,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1471881\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/148/571/#p573\">\n    716 P.2d 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 30 (1986).

After experiencing post-operative complications, Plaintiffs filed medical malpractice actions against Physician Group of Arizona, IASIS Healthcare Corp., IASIS Healthcare Holdings, Inc., IASIS Finance, Inc., and St. Luke's Medical Center (collectively, the \"Hospital\") and Dr. Schlesinger. Plaintiffs' cases were later consolidated for discovery.

Additionally, the agreement stated that \"no past or present wrongdoing on the part of [Dr. Schlesinger] is implied or should be inferred\" from the settlement agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, Plaintiffs dismissed with prejudice all claims against Dr. Schlesinger and \"any claims against any co-defendants for vicarious liability,\" but in their stipulation specifically reserved independent claims against the Hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b64 The Hospital moved to dismiss most of the remaining claims, arguing they were derivative of Dr. Schlesinger's negligence.

Although Plaintiffs must prove Dr. Schlesinger's negligence to establish the causation and damages elements for their claims against the Hospital, those claims are not properly characterized as vicarious liability claims.

In fact, the settlement and dismissal documents state just the opposite, expressly preserving those claims. Furthermore, the parties' agreement did not manifest an intent to conclusively\n   establish the doctor's negligence or lack thereof-the agreement stated only that \"no past or present wrongdoing on the part of [Dr. Schlesinger] is implied or should be inferred by\" the settlement. Thus, Plaintiffs are not barred from bringing their claims for negligent hiring, credentialing, and supervision against the Hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b616 We vacate the court of appeals' memorandum decision, reverse the trial court's Rule 54(b) judgment dismissing Plaintiffs' independent negligence claims against the Hospital, and remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
