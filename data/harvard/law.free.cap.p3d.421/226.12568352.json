Buckner, Jr., of Lenexa, an attorney admitted to the practice of law in Kansas in 1994. After respondent appeared in person and through counsel for a hearing before the panel of the Kansas Board for Discipline of Attorneys, the panel determined he violated Kansas Rules of Professional Conduct (KRPC) 1.4(b) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 293) (communication); 1.5(d) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 294) (fees); 1.15(a), (b), (c), (d)(1)(ii), (d)(3), and (f) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 328) (safekeeping property); 1.16(d) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 333) (termination of representation); 8.1(b) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 379) (failure to respond to lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority); and Kansas Supreme Court Rule 207(b) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 246) (failure to cooperate in disciplinary investigation). The hearing panel also found that the respondent did not violate KRPC 1.3 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 292) (diligence) and KRPC 8.4 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 381) (misconduct).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the panel, the Disciplinary Administrator recommended that the respondent be disbarred. Respondent's counsel acknowledged respondent's conduct supported suspension. The hearing panel unanimously recommended that the respondent be suspended for two years and, if the respondent seeks reinstatement, that he be required to undergo a reinstatement hearing under Supreme Court Rule 219 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 264).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 211(f) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 251) and Supreme Court Rule 212 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 255), the Disciplinary Administrator filed a Notice of Appeal and Exceptions to the Hearing Panel Report, arguing the hearing panel's findings of fact support a conclusion of law that the respondent violated KRPC 8.4(c). In the alternative, the Disciplinary Administrator argued that the clear and convincing evidence of record established that respondent violated KRPC 8.4(c). Furthermore, in recommending discipline, the Disciplinary Administrator\n   took exception to the hearing panel's findings that: (1) respondent's violations were committed knowingly, rather than intentionally and (2) that respondent's behavior was motivated by selfish conduct, rather than selfish\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   dishonest conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Respondent did not file exceptions to the panel's final hearing report; therefore, the panel's findings of fact are deemed admitted. Supreme Court Rule 212(c), (d) ; see also\n   <em>\n    In re Hodge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=307%20Kan.%20170\">\n    307 Kan. 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 209-10,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=407%20P.3d%20613\">\n    407 P.3d 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (\"When a respondent does not take exception to a finding it is deemed admitted.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We unanimously hold that clear and convincing evidence supports each of the rule violations found by the panel. But we disagree with the panel's conclusion that respondent's conduct did not violate KRPC 8.4(c) and hold that the panel's findings of fact, as a matter of law, establish a violation of this rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The majority of this court holds disbarment is the appropriate discipline. A minority of this court would impose indefinite suspension and require the respondent to undergo a reinstatement hearing under Supreme Court Rule 219 at which Respondent would be required to prove that full restitution has been provided to his clients and the Client Protection Fund as factually applicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 10, 2016, the office of the Disciplinary Administrator filed a formal complaint against the respondent alleging violations of the KRPC; on May 1, 2017, that office filed a first amended formal complaint. Upon motion granted December 27, 2016, the formal hearing was continued. The respondent filed an answer to the complaint on January 23, 2017, and an answer to the first amended formal complaint on May 22, 2017. Respondent filed a proposed probation plan on May 1, 2017. A hearing was held on the complaint before a panel of the Kansas Board for Discipline of Attorneys on June 8, 2017, where the respondent was personally present and was represented by counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Upon conclusion of the hearing, the panel made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law, together with its recommendation to this court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"14.

I have framed that as a monthly cap or monthly flat fee. I will keep track of my time in a traditional format but cap the legal fee portion as $500.

Clients agree to pay by the hour at Buckner's prevailing\n   rates for all time spent on Clients' matter by Buckner's legal personnel. Thus, these rates are subject to change upon written notice from Buckner. L.J. Buckner, Jr. will be the person primarily working on this matter. Time charged may include the time Buckner spends on telephone calls relating to Clients' matter, including calls with Clients, witnesses, opposing counsel or court personnel. Buckner may charge for waiting time in court and elsewhere and for travel time, both local and out of town. Client's payments to Buckner for legal fees generally shall be capped at $500.00 per month or any portion thereof with such payments being due on or about the 10th of each month (\"Monthly Flat Fee\"). All such payments shall be applied against Buckner's outstanding fees. Buckner is entitled to and may recover the full amount of his billed fees from persons other than Clients through attorney's fee provisions or sanctions or the like.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   This provision of the fee agreement makes it clear that P.J. and D.R. had to pay a monthly 'cap' of $500. A cap means a limit on the amount the respondent can receive from P.J. and D.R. P.J. and D.R. were not responsible for any more than $500 per month. Without fail, P.J. and D.R. paid the $500 monthly attorney fee to the respondent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   \"47. P.J. and D.R. believed that they were required to pay the respondent $500 per month for the duration of the representation.

Under the fee agreement, P.J. and D.R. did not believe that they were required to pay the respondent any additional fees. P.J. and D.R. relied on the provision of the fee agreement that the respondent was 'entitled to and may recover the full amount of his billed fees from persons other than Clients through attorney's fee provisions or sanctions or the like.'

The respondent justified retaining the settlement proceeds because his clients had not made their mortgage payments for an extended period of time and had thus, lived 'for free' for that period of time. The respondent asserted that his clients effectively received $2,200 each month that they did not pay their mortgage. While P.J. and D.R. did not pay their mortgage for an extended period of time, the settlement of the case resulted in his clients losing their home, including any equity they had accrued or appreciation that the house had gained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   'd.

Respondent was given adequate notice of the formal complaint and first amended formal complaint, to which he filed answers. Respondent was also given adequate notice of the hearing before the panel and the hearing before this court. The respondent did not file exceptions to the hearing panel's final hearing report; therefore, the panel's findings of fact are deemed admitted. Supreme Court Rule 212(c), (d). Furthermore, the evidence before the hearing panel establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the charged misconduct violated KRPC 1.4(b) (2018 Kan. S. Ct.

We agree and hold the panel's factual findings support a conclusion, as a matter of law, that respondent violated KRPC 8.4(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   KRPC 8.4(c) states: \"It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to: ... engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\" (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 381). This rule is identical to Model Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(c). See American Bar Association: Annotated Model Rules of Professional Conduct (8th ed. 2015) (AMRPC), Rule 8.4(c), Misconduct, p. 669. Both the KRPC and the model rules define \"fraud\" as \"conduct that is fraudulent under the substantive or procedural law of the applicable jurisdiction and has a purpose to deceive.\" KRPC 1.0(e) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 286); AMRPC 1.0(d), p. 15. The KRPC and the model rules do not define the terms \"dishonesty,\" \"deceit,\" and \"misrepresentation,\" but the annotation to the model rules provides the following discussion of these terms:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-216\">\n   \"One court explained the difference by concluding that fraud and deceit require an intent to deceive, but misrepresentation does not, and that dishonesty involves 'conduct indicating a disposition to \"lie, cheat or defraud.\" '\n   <em>\n    In re Obert\n   </em>\n   , [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"60642\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/336/640/\">\n    336 Or. 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ]\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"60642\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/336/640/\">\n    89 P.3d 1173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Or. 2004) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Scanio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8329714\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/919/1137/\">\n    919 A.2d 1137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. 2007) ('dishonesty' includes 'conduct evincing a lack of honesty, probity or integrity in principle; a lack of fairness and straightforwardness,' but need not involve conduct legally characterized as fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation).\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fla.

With respect to dishonesty towards clients, the annotation provides, \"A lawyer may not mislead or lie to a client.\" AMRPC 8.4, p. 680.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   We hold the factual findings in the panel's final hearing report, especially findings 51(a)-(j) quoted above, support a conclusion of law that the respondent violated KRPC 8.4(c). These factual findings show that respondent was dishonest with his clients and with the hearing panel and that, at the very least, he\n   misled his clients into settling the lawsuit for the respondent's benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   Without reiterating all of the panel's findings, we highlight that the respondent encouraged his clients to accept the mortgage company's $25,000 settlement offer by explaining, \" '[u]nder the settlement agreement as it stands, you would ... [o]we nothing to EverBank\n   <em>\n    and have $25K in your pocket\n   </em>\n   ....' \" (Emphasis added.) As the panel realized, \"[i]f, during settlement negotiations, the respondent expected to get the settlement proceeds because they came from a 'person other than the Clients,' the respondent would not have told P.J. and D.R. that they would have '25K' in their pocket.\" The hearing panel further recognized that respondent's testimony that P.J. and D.R. engaged in settlement negotiations so respondent would get more of his attorney fees paid, not so P.J. and D.R. would receive a cash settlement, was \"troubling ... because it is inconsistent with other probative evidence.\" The hearing panel found \"based on the appearance of the witnesses at the hearing, [ ] P.J. and D.R. negotiated the settlement from $25,000 to $49,999 so that they would receive a larger amount of money on settlement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   Further, the panel found \"[a]fter the case was settled and the check was cut, the respondent told his clients that he would pay them the day the bank released the funds.\" And after respondent received the settlement check, at P.J. and D.R.'s request, the respondent provided them with a check for $3,000. Based on its assessments of the evidence, the hearing panel reasoned, \"[i]f, under the fee agreement, the settlement proceeds were to be used to pay the respondent's fees first, the respondent would not have provided P.J. and D.R. with $3,000 for moving expenses.\" Moreover, after disbursing these funds, respondent asked P.J. and D.R. how they proposed to allocate the remainder of the funds. The hearing panel reasoned, \"[i]f the respondent expected the entire settlement was to be used to pay his fees under his contract, he would not have made that statement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   We cannot reconcile respondent's statements to his clients and actions with respect to the settlement funds with respondent's representations to the hearing panel without determining that the respondent was dishonest with his clients and the hearing panel and misled his clients into settling the lawsuit for his benefit. Accordingly, we unanimously hold that the panel's factual findings, which respondent took no exception to, support the legal conclusion that respondent violated KRPC 8.4(c). Therefore, we need not address the Disciplinary Administrator's alternative argument to look beyond these factual findings for additional evidence in the record establishing a violation of KRPC 8.4(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   DISCIPLINE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Having found violations of the KRPC, we must determine the appropriate discipline. As set forth above, respondent's violations are KRPC 1.4(b) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 293) (communication); 1.5(d) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 294) (fees); 1.15(a), (b), (c), (d)(1)(ii), (d)(3), and (f) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 328) (safekeeping property); 1.16(d) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 333) (termination of representation); 8.1(b) (2018 Kan.

R. 246) (failure to cooperate in disciplinary investigation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   Before the hearing panel, the Deputy Disciplinary Administrator recommended that the respondent be disbarred. Respondent's counsel conceded that respondent's failure to cooperate in the disciplinary proceeding warranted suspension. The hearing panel recommended that respondent be suspended for two years, and that he be required to undergo a reinstatement hearing under Rule 219. Respondent asks this court to uphold the hearing panel's recommended sanction while the Deputy Disciplinary Administrator continues to argue that disbarment is the appropriate sanction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   This court is not bound by the recommendations made by the Disciplinary Administrator or the hearing panel.

And finally, the respondent violated his duties to his clients and the legal profession by engaging in dishonest and misleading conduct towards his clients and the hearing panel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   <em>\n    Respondent's Mental State\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   The hearing panel found \"respondent knowingly violated his duties.\" \"The ABA Standards identify three mental states: 'intent,' the highest culpable mental state; 'knowledge,' the intermediate culpable mental state; and 'negligence,' the least culpable mental state.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415921\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/304/97/#p140\">\n    304 Kan. at 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415921\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/304/97/#p140\">\n    373 P.3d 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The ABA Standards define intent as \"the conscious objective or purpose to accomplish a particular result,\" while knowledge is defined as \"the conscious awareness of the nature or attendant circumstances of the conduct but without the conscious objective or purpose to accomplish a particular result.\" American Bar Association Annotated Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, xxi (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   The Deputy Disciplinary Administrator argues that the respondent intentionally violated his duties, pointing out the panel's final hearing report finding that \"[t]he respondent's repeated failure to provide written responses to the complaint amounts to bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by\n   <em>\n    intentionally\n   </em>\n   failing to comply with rules and orders of the disciplinary process.\" (Emphasis added.) It is difficult to square this finding with the panel's holding that the respondent \"knowingly\" violated this duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Furthermore, with respect to the violation of failing to safeguard a client's property, respondent argues that \"[i]t is clear that [he] intended to disburse the settlement proceeds, but, after an unreasonable fee dispute, did not.\" That argument establishes that respondent commingled the settlement funds with his personal monies and expended the entire amount despite knowing that some of the money should have been disbursed to his clients, or at least that his clients were claiming entitlement to some of the funds. Such conduct is intentional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Finally, respondent's communications with his clients manifest a conscious objective or purpose to mislead his clients as to the effect the settlement would have on the clients' financial situation. Again, such conduct is intentional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   <em>\n    Injury from the Misconduct\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   The panel concluded that respondent's conduct resulted in actual injury to his clients and the legal profession. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   <em>\n    Aggravating and Mitigating Circumstances\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   This court's rules require that a disciplinary panel explain \"[m]itigating or aggravating circumstances which affect the nature or degree of discipline.\" Supreme Court Rule 211(f) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 252). The panel must consider the evidence presented as to aggravating and mitigating circumstances and determine the weight to be assigned to each in arriving at an appropriate discipline.\n   <em>\n    In re Walsh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671161\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/286/235/#p248\">\n    286 Kan. 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 248,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671161\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/286/235/#p248\">\n    182 P.3d 1218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). On appeal, this court determines whether it agrees with the panel's findings regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Hawkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415921\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/304/97/#p140\">\n    304 Kan. at 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415921\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/304/97/#p140\">\n    373 P.3d 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   The hearing panel found the following aggravating circumstances were present: (1) Dishonest or Selfish Motive; (2) Multiple Offenses; (3) Bad Faith Obstruction of the Disciplinary Proceeding by Intentionally Failing to Comply with Rules or Orders of the Disciplinary Process; (4) Submission of False Evidence, False Statements, or Other Deceptive Practices During the Disciplinary Process; (5) Refusal to Acknowledge Wrongful Nature of Conduct; (6) Substantial Experience in the Practice of Law; and (7) Indifference to Making Restitution. The panel additionally found one mitigating circumstance: Absence of a Prior Disciplinary Record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   On appeal, the Deputy Disciplinary Administrator challenges the panel's finding regarding the aggravating factor of Dishonest or Selfish Motive, arguing the panel erred in only finding respondent acted selfishly because respondent's conduct was also motivated by dishonesty. Based on our holding above that the respondent violated KRPC 8.4(c), we agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   <em>\n    The Appropriate Discipline is Disbarment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   ABA Standard 4.1-Violations of Duties Owed to Clients-Failure to Preserve the Client's Property, provides, in relevant part: \"4.11 Disbarment is generally appropriate when a lawyer knowingly converts client property and causes injury or potential injury to a client.\" Likewise, \"Kansas disciplinary cases have consistently recognized that misappropriation of clients' funds is one of the most serious offenses an attorney can commit and the sanction generally imposed has been disbarment.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Veith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1507504\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/252/266/#p272\">\n    252 Kan. 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 272,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1507504\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/252/266/#p272\">\n    843 P.2d 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). Here, money that respondent admittedly intended to disburse to his clients was commingled with his own funds, instead of being safeguarded in a trust account, and respondent used the funds for his own benefit. Disbarment is appropriate for such a conversion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   A majority of the court concludes that the severity of respondent's conduct warrants disbarment. A minority of the court would impose indefinite suspension and require a reinstatement hearing under Rule 219 (2018 Kan. Ct. R. 264) at which Respondent would be required to prove that full restitution has been provided to his clients and the Client Protection Fund, if applicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   CONCLUSION AND DISCIPLINE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that L.J. Buckner, Jr. be and he is hereby disbarred from the practice of law in the state of Kansas, effective on the filing of this opinion, in accordance with Supreme Court Rule 203(a)(1) (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 234).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk of the Appellate Courts strike the name of L.J. Buckner, Jr. from the roll of attorneys licensed to practice law in Kansas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the respondent shall comply with Supreme Court Rule 218 (2018 Kan. S. Ct. R. 262).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the costs of these proceedings be assessed to the respondent and that this opinion be published in the official Kansas Reports.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
