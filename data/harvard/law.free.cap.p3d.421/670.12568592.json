Waller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4249905\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/235/479/\">\n    235 Ariz. 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4249905\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/235/479/\">\n    333 P.3d 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 810 (App. 2014) (citation omitted). After a Tucson police officer stopped De Anda while he was driving, De Anda exhibited signs of alcohol impairment and was arrested. Pursuant to Arizona's implied-consent statute, A.R.S. \u00a7 28-1321, another officer advised De Anda as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Arizona law states that a person who operates a motor vehicle at any time in this state gives consent to a test or tests of blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance for the purpose of determining alcohol concentration or drug content. The law enforcement officer is authorized to request more than one test and may choose the types of tests.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   If the test results are not available, or indicate an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or above (0.04 or above in a commercial vehicle,) or indicate any drug defined in ARS 13-3401 or its metabolite without a valid prescription, then your Arizona driving privilege will be suspended for not less than 90 consecutive days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   If you refuse, do not expressly agree to submit to, or do not successfully complete the tests, your Arizona driving privilege will be suspended. The suspension will be requested for 12 months, or for two years if you've had a prior implied-consent refusal within the last 84 months.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Will you submit to the tests?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   De Anda agreed, and the officer drew his blood and submitted it for forensic analysis. De Anda was subsequently charged with the four counts described above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 3 Before trial, De Anda filed a motion to suppress all evidence obtained from the blood test, contending that his consent to submit to the test had been coerced by the officer's advisement. Specifically, he argued the officer should have given him the option to submit or refuse testing prior to explaining the penalties associated with refusal. After a hearing, the trial court denied his motion and the results of the blood test were admitted at trial. De Anda was convicted of all four counts and sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment, the longest of which is four months, followed by concurrent, five-year terms of probation. We have jurisdiction over De Anda's appeal pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13-4031 and 13-4033(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Implied Consent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 4 The sole issue before us is whether the trial court erred in denying De Anda's motion to suppress. De Anda argues the procedure provided by statute and approved in\n   <em>\n    State v. Valenzuela\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310326\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/299/\">\n    239 Ariz. 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4310326\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/239/299/\">\n    371 P.3d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 636 (2016), required the advising officer to give him an opportunity to consent to testing prior to advising him of the consequences of refusal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 28-1321(B). He further argues that the officer's failure to follow this procedure rendered his consent to the test involuntary. We review the court's denial of De Anda's motion \"for abuse of discretion if it involves a discretionary issue, but review constitutional issues and purely legal issues de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Gay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4000041\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/214/214/\">\n    214 Ariz. 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4000041\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/214/214/\">\n    150 P.3d 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 790 (App. 2007) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 5 We recently determined Arizona's implied-consent statute does not require the state to follow the procedure De Anda suggests.\n   <em>\n    Diaz v.

But\n   <em>\n    Diaz\n   </em>\n   dealt with a breath test, and we did not address the additional Fourth Amendment concerns associated with a blood test.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-7 &amp; n.5 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Birchfield v.

Instead, the officer accurately advised De Anda of the terms of Arizona's implied-consent statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 28-1321.
