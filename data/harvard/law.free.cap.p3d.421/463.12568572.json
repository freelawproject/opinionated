This appeal primarily asks whether an accused, who, in response to an antagonist retrieving a gun, also arms himself and hides behind a vehicle, suffers accomplice liability for homicide when, without the accused shooting his firearm, the antagonist fires his gun and the bullet strikes and kills an innocent bystander. The State argues that the accused bears liability because he encouraged his adversary to fire the gun. The State emphasizes that Lashawn Jameison later exchanged gunfire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 The appeal also asks whether the same accused may be convicted of a drive-by shooting when he retrieves a gun from the car in which he arrived to the scene of the homicide but crouches behind another car at the time he returns fire. We affirm the trial court's summary dismissal of the homicide charges and twelve of fourteen of the drive-by shooting charges. We affirm the dismissal of the drive-by shooting charges based on our decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Vasquez\n   </em>\n   , 2 Wash. App. 2d 632,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12566466\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/415/1205/\">\n    415 P.3d 1205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), decided after the trial court ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 This prosecution arises from a confrontation between Kwame Bates and defendant Lashawn Jameison, on the one hand, and Anthony Williams, on the other hand, during which skirmish Williams fired his gun and killed bystander Eduardo Villagomez. A video partially captures the confrontation and shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 On the night of January 17-18, 2016, Lashawn Jameison and Kwame Bates joined a group of five hundred young adults at the Palomino Club in Spokane to celebrate Martin Luther King Day. Bates drove Jameison to the club in a white Toyota Camry owned by Bates' girlfriend, which car gains significance as events transpire. Bates parked the Camry on Lidgerwood Street in front of a Department of Licensing building adjacent to the club. A Chrysler parked behind the Camry on the street. We do not know the time of night that Bates and Jameison arrived at the celebration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 The Palomino Club closed at 2 a.m. on January 18. As Lashawn Jameison and Kwame Bates exited the club at closing, another patron, Anthony Williams, shoved Sierra, a female friend of Bates. The shove began a deadly chain of events. As a result of the push, Bates and Williams argued. Jameison did not participate in the quarrel. Williams jumped a metal fence bordering the club parking lot, retrieved a handgun from a car parked in the adjacent Department of Licensing parking lot, and returned to the entrance of the club. Williams paced to and from the club building, the adjacent lot, and Lidgerwood Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 Both Kwame Bates and Lashawn Jameison, knowing that Anthony Williams possessed a firearm, returned to the white Toyota Camry and armed themselves. Both Bates and Jameison lawfully owned firearms. During this activity, other patrons of the Palomino Club departed the building and walked to their cars parked in the club parking lot, in the adjacent parking lot, and on the street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Lashawn Jameison, with gun in hand, retreated and separated himself from Kwame Bates and Anthony Williams. Jameison hid at the rear of the Chrysler parked behind the Camry while Bates stood by a power pole near the Camry. Bates and Williams, with Williams then in the Department of Licensing parking lot, faced one another as Martin Luther King Day celebrants continued to walk to their cars. According to Bates, he \"does not back down\" from a fight as long as the fight is fair. Clerk's Papers (CP) at 158. Jameison crouched behind the Chrysler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 8 A friend of Anthony Williams drove the friend's car into the parking lot. Williams stepped behind his friend's vehicle and discharged his gun in Bates' direction. The bullet missed Bates and struck Eduardo Villagomez, a bystander walking along the street. Villagomez slumped to the street. Tragically an unsuspecting driver of a car drove over Villagomez's stricken body. Villagomez died as a result of the bullet wound and the force of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 After Anthony Williams' discharge of gunfire, Kwame Bates ran from the power pole and joined Lashawn Jameison behind the stationary Chrysler. Seconds after Williams fired the first shot, Bates and Jameison stood, returned fire, and crouched again behind the Chrysler. Jameison fired, at most, two shots toward Williams. Williams returned additional shots toward Bates and Jameison. Bates rose again and returned fire as Williams entered the vehicle driven by his friend. The friend drove the vehicle from the parking lot and club. Bates and Jameison entered the Camry and also departed the neighborhood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 Because the State contends inferences from the facts support accomplice liability, we now repeat and quote evidence in its unedited form and as presented to the trial court. Spokane Police Department Detective Marty Hill reviewed a security video, and, based on this viewing, wrote in an amended statement of investigating officer:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   This individual is a black male dressed in a bright red top (later identified as Lashawn D.

Detective Hill added:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A sedan, later found to be driven by Jazzmine Dunlap, pulls into the lot[,] and a male approaches the driver rear door. This male, later identified as Anthony G. Williams, B/M, 08/18/1993, then begins to fire shots at Jameison and Bates who are secreted behind the Chrysler 300. The victim, later identified as Eduardo Villagomez, HM, 01/15/1995, and his three companions, later identified as Carlos Villagomez, Miguel L. Martinez, and Rosario A.

Bates put himself standing in the street to the east of his car. Bates said the male with the gray sweatshirt [Anthony Williams] approached him from the parking lot of the DMV [Department of Motor Vehicles] building. Bates stated this male was yelling at him and he thought he and this unknown male were going to have a fair fight. Bates stated he does not back down from fights as long as they are fair.Bates stated this unknown male pulled out his firearm. Bates said he ran to his right and jumped behind the Chrysler 300 as the male began shooting. Bates said he could hear bullets striking the Chrysler. Bates admitted that he returned fire towards this male as the male was running towards a gray colored car. Bates indicated that he fired between six and seven shots. Bates said when the male entered the car, he did not continue to shoot anymore, but he and L-Jay jumped into the white 1993 Toyota Camry ... and they drove away.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Bates said it happened so fast, \"I thought it was over for me.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   CP at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 12 Stephanie Collins, a deputy prosecuting attorney, signed a statement outlining facts in chronological order. Collins declared in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   11. A Chevy Cruze pulls into the DOL [Department of Licensing] lot-later determined to be driven by a friend of Williams', Jazzmine Dunlap. The car stops in the DOL lot and Williams approaches it.

The State acknowledged that Anthony Williams shot Eduardo Villagomez but charged Jameison with accomplice liability. The State also charged Jameison with fourteen counts of drive-by shooting as a result of Jameison's returning of gunfire. The fourteen charges arise from the presence of at least fourteen club patrons in the vicinity at the time of the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 14 Lashawn Jameison moved to dismiss the homicide charges pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State v. Knapstad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1192451\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/107/346/\">\n    107 Wash.2d 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=729%20P.2d%2048\">\n    729 P.2d 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). Jameison emphasized that the video of the scene and law enforcement officers' reports and affidavits demonstrated beyond dispute that Anthony Williams killed the decedent while Jameison ducked behind a car, shielding himself from Williams' attack. Jameison added that, because he had not fired a shot by the time Williams' bullet struck Eduardo Villagomez and because he himself was a victim of Williams' violence, he could not be guilty of murder even as an accomplice. Jameison posited the same arguments for the alternative charge of manslaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 15 Lashawn Jameison also moved to dismiss the drive-by shooting charges for insufficient evidence of recklessness. In the alternative, he argued that all but one count should be dismissed because he fired only one shot. He based the latter argument on law enforcement's discovering, at the crime scene, only one shell casing matching his gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 16 As part of its response to Lashawn Jameison's motion to dismiss, the State filed a certificate of Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Stefanie W. Collins, which outlines the facts in serial and chronological form. We previously quoted two paragraphs from the certificate. Collins declared that she based the facts on her review of police reports and\n   security video. In reply, Jameison asked that Collins' certificate be stricken because Collins did not base her certificate on percipient knowledge. The trial court's order of dismissal does not indicate whether the court granted the motion to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 17 The trial court dismissed the first degree murder and first degree manslaughter charges on the basis, in part, that Lashawn Jameison did not cause the death of Eduardo Villagomez. The trial court also ruled that the unit of prosecution for drive-by shooting charges was the number of shots fired by Jameison. Because of a dispute of fact as to whether Jameison fired one or two shots, the trial court dismissed all but two of the fourteen drive-by shooting counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 18 The State requested and this court granted discretionary review of the trial court's dismissal of some of the pending charges. After we accepted discretionary review, this court decided\n   <em>\n    State v. Vasquez\n   </em>\n   , 2 Wash. App. 2d 632,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12566466\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/415/1205/\">\n    415 P.3d 1205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), which delineates the elements of a drive-by shooting prosecution. We requested that both parties address\n   <em>\n    Vasquez\n   </em>\n   during oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   LAW AND ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Facts and Inferences\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 19 The State appeals dismissal of the murder, manslaughter, and the twelve drive-by shooting charges. Lashawn Jameison has not sought review of the trial court's refusal to dismiss the remaining two drive-by shooting counts. Before addressing the substantive law of homicide and drive-by shootings, we first determine what facts to apply to the law. The parties contest what constitutes the unquestioned facts and the permissible inferences from those facts. We must resolve this dispute of undisputed facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 20 CrR 8.3(c) permits an accused to seek dismissal of charges before trial. The rule declares:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   On Motion of Defendant for Pretrial Dismissal. The defendant may, prior to trial, move to dismiss a criminal charge due to insufficient evidence establishing a prima facie case of the crime charged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (1) The defendant's motion shall be in writing and supported by an affidavit or declaration alleging that there are no material disputed facts and setting out the agreed facts, or by a stipulation to facts by both parties. The stipulation, affidavit or declaration may attach and incorporate police reports, witness statements or other material to be considered by the court when deciding the motion to dismiss. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (2) The prosecuting attorney may submit affidavits or declarations in opposition to defendant's supporting affidavits or declarations. The affidavits or declarations may attach and incorporate police reports, witness statements or other material to be considered by the court when deciding defendant's motion to dismiss. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (3) The court shall grant the motion if there are no material disputed facts and the undisputed facts do not establish a prima facie case of guilt. In determining defendant's motion, the court shall view all evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecuting attorney and\n   <em>\n    the court shall make all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the prosecuting attorney.\n   </em>\n   The court may not weigh conflicting statements and base its decision on the statement it finds the most credible. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (4) If the defendant's motion to dismiss is granted, the court shall enter a written order setting forth the evidence relied upon and conclusions of law. The granting of defendant's motion to dismiss shall be without prejudice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (Emphasis added) (boldface omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 21 The order in response to Lashawn Jameison's motion to dismiss does not list the affidavits, declaration, or reports reviewed by the trial court. Therefore, we have scoured all evidence forwarded to this appellate court. We included in our review the certificate of Stephanie Collins, to which Jameison objected, without determining the propriety of its use. Jameison's trial court entered findings of fact, but we conclude we must determine the facts on our own since the trial court does not resolve disputed facts on a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 22 Trial courts should grant an accused's motion to dismiss when the undisputed facts\n   do not establish a prima facie case of guilt. CrR 8.3(c)(3). The law labels such motions to dismiss as\n   <em>\n    Knapstad\n   </em>\n   motions in reference to a leading Washington decision,\n   <em>\n    State v. Knapstad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1192451\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/107/346/\">\n    107 Wash.2d 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=729%20P.2d%2048\">\n    729 P.2d 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). The Supreme Court adopted CrR 8.3(c)(3) in light of its\n   <em>\n    Knapstad\n   </em>\n   decision. A\n   <em>\n    Knapstad\n   </em>\n   motion in a criminal case corresponds to a summary judgment motion in a civil case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 23 We review de novo a trial court's decision to grant a\n   <em>\n    Knapstad\n   </em>\n   motion and to dismiss a criminal prosecution under CrR 8.3(c).\n   <em>\n    State v.

An appellate court will uphold the trial court's dismissal of a charge if no rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt the essential elements of the crime.\n   <em>\n    State v.

We agree the record shows that Jameison armed himself. We disagree with the State's assertion that Jameison \"squared off\" with Williams. The record of evidence repeatedly states that Anthony Williams and Kwame Bates \"squared off.\" The record also indicates that Williams shot toward Jameison in addition to Bates. Nevertheless, whereas Jameison armed himself, no police report or other record claims that Jameison \"squared off\" with Williams. He instead crouched behind a car. Assuming Jameison \"squared off\" with Williams, the \"squaring off\" occurred after Williams fired the fatal shot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 25 The State additionally writes that Lashawn Jameison assumed a fighting position. We also disagree with this factual assertion. The only testimony about Jameison's physical stance concerns his crouching as if hiding behind a car because of Anthony Williams' brandishing a weapon. The video confirms this testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 26 The State repeatedly refers, in its briefing, to an agreement between Lashawn Jameison and Anthony Williams to fight. The record lacks any entry of an agreement between Jameison and Williams to fight, let alone an agreement between Kwame Bates and Williams to fight. The State concedes the record does not authenticate that Jameison overtly agreed to fight. The State contends, however, that Jameison's actions in taking up arms and assuming a fighting position near Bates manifested Jameison's agreement to resolve differences by violence. In this regard, the State faults the trial court for failing to draw all reasonable inferences from the facts in favor of the State. We would be more likely to reverse the trial court's dismissal of homicide charges if facts supported such a rational inference of an agreement to which Jameison was a party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 27 We struggle in the abstract with what assay to employ when adjudging what reasonable inferences we may deduce from established facts. Therefore, we first comb for definitions and synonyms for our key word \"inference.\" Our state high court has defined an \"inference\" as a logical deduction or conclusion from an established fact.\n   <em>\n    Fannin v.

On the night of January 30, Aten cared for a four-month-old child. She found the child dead the next morning. A physician, who performed an autopsy on the infant, concluded that the child died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), a form of acute respiratory failure. He acknowledged suffocation could cause acute respiratory failure. But he also testified he could not determine in an autopsy whether SIDS or suffocation caused the acute respiratory failure. The State argued that the evidence sufficed to prove the corpus delicti because one logical and reasonable inference from the evidence was that the infant died from suffocation by Aten, a criminal act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 34 The Supreme Court, in\n   <em>\n    State v. Aten\n   </em>\n   , noted that it had not previously addressed directly the issue whether the State establishes the corpus delicti when evidence independent of a defendant's statements is consistent with reasonable and logical inferences of both criminal agency and innocence. The court held that the State does not establish corpus delicti when independent evidence supports reasonable and logical inferences of both criminal agency and noncriminal cause. The circumstantial evidence proving the corpus delicti must be consistent with guilt and inconsistent with a hypothesis of innocence. Accordingly, since the independent evidence from the child's death supported a reasonable and logical inference or hypothesis of\n   innocence, that is that the child died of SIDS, insufficient evidence established the corpus delicti.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 35 Washington law, if not the federal constitution, demands that inferences in the criminal setting be based only on likelihood, not possibility.

Merriam Webster's online dictionary lists \"agree\" as a transitive verb meaning \"a : to concur in (something ...) b : to consent to a course of action.\" https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/agree (last visited June 19, 2018). No evidence directly confirms that Jameison concurred in Williams shooting at Jameison's direction. Experience, common sense and logic easily depict Williams acting on his own without any consent from Jameison or Bates. The State in essence portrays Lashawn Jameison and Anthony Williams as agreeing to a duel. The totality of the undisputed facts, however, leads one to conclude that Jameison never consented to a duel. Jameison retrieved his firearm only after Williams grabbed his weapon and in order to defend himself. He could have, but never did, shoot at Williams before Williams first shot in his direction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b6 37 The State also writes that Lashawn Jameison encouraged Anthony Williams to fire his weapon. The State may ask this court to infer encouragement as a factual matter from the conduct of Jameison. We deem whether or not Jameison encouraged Williams to be more a legal question, since we must decide whether any encouragement occurred within the meaning of RCW 9A.08.020, the accomplice liability statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Homicide\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 38 We arrive at our discussion of the substantive law.

RCW 9A.32.030 covers first degree murder by extreme indifference.

The mens rea of murder by extreme indifference is aggravated recklessness, which requires greater culpability than ordinary recklessness or more than mere disregard for the safety of others.\n   <em>\n    State v.

First, did Lashawn Jameison cause the death of Eduardo Villagomez? Second, may Lashawn Jameison be guilty of accomplice liability when the mens rea under the accomplice liability statute affords liability based on knowingly promoting a crime but the underlying crimes demand only a mens rea of recklessness? Stated differently, does Washington's accomplice liability statute permit convictions based on underlying crimes with a mental state less than knowledge? Third, did Lashawn Jameison know that his arming of himself and hiding behind a car would promote or facilitate the killing of someone? Fourth, did Lashawn Jameison encourage Anthony Williams to discharge Williams' first shot that killed Villagomez? Fifth, was Jameison a victim of the initial shot fired by Williams? Sixth and related to the fifth question, may an accused be the accomplice to a shooting when the shooter attempts to harm the accused or a companion of the accused with the deadly bullet?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b6 43 On appeal, the parties ably devote pages to the question of whether one can be an accomplice to a crime with a mens rea of recklessness. The trial court based its dismissal on the lack of causation. We ignore these questions and render our decision on other grounds. We hold discretion to affirm on any grounds supported by the record.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Eikenberry v.

We address and conflate the fourth, fifth, and six questions. We find that the conduct of Jameison in arming himself and hiding behind a car from the bullets of Anthony Williams ineptly fulfills the meaning of \"encouragement\" and his situation borders on victimhood. In turn, imposing criminal liability on Jameison conflicts with general principles of accomplice liability and disserves policies behind imposing accomplice liability. Numerous decisions support our conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b6 44 According to the State, Jameison encouraged Anthony Williams' conduct by words or conduct, including taking up arms with his companion Kwame Bates, agreeing to fight, assuming a strategic fighting position, and squaring off with Williams. The State adds that Jameison colluded with Bates to engage in an extremely reckless gunfight that resulted in the unintended death of Eduardo Villagomez. According to the State, but for Jameison's conduct, Williams \"may not\" have been encouraged to fire his pistol. We have already concluded that the record fails to support inferences that Jameison agreed to a fight, assumed a strategic fighting position, or squared off with Williams. Therefore, we ask whether Jameison's retrieval of a weapon, walking to the Chrysler,\n   and crouching behind the car \"encouraged\" the fatal criminal conduct of Anthony Williams within the meaning of RCW 9A.08.020(3)(a)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b6 45 Our key term is \"encourages.\" RCW 9A.08.020 lacks a definition for this common word. Because of the word's familiarity, we should not need to ponder a dictionary definition, but we mention one for its limited assistance. A dictionary defines \"encourage\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   1 a: to inspire with courage, spirit, or hope: HEARTEN\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   - she was\n   <em>\n    encouraged\n   </em>\n   to continue by her early success\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   B: to attempt to persuade: URGE\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   - they\n   <em>\n    encouraged\n   </em>\n   him to go back to school\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   2: to spur on: STIMULATE\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   - warm weather\n   <em>\n    encourages\n   </em>\n   plant growth\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   3: to give help or patronage to: FOSTER\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   - government grants designed to\n   <em>\n    encourage\n   </em>\n   conservation\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/encourage (last visited June 19, 2018).

Parker told his passenger that Keese would need to follow them to Bellevue because he did not intend to stop. Keese increased her speed to drive tandem with Parker. Parker responded by accelerating further in order to elude her. The two cars traveled in excess of 100 miles per hour. Parker's passenger asked him to slow. Keese's passenger uttered the same request to Keese. Eyewitnesses considered the two cars racing. As the two cars approached a third car in the interstate's center lane, Keese changed lanes and lost control of her car. Her car careened through the highway's median and struck an oncoming vehicle. The collision killed Keese's passenger and the driver of the oncoming car suffered permanent and serious head injury. Parker's car stopped without incident.

The two officers drank whiskey and then argued with other patrons about the merits of various firearms. A small target was placed in the rear of the saloon, and the officers and others demonstrated the capabilities of assorted firearms by firing six or seven shots. One of those shots missed the target or penetrated through the target, passed through the rear of the saloon, and fatally wounded David Gerber, who walked in the busy alley at the rear of the saloon. A jury convicted the officers of manslaughter. On appeal, the officers asserted that the evidence did not suffice to convict them because the State failed to present proof that a bullet fired by either killed Gerber. The court affirmed the conviction by holding that all those who had a common purpose to participate in the shooting at the target were equally guilty of the commission of the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b6 53 Lashawn Jameison lacked a common purpose with Anthony Williams. We know who fired the shot that killed Eduardo Villagomez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b6 54 Another Washington decision on point is\n   <em>\n    City of Auburn v. Hedlund\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5751364\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/165/645/\">\n    165 Wash.2d 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=201%20P.3d%20315\">\n    201 P.3d 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). As previously noted, a person is not an accomplice to a crime if he or she is a victim of that same crime. Teresa Hedlund hosted a party where liquor flowed. Following the party, Hedlund rode with five other passengers squashed into a Ford Escort. Hedlund remarkably videotaped the trip. The driver was intoxicated as a result of the party, and he drove into a concrete pillar. Hedlund was the only survivor of the single car accident. She sustained serious injuries herself. The city of Auburn charged her with being an accomplice to driving under the influence and reckless driving. The State contended that Hedlund's videotaping encouraged the driver to showboat and drive recklessly. At the close of the City's case in chief, the trial court dismissed the charges because a victim may not be charged as an accomplice under RCW 9A.08.020. The Supreme Court affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b6 55 In\n   <em>\n    Hedlund\n   </em>\n   , the State of Washington argued before the Washington Supreme Court that Hedlund should not be considered a victim of the driver's crime because Hedlund's acts of encouragement occurred before the collision with the column. The court rejected the argument. The exception for victims does not extend only to those whose complicity coextended at the time of the crime. Although the court deemed Hedlund's conduct to be reprehensible, the court did not wish to limit the definition of the term \"victim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b6 56 Although Anthony Williams likely wished to strike Kwame Bates, not Lashawn Jameison, with the first bullet, one police report declared that Williams also fired the first shot in Jameison's direction. In that sense, Jameison was a victim of Williams's assaultive behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   \u00b6 57 If we read \"encourage\" too broad, the ramifications of accomplice liability could be endless. One can analogize Lashawn Jameison's station to the purchaser of a controlled substance. The State could and some states have contended that the purchaser of the substance commits not only the crime of possession of the controlled substance but also the crime of delivery of the substance by reason of accomplice liability. By reason of the buyer wishing to purchase the unlawful drugs, the buyer encouraged the seller to deliver the drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b6 58 In\n   <em>\n    Robinson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9974242\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/815/361/\">\n    815 S.W.2d 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex. App. 1991), the State convicted Michael\n   Robinson of delivery of marijuana. The appellate court reversed because the defendant purchased the marijuana from a third party. The State argued that, as purchaser, Robinson solicited, encouraged, directed, or aided the commission of the offense. The court noted that the victim of the crime may not be held as an accomplice even though his conduct in a significant sense assists in the commission of the crime. Since the buyer and the seller enter the transaction from opposite poles, they do not aid and assist one another. Their conduct is the antithesis of one another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \u00b6 59 We worry about other ramifications of the State's theory of criminal liability. If one stretches the State's argument, Lashawn Jameison would be responsible for his own murder, if Anthony Williams' bullet struck him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b6 60 Let us assume a man nags at his wife. An irritated wife retrieves a gun and shoots at her husband. The bullet misses and wounds the couple's child. Under the State's theory, the husband could incur accomplice liability. The husband's conduct encouraged the wife to fire her gun. One may consider this example extreme, because the husband performed no unlawful act and the wife acted irrationally. Nevertheless, Lashawn Jameison performed no criminal act preceding Anthony Williams' first bullet and Williams acted irrationally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Drive-By Shootings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b6 61 On appeal, as in the trial court, the parties dispute whether the unit of prosecution for the charge of drive-by shooting constitutes the number of shots fired by the accused or the number of bystanders threatened by the shootings. We address a distinct question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b6 62 The controlling statute, RCW 9A.36.045(1), declares:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   A person is guilty of drive-by shooting when he or she recklessly discharges a firearm as defined in RCW 9.41.010 in a manner which creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another person and the discharge\n   <em>\n    is either from a motor vehicle or from the immediate area of a motor vehicle that was used to transport the shooter\n   </em>\n   or the firearm, or both, to the scene of the discharge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Key to this appeal is what constitutes the immediate area of the motor vehicle that transported the shooter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   \u00b6 63 We decline to address how to gauge the unit of prosecution for the offense of drive-by shooting. After the parties filed briefs, this court decided\n   <em>\n    State v. Vasquez\n   </em>\n   , 2 Wash. App. 2d 632,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12566466\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/415/1205/\">\n    415 P.3d 1205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), which requires a stated proximity between the shooter and his vehicle for purposes of the prosecution. We directed the parties to address this recent decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \u00b6 64 In\n   <em>\n    State v. Vasquez\n   </em>\n   , Anthony Vasquez shot and killed Juan Garcia as Garcia sat in the front passenger side of a GMC Envoy parked at the Airport Grocery in Moses Lake. For minutes prior to the shooting, the Envoy was parked near the Airport Grocery's front entrance. Vasquez then arrived at the scene in a Toyota pickup. The Toyota was parked on the side of the grocery, next to a fenced utility area, approximately sixty-three feet away from the Envoy. Once the Toyota was parked, Vasquez ran from the pickup and hid behind the utility fence for a minute. Vasquez then rushed around the corner of the grocery, across the front-side of the Envoy, and over to the area of the front passenger window of the Envoy. The front window was partially rolled down, exposing Garcia to Vasquez. Vasquez shot and killed Garcia from point-blank range. Vasquez then retreated to the Toyota and the car sped away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \u00b6 65 On appeal, this court agreed with Anthony Vasquez that the State's evidence did not suffice to convict him of a drive-by shooting. RCW 9A.36.045(1) demands that the shooter be in the \"immediate area\" of the vehicle that transported him. We did not establish a concise measurement for determining the immediate area. Nevertheless, we relied on\n   <em>\n    State v. Rodgers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"960821\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/146/55/\">\n    146 Wash.2d 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20P.3d%201\">\n    43 P.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002), when fashioning some language to assist in measuring the immediate area in individual circumstances. The legislature narrowly drew the drive-by shooting definition.\n   <em>\n    Rodgers\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Vasquez\n   </em>\n   employed two dictionary definitions of \"immediate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The first defined \"immediate\" as \"existing without intervening space or substance ... being near at hand: not far apart or distant.\" WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 1129 (1986);\n   <em>\n    State v.

The second defined \"immediate\" as \"[n]ot separated in respect to place; not separated by the intervention of any intermediate object.\" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 749 (6th ed. 1990);\n   <em>\n    State v. Rodgers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"960821\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/146/55/\">\n    146 Wash.2d at 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20P.3d%201\">\n    43 P.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

Vasquez\n   </em>\n   , that the immediate area was either inside the vehicle or from within a few feet or yards of the vehicle. The crime of drive-by shooting contemplates a shooter who is either inside a vehicle or within easy or immediate reach of the vehicle. Intervening obstacles disqualify a location from being within the immediate area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   \u00b6 67 In\n   <em>\n    State v. Rodgers\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held two blocks did not fall within the immediate area. In\n   <em>\n    State v. Vasquez\n   </em>\n   , we held that a distance of sixty-three feet did not qualify as the immediate area. When Lashawn Jameison fired his responding shots, Jameison likely stood closer than sixty-three feet of the Toyota Camry, the car in which he traveled to the Palomino Club. We still hold that Jameison did not stand within the immediate area. The obstacle of an additional car and a telephone pole stood between Jameison and the Camry. The Camry was not within his immediate reach. Jameison stood more than a few feet or yards from the Camry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   \u00b6 68 We do not base our decision on the ground that the shooting lacked proximity in time to when Lashawn Jameison arrived in the Toyota Camry, but we note that Jameison had not recently ridden in the car. He had entered a club and partied in the intervening minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b6 69 The State appealed the dismissal of twelve of the fourteen drive-by shooting charges. We affirm the dismissal of those twelve charges, but lack authority to now dismiss the remaining two charges because those charges are not before the court. We remand for further proceedings with regard to the two charges in light of our opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   \u00b6 70 We affirm the trial court's dismissal of the murder and manslaughter charges and twelve of fourteen drive-by shooting charges brought against Lashawn Jameison. We remand for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Lawrence-Berrey, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Siddoway, J.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
