The twentieth century rise of the administrative state brought with it an explosion of executive branch quasi-judicial decision-making. Eventually, the urge to apply common law principles in these otherwise statutorily-created forums proved irresistible. But the apples to oranges application of common law doctrines to statutory claims litigated in executive branch forums was-by its very nature-never guaranteed universal success. Many times, such applications fit nicely and a sound and fair resolution was achieved. Other times, however, the apples to oranges application resulted in a distasteful fruit salad of injustice. This case falls into the latter category.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 Michael Weaver, a long-time Everett firefighter, applied for compensation resulting from that which he alleged-and the law presumes-to be a work-related occupational disease. Weaver's petition is serious to him and his family; he suffers from brain cancer that has made it impossible for him to work and that will ultimately claim his life. The Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals ruled that either collateral estoppel or res judicata barred his claim. The superior court unfortunately adopted the same either/or analysis and also unfortunately ruled that Weaver's application was barred. But a careful review of these two distinct common law doctrines-conducted pursuant to the analytical framework mandated by our Supreme Court-reveals that neither doctrine, properly applied, bars Weaver's entreaty. Accordingly, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Michael Weaver was employed between 1996 and 2014 by the City of Everett (the City) as a firefighter. In June 2011, Weaver noticed a mole on the skin of his left shoulder. The mole was removed and the resulting biopsy revealed that it contained a malignant melanoma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Shortly thereafter, Weaver underwent surgery to remove the melanoma. After a period of recovery, Weaver returned to his employment as a firefighter. The treatment and surgery caused Weaver to miss nearly five weeks of work, losing the opportunity to earn just under $10,000 in wages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 While in recovery, in July 2011, Weaver filed a pro se application for temporary total disability benefits from the City, a self-insured entity for workers' compensation purposes. His application alleged that the malignant melanoma on his shoulder arose from his 15 years of working as a firefighter. He requested compensation for the nearly 5 weeks of wages that he had been unable to earn due to the medical treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 After initially granting Weaver's application, the Department of Labor and Industries (the Department) reconsidered its decision and denied his application. Thereafter, Weaver, through counsel, appealed the Department's denial order to the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals (the Board). A hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ) resulted. The City presented the published deposition testimony of two medical specialists, Dr. Robert Levenson, an oncologist, and Dr. John Hackett, a dermatologist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 Weaver's counsel, presumably due to monetary considerations, chose not to present the testimony of Dr. David Aboulafia, Weaver's treating oncologist. Nor did Weaver's attorney present testimony from a medical expert in oncology or dermatology.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, Weaver's counsel presented the published deposition testimony of Dr. Kenneth Coleman, a doctor with a practice in family and emergency medicine, but with no expertise in melanoma generally or in melanoma arising from occupational exposures specifically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 The ALJ recommended that the Board affirm the Department's order denying Weaver's application.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In February 2013, the\n   Board adopted the ALJ's recommendation and issued a final order denying Weaver's application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9 After the Board's ruling, Weaver's counsel withdrew. Weaver filed a pro se review petition in the superior court. Ten months later, with Weaver still unrepresented and no progress being made in the appeal, the parties entered into a stipulation and agreed order of dismissal. Weaver's petition for review was dismissed in late 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10 In January 2014, Weaver began to have difficulty with mental processing and word finding. A magnetic resonance imaging test revealed a three-centimeter mass, a tumor, in the left frontal lobe of his brain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11 Weaver immediately underwent surgery and the tumor was removed. The resulting biopsy diagnosed the tumor as a metastatic malignant melanoma, a form of cancer developing out of a primary cancer site. The logical conclusion was that the brain tumor had metastasized out of the malignant melanoma that Weaver noticed on his shoulder in 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12 Weaver did not return to work as a firefighter after the surgery. He was estimated to have a 20 to 30 percent chance of survival over the next two years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 13 In July 2014, Weaver, now represented by counsel, submitted an application for workers' compensation from the City, seeking permanent total disability benefits. The application alleged that he suffered from a malignant melanoma located on his \"upper back/scapula area, w/ cancer spreading to brain.\" He alleged that the condition arose from \"sun exposure during outdoor firefighting and training from 1996 forward.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 14 The Department denied Weaver's application on the basis that it had already rejected his application for compensation based on the malignant melanoma discovered on his shoulder and that the metastasized melanoma had arisen from the earlier melanoma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 15 Weaver sought an administrative appeal and, in the resulting proceeding, the ALJ recommended that the Board affirm the Department's rejection of Weaver's application for permanent total disability benefits. The executive branch official concluded that the common law doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel barred Weaver's application. The board, an executive branch agency, adopted the ALJ's proposed decision and order as its final order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 16 Weaver filed a notice of appeal to the superior court. The superior court affirmed the Board's order and denied Weaver's petition, ruling that either collateral estoppel or res judicata barred his claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 17 Weaver now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 18 It is necessary for us to determine whether the superior court erred by affirming the Board's application of the doctrines of collateral estoppel and res judicata to bar Weaver from pursuing his claim for compensation under the Industrial Insurance Act, Title 51 RCW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 19 At the outset, we note that collateral estoppel and res judicata are equitable, court-created doctrines established at common law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    J.M.

The court accordingly ruled that, in the district court proceeding, Maxwell lacked sufficient motivation to fully and vigorously litigate whether she, in fact, committed the traffic infraction. Thus, the Supreme Court held, the superior court erred by precluding her from contesting that issue at the subsequent civil trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 32 Weaver's circumstances are strikingly similar to those in\n   <em>\n    Hadley\n   </em>\n   . As with Maxwell's nominal incentive to litigate a $95 citation before the district court, Weaver's incentive to fully and vigorously litigate during the proceeding on his application for temporary compensation was low. Indeed, Weaver's initial application for compensation sought only temporary total disability benefits, those wages equivalent to five weeks of missed work. Weaver anticipated that he would-and he did-return to his duties as a firefighter after completing his recovery. He was not then, as he is now, confronted by a brain cancer that is alleged to have left him permanently disabled, unable to work, with significant out-of-pocket medical expenses, and with a real possibility of death arising from the cancer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 33 Moreover, that Weaver had less than $10,000 in benefits at stake during his application for temporary compensation further informs our inquiry. Indeed, had Weaver retained a specialist in oncology or dermatology (or both), the cost of doing so might rival-or perhaps even eclipse-the modest benefit amount that he sought and, if his efforts proved unsuccessful, he would be entirely unable to recover these costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW 51.32.185(7).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 34 We note that our legislature has, for over 30 years, recognized that civil actions in which the amount in controversy is less than $10,000 fall into a special category of \"small claims.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW 4.84.250. The legislature thus provided that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   in any action for damages where the amount pleaded by the prevailing party as hereinafter defined, exclusive of costs, is seven thousand five hundred dollars or less, there shall be taxed and allowed to the prevailing party as a part of the costs of the action a reasonable amount to be fixed by the court as attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    After July 1, 1985, the maximum amount of the pleading under this section shall be ten thousand dollars.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   RCW 4.84.250 (emphasis added). This cost- and fee-shifting provision manifested a recognition by the legislature of the economic difficulties that arise in fully litigating-whether as plaintiff or defendant-small monetary claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 35 In this light, that Weaver's application for temporary compensation sought less than $10,000 in benefits supports that he sought an amount that did not provide sufficient motivation for a full and vigorous litigation of the initial compensation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 36 Viewed in the totality, the prevailing circumstances underlying Weaver's application for temporary total disability benefits suggest that he did not have sufficient motivation to fully and vigorously litigate the issue of whether his employment caused his cancer during the proceeding on his temporary compensation application. Accordingly, application of collateral estoppel to preclude him from litigating that issue in his present application works an injustice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 37 The Department and the City did not establish that application of collateral estoppel would not work an injustice against Weaver.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the superior court erred by barring Weaver's application on the basis of collateral estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 38 The Department and the City next contend that they established that res judicata precludes Weaver's application for permanent total disability benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 39 We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 40 Res judicata is an equitable court-created doctrine established at common law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weidlich v.

His application for permanent benefits, in contrast, requested recurring pension payments arising from his total inability to obtain gainful employment because of his metastasized malignant melanoma.

Initially, and most obviously, the Act both categorized the relief available to workers into compensation schedules-predicated on the scope of the worker's injury-and fixed to a specified amount the relief available to workers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LAWS OF 1911, ch. 74, \u00a7 5(a), at 356-58 (compensation schedule for an injury causing death); LAWS OF 1911, ch. 74, \u00a7 5(b), at 358 (compensation schedule for an injury causing permanent total disability); LAWS OF 1911, ch. 74, \u00a7 5(d), at 359 (compensation schedule for an injury causing temporary total disability); LAWS OF 1911, ch. 74, \u00a7 5(f), at 360 (compensation schedule for an injury causing permanent partial disability).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Compensation schedules that separated out and established the relief to which a worker was entitled based on the scope of the disability did not, of course, exist at common law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b6 58 Additionally, the Act separated out the relief that the worker could obtain for an aggravation of an initial injury.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   <em>\n    If aggravation,\n   </em>\n   diminution, or termination\n   <em>\n    of disability takes place or be discovered after the rate of compensation shall have been established or compensation termi\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    nated\n   </em>\n   in any case the department may,\n   <em>\n    upon the application of the beneficiary\n   </em>\n   or upon its own motion, readjust for future application the rate of compensation in accordance with the rules in this section provided for the same, or in a proper case terminate the payments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   LAWS OF 1911, ch. 74, \u00a7 5(h) at 360-61 (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Act thus provided a worker with the ability to obtain relief for an initial injury and-in a subsequent action-obtain additional relief that had not been alleged during the initial action. Consequently, this provision also separated the relief available to a worker in a manner not existing at common law. Accordingly, these provisions support that the legislature explicitly separated out the relief available to workers into distinct subject matter, rather than the unified subject matter of the common law claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b6 59 In this light, Weaver's applications under the Act did not seek identical relief. In fact, neither the Department nor the City dispute that his requests for temporary total disability benefits and permanent total disability benefits sought distinct compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   \u00b6 60 Nevertheless, the Department and the City contend that Weaver's applications sought identical relief. This is so, they assert, because the only subject of relief set forth in the Act was compensation for workplace injuries. Therefore, the Department and the City continue, Weaver's applications merely sought compensation under the Act and thus had identical subject matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b6 61 This myopic contention is unconvincing. As analyzed, the foregoing provisions of the Act suggest that the legislature did not, in actuality, set forth a singular form of relief for compensation for workplace injuries. Indeed, a single award of compensation was the relief previously available at common law and, as indicated, the legislature specifically declared that it was abolishing the common law action and replacing it with a distinct statutory scheme. LAWS OF 1911, ch. 74, \u00a7 1, at 345.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b6 62 Thus, the Department and the City have not established that Weaver's applications sought identical relief under the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   ii\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b6 63 The Department and the City have also not established that Weaver's applications involved identical facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b6 64 As indicated, Weaver filed an application for temporary total disability benefits and another application for permanent total disability benefits. In support of his application for temporary compensation that he filed in 2011, he alleged that he suffered from a malignant melanoma on the skin of his shoulder, the treatment of which caused him to miss five weeks of work before he was able to return. He further alleged that his employment as a firefighter caused the cancer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b6 65 In support of his application for permanent compensation that he filed in 2014, he alleged that he suffered from a newly diagnosed metastatic malignant melanoma that manifested itself as a brain tumor and that he was permanently unable to obtain gainful employment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b6 66 Generally speaking, although there are some commonalities between Weaver's applications, it is evident that the facts underlying his applications are not identical. The Act-and judicial construction thereof-reinforce this view.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b6 67 As will be iterated below, the Act's provisions suggest that the legislature split the evidence and proofs that a worker's application could establish in a manner that did not previously exist at common law. To begin, the Act required the following in order to request compensation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   SEC. 5.\n   <em>\n    Schedule of Awards\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    Each workman who shall be injured whether upon the premises or at the plant or, he being in the course of his employment, away from the plant of his employer,\n   </strong>\n   or his family or dependents in case of death of the workman,\n   <strong>\n    shall re\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    ceive out of the accident fund compensation in accordance with the following schedule,\n   </strong>\n   and, except as in this act otherwise provided, such payment shall be in lieu of any and all rights of action whatsoever against any person whomsoever.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   SEC. 12.\n   <em>\n    Filing Claim for Compensation\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   (a)\n   <strong>\n    Where a workman is entitled to compensation under this act he shall file with the department, his application for such, together with the certificate of the physician who attended him,\n   </strong>\n   and it shall be the duty of the physician to inform the injured workman of his rights under this act and to lend all necessary assistance in making this application for compensation and such proof of other matters as required by the rules of the department without charge to the workman.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   LAWS OF 1911, ch. 74, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 12, at 356, 364-65 (bolded emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   These provisions therefore require a worker to submit a certification of his attending physician in order to support his application for compensation, a factual predicate that was not specifically mandated at common law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b6 68 Moreover, establishing an attending physician's certification as a predicate for a worker's application suggests the worker was limited to only alleging the factual basis for an actual-rather than a potential-injury. Unlike at common law, these provisions do not suggest that the worker could allege facts in support of the possibility of additional injury or death arising from the initial injury. Furthermore, by setting forth that a qualifying worker would receive \"compensation in accordance with the following schedule,\" these provisions linked a workers' compensation to the specific injury alleged by the worker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \u00b6 69 Hence, by requiring specific proof of injury and linking the specified compensation to such proof, a distinction not made at common law, these provisions support that the Act separated out the factual basis for requesting relief under the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b6 70 Additionally, the foregoing provision authorizing compensation for a later-discovered aggravation of a worker's initial injury supports this view.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LAWS OF 1911, ch. 74, \u00a7 5(h) at 360-61.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, a worker submitting an application for an aggravation of an initial injury could not rely on the factual basis that supported the worker's initial application for compensation. Rather, the worker was required \"to present medical testimony of a causal connection based on 'some\n   <em>\n    objective medical evidence' that the injury 'has worsened since the initial closure of the claim.\n   </em>\n   ' \"\n   <em>\n    Hendrickson v.

As indicated, at common law, a worker could not, of course, split his claim for damages arising from a single injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b6 71 The provisions setting forth the factual basis for obtaining compensation for an injury that disabled the worker and for an injury that resulted in the worker's death also support that the legislature split the factual basis of a worker's action. As indicated, \u00a7 12 of the Act regarded the filing of a claim for compensation and subsection (a) thereof set forth that, \"Where a workman is entitled to compensation under this act he shall file with the department, his application for such, together with the certificate of the physician who attended him.\" LAWS OF 1911, ch. 74, \u00a7 12(a), at 364. Notably, in subsection (b) of that provision, the legislature set forth that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   [w]here death results from injury the parties entitled to compensation under this act, or some one in their behalf, shall make application for the same to the department,\n   <em>\n    which application must be accompanied with proof of death and proof of relationship\n   </em>\n   showing the parties to be entitled to compensation under this act,\n   <em>\n    certificates of attending physician, if any,\n   </em>\n   and such other proof as required by the rules of the department.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   LAWS OF 1911, ch. 74, \u00a7 12(b), at 364-65 (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given that, an application for an injury resulting in death required proof of death and proof of relationship, a factual basis not identical to an application for an injury that results in a disabling condition. Again, such claim splitting was not permitted at common law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   \u00b6 72 Lastly, that the Act requires distinct factual bases in order to establish a worker's entitlement to a specific compensation schedule supports that the Act separated out the facts of a worker's claim. As pertinent here, the provision regarding a \"temporary total disability\" requires a worker to establish that the worker suffers from \"a condition\n   <em>\n    temporarily\n   </em>\n   incapacitating the workman from performing any work at any gainful occupation.\"\n   <em>\n    Bonko v.

His application for temporary total disability benefits alleged that he had missed five weeks of work arising from the treatment of the malignant melanoma on his shoulder. In contrast, his application for permanent total disability benefits alleged that he was permanently unable to continue on in his employment after the malignant melanoma on his shoulder metastasized and manifested itself as a brain tumor. Indeed, the medical evidence that he would need to present in order to support each application would clearly not be the same. Thus, the factual basis for Weaver's applications are not identical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \u00b6 75 Accordingly, the Department and the City did not establish that his applications involved identical facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   iii\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   \u00b6 76 Lastly, and significantly, the Department and the City did not establish that Weaver could-or should-have litigated the subject matter of his application for permanent total disability benefits at the time that he litigated his application for temporary total disability benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   \u00b6 77 The factual basis for Weaver's application for permanent total disability benefits-the brain tumor-was not discovered until 2014, three years after his application for temporary total disability benefits was submitted. Indeed, it is undisputed that the basis underlying Weaver's allegations of permanent disability did not accrue until 2014-when the brain tumor impaired his capacity to perform the duties of a firefighter. Therefore, the facts underlying Weaver's application for permanent total disability benefits\n   and the relief that he sought thereunder could not have been litigated at the time of his 2011 application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b6 78 Nevertheless, the Department contends that Weaver should have litigated the subject matter set forth in the application here at issue during the 2011 proceeding on his application for temporary total disability benefits. This is so, the Department asserts, because facts regarding the potential that his cancer might metastasize were set forth in the record during the 2011 proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   \u00b6 79 The Department is mistaken. The referenced evidence was subject to exclusion but came in without objection-for reasons tactical or otherwise. Nevertheless, there is no indication that this evidence was material to Weaver's application during the earlier proceeding. Indeed, the possibility that Weaver's cancer might metastasize was irrelevant to whether Weaver was entitled to lump sum compensation recoverable under the Act for his temporary inability to earn wages as a firefighter while recovering from the surgery. Weaver did not fail to litigate something that he should have litigated in the first proceeding. The Department's contention fails.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   \u00b6 80 At the time that Weaver submitted his application for temporary total disability benefits, the facts underlying his application for permanent total disability benefits had not yet occurred and the permanent relief that he sought thereunder could not plausibly have been requested. Thus, the Department and the City have not established the first element of res judicata, that the subject matter of Weaver's applications were identical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   \u00b6 81 Accordingly, the superior court erred by determining that res judicata barred Weaver's application for permanent total disability benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   \u00b6 82 Weaver's application for permanent total disability benefits is not barred by collateral estoppel or by res judicata. In so concluding, we do not intend to suggest that an issue in a workers' compensation action can never be subject to collateral estoppel. Indeed, there may be circumstances in which a worker had an incentive to fully litigate the issue in an initial proceeding but did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   \u00b6 83 In addition, our decision in this matter does not indicate that res judicata can never bar a subsequent petition for compensation in a workers' compensation matter. Indeed, we can easily conceive of circumstances involving the same subject matter where the worker did, could have, or should have litigated the subject matter in an earlier proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   \u00b6 84 However, the laws of preclusion do not rightfully apply to Weaver's application. As elucidated by Washington's foremost scholar on civil procedure, Professor Trautman,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   [t]here is danger that in seeking to relieve the crowded dockets and backlog of litigation, courts will too readily turn to the rules of res judicata and collateral estoppel. It is critical to remember that the doctrines of claim and issue preclusion are court-created concepts. Accordingly, they can be adjusted to accommodate whatever considerations are necessary to achieve the final objective-doing justice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Trautman, 60 WASH. L.

Initially, we are generally reluctant to apply this common law doctrine given that the legislature elected to preempt the worker's common law personal injury action and institute its own statutory scheme while\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    electing to incorporate the law of preclusion into the Act's provisions. Caution in precluding Weaver's application in this matter is further warranted because it would weigh against the legislative judgment that cancer manifesting itself during a worker's employment as a firefighter is presumed to have been caused by the firefighter's employment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    RCW 51.32.185(1).

We note, however, that if the Department or the City contend in the alternative that the Act sets forth\n    <em>\n     multiple\n    </em>\n    causes of action, res judicata would not apply. Indeed, if the Act sets forth multiple causes of action and, as analyzed, the Act abolished the common law action available to workers, this reinforces the view set forth herein that the legislature split the common law cause of action into multiple components. Assuming the common law action was so split, Weaver's applications for compensation constituted separate causes of action and res judicata would not apply.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"21\">\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    After oral argument in this court, the City submitted a statement of additional authorities, citing four cases to us.

This is a case with the result the City desires The opinion is brief, and self-admittedly scant in analysis. It does not mention \"collateral estoppel\" or \"res judicata.\" Nor does it apply the four-part res judicata analysis.
