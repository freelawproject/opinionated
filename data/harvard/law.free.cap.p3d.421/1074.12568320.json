In 2005, Pioneer completed construction of its third apartment building, Pioneer Homestead III (PH III), and in 2013, it learned of a binding door and plaster cracks in a PH III unit. Upon investigation, Pioneer found numerous design deficiencies in the PH III plans, as well as deviations from those plans in the building's construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   [\u00b62] In 2015, Pioneer sued Sargent Engineers, Inc. (Sargent) for professional negligence in the structural engineering services it provided during the design phase of PH III's construction, and Zeist Construction Management, LLC (ZCM) for breach of contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sargent moved for summary judgment, asserting that Pioneer's claims against it were time-barred, and the district court granted that motion. We find that disputed issues of material fact exist with respect to when Pioneer reasonably should have discovered Sargent's alleged negligence, and we therefore reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b63] Pioneer presents a single issue for our review, which we restate as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Were there disputed issues of fact that precluded the district court from ruling that Pioneer's claims were time-barred as a matter of law?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b64] Pioneer operates Teton County's only low-income housing development. Its complex consists of three apartment buildings that offer seventy-eight one-and-two-bedroom independent-living apartments. PH III has twenty-five units, and is Pioneer's most recently constructed building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b65] The construction of PH III began in April 2004 when Pioneer entered into a design/build contract with Idaho-based Superior Modular Systems (SMS). Pursuant to that contract, SMS was to supply modular units that were constructed off-site, deliver them to the PH III building site, and put them together there. Pioneer separately contracted with ZCM to manage the PH III project, and SMS separately contracted with Sargent to provide the required structural engineering plans and specifications for the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b66] On June 1, 2004, Sargent issued a stamped set of plans and specifications for the PH III project. The project then proceeded, and on August 15, 2005, after construction was completed, a certificate of occupancy was issued for the building. Pioneer then began accepting residents for the twenty-five PH III units.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b67] Pioneer encountered issues with PH III at three different times after it was occupied. The first of the concerns occurred in 2006, when residents of PH III noticed noises coming from the attic and wall spaces in the building. Pioneer investigated and found that birds were getting into the building through a vent that, due to an installation error, was stuck in an open position that allowed birds to enter that space. The vent was repaired, and birds were not thereafter able to enter the attic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b68] The next concern was encountered in 2007. In the summer of that year, Pioneer's property managers noticed some concrete cracking underneath a steel support beam in a covered parking area on the property's north side. Upon learning of the cracking, Pioneer notified SMS, which then notified Sargent. It was ultimately determined that the steel beam in question was improperly attached to the concrete in a manner that failed to account for the expansion and contraction that would occur with temperature fluctuations. When the beam expanded and contracted, it caused the concrete to crack and weakened its load-bearing capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b69] Sargent examined the defect, and on October 23, 2007, sent a letter to Pioneer explaining its observations and offering a solution for the problem. In response, Pioneer retained another engineer, F. Richard Scheerer of G &amp; S Structural Engineers, to review Sargent's proposed solution. Mr. Scheerer visited the apartment building, observed the problem, reviewed Sargent's proposal, and agreed that Sargent's solution was an \"appropriate fix.\" Pioneer then made Sargent's recommended repair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b610] The final and most recent issue with PH III, which led to the present dispute, arose in the late spring of 2013 when Pioneer received a complaint from a PH III resident in Unit 210. The resident reported a gap in a corner of that unit's drywall that was large enough to pass fingers through, and a sticking door. In response, Pioneer retained Y2 Consultants, Inc. (Y2), an engineering firm, to inspect the unit and determine the cause of those problems. Y2 performed a site visit on June 4, 2013, and reviewed the plans and specifications and performed its own calculations. On July 16, 2013, Y2 provided a written report of its findings, which were that there were significant design flaws in the plans and specifications for PH III, and defects in its construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b611] On April 7, 2015, Pioneer filed a complaint against ZCG and Sargent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint asserted a claim for breach of contract against ZCG and a claim of professional negligence against Sargent. As to the claim against Sargent, the complaint alleged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   26. Defendants Sargent Engineers, Inc. and Kari Moulton breached their duties in numerous respects including, without limitation:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   a) Failing to design a properly sized glue laminated beam at the north carport entrance;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   b) Failing to specify proper connections of the glue laminated beam;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   c) Including a roof truss design with an inadequate snow load capacity;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   d) Failing to specify proper and workable lateral connections between each modular unit;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   e) Failing to calculate proper dead weight loads for the north wall of the structure; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   f) Failing to design a proper or adequate seismic and wind resistance system for the structure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   27. As a result of the negligence of Defendants Sargent Engineers, Inc. and Kari Moulton the Pioneer Homestead III building was damaged by buckling floors in some units, cracked interior sheetrock at some locations, shifting door frames throughout, and shifting unit walls along hallways.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b612] On July 8, 2016, Sargent filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that Pioneer's claims against it were barred by the two-year statute of limitations applicable to claims for professional errors and omissions. Pioneer opposed Sargent's motion with affidavits by Harry Lawroski, the Pioneer board member who oversaw the PH III project, and Jeffrey Hobson, the Y2 structural engineer who evaluated the PH III plans and specifications. Based on those affidavits, Pioneer argued that questions of disputed fact concerning whether Sargent's negligence was reasonably discoverable within the two-year period of limitations precluded summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b613] On December 12, 2016, the district court issued its summary judgment ruling, which granted Sargent's motion. The court did not specifically discuss Pioneer's supporting affidavits, but concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   For an extension of the two-year limitation to apply under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%201-3-107\">\n    Wyo.

It argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   The undisputed facts demonstrate the first complaint Appellants had with Appellees' work on the project was an allegation that \"certain straps and posts were not called out in the plans or built as specified\" and \"there were no overturning holdowns called out in the plans between floors, allowing the building to oscillate in wind and seismic events and causing cracking.\" ... The fact that certain hold-down straps contained in the design were unconstructable because other mechanical or structural components of the building were in the way must have been identified at the time of construction. Appellees performed no on site work, or any consultation after it provided the plans on June 4, 2004. However the project owner (Appellant), or its agents who performed the work, could not have completed construction without being aware of this situation. ... Once an alleged defect was identified, a reasonable property owner would have investigated further, including obtaining consultation from another engineer if they did not have the requisite knowledge or expertise to do so on their own.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   [\u00b623] This argument fails on a number of grounds. First, the construction of the modular units was done by Pioneer's contractor, SMS, and that construction was done at an SMS facility. SMS constructed the units and was solely in charge of placing them on the foundation and piecing them together. The record contains no evidence that SMS identified the cited defect or understood its ramifications relative to wind and seismic events. One might infer that SMS must have recognized the problem during construction, as urged by Sargent, but it is also plausible that SMS employees were unaware of either the defect or its importance. On summary judgment, Sargent is not entitled to the favorable inference that the defect was identified and understood during construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   [\u00b624] Additionally, the record is clear that SMS was Pioneer's contractor. Even if one could infer that SMS identified a design defect during construction, Sargent cites to no evidence that SMS acted as Pioneer's agent or in any other capacity by which SMS's knowledge could be imputed to Pioneer. Sargent likewise points to no evidence that ZCM, who served as Pioneer's construction manager, had knowledge of these defects during construction. At the very least, questions of material fact remain on the question of whether Pioneer had notice of any design\n   defects during the construction of PH III or was put on inquiry notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     2006: Birds in the Attic\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   [\u00b625] Sargent next contends that in response to the 2006 incident in which birds were found in the PH III attic, a reasonable owner would have ordered a professional review of the PH III engineering design, plans, and specifications. We conclude that Pioneer submitted evidence sufficient to preclude summary judgment based on this incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   [\u00b626] In his affidavit in opposition to summary judgment, Harry Lawroski stated the following concerning the 2006 incident:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   11. In around 2006, residents of PH III noticed noises coming from the attic and wall spaces in the building. It was quickly determined that birds were getting into these areas and causing the noise, and the problem was just as quickly remedied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   12. At my deposition, upon questioning by counsel for Sargent Engineers, I testified briefly about this issue, and indicated that there was \"some separation\" that allowed the birds to get into the southeast corner of the building. In response to the question: \"Was (sic.) there any repairs or corrective action taken as a result of that situation?\" I responded: \"I think they plugged up the holes.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   13. I was a bit loose with my terminology during my testimony. There was no \"separation,\" in the sense that no hole had opened up in the side of the building as the result of any settling or structural problem. The birds were getting in through a vent that had been installed incorrectly. Due to the installation error, the vent was stuck in the open position, providing an opening allowing the birds to get in. It was easily remedied and has not been a problem since.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   14. The Pioneer Homestead Board did not in any way question the structural engineering work of Sargent upon discovering that a faulty vent had let some birds in.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   [\u00b627] Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to Pioneer, it is at least clear that reasonable minds might differ on whether birds in the attic should have alerted Pioneer to the need for a professional review of the PH III engineering design and specifications. The 2006 incident therefore did not provide a basis for summary judgment in favor of Sargent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     2007: Cracking Concrete in Covered Parking Area\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   [\u00b628] Sargent next contends that the 2007 discovery of cracking concrete in the covered parking area on the north side of PH III should have placed Pioneer on notice that it needed a professional review of the engineering design, plans, and specifications. We again disagree that this provides a basis for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   [\u00b629] Pioneer submitted two affidavits in opposition to this summary judgment ground, the affidavit of Jeffrey Hobson, the Y2 structural engineer who reviewed the plans in 2013 and identified the defects, and Harry Lawroski. We will begin with Jeffrey Hobson's affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   [\u00b630] In his affidavit and attached report, Mr. Hobson identified a number of deficiencies in the PH III plans and specifications and detailed those with specificity. He further stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   11. None of the above problems with Sargent's calculations and design have any connection to the concrete breakout issue that occurred in 2007. Sargent has incorrectly stated this concrete failure is spalling, but spalling is a different type of concrete failing than what has occurred. The concrete breakout failure was caused by tension loads. The fact that a particular steel beam was improperly fixed to the concrete wall beneath, and failed to take into account the expansion and contraction that would occur with temperature fluctuations. When the beam expanded and contracted, it caused the concrete to crack, weakening this load-bearing feature and risking a catastrophic failure. This was an isolated problem, with a relatively easy repair.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   12. The discovery of the concrete breakout issue would not have led a reasonable engineer to question Sargent's separate design and engineering calculations for the gravity or lateral load systems of the building. Those more serious issues could not have been reasonably anticipated, and were not identified until 2013, when, in response to complaints about a door sticking and a cracking and separation in one unit, we recommended and conducted a thorough investigation into the plans and engineering calculations that had been performed by Sargent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   13. That investigation took our office several weeks. It required a detailed review of all of the plans and supporting engineering calculations. That effort was not something that any reasonable person would have undertaken just because an unrelated concrete spalling condition had been discovered on one beam in the parking garage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   [\u00b631] Sargent contends that the Hobson affidavit is conclusory and therefore cannot provide a basis to find a disputed issue of fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree. A conclusory affidavit is one that states conclusions or opinions without any underlying facts or basis.\n   <em>\n    Braunstein v. Robinson Family Ltd. P'ship, LLP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994617\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/226/826/\">\n    2010 WY 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994617\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/226/826/\">\n    226 P.3d 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 832 (Wyo. 2010). Mr. Hobson's affidavit plainly states underlying facts and an underlying basis for his conclusions that the 2007 and 2013 incidents were unrelated and the 2007 incident would not have caused a reasonable person to undertake a full-scale review of PH III plans and specifications.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   [\u00b632] Even if we were to ignore Mr. Hobson's affidavit, Pioneer also submitted Mr. Lawroski's affidavit on this question. Mr. Lawroski's affidavit described the 2007 issue and the steps Pioneer took to address it. Specifically, Pioneer contacted SMS, who then contacted Sargent. Sargent then investigated the problem and proposed a solution. The letter from Sargent to Pioneer explaining its findings and proposed solution was\n   attached to Mr. Lawroski's affidavit. Sargent advised (emphasis added):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Thank you for bringing to our attention the spalling concrete at the steel beam bearing location at the Pioneer Homestead III project in Jackson, WY. Sargent Engineers has reviewed the calculations and construction documents for the project. In addition, Kari Moulton a principal in our Driggs office, visited the project site on September 26 to observe the concrete spalling in the foundation wall and to observe other structural components of the project for signs of cracking or spalling. The amount of plate bearing and undamaged concrete at the beam pocket was observed.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     No other non-shrinkage cracks or spalls in the concrete were noted at other locations on the project during the site visit\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Based [on] findings from the site visit and subsequent calculations, the concrete wall has adequate bearing at the undamaged section behind the anchors for the vertical load from the steel beam. However, the anchor capacity has been reduced due to the spalled section. It is recommended that the weld beads at the sides of the beam to the bearing plate be removed allowing the beam to slide on the seat. The spalled section of wall should then be repaired by using non-shrink grout to fill the spalled concrete section tight up against the embedded plate and flush with the adjoining wall. As there is still adequate bearing at the beam pocket,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     this would likely be all that would be necessary to repair the damaged section\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   However, to insure that lateral loads are not transferred to the embedded plate; and to provide[ ] a completely redundant system of vertical and out of plane load transfer we recommend the addition of a steel angle with epoxy bolts embedded into the concrete wall adjoining the spalled section at the beam pocket. Details outlining the grout repair and installation of a stiffened steel angle are provided herewith.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   [\u00b633] Pioneer then hired another engineer, G &amp; S Structural Engineers, to review Sargent's findings and recommendations, and G &amp; S confirmed that Sargent's solution would likely be effective. The G &amp; S correspondence with Pioneer was also attached as an exhibit to Mr. Lawroski's affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   [\u00b634] Pioneer's evidence thus showed that Sargent itself reviewed the 2007 problem, used language suggesting the problem was an isolated one, and offered a repair, which it described as \"all that would be necessary,\" and that an independent engineer verified the findings and the fix. Considering this evidence in the light most favorable to Pioneer, we have no difficulty concluding that reasonable minds might very well differ on the question of whether the 2007 issue should have prompted Pioneer to undertake a full-scale professional review of the PH III design, plans, and specifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   [\u00b635] The affidavits of Mr. Hobson and Mr. Lawroski, and the attached exhibits, make it clear that genuine issues of material fact exist concerning the question of when Pioneer knew or should have known that it needed to investigate defects in the design and construction of PH III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Controlling Precedent\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   [\u00b636] As a final matter, we address Sargent's argument that the outcome of this appeal should be controlled by our decision in\n   <em>\n    Lucky Gate Ranch, L.L.C. v.

An engineering report indicated that the separation was caused by differential movement in the supporting soil, creating a factual question about the cause of such movement. The answer to that question could raise other factual questions as to whether the separation was caused by an act, error or omission by the District and whether it was related to the alleged water main leak. The facts need to be further developed before the beginning of the limitation period for the water main break can be established.
