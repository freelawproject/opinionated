Proceedings in this case began in late December 2014, when the state filed a juvenile neglect action against Mother\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   following a second report\n   from the Rawlins Police Department about deplorable and unsafe living conditions in Mother's home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mother denied the neglect allegations at the shelter care and initial hearing; the juvenile court placed the children in DFS custody for familial foster care placement. Mother later admitted to the neglect allegations at the adjudicatory hearing on March 9, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b64] Following the adjudicatory hearing, the juvenile court appointed a multidisciplinary team (MDT), which recommended reunification as the initial permanency goal. In its October 23, 2015,\n   <em>\n    Order on Review Hearing\n   </em>\n   , the juvenile court found DFS was \"making reasonable efforts for a permanency plan of reunification and a concurrent plan of adoption with family.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b65] In January 2016, at the first permanency hearing, the juvenile court adopted the MDT's recommendation to give Mother another three months to comply with the case plan and court requirements to regain custody of her children, notwithstanding Mother's lack of effort during the prior year. The MDT advised Mother it would change its recommended permanency goal from reunification with a concurrent goal of adoption, to termination and adoption, if Mother failed to make substantial progress. Mother failed to make the necessary progress and, consequently, at the next MDT meeting in April 2016, the MDT recommended changing the permanency plan to adoption. Mother was notified of, but did not attend, the April 2016 MDT meeting; Mother's attorney did attend the meeting. The juvenile court accepted the new permanency recommendation after hearing from all parties, including Mother and her attorney, during a review hearing on April 18, 2016. Mother did not appeal the juvenile court's April 25, 2016,\n   <em>\n    Order Upon Review Hearing\n   </em>\n   despite the fact it found \"efforts to reunify are no longer necessary\" and DFS is \"making reasonable efforts at the concurrent permanency plan of adoption.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b66] Mother also did not appeal the juvenile court's July 21, 2016, order following a permanency hearing on July 18, 2016, which incorporated the MDT's continued recommendation for a permanency goal of termination of parental rights and adoption. DFS filed a civil action in district court to terminate Mother's parental rights on July 25, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b67] The district court held a bench trial on July 12-13, 2017, and entered an order terminating Mother's parental rights to AM-LR and TCG pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2014-2-309\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 14-2-309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(iii) and (v) (Lexis Nexis 2017), on July 26, 2017. The district court found clear and convincing evidence to support both statutory grounds for termination: 1) the children were neglected, DFS' reasonable efforts to rehabilitate were unsuccessful, and both AM-LR's and TCG's health and safety would be seriously jeopardized if they returned to live with Mother; and, 2) AM-LR and TCG had been in foster care for thirty consecutive months and Mother was unfit to have custody and control of the children. Mother timely appealed from the July 26, 2017, termination order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b68] Mother does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to terminate her parental rights or raise\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   issue on appeal relating to the termination proceeding. She instead alleges the juvenile court violated her due process rights in the neglect proceedings by failing to notify her of a change in the nature of the July 18, 2016, hearing, and her right to request an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mother did not attempt to challenge the neglect proceedings directly. Instead, she is using her appeal of the district court's termination of parental rights order to collaterally attack the juvenile court's July 21, 2016,\n   <em>\n    Order Upon Permanency Hearing\n   </em>\n   -an order stemming from a separate proceeding in a different court. Whether Mother may collaterally attack the juvenile court's permanency order by appealing the district court's termination of parental rights order is a question of law we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption of SSO\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12348026\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/406/723/\">\n    2017 WY 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12348026\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/406/723/\">\n    406 P.3d 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 726 (Wyo. 2017) (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Estate &amp; Guardianship of Andrews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9399852\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/39/1021/\">\n    2002 WY 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9399852\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/39/1021/\">\n    39 P.3d 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1025-26 (Wyo. 2002) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b69] We have long recognized \"termination proceedings are entirely separate and distinct from neglect proceedings, deriving their respective genesis from separate statutes and requiring different burdens of proof.\"\n   <em>\n    In re MN v.
