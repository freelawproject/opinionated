Walter Thompson U.S.A., Inc., appeals from the Court of Appeals decision reversing the trial court\u2019s grant of defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(0(10). 181 Mich App 611; 450 NW2d 10 (1989). This Court granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal, limited to the following ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>tions: \"(1) whether there was a genuine issue of fact as to whether plaintiff\u2019s employment was terminated for economic reasons only, and (2) assuming there was a genuine issue of fact regarding the reason(s) for the plaintiff\u2019s discharge, was that factual issue material.\u201d 434 Mich 911 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">We find that plaintiff failed to show the existence of a genuine issue of fact material to his wrongful discharge claim. Plaintiff conceded that defendant was discharging employees because of economic hardship, and presented no evidence, in response to defendant\u2019s summary disposition motion and supporting evidence, sufficient to raise a jury question whether defendant discharged him for bona fide economic reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">I. PACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Plaintiff was senior vice-president for defendant at the time of his termination in November 1986. He had been with defendant continuously since 1976, working the last eight years on an advertising account with Burger King Corporation. At the time of his termination, plaintiff was account director for Burger King field marketing, with an annual salary of $111,140 as of 1985. Although he resided and worked out of defendant\u2019s offices in Michigan, he was part of defendant\u2019s New York office.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Defendant informed plaintiff that his position was being eliminated as part of a work-force reduction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff was notified of his termination by his immediate supervisor, Robert Norsworthy. A few days later, plaintiff received a letter signed by defendant\u2019s corporate officer, Stephen Bowen, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>informing plaintiff that his employment would be discontinued.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Plaintiff filed a complaint against defendant in April 1987, alleging: (1) plaintiff had an oral contract for employment that could only be terminated for just cause, (2) plaintiff was fired without cause, and (3) plaintiff\u2019s discharge was in breach of his contract with defendant. Defendant\u2019s answer included the affirmative defense that plaintiff had been terminated as a part of its work-force reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">After discovery, defendant filed a motion for summary disposition, alleging pursuant to MCR 2.116(0(10) that no genuine issue of material fact existed regarding whether plaintiff\u2019s employment was terminated as part of a work-force reduction. In support of the motion, defendant offered the deposition testimony of plaintiff and Bowen, and documentary evidence relating to plaintiff\u2019s employment history and a Burger King restaurant franchisee application. Bowen\u2019s testimony cited economic factors affecting the company, efforts to reduce the work force in unprofitable areas, and the nonessential nature of plaintiff\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">For purposes of its motion only, defendant conceded that plaintiff had an oral contract of permanent employment terminable only for good cause. Additionally, defendant allowed that plaintiff\u2019s performance was not at issue. Defendant contended nonetheless that it was entitled to judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>ment because plaintiff\u2019s position was eliminated for economic reasons as part of the work-force reduction, and, therefore, his termination was for nonactionable just cause as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">In opposition to defendant\u2019s motion, plaintiff contended that (1) plaintiff\u2019s termination had \"nothing to do with the reduction in work-force,\u201d but was actually a punitive discharge by Bowen, (2) plaintiff had a lifetime good-cause employment contract, (3) Norsworthy would testify \"in support of Plaintiff\u2019s case, and will verify the facts contained herein,\u201d (4) defendant attempted to disguise the true nature of plaintiff\u2019s discharge by doing it in the course of a work layoff, (5) plaintiff was offered a bonus and raise shortly before his termination, indicating his value to the company and, in a typical work-force reduction, a highly paid and valued employee would not be let go, and (6) \"numerous factual disputes\u201d existed such as the terms of the contract, the reason for discharge, and the method utilized by defendant to accomplish the discharge. Plaintiff conceded, however, that defendant was, at the time, reducing its work force for economic reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition. Citing MCR 2.116(G)(4), which requires that the adverse party on a motion for summary disposition must introduce additional evidence beyond its pleadings and briefs to show there is a genuine issue of material fact, the court held: \"Plaintiff has failed to provide any evidentiary support for his claim that he was laid off for punitive reasons and not economic reasons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed, reasoning that although \"there is nothing in the record to indicate that plaintiff\u2019s position was terminated for reasons other than economic motivation,\u201d 181 Mich App 616, the evidence did not show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>plaintiff was hired only for the one position he had held, and that plaintiff had cited certain incidents which allegedly contributed to Bowen\u2019s dislike of him. The Court held that \"the employer must establish economic motivation to terminate the particular employee, as opposed to the employee\u2019s position, where the employee has a just cause contract and the employer has reasonable alternative options for the employee within the organization.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 617-618. The Court concluded that \"[b]ecause we are unable to say that it will be impossible for plaintiff to factually support his position at trial, we hold that the grant of summary disposition was inappropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Plaintiff argues that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Toussaint v Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Michigan, </em>408 Mich 579; 292 NW2d 880 (1980), governs this dispute. In <em>Toussaint, </em>this Court held that an employee may have an enforceable right not to be terminated except for just cause, grounded in either an express oral or written contract or in legitimate expectations arising from an employer\u2019s policy statements. See <em>id. </em>at 598-599. We conclude, however, as the Court of Appeals has held, that bona fide economic reasons for discharge constitute \"just cause\u201d under <em>Toussaint. </em>See <em>Friske v Jasinski Builders, Inc, </em>156 Mich App 468, 472; 402 NW2d 42 (1986); <em>Bhogaonker v Metropolitan Hosp, </em>164 Mich App 563, 565-566; 417 NW2d 501 (1987).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">In the instant case, while plaintiff alleges that Bowen disliked him, he has failed to raise any genuine issue of fact regarding the validity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>defendant\u2019s proofs that adverse business conditions existed and that the elimination of plaintiff\u2019s position was necessitated by those conditions. Indeed, plaintiff conceded that defendant was instituting layoffs for economic reasons at the time. The objective circumstances, as presented by defendant\u2019s proofs, indicate no more than a termination resulting from an economically motivated workforce reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">\"When properly challenged, plaintiff must establish that he has a case on the law and that there are some evidentiary proofs to support his allegations as to any material fact.\u201d <em>Durant v Stahlin, </em>375 Mich 628, 638; 135 NW2d 392 (1965). Under MCR 2.116(G)(4), a party opposing a motion for summary disposition is required to respond with affidavits or other evidentiary materials to show the existence of a factual dispute, rather than relying on the allegations or denials in the pleadings. In this case, plaintiff did not specify any facts in opposition to defendant\u2019s motion in any \"Affidavits, depositions, admissions, or other documentary evidence,\u201d MCR 2.116(G)(3), instead simply stating in his responsive pleading that he would produce at trial evidence that defendant\u2019s economic necessity rationale was a pretext.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">This case thus stands in marked contrast to the recent Court of Appeals decision in <em>Ewers v Stroh Brewery Co, </em>178 Mich App 371; 443 NW2d 504 (1989), where \"plaintiff relied on deposition and documentary evidence which he argued indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>that defendant was experiencing substantial economic growth and operating at a substantial profit before and after his discharge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375. Because plaintiff failed to carry his burden under MCR 2.116(G)(4), we need not address the issue discussed by the Court of Appeals regarding whether the defendant must demonstrate economic reasons not only for the elimination of a just-cause employee\u2019s position, but for the termination of the employee as an individual as well. See 181 Mich App 617-618. In the absence of any sufficient response from plaintiff, defendant\u2019s proofs in this case were adequate to support summary disposition on the ground that plaintiff\u2019s termination was for bona fide economic reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">III. conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">For the reasons stated, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition for defendant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b364-7\">Brickley, Boyle, Riley, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, C.J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b364-9\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AC7\">Dennis McCart was a senior vice president of J. Walter Thompson U.S.A., Inc., an advertising agency. McCart commenced this action against J. Walter Thompson after he was discharged from his employment in November, 1986. McCart claimed that J. Walter Thompson had agreed that he could not be discharged except for good cause, and that his employment was terminated without good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">J. Walter Thompson moved for summary disposition on the ground that there was no genuine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>issue as to any material fact.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For purposes of the motion, J. Walter Thompson did not dispute McCart\u2019s contention that he had an \"oral contract for permanent employment that could be terminated only for good cause.\u201d J. Walter Thompson asserted that it was entitled to a judgment of dismissal because \"it is not disputed\u201d that McCart\u2019s employment was terminated when his position was eliminated \"as part of a reduction in force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">J. Walter Thompson\u2019s assertion that there is no genuine issue whether McCart\u2019s employment was terminated when his position was eliminated as part of a reduction in force is, in a sense, undisputed. The <em>timing </em>of the termination of his employment did, indeed, coincide with a reduction in the work force and the discharge of a number of other employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">McCart did, however, dispute whether the reason for his discharge was a reduction in work force. McCart asserted, in an answer to J. Walter \u25a0Thompson\u2019s motion, that the termination of his employment \"had nothing to do with the reduction in work force, but was a punitive discharge by Defendant\u2019s President, Steve Bowen, in violation of Plaintiff\u2019s contract of employment.\u201d McCart asserted that J. Walter Thompson had \"attempted to disguise Plaintiff\u2019s discharge by doing it in the course of a work reduction layoff, but such attempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>was a ruse.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> McCart added that he would \"produce[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] the testimony of his former boss, Robert Norsworthy, who will testify in support of Plaintiff\u2019s case, and will verify the facts contained herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The majority faults McCart because he did not file an affidavit<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> or other evidentiary materials, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>\"simply statfed] in his responsive pleading that he would produce at trial evidence that defendant\u2019s economic necessity rationale was a pretext,\u201d and concludes that McCart \"failed to carry his burden\u201d under the court rule.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Motions for summary disposition asserting that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact are, indeed, generally supported and opposed with affidavits. The court rule does not, however, require that the motion be supported or opposed in all events by affidavit. The court rule states, rather, that the showing required by an opposing party cannot be made by \"resting] upon the mere allegations or denials of his or her <em>pleading </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The showing must be made, instead, \"by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule . . . ,\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The rule provides that \"affidavits, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>depositions, admissions, or other documentary evidence may be submitted by a party to support or oppose the grounds asserted in the motion.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">J. Walter Thompson pleaded as an affirmative defense that McCart\u2019s \"employment was terminated as part of a contraction of defendant\u2019s work force.\u201d The standard jury instructions, applicable in a \"wrongful discharge\u201d case, provide that where the plaintiff has carried his burden of showing that the employment relationship could not be terminated except for good or just cause, \"[t]he defendant [J. Walter Thompson] has the burden of proving that it had good or just cause to terminate the plaintiff\u2019s employment.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aup\">The question then arises whether it is J. Walter Thompson\u2019s burden to show that the asserted good or just cause \u2014 reduction in work force/economic necessity \u2014 was not, as McCart asserts, pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">In an employment discrimination case, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing discrimination, whether it be discrimination based on age, religion, race, or sex.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When the plaintiff proffers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>prima facie evidence of discrimination, the employer must then offer a reason for its action or nonaction negating age, religious, racial, or sexual discrimination.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The plaintiff-employee may assert that the reason is pretextual, but nevertheless continues to have the ultimate burden of showing and persuading the trier of fact that there was discrimination.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">J. Walter Thompson, which has the ultimate burden of proving its reduction in work force/ economic necessity affirmative defense, may, as an aspect of that burden, similarly have the burden of proving that the reason for discharging McCart was its stated reason, economic necessity, and not personal animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The burden on a party, such as McCart, oppos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>ing a motion for summary disposition, is to show that there is a genuine issue as to an <em>essential </em>element<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of the opposing party\u2019s case. If the bona fides of the asserted good cause \u2014 the absence of pretext \u2014 is an essential element of J. Walter Thompson\u2019s case, and J. Walter Thompson has the burden of proving that essential element, it is entitled to summary disposition only if it, not McCart, establishes that there is no genuine issue whether McCart was discharged because of economic necessity or personal animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The parties have neither briefed nor argued the question whether the ultimate burden of proof and persuasion on the issue of good cause remains with the defendant in a \"wrongful discharge\u201d case where the defendant asserts as an affirmative defense good or just cause on the basis of reduction in force/economic necessity and the plaintiff contends that this is pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Summary disposition is not appropriate when the moving party\u2019s factual assertions depend on the credibility of a witness. The United States Supreme Court has said, in this context, that an affiant who, like Bowen, was an officer of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>moving party was \"clearly an interested witness\u201d requiring \" 'the credibility of his testimony to be submitted to the jury as a question of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sartor v Arkansas Natural Gas Corp, </em>321 US 620, 624, 628; 64 S Ct 724; 88 L Ed 967 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">MCR 2.116(0(10), \"no genuine issue as to any material fact,\u201d is derived word for word from corresponding FR Civ P 56. The advisory committee on the federal rule stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">Where an issue as to a material fact cannot be resolved without observation of the demeanor of witnesses in order to evaluate their credibility, summary judgment is not appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">J. Walter Thompson\u2019s assertions that McCart was discharged as part of a work-force reduction, <em>necessitated by the need to economize and reduce overhead, </em>and was not prompted by personal animus, depends entirely on the credibility of Stephen Bowen\u2019s testimony on deposition.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">McCart was not discharged in accordance with the terms of a facially neutral plan for determining who should be discharged. It appears that Bowen ordered that McCart be discharged, and then left it to Robert Norsworthy, McCart\u2019s immediate superior, to determine how the rest of the work-force reduction would be achieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Bowen\u2019s assertions in his deposition that he directed that McCart be discharged only because of economic necessity, that he bore McCart no ill will, and that McCart was not discharged because of personal animus, constituted assertions regarding Bowen\u2019s state of mind when he ordered McCart discharged. This Court has said that in such a case summary disposition may not be granted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>The probative value of a witness\u2019s testimony as to his own state of mind depends upon his credibility, and, when the credibility of a witness or deponent is crucial, summary judgment should not be granted. <em>Arber v Stahlin, </em>382 Mich 300, 308-309 [170 NW2d 45] (1969). An averment of what the defendant believed or thought, as distinguished from an averment of the existence of objective facts, does not put a plaintiff to the burden of presenting evidentiary facts of actual malice to withstand a summary judgment action. <em>[Walker v Cahalan, </em>411 Mich 857 (1981).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">In <em>Arber, supra, </em>p 308, this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">[S]ummary judgment is not available whenever a presented issue of material fact turns upon the credibility of an affiant or witness whose deposition has been taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">If Thompson\u2019s motion had \"specifically identified]\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the pivotal issue, the bona tides of its stated reason for terminating McCart\u2019s employment, then it would be McCart\u2019s obligation to \"set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">The majority, proceeding on the erroneous premise that McCart had not complied with the rule because he did not file an affidavit or a deposition, does not examine McCart\u2019s deposition or Bowen\u2019s deposition<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u2014 relied on in J. Whiter Thompson\u2019s motion \u2014 to determine whether they contain statements bearing on whether there is a genuine issue regarding the reason for the elimination of McCart\u2019s position and for his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">The majority states that \"while plaintiff alleges that Bowen disliked him, he has failed to raise any genuine issue of fact regarding the validity of defendant\u2019s proofs that adverse business conditions existed and that the elimination of plaintiff\u2019s position was necessitated by those conditions.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> While McCart did not dispute J. Walter Thompson\u2019s evidence of <em>adverse business conditions, </em>there was a genuine issue of material fact whether the <em>elimination of McCart\u2019s position was necessitated by or based on business conditions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">There was no evidence, other than Bowen\u2019s assertions, that McCart\u2019s employment was terminated because of adverse business conditions. The only \"evidence\u201d that the elimination of McCart\u2019s position was \"necessitated\u201d by business conditions is the statement in J. Walter Thompson\u2019s <em>unsworn </em>motion that McCart\u2019s position was eliminated \"as part\u201d of a reduction in force,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and <em>assertions </em>of good faith by Bowen on deposition, which assertions, again, were <em>not </em>bases of the motion for summary disposition. It is again relevant that, in all events, Bowen\u2019s credibility was clearly in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, there was \"evidence, in response to defendant\u2019s summary disposition motion and supporting evidence, sufficient to raise a jury question whether defendant discharged him for bona fide economic reasons.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The evidence was, to be sure, not \"presented\u201d by McCart \u2014 it was presented by J. Walter Thompson when it presented for consideration on the motion McCart\u2019s and Bowen\u2019s depositions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>a letter from Bowen to McCart explaining why he had been discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">While McCart\u2019s position was eliminated and his duties transferred to other persons, McCart testified on deposition that there were constant restructurings and realignments of positions at J. Walter Thompson with transfers of duties and revisions in the titles of persons performing particular duties. A trier of fact could reasonably infer that a restructuring and realignment at J. Walter Thompson might not be substantive and does not necessarily evidence that McCart\u2019s position was eliminated for economic rather than personal reasons. To be sure, McCart\u2019s credibility is also, because of his interest in the outcome, suspect; precisely, this was all for the trier of fact to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">While Bowen testified that he bore no ill will or personal animus to McCart, McCart countered in his testimony that he felt that Bowen was out to get him from the time that McCart had declined, out of loyalty to Robert Norsworthy, to whom he reported, to accept Bowen\u2019s offer of promotion to Norsworthy\u2019s position. McCart had been on his guard ever since, and was fearful that alternative work assignments, from time to time offered to him by Bowen, were designed to separate him from his strong client ties so that Bowen could eventually fire him.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> That was McCart\u2019s major concern in declining such \u201copportunities.\u201d_</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>McCart\u2019s testimony in that regard was specific, recounting a number of efforts by Bowen to remove him from his ties with the Burger King account. With only one exception, the positions which Bowen offered McCart all involved a loss of responsibility or status for McCart.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>exception was a position in which three or four others had been unsuccessful in the recent past. Bowen confirmed that if McCart had accepted that position, McCart\u2019s annual salary would have been increased by $50,000 and McCart would have received a $100,000 sign-up bonus. In McCart\u2019s view, Bowen was prepared to pay $100,000 to separate McCart from a tie with Burger King and place him in a position in which he would, like the others, fail. Employees do not ordinarily turn down a $50,000 raise, and a $100,000 bonus; that is some evidence that McCart\u2019s concerns were real.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">McCart said that Bowen had assured him that Bowen did not have a problem with McCart declining the offers of new positions. Yet, on the last occasion, early in the year McCart was discharged, when McCart, declining the proposed new assignment, $50,000 raise, and $100,000 bonus, said, \"I\u2019d just as soon stay in my position,\u201d Bowen responded, \"I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll allow that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">McCart also testified regarding a run-in with Bowen a few years earlier, following which McCart tendered his resignation in writing, and Bowen acknowledged \u2014 before achieving the power he later acquired \u2014 that he had \"overstepped his bounds.\u201d A restructuring and realignment was worked out that did not involve Bowen overseeing McCart, but, within less than a year, McCart found himself again reporting, through Norsworthy, to Bowen.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Bowen was questioned about his assertion, in a letter sent shortly after McCart was discharged, that McCart had been \"considering other business alternatives than J. Walter Thompson,\u201d and de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>nied that was a factor in the decision to terminate McCart\u2019s employment. That denial is not consistent with Bowen\u2019s letter to McCart stating that \"I\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> could not discharge other persons \"who have an expressed desire for a future with jwt in order to retain you for however long you might choose to continue in \u201987, having made it very clear for some time that you did not wish to continue with jwt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">McCart denied he was planning on leaving J. Walter Thompson; McCart\u2019s declining the $50,000 raise and $100,000 bonus tends to support that denial. Be that as it may, the letter indicates that J. Walter Thompson and Bowen had a choice, that it may not have been \"necessary\u201d because of economic conditions to discharge McCart, and that Bowen may have made the decision to discharge McCart in part for a reason other than the stated reason of economic necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The dichotomy between the assertion in the letter that this was a factor, and the denial on deposition, again poses the credibility issue. If the trier of fact were to decide that Bowen deliberately mischaracterized McCart\u2019s motives or reasons for declining Bowen\u2019s offers of new positions, and in asserting that McCart might choose to resign in 1987, and that Bowen made a personal decision prompted by personal animus to direct that McCart be discharged under the cover of an economic layoff of others, which was, as McCart charged, a ruse insofar as McCart was concerned, the trier of fact could properly conclude that J. Walter Thompson did not have good or just cause for discharging McCart.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Credibility was an issue, Bowen\u2019s, McCart\u2019s, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>(see n 19) Norsworthy\u2019s.

This Court ruled that plaintiff Rizzo\u2019s answer to the defendant\u2019s dramshop motion for summary disposition, promising medical testimony to prove that the allegedly intoxicated person was indeed intoxicated, raised a genuine issue of fact. The Court held that the trial judge erred in failing to consider, when ruling on the motion, the offer to produce competent medical testimony at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">The offer to \"produce competent medical evidence . . . that Contardi was under the influence of intoxicating beverages after drinking four (4) beers\u201d along with Contardi\u2019s admission in his deposition of drinking that amount certainly creates an issue of fact as to Contardi\u2019s intoxicated condition prior to the subsequent service of screwdrivers by defendants according to further testimony in his deposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-9\">As stated above, it is true that this offer to produce medical evidence cannot be totally characterized as an affidavit, deposition, admission, or documentary evidence under GCR 1963, 117.3. <em>This, however, is data in the form of the permitted category of a \u2019\u2019pleading\u201d (i.e., plaintiffs\u2019 answer to defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment) or in lieu of an affidavit which is not required of an opposing party. </em>It is supportive of plaintiffs\u2019 claim and should have been considered by the trial judge in ruling on the motions. <em>[Id., </em>p 377.
