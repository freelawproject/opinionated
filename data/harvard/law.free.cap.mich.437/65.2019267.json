The trial court found the coverage exclusion ambiguous, because it was unclear whether a motorcycle was a motor vehicle for purposes of the exclusion, and therefore unenforceable. The Court of Appeals affirmed. We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>i</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">In August, 1985, the plaintiff was riding his wife\u2019s motorcycle when he collided with an uninsured automobile. The insurance policy on the motorcycle did not provide uninsured motorist coverage. The insurance policy on the plaintiff\u2019s wife\u2019s automobile did provide such coverage, however. The plaintiff applied for benefits under that policy, but the defendant denied the claim on the basis of the policy\u2019s \"other owned vehicle\u201d exclusion, which stated that injuries suffered while occupying a motor vehicle owned by the plaintiff\u2019s wife, other than the vehicle specifically named in the policy, were not covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The plaintiff brought a declaratory judgment action in Wayne Circuit Court on October 9, 1985, to determine his entitlement to benefits under his wife\u2019s automobile policy. Both parties moved for summary disposition. The defendant asserted that the exclusion precluded coverage. The plaintiff claimed that the exclusion did not apply because a motorcycle was not a motor vehicle for purposes of the exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The trial court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion, finding the coverage exclusion ambiguous and therefore unenforceable. The court concluded that it was unclear whether a motorcycle was a motor vehicle for purposes of the exclusion. As evidence of such ambiguity, it cited the policy\u2019s use of the term \"occupying\u201d in connection with the term \"motor vehicle,\u201d which it thought could indicate that the latter was intended to encompass only four-wheeled vehicles. The trial court also thought that the defendant\u2019s failure expressly to refer to motorcycles in the policy contributed to the exclusion\u2019s ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>decision in a brief unpublished opinion per curiam, <em>Bianchi v Auto Club of Michigan, </em>decided March 1, 1989 (Docket No. 93830). Our grant of leave to appeal was not limited. 435 Mich 861 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Uninsured motorist coverage is not required in Michigan. <em>Bradley v Mid-Century Ins Co, </em>409 Mich 1; 294 NW2d 141 (1980). Thus, the provisions of the no-fault act, MCL 500.3101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 24.13101 <em>et seq., </em>are not at issue in this case. The sole issue is one of contractual interpretation. Specifically, we must decide whether the uninsured motorist protection that the plaintiff\u2019s wife purchased for her jeep covered injuries the plaintiff suffered while operating his wife\u2019s motorcycle. We agree with the defendant that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The exclusionary language at issue is contained in part iv of the insurance agreement, entitled \"Uninsured Motorists Insurance Coverage,\u201d and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-8\">This coverage does not apply to <em>bodily injury </em>sustained by an <em>insured person:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-9\">while <em>occupying </em>a <em>motor vehicle </em>which is owned by you or a <em>relative </em>unless that <em>motor vehicle </em>is <em>your car. </em>[Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">A number of the terms found in the exclusion are specifically defined in the policy. The term \"motor vehicle\u201d is defined in the uninsured motorists section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-11\"><em>Motor Vehicle </em>means a land motor vehicle or <em>trailer, </em>requiring vehicle registration, but does not mean:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-12\">a vehicle used as a residence or premises;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>a vehicle, whether the accident occurs on or off the highway, which is a snowmobile, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-4\">operated on rails or crawler treads, or a farm-type tractor, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">equipment designed for use principally off the highway. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The terms \"your car\u201d and \"occupying\u201d are defined at the beginning of the policy, under the heading \"Definitions Used Throughout This Policy\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\"><em>Your car, </em>which is the vehicle described on the Declaration Certificate and identified by a specific Vehicle Reference Number, a <em>replacement, </em>a <em>temporary substitute </em>and a <em>trailer </em>owned by <em>you </em>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\"><em>Occupying, Occupied </em>means in, getting into, or out of. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">The lower courts\u2019 findings that it is unclear from the language of the exclusion and the supporting definitions whether a motorcycle is a motor vehicle for purposes of the exclusion are best stated in the Court of Appeals decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-10\">In this case, the definition of a motor vehicle as a land motor vehicle or trailer, excluding five different categories of vehicles, created an ambiguity whether or not the motorcycle was intended to be subject to the exclusion. The omission of an explicit reference to motorcycles and the absence of a delineation of physical characteristics of a motor vehicle could have reinforced the insured\u2019s impression that a motorcycle lacks the status of a motor vehicle. When this ambiguity is read in conjunction with the requirement that the insured be occupying the vehicle at the time of the accident, suggesting that the operator be enclosed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>within the vehicle, the confusion to the reader of the policy becomes all the more apparent. [Slip op, P 3.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">In <em>Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n v DeLaGarza, </em>433 Mich 208, 213; 444 NW2d 803 (1989), we stated that an insurance contract is ambiguous when its provisions are capable of conflicting interpretations. Citing our earlier opinion in <em>Raska v Farm Bureau Ins Co, </em>412 Mich 355, 362; 314 NW2d 440 (1982), we elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">A contract is said to be ambiguous when its words may reasonably be understood in different ways.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">If a fair reading of the entire contract of insurance leads one to understand that there is coverage under particular circumstances and another fair reading of it leads one to understand there is no coverage under the same circumstances the contract is ambiguous and should be construed against its drafter and in favor of coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-9\">Yet if a contract, however inartfully worded or clumsily arranged, fairly admits of but one interpretation it may not be said to be ambiguous or, indeed, fatally unclear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">In <em>Powers v DAIIE, </em>427 Mich 602; 398 NW2d 411 (1986), we made clear that any ambiguity in an insurance policy drafted by an insurer is to be construed against the insurer and in favor of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">While we agree with the Court of Appeals that the other-owned-vehicle exclusion in the policy before us is not a model of clarity, we cannot conclude that it, or the policy as a whole, \"fairly admits\u201d of more than one interpretation, even when construed against the defendant. In our opinion, a motorcycle plainly fits within the definition of a motor vehicle for purposes of the un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>insured motorists section, and thus within the other-owned-vehicle exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The uninsured motorists section of the policy broadly defines \"motor vehicle\u201d to mean \"a land motor vehicle or trailer, requiring vehicle registration,\u201d but expressly excludes from the definition five kinds of vehicles that might otherwise fit that description. Motorcycles are not among the stated exceptions. The question thus becomes whether a motorcycle fits within the broad definition. Plainly, it does. A motorcycle is a motor vehicle in both the common sense<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the dictionary sense<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the term, it is operated on land, and it is required to be registered. MCL 257.216; MSA 9.1916.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">While the use of the term \"motor vehicle\u201d within the definition \"motor vehicle\u201d appears somewhat circular at first blush, under the circumstances it does not create an ambiguity. In context, its use indicates that for purposes of this section relating to uninsured motorists, the term is to be given its usual meaning. This contrasts, for example, with the separate definition of the term in the no-fault coverage section of the policy,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which limits its meaning to vehicles with more than two wheels and expressly exempts motorcycles and mopeds. That definition of motor vehicle conforms with that found in the no-fault act itself, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>excludes motorcycles. MCL 500.3101(2)(a); MSA 24.13101(2)(a). The broader definition of the term in the uninsured motorist section, on the other hand, is more akin to the use of the term in the Motor Vehicle Code, which includes motorcycles. MCL 257.33; MSA 9.1833.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Given the scope of the definition of a motor vehicle for purposes of the uninsured motorist coverage, we cannot agree with the lower courts that the failure of the definition explicitly to refer to motorcycles \"could have reinforced the insured\u2019s impression that a motorcycle lacks the status of a motor vehicle.\u201d Slip op, p 3. In fact, just the opposite is true. The fact that the first part of the definition is so broad and is followed by the express exclusion of five different categories of vehicles, into which motorcycles clearly do not fit, must necessarily reinforce the reader\u2019s conclusion that a motorcycle <em>is </em>a motor vehicle for purposes of this section. In this case, the oft-cited (but often misused) legal maxim, \"expressio unius est exclusio alterius\u201d \u2014 express mention of one thing implies exclusion of other similar things \u2014 plainly applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The use of the term \"occupying\u201d in the exclusion is even less problematic. Once it is established that a motorcycle fits within the broad definition of a motor vehicle for purposes of the uninsured motorist coverage, and is not included in the express exceptions to that definition, it makes little sense to read the term \"occupy\u201d as narrowly as do the plaintiff and the lower courts. Given the broad category of vehicles included within the scope of the motor vehicle definition, \"occupy\u201d is certainly an adequate term to indicate the use of a vehicle.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>We agree with the defendant that the plaintiff was occupying a motor vehicle at the time the accident occurred, and that the other-owned-vehicle exclusion in his wife\u2019s automobile policy therefore applies. Summary disposition should have been granted in the defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Our conclusion that a motorcycle is a motor vehicle for purposes of the exclusion, and that the exclusion precludes coverage of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, is a matter of contractual interpretation and is based on the language of the policy before us. The decisions of this Court on prior occasions, and the decisions of other courts in other cases, are therefore of limited value to our interpretation of that language. We note, however, that our decision today comports with that of other courts which have construed similar language in other policies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">We agree with the defendant that a motorcycle is a motor vehicle for purposes of the automobile policy\u2019s other-owned-vehicle exclusion, and that summary disposition should have been granted for the defendant. We reverse the decisions of the trial court and Court of Appeals, and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion._</p>\n<judges id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Cavanagh, C.J., and Levin, Brickley, Riley, Griffin, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-7\"> \"The terms of an insurance policy should be construed in the plain, ordinary and popular sense of the language used, as understood by an ordinary person . 14 Callaghan, Michigan Civil Jurisprudence, Insurance, \u00a7 149, p 134.
