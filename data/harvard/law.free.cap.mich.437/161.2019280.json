In this case we granted leave to appeal to determine \"whether the trial judge erred reversibly by refusing to instruct the jury that the defendant was entitled to use deadly force to resist a sexual assault. Cf. <em>People v </em>[Heflin], 434 Mich 482 [456 NW2d 10] (1990).\u201d 435 Mich 867 (1990). After considering this matter, we are persuaded that the trial court did err, but that the error was harmless. We therefore affirm the judgments of the Court of Appeals and the Oakland Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">This defendant has been convicted of first-degree murder. MCL 750.316; MSA 28.548. The Court of Appeals has summarized the facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-11\">Briefly, the victim was an eighty-one-year-old white male and retired Lutheran minister. He suffered from various physical ailments and relied on a cane to walk. Defendant is a young, black woman who worked as a companion to another resident in the same apartment complex as the victim. Defendant and the victim were acquainted and defendant was present at the victim\u2019s apartment on the evening of his death. Defendant admits to killing the victim, but claims that she did so in self-defense. Specifically, defendant claims that the victim started to make sexual advances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>towards her and would not stop even when she resisted. According to the medical examiner, the victim suffered ten blows to the head with a blunt instrument and approximately thirty-two stab wounds to the back. In a statement to the police during the investigation, defendant indicated that her reaction and the extent of her conduct in defending herself was in part a result of her having been previously raped and the fear of it happening again. [179 Mich App 702, 704-705; 446 NW2d 549 (1989).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Using the standard instruction, the trial court instructed the jury that the defendant could defend herself from death or \"serious bodily harm\u201d with force, \"even to the extent of taking a human life if necessary.\u201d See CJI 7:9:01, now CJI2d 7.15. However, the trial court refused the defendant\u2019s timely request that the standard self-defense instruction be modified so that the jury would be specifically informed that deadly force may be used to resist a \"sexual assault.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aqv\">We addressed this issue in <em>People v Heflin, </em>434 Mich 482; 456 NW2d 10 (1990), reh den 435 Mich 1203 (1990). This Court\u2019s opinions contained varying formulations of the precise basis and extent of a court\u2019s obligation to give such an instruction. However, a majority of us were in agreement that, upon request and where there is a sufficient evidentiary basis, a court must instruct the jury that force, including deadly force, may be used to repel an imminent forcible sexual penetration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>pp <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>502-503, 509-515, 527-530, 551-567. In the present case, there was both a request and an evidentiary basis for such an instruction, and it should have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Although the trial court erred when it failed to instruct the jury correctly with regard to the use of deadly force, the error was harmless for the reasons stated in the concurring opinion in the Court of Appeals. 179 Mich App 710-711. The decedent was eighty-one years old, walked with a cane, and was described as being unsteady on his feet. The defendant is in her early twenties, five feet, seven inches tall, and weighs 170 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The evidence thoroughly contradicted the defendant\u2019s version of how and why she killed the elderly and infirm victim. We agree with Judge Marilyn Kelly\u2019s concurring opinion in the Court of Appeals that, on this record, no reasonable juror would have believed the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">Defendant bludgeoned the deceased ten times and stabbed him thirty-two times. Some of the wounds appeared to have been inflicted while he attempted to crawl away. . . . [N]o reasonable juror could have believed such force was necessary to prevent rape by the enfeebled deceased. <em>[People v Barker, </em>179 Mich App 702, 711 (Kelly, J., concurring).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgments of the Court of Appeals and the Oakland Circuit Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b412-9\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Brickley, Boyle, Riley, and Griffin, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-7\"> The term \"sexual assault\u201d may mean a variety of things, including sexual activity which contemplates something less than forcible sexual penetration. Here, the defendant testified concerning actions of the deceased, and stated that these actions caused her to fear that he would rape her, i.e., that he would force her to engage in sexual penetration. Defense counsel\u2019s generalized request was grounded in that evidentiary basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b411-8\"> As with any use of deadly force, defendant\u2019s belief must be both honest and reasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b412-10\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJ6\">(dissenting). I concur in the conclusion that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>jury that Stacey Barker was justified in using \"force, including deadly force\u201d if she honestly and reasonably believed that it was necessary to use such force \"to repel an imminent forcible sexual penetration.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">I dissent from the Court\u2019s disposition because I do not agree that the error was harmless, either for the reasons stated in the concurring opinion in the Court of Appeals,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or for the reasons stated in the memorandum opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">The evidence suggests that there was, and is consistent with, a sudden affray. Barker assaulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Frank Madsen with impromptu weapons; first with a statuette that she obtained from the top shelf of furniture in the foyer of Madsen\u2019s apartment and then, after the struggle continued in the kitchen, with a kitchen knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">This Court should not lightly assume that an eighty-one-year-old man does not have sexual interests, and is incapable of being aroused by and making a sexual assault on a younger woman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-7\">In general, there is no reason why healthy older people cannot continue to enjoy sex until almost the very end. A man, despite a lowered sperm count, is still capable of fathering children even into his eighties .... [Rosenfeld, <em>Prolongevity II </em>(New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1985), p 177.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-8\">Although sperm production slows down after age forty, it continues into the eighties and nineties. [Masters, Johnson &amp; Kolodny, <em>Human Sexuality </em>(Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Co, 1982), p 170.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">It cannot properly be said that no reasonable juror would have believed that Madsen made a sexual assault on Barker. Nor can it properly be said that an instruction that Barker could use deadly force to prevent oral sexual advances\u2014 Barker\u2019s lawyer spoke of Madsen seeking to lick Barker\u2019s body \u2014 may not have resulted in acquittal, conviction of a lesser offense, or another mistrial because all twelve jurors were unable to agree on a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">As set forth in the memorandum opinion, Barker requested an instruction that deadly force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>may be used to resist a \"sexual assault.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The memorandum opinion states that Barker was entitled to an instruction \"that force, including deadly force, may be used to repel an imminent forcible sexual penetration.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The memorandum opinion does not state that a judge should instruct the jury with respect to what the term \"sexual penetration\u201d means. Judges may therefore read the memorandum opinion either as not requiring, or not permitting, an instruction in that regard. It should be made clear that the instruction should generally state that \"sexual penetration\u201d includes not only vaginal intercourse, but also \"cunnilingus, fellatio, anal intercourse, or any other intrusion, however slight, of any part of a person\u2019s body or of any object into the genital or anal openings of another person\u2019s body,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that emission of semen is not required._</p>\n<p id=\"AUo\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The judge who filed the concurring opinion in the Court of Appeals said that Barker \"bludgeoned the deceased ten times and stabbed him thirty-two times. Some of the wounds appeared to have been inflicted while he attempted to crawl away.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judge said that although the jurors were not told that Barker \"was entitled to use deadly force, no reasonable juror could have believed such force was necessary to prevent rape by the enfeebled deceased.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">While the prosecutor argued that Frank Madsen was crawling away, the medical examiner testified that he was unable to determine whether the assailant, Barker, was standing behind, in front of, or at the side of Madsen when the wounds were inflicted. Barker testified that, rather than crawling away, Madsen continued to assault her after she struck him on the head with the statuette, and followed her into the kitchen. And it was for that reason that she picked up a kitchen knife, and, in a frenzy, stabbed him as many times as she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">A woman who cleaned Madsen\u2019s apartment every day, and who discovered Madsen\u2019s body, described him as \"a strong man, a big man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">It was for the jurors, and not for the judges of the Court of Appeals or for the justices of this Court, to decide whether Madsen was attempting to crawl away or was continuing a sexual assault when he was stabbed. It was also the function of the jurors, and neither our function nor that of the Court of Appeals, to decide \u2014 if the jurors found that Madsen had initiated and persisted in a sexual assault \u2014 the extent to which he was enfee<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>bled, and the force Barker honestly and reasonably believed to be necessary to prevent a continuation of the sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">If the jurors concluded, in agreement with the concurring Court of Appeals judge, that deadly force was not needed to prevent rape, they might nevertheless, if properly instructed that Barker was entitled to use deadly force if she honestly and reasonably believed that a sexual assault/forcible sexual penetration was imminent, have found her guilty of a lesser oifense than first-degree murder. Thus, even if none of the jurors \" 'believed such [deadly] force was necessary to prevent rape by the enfeebled deceased,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> one or more of the jurors, if so properly instructed, might have reasonably concluded \u2014 as we are advised one juror did in the first trial<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u2014 that Barker was guilty of the lesser oifense of manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The majority does not state the basis for the conclusion set forth in the memorandum opinion that the \"evidence thoroughly contradicted the defendant\u2019s version of how and why she killed the elderly and infirm victim.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AbL\">The constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">Decisions of the supreme court, including all decisions on prerogative writs, shall be in writing and shall contain a concise statement of the facts and reasons for each decision and reasons for each denial of leave to appeal. When a judge dissents in whole or in part he shall give in writing the reasons for his dissent. [Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 6.]_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>The majority does not state the facts, other than to repeat the summary provided by the majority in the Court of Appeals. The majority in the Court of Appeals did not, however, predicate affirmance on harmlessness of instructional error, but rather on its conclusion that there was no instructional or other error. Accordingly, the factual narration provided by the Court of Appeals did not focus on the asserted harmlessness of the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Barker, her counsel, bench and bar, and the public at large are left to wonder what evidence the majority has in mind in stating that the evidence thoroughly contradicted Barker\u2019s version of how and why she killed Madsen. The majority\u2019s conclusory statement does not comply with the constitutional requirement obliging the Court to provide a concise statement of the facts and the reasons for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Madsen\u2019s daughter testified that her father was an affectionate man, and that women had called him a \"great kisser.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Madsen\u2019s wallet was found in his apartment containing $61 in cash<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and a card with Barker\u2019s telephone number written on it. A woman testified that in October, 1986, she was working in a Bennigan\u2019s restaurant in Southfield and observed Barker having dinner with an elderly gentleman who walked with a cane. She said that the two were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>acting \"like a young couple, like girlfriend and boyfriend . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">A detective testified that Barker told him that she met Madsen while working for another resident and that they became friends. He invited her to his apartment a number of times, and they went out to lunch and dinner. On another occasion, he paid her for cleaning his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Barker told the detective that on November 5, Madsen telephoned her and asked her to visit him. They began the evening watching television. He came over on the couch where Barker was and started touching her. \"I just started laughing[.] I said, Frank, what are you doing because he had told me that he was impotent.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"As-\">Barker\u2019s aunt and a number of women in the complex where Madsen lived had told her that she should stay away from Madsen \"because he was a dirty old man, but I felt like he was just nice and he just needed company.\u201d She was not concerned about him trying to sexually approach her, because he had never tried, and he had told her that he was impotent.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">This night, he kept pulling on her clothes, telling her he just wanted to touch her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">[H]e just wanted to look at me and I kept trying to laugh it off and tell him, no, would you stop, you\u2019re being bad and he was telling me, you know, that he had been taking me out to dinner, spending money on me, buying me things and giving me money and he had been with me, you know, he had been seeing me for a long time and it was about time I started being nice to him. So I said, Frank, I\u2019m always nice to you and the whole time this was going on he was just laughing and smiling you know, like it was a joke and I kept telling him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>he was scaring me and to please stop and then he didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-4\">And, you know, he started scaring me because he seemed like he was trying to take advantage of me, but he was laughing so it was like he was joking with me. So I kept saying, Frank, would you please stop, just stop, so I got up and I started walking towards the door. I was just gonna leave because I didn\u2019t want him pawing all over me and then he came behind me and he was grabbing me, telling me he wasn\u2019t gonna let me go and I really got scared because I had been raped before and I had to see a rape counselor and I just didn\u2019t want it to happen again. And then he started pulling on my blouse and I was \u2014 I just kept saying over and over please stop, just please leave me alone and then he started grabbing me harder so I just wanted him to leave me alone so I hit him with this statue and then he . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">A lot of things are a blur, but all I can remember is that I was scared.

Instead he tried to kiss on me, so he backed me up into the kitchen against the sink and he was kissing on my neck and slobbering on me.
