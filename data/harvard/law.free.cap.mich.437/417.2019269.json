Allen, as personal representative of her deceased husband, Ray F. Allen, after she had, as his widow, entered into a redemption agreement respecting Garden Orchards, Inc.\u2019s, liability under the workers\u2019 compensation act. The Court of Appeals held that Lucille R. Allen\u2019s \"acceptance of the redemption agreement\u201d equitably estopped her from maintaining this action in tort.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"AbH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Ray F. Allen was fatally injured while working on a Garden Orchards\u2019 farm. Lucille R. Allen sought, as his widow, workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Auto-Owners Insurance Company, the workers\u2019 compensation insurer for Garden Orchards, defended on the basis that the \"deceased was not an employee of Garden Orchards, Inc., but was instead an independent contractor.\u201d Garden Orchards had earlier asserted that Ray F. Allen was not an employee, but rather was a \"self-employed contractor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The redemption agreement was entered into between Lucille R. Allen, widow of Ray F. Allen, Garden Orchards, employer, and Auto-Owners Insurance Company, insurance carrier. The agreement was on Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation form 18 which provides that \"all agreements to redeem liability <em>must </em>be submitted on blanks furnished by the bureau.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The redemption agreement provided that Lucille R. Allen, Garden Orchards, and the insurer \"represented]\u201d that Ray F. Allen was an employee of Garden Orchards, that Garden Orchards was the employer, and that the \"[e]mployer has agreed to pay and employee\u2019s widow has agreed to accept $20,000.00 in full and final settlement of <em>any and all liability the employer might have for weekly Workmen\u2019s Compensation bene\u00f1ts </em>. . . because of any and all injuries arising out of and in the course of the employment that said employee might have sustained during his lifetime.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">The settlement embodied in the redemption agreement was considered by a workers\u2019 compensation magistrate at a hearing during the course of which Lucille R. Allen testified. A redemption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>order, also on a bureau form, was entered which recited that the magistrate had reviewed the redemption agreement, had concluded that it should be approved, and had \"ordered that said agreement to redeem the <em>employer\u2019s entire liability for workers\u2019 disability compensation bene\u00f1ts\u201d </em>on payment of $20,000 is approved.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">This action was subsequently commenced by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Lucille R. Allen as personal representative of her husband\u2019s estate. She alleged that her husband had been retained by Garden Orchards as an independent contractor to perform services on a farm owned and operated by Garden Orchards and that, while performing such services, he was fatally injured, and that the proximate cause of the accident and fatal injury was the negligence of Garden Orchards.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Garden Orchards moved for summary disposition, asserting that Ray F. Allen was an employee of Garden Orchards and that a redemption order had been entered whereby Garden Orchards\u2019 \"entire liability for the injuries sustained\u201d by Ray F. Allen had been redeemed. Garden Orchards al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>leged that the redemption agreement and order barred the instant action and constituted a \"release, accord, settlement and satisfaction . . . The circuit judge granted summary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">In affirming the summary disposition, the Court of Appeals cited its decisions in <em>Burgess v Holloway Construction Co, </em>123 Mich App 505; 332 NW2d 584 (1983), and <em>Johnson v Harper-Grace Hosp, </em>92 Mich App 202, 204; 284 NW2d 520 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">In <em>Jordan v C A Roberts Co, </em>379 Mich 235, 246; 150 NW2d 792 (1967), this Court declared that a redemption order constituted \"a final and conclusive determination of the liability\u201d of the employer, and precluded maintenance of a wrongful death action against the employer by a widow as the personal representative of her husband\u2019s estate. The Court predicated its decision upon \"the nature of the remedy under the workmen\u2019s compensation statute rather than upon an estoppel . . . <em>.\u2019\u2019Id. </em>at 242.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">The Court said that a redemption order barred an action against the employer although there had not been \"a contested adjudication of rights,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 244, and that to rule otherwise would be contrary to a provision of the act stating that when an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>employee or his dependents elect to receive benefits under the act, they thereby release the employer of all claims or demands at law arising from such injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-4\">If the employee, or his dependents, in case of his death, of any employer subject to the provisions of this act files any claim with, or accepts any payment from such employer, or any insurance company carrying such risks, or from the commissioner of insurance on account of personal injury, or makes any agreement, or submits any question to arbitration under this act, such action shall constitute a release to such employer of all claims or demands at law, if any, arising from such injury[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] [1948 CL 416.1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The Court said that an action would be barred<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> if proceedings were had under the workers\u2019 compensation act \"resulting in a <em>determination of </em>jurisdiction\u201d and that the unappealed order in the case then at bar, approving the redemption of the widow\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim, constituted \"a final and conclusive <em>determination </em>of the liability\u201d of the employer arising out of her husband\u2019s death with the result that an action for wrongful death was barred.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Jordan, supra </em>at 246 (emphasis added). _</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>The statutory provision, relied on in <em>Jordan, </em>1948 CL 416.1, was repealed, two years after <em>Jordan </em>was decided when the workers\u2019 compensation act of 1969 was enacted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Four years after <em>Jordan </em>was decided, this Court, in <em>Bugg v Fairview Farms, Inc, </em>385 Mich 338, 344; 189 NW2d 291 (1971), held that a wrongful death action was not necessarily barred by a redemption order. Although <em>Bugg </em>was decided after the repeal of \u00a7 416.1, the redemption order had been entered in March, 1968, before the repeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The justice who wrote the opinion for the Court in <em>Jordan </em>wrote a dissent in <em>Bugg </em>in which he relied on \u00a7 416.1. He said that in his view the question presented was one of <em>\"choice of remedies </em>between the wrongful death act and the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act,\u201d that he read the language of \u00a7 416.1 as had the trial judge, and that once the provisions of \u00a7 416.1 \"come into play, the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act remedy against the employer is exclusive.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Bugg, supra </em>at 363-364 (Adams, J., dissenting). (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The majority said that the Court \"need not determine the abstract question of whether an approval of a redemption agreement is a determination of the conditions of liability under the act by the compensation commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351. The majority continued that \u2014 contrary to the trial judge\u2019s ruling, which had been based on \u00a7416.1, the parties by agreement had not resolved the meritorious issue, nor did they submit it to the referee for decision \u2014 and had reserved the question for determination in a pending lawsuit.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>The majority added that \"[i]n order to be a bar, the adjudication must be taken and rendered upon the merits\u201d and that \"[p]arol evidence is admissible to ascertain whether a given question in issue was litigated, submitted and decided where the record is not conclusive and the issue of <em>res judicata </em>is raised.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Without adverting specifically to <em>Jordan, </em>the majority modified <em>Jordan </em>in stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-6\">The <em>conditions of liability </em>under the act are necessarily determined by the compensation department for the purpose <em>only </em>of approving a redemption agreement. But this does not <em>necessarily </em>adjudicate the issue for all purposes. <em>[Bugg, supra </em>at 352. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Also, again without specifically adverting to <em>Jordan, </em>but in apparent reference thereto, the majority added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-8\">Just as a judgment by default admits the legality of the demand only for the purpose of the suit, so does an <em>agreement of redemption admit the jurisdiction of the commission only </em>for the purpose of approving the agreed payment. <em>[Id. </em>at 353. Emphasis added.]_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>The majority observed that \u00a7 416.1 had been repealed by the 1969 revision of the workers\u2019 compensation act and had been replaced by \u00a7 831 of the 1969 act, which, said the majority, was the provision in the 1969 enactment comparable to \u00a7 416.1. Section 831 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-5\">Neither the payment of compensation or the accepting of the same by the employee or his dependents shall be considered as a <em>determination </em>of the rights of the parties under this act. [MCL 418.831; MSA 17.237(831). Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Under the original workers\u2019 compensation act, the employer had an election whether to provide, and the employee had an election whether to seek or accept, workers\u2019 compensation benefits as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>alternative to an action at law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Both the employer\u2019s and employee\u2019s election was eliminated over the years before <em>Jordan </em>or <em>Bugg </em>was decided.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But, as sometimes occurs, the repealed premise\u2014 that there was an election or choice \u2014 died hard. In all events, the statutory provision, \u00a7416.1, relied on in <em>Jordan, </em>barring a law action, where the employee or his dependents elect to seek workers\u2019 compensation benefits rather than to' sue at law, was repealed in 1969, and no longer has operative effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Consistent with \u00a7 831, providing that \"[njeither the payment of compensation or the accepting of the same by the employee or his dependents shall be considered as a <em>determination </em>of the rights of the parties under this act\u201d (emphasis added), this Court has ruled that admissions made at a redemption hearing may not, where the settlement \"fell through,\u201d be considered in subsequent proceedings. <em>Farrell v Campbell, Wyant &amp; Cannon Foundry Co, </em>392 Mich 344, 345; 220 NW2d 450 (1974). In so holding, this Court said that \"the purpose of the [redemption] hearing is to pass on the propriety of the redemption <em>rather than the legitimacy of the claim\u201d Id. </em>at 346. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Pertinently to the question presented in the instant case, this Court, in holding that the \"Second Injury Fund should not be subjected to a separate, independent hearing to determine whether the fund is liable for differential payments when the claimant and employer redeem all alleged potential employer liability by entering into a negotiated settlement where employer liability has been neither admitted nor adjudicated,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>declared that a redemption agreement \"constitutes <em>neither an admission nor an adjudication of employer liability.\u201d White v Weinberger Builders, Inc, </em>397 Mich 23, 27, 34; 242 NW2d 427 (1976). (Emphasis added.) Similarly, in holding that a redemption agreement may be set aside on the ground of mutual mistake, this Court said that it <em>does not regard \"approval of a redemption agreement as a \u00f1nding of fact nor an admission of liability.\u201d Solo v Chrysler Corp (On Rehearing), </em>408 Mich 345, 350; 292 NW2d 438 (1980). (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The Court of Appeals thus erred in <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 207, on which the Court of Appeals relied in <em>Burgess </em>and in the instant case, in declaring that the redemption served \"as a final <em>adjudication </em>of the rights of the parties in relation to this particular injury . . . <em>\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.) A redemption order does not, as set forth in <em>White </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number><em>Solo, </em>constitute an adjudication or a determination. Nor does the payment or acceptance of compensation constitute a \"determination of the rights of the parties under\u201d the act. MCL 418.831; MSA 17.237(831).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Although the Court of Appeals ruled that Lucille R. Allen was equitably estopped from maintaining this action, no evidence was offered by Garden Orchards that any representation, admission, or silence of Lucille R. Allen induced it to believe any facts, or that it justifiably relied and acted on the belief that Ray F. Allen was an employee. It appears rather that Auto-Owners, the insurance carrier, decided to redeem its exposure and that Garden Orchards\u2019 consent to the redemption was then obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">It has not been claimed, let alone shown, that Auto-Owners, in entering into the settlement, or that Garden Orchards in consenting to the settlement, obtained the agreement of Lucille R. Allen or her attorneys that the amount paid pursuant to the settlement would preclude maintenance of this action for wrongful death. A different question would be presented if Lucille R. Allen had agreed to accept the $20,000 in full settlement of all claims against Garden Orchards. Garden Orchards has not sought reformation of the settlement agreement.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>While Lucille R. Allen did, indeed, obtain payment of $20,000 on the basis that her husband was an employee of Garden Orchards, Auto-Owners, by the same token, avoided the possible payment of a greater sum on the basis, in part, that he was not an employee, but rather an independent contractor. Equities run in both directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">We agree with the signers of the dissenting opinion that \"the absence of an adjudication does not necessarily preclude the availability of equitable estoppel.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> While a party may assert inconsistent claims or defenses,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> where the other party concedes the validity of a claim or defense, and there is a disposition on that basis to the detriment of the other party, the doctrine of equitable estoppel may protect the other party from the reassertion of an inconsistent claim or defense, as set forth in <em>Hassberger v General Builders\u2019 Supply Co, </em>213 Mich 489, 492; 182 NW 27 (1921), relied on by the signers of the dissenting opinion._</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>In <em>Hassberger, </em>the defendant had contended, in an action for specific performance, that there was not a valid contract between the defendant and the plaintiff, and, on that basis, <em>the action was dismissed by the plaintiff </em>In a subsequent action to recover the money paid under the alleged contract, the defendant claimed that there was a valid and enforceable contract. This Court affirmed the decision of the circuit court, directing a verdict for the plaintiff, on the basis that the defendant was estopped by his conduct, \"by insisting in the former case that the contract was void to the <em>disadvantage and expense </em>to plaintiff . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added.) The Court observed that the defendant \"succeeded in <em>defeating </em>an action for specific performance on the ground that no valid contract existed between it and the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496. (Emphasis added.) The Court observed that if there were not a valid contract, then defendant had \"some $3,750 of plaintiff\u2019s money to which it had no right\u201d and would not be permitted to assert that there was a valid contract. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">In the instant case, Lucille R. Allen did not \"defeat\u201d Garden Orchards in the workers\u2019 compensation proceedings. There was a settlement. Neither party was defeated. Neither party prevailed. Money was indeed paid by Garden Orchards to Lucille R. Allen, but without any concession by <em>either </em>party regarding the correctness of the position asserted by the other. In contrast with <em>Hassberger, supra </em>at 490, Garden Orchards did not concede \"that defendant\u2019s position was well taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">In <em>Hassberger, </em>defendant\u2019s counsel \"dismissed the bill and brought this action to recover the money paid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This case would be similar if Garden Orchards\u2019 counsel had <em>conceded </em>that Ray F. Allen was an employee and had consented to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>the payment of full workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Then, of course, Lucille R. Allen would be precluded from maintaining this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">A redemption order approves a settlement. It does not purport to determine which of the competing factual assertions advanced by the parties is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The redemption agreement, by its terms, constituted a settlement \"of any and all liability the employer might have for weekly Workmen\u2019s Compensation benefits\u201d and did not purport to include or cover all liability Garden Orchards might have arising out of the injury. The redemption order, by its terms, similarly redeemed only Garden Orchards\u2019 \"entire liability for workers\u2019 disability compensation benefits,\u201d and did not purport to include any other liability that Garden Orchards might have arising out of Ray F. Allen\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">If Lucille R. Allen prevails in this wrongful death action, the judge would be required to reduce the portion of the judgment for economic loss to the extent of the $20,000 workers\u2019 compensation benefit paid to her pursuant to the redemption agreement.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Reversed and remanded to the circuit court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b681-9\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Brickley, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b667-12\"> <em>Allen </em>v <em>Garden Orchards, Inc, </em>unpublished memorandum opinion of the Court of Appeals, decided August 18, 1989 (Docket No. 112642).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b669-6\"> Section 835 of the act, as amended, provides regarding redemptions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-7\">(1) After 6 months\u2019 time has elapsed from the date of a personal injury, any liability resulting from the personal injury may be redeemed by the payment of a lump sum by agreement of the parties, subject to the approval of a hearing referee or worker\u2019s compensation magistrate, as applicable.

I write separately to emphasize that a redemption is in fact a settlement, and therefore the effect to be given a redemption agreement depends on the terms of the agreement itself. See <em>Beardslee v Michigan Claim Services, Inc, </em>103 Mich App 480, 485; 302 NW2d 896 (1981); <em>Nunley v Practical Home Builders, Inc, </em>173 Mich App 675, 680-681; 434 NW2d 205 (1988); <em>Hill v Terminix Int\u2019l, Inc, </em>617 F Supp 1030, 1032 (ED Mich, 1985); <em>Merriweather v Int\u2019l Business Machines, </em>712 F Supp 556, 562-564 (ED Mich, 1989), aff\u2019d 908 F2d 973 (1990).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I agree in the instant case that the redemption agreement, by its terms a \"full and final settlement of any and all liability the employer might have <em>for weekly Workmen\u2019s Compensation bene\u00f1ts\u201d </em>(emphasis added), indicates no intent by the parties to settle any liability other than that potentially arising under the Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">I concur in both the result and reasoning of part iv of the lead opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-9\"> This proposition, consistently enunciated in the Michigan Court of Appeals and in federal cases interpreting Michigan law, is not remarkable. Professor Larson states, \"A settlement covers only those claims or rights that are specifically mentioned in the agreement.\u201d 3 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 82.51, p 15-1207.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b682-6\">Griffin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7Ho\">I respectfully dissent. The lead opinion reasons from an assumption that the dispositive issue in this case is whether the decedent\u2019s status as an employee was \"adjudicated\u201d in the earlier redemption proceeding. Finding no adjudication, the opinion concludes that estoppel could not apply. I do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">As this Court said in <em>Hassberger v General </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number><em>Builders\u2019 Supply Co, </em>213 Mich 489, 492; 182 NW 27 (1921), the doctrine of estoppel \" 'has its origin in moral duty and public policy; and its chief purpose is the promotion of common honesty, and the prevention of fraud.\u2019 \u201d For purposes of this appeal, it is important to underscore a distinction between estoppel by record (res judicata and collateral estoppel) and equitable estoppel. Estoppel by record \"is the preclusion to deny the truth of matters set forth in a record, whether judicial or legislative, and also to deny the facts adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d 28 Am Jur 2d, Estoppel and Waiver, \u00a72, p 600. Equitable estoppel, on the other hand, broadly applies to situations where, \"because of something which he has done or omitted to do, a party is denied the right to plead or prove an otherwise important fact.\u201d 28 Am Jur 2d, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 27, p 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">Although estoppel by record is not applicable , unless there has been an adjudication of the point at issue, the absence of an adjudication does not necessarily preclude the availability of equitable estoppel. <em>Hassberger, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The doctrine of equitable estoppel has often been invoked to prevent a party from taking an incon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>sistent position in legal proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As this Court has said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-4\">\"Where a fact has been asserted, or an admission made, through which an advantage has been derived from another, or upon the faith of which another has been induced to act to his prejudice, so that a denial of such assertion or admission would be a breach of good faith, the law precludes the party from repudiating such representation, or afterwards denying the truth of such admission.\u201d <em>[Hassberger, supra </em>at 492-493.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">\"To allow a party who succeeds in defeating one action on a seeming state of facts, though false, to shift his ground and defeat a second action by disproving the truth of his first defense would be to sanction the grossest abuse and fraud.\u201d [Id. at 493.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">As a matter of policy, a party should not be permitted to claim that he is an employee in order to induce an employer to settle its workers\u2019 compensation liability, and then claim that he is not an employee in a subsequent tort action against the same employer on the basis of the same injury. To condone such a course of conduct would seriously undermine the exclusive remedy provision, MCL 418.131; MSA 17.237(131), which is the cornerstone of the workers\u2019 compensation act.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">When nearly identical facts were presented in <em>Jordan v C A Roberts Co, </em>379 Mich 235; 150 NW2d 792 (1967), this Court concluded that the widow, after representing that her deceased husband was an employee for the purposes of obtaining ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>proval of a redemption agreement, could not thereafter bring a wrongful death action against the employer on the basis of the same accident. Speaking through Justice Adams, the <em>Jordan </em>Court predicated its decision on \"the nature of the remedy\u201d provided under the act and pointed to the exclusive remedy provision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <em>Jordan </em>Court found additional support in another section of the act which then read,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-4\">\"If the employee, or his dependents, in case of his death, of any employer subject to the provisions of this act files any claim with, or accepts any payment from such employer, or any insurance company carrying such risks, or from the commissioner of insurance on account of personal injury, or makes any agreement, or submits any question to arbitration under this act, such action shall constitute a release to such employer of all claims or demands at law, if any, arising from such injury. [1948 CL 416.1; MSA 17.212.]\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 245.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The lead opinion focuses upon the fact that \u00a7 416.1 was repealed in 1969 and replaced by MCL 418.831; MSA 17.237(831), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">Neither the payment of compensation or the accepting of the same by the employee or his dependents shall be considered as a determination of the rights of the parties under this act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">However, these developments have not destroyed the sound reasoning of the <em>Jordan </em>decision, as the lead opinion implies. In the first place, \u00a7 416.1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>made no reference whatever to the consequences of submitting a redemption agreement to the referee and obtaining approval after a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Secondly, \u00a7831, which is referred to as being \"comparable\u201d to the repealed provision <em>(ante, </em>p 427), reflects no legislative intent to support the conclusion of the lead opinion. Indeed, the <em>Jordan </em>Court reached its contrary result after carefully acknowledging the very point made in \u00a7 831. Before the 1969 revision, the law had provided that the voluntary payment or acceptance of workers\u2019 compensation benefits did not, in and of itself, determine an employee\u2019s status or bar a subsequent action. <em>Jordan, supra, </em>p 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">In <em>Bugg v Fairview Farms, Inc, </em>385 Mich 338; 189 NW2d 291 (1971), the parties made clear in the transcript of the redemption hearing that they had not resolved their dispute concerning one issue, i.e., whether the injury arose in the course of employment. Pointing to the fact that the parties had expressly agreed to reserve this issue for determination in a subsequent third-party civil action, the <em>Bugg </em>Court concluded that the employer, in that instance, was estopped from later raising the redemption order as a release. <em>Id., </em>p 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">In the case at bar, there is nothing in the record of the redemption hearing to suggest that the parties reserved any of the issues involved in the settlement for determination in a subsequent lawsuit. It is true that, prior to the settlement and approval, the parties disagreed with regard to whether the decedent was an employee or an independent contractor. However, on the basis of the redemption proceeding record before us, there is every reason to believe that the parties settled and resolved their differences as to the matters expressly set forth in the redemption agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Like other agreements, a redemption agreement might later be set aside on grounds such as mutual mistake, <em>Solo v Chrysler Corp (On Rehearing), </em>408 Mich 345; 292 NW2d 438 (1980). However, the burden should be on the party who seeks to avoid the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">The exclusive remedy provision of the act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">(1) The right to the recovery of benefits as provided in this act shall be the employee\u2019s exclusive remedy against the employer for a personal injury or occupational disease. The only exception to this exclusive remedy is an intentional tort. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">(2) As used in this section and section 827, \"employee\u201d includes the person injured, his or her personal representatives and any other person to whom a claim accrues by reason of the injury to, or death of, the employee .... [MCL 418.131; MSA 17.237(131).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">In view of the exclusive remedy provision, I believe that, once a redemption agreement has been negotiated, signed, and approved, as in the case at bar, the employer should be able to expect that he will not thereafter be subject to liability in tort to the employee or his privies for the same injury. Absent unusual circumstances, as in <em>Bugg, </em>I believe that such an expectation is reasonable and in keeping with the policy and purposes of the act. Moreover, I believe it is the expectation and the intention of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">Particularly in light of the \"nature of the remedy\u201d which the act provides, I would hold in this case that the plaintiff is equitably estopped from maintaining in a subsequent wrongful death ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>tion that her husband was not an employee. To hold otherwise, as the lead opinion does today, seriously erodes and undermines the exclusive remedy provision which is the foundation of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The lead opinion also challenges the factual basis for the application of equitable estoppel <em>(ante, </em>pp 430-431). If a majority of this Court has similar doubts concerning the factual basis, then the appropriate course, I suggest, should be to remand this case to the trial court for a hearing, if deemed necessary, for further findings and a redetermination regarding this issue.</p>\n<judges id=\"b688-6\">Riley, J., concurred with Griffin, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b688-7\">Mallett, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-6\"> In <em>Hassberger, </em>the plaintiff first brought an equitable action seeking specific performance of an option contract he had with the defendant. The defendant alleged in its answer and sought to prove at trial that the option was void and unenforceable. Because of the defendant\u2019s representations, the plaintiff dismissed the action, and brought another action for assumpsit on the basis that there was no contract. The defendant then argued that the option was valid and enforceable. After finding that res judicata was inapplicable because the prior suit had been dismissed, this Court said that \"the distinction\u201d between collateral estoppel and estoppel by conduct \"is clear. One may be estopped by his conduct,\u201d despite the lack of a prior adjudication. <em>Id </em>at 492.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b684-9\"> See <em>Hassberger, supra; Burgess v Holder, </em>362 Mich 53; 106 NW2d 379 (1960); <em>Mertz v Mertz, </em>311 Mich 46; 18 NW2d 271 (1945); <em>Billingsley v Gulick, </em>256 Mich 606; 240 NW 46 (1932); <em>Great Western Smelting &amp; Refining Co v Evening News Ass\u2019n, </em>139 Mich 55; 102 NW 286 (1905).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b685-8\"> The provision then read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-9\">\"Where the conditions of liability under this act exist, the right to the recovery of compensation benefits, as herein provided, shall be the exclusive remedy against the employer.
