In the vast outpouring of ensuing cases, there are indeed situations in which employers have in reality agreed to limit managerial discretion. However, the theory remains troubling because of those instances in which application of contract law is a transparent invitation to the factfinder to decide <em>not </em>what the \"contract\u201d was, but what \"fairness\u201d requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">That courts have not been successful in unravel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>ing the logic of the theory to produce principles that distinguish the first category of cases from the second, is not necessarily a reason to abandon the experiment. As Justice Griffin put it in <em>In re Certified Question, Bankey v Storer Broadcasting Co, </em>432 Mich 438, 457; 443 NW2d 112 (1989), \"[fjairness suggests that a discharge-for-cause policy announced with flourishes and fanfare at noonday should not- be revoked by a pennywhistle trill at midnight.\u201d But unless the theory has some relation to the reality, calling something a contract that is in no sense a contract cannot advance respect for the law. Thus, we seek a resolution which is consistent with contract law relative to the employment setting while minimizing the possibility of abuse by either party to the employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">It is in this context that we address the question presented in this appeal: whether an employer\u2019s oral statements and written policy statements created an employment contract terminable only for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">In August of 1976, plaintiff applied for a sales position at defendant\u2019s North Kent Mall store in Grand Rapids. Plaintiff was interviewed by Mr. Vern Harryman who, according to plaintiff, told her that she would have a job at Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Incorporated, as long as she achieved her sales quota. With regard to his meeting with plaintiff, Mr. Harryman testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-7\">When we hired commission salespeople, that\u2019s sort of a different type of employee than a time-card person. Their main objective, the number one thing was that they must attain their draw of a hundred and twenty-six dollars a week, and gener<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>ally, as long as they generated sales and were honest, why, they had a job at Wards, and that\u2019s the way we used to hire our people.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">At the time of her hiring, plaintiff signed a sheet entitled \"Rules of Personal Conduct.\u201d The sheet stated that adherence to company policies would help an employee to achieve \"growth, profit, security, [and a] successful career.\u201d The rules further provided that anyone involved in the following activities would be immediately dismissed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Several years later, in January of 1982, defendant issued to all employees a handbook entitled \"Welcome to Wards.\u201d The handbook contained disciplinary guidelines which classified infractions according to severity, and allowed four types of discipline for transgression: \"1) Written Warning(s); 2) Suspension without Pay; 3) Probation . . . ; and 4) Separation.\u201d In the back of the handbook was a form designated the \"New Employee Sign-Off Sheet.\u201d The sheet provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-6\">I have read and fully understand the rules governing my employment with Montgomery Ward. I agree to employment with Montgomery Ward under the conditions explained. I understand these conditions can be changed by the Company, without notice, at any time. I also understand and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>agree that my employment is for no definite period and may, regardless of the time and manner of payment of my wages and salary, be terminated at any time, with or without cause, and without any previous notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">Although a personnel employee informed plaintiff that the sheet was. applicable to her, plaintiff refused to sign the form. Plaintiff claimed that it applied only to new employees, and she did not \"feel it\u2019s right that you can fire somebody for no reason, at all.\u201d Plaintiff noted on the back of the sign-off sheet, \"Read and do not wish to sign. 5-20-82. [s] Mary Rowe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Defendant issued another employee handbook to its work force in August of 1982. The August, 1982 handbook also contained an \"Employee Sign-off Sheet\u201d providing for termination with or without cause. Plaintiff received but did not sign this sheet. All Montgomery Ward employees, including plaintiff, received another handbook in May of 1983. In the 1983 handbook, there was further language providing for employment at will. Virtually the same disciplinary guidelines were included in all the handbooks.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">The Court of Appeals opinion aptly describes the facts surrounding plaintiff\u2019s termination.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-8\">On March 8, 1984, plaintiff was scheduled to work from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. At 2 p.m., she was observed leaving the store from an unauthorized exit by security personnel. She returned approximately four hours later. Plaintiff did not receive permission to leave the store from her supervisor, although she claimed that she attempted to contact him several times since the previous day but was unable. She did tell her co-workers that she had to leave on an emergency but did not say where she was going or how long she would be gone. Further, even though the salaries of commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>sioned salespersons are not do. indent upon the hours worked, plaintiff failed t_. punch out when she left or punch in when she returned, as required by company policy. Neither did she make note of her four-hour absence on the time card which she turned in at the end of the work week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-5\">Two days later, plaintiff was called into the office of the store manager to answer for the unauthorized absence. She allegedly gave no explanation for leaving the store and refused to provide a written statement on the matter. She said only that she could not remember where she was for those four hours. As a result of this incident, plaintiff was terminated from defendant\u2019s employ.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-6\">On May 14, 1984, plaintiff filed a complaint against defendant in the Kent Circuit Court asserting claims for wrongful discharge, breach of contract, and several other causes of action which are not relevant for purposes of this appeal. A jury trial on the matter was held on February 18 and 19, 1986. At the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s proofs, defendant moved for a directed verdict on the ground that she was an at-will employee who was subject to dismissal at any time without cause. The court denied that motion, reasoning that an issue of fact existed for the jury to determine whether there was a just-cause employment contract or whether plaintiff\u2019s employ was terminable at the will of defendant. The trial then continued and eventually concluded in a jury verdict of $86,500 plus interest in favor of plaintiff. A judgment to that effect was thereafter entered by the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-7\">On May 1, 1986, defendant filed motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), a new trial, or remittitur. By court order dated June 19, 1986, each of those motions was denied.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">Defendant appealed the decision, and the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>of Appeals reversed,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> finding that plaintiff was an employee at will. Plaintiff appealed in this Court, and we ordered <em>Rowe </em>held in abeyance pending resolution of <em>In re Certified Question, supra, </em>and <em>Bullock v Automobile Club of Michigan, </em>432 Mich 472; 444 NW2d 114 (1989). On May 2, 1990, this Court granted leave to appeal. 434 Mich 910 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">The issue posed by this case is whether defendant employer\u2019s oral statements and written policy statements directed at plaintiff may be interpreted to permit a promise implied in fact not to terminate except for cause. We find that plaintiff\u2019s allegations are insufficient to support her contention of a promise implied in fact limiting the defendant\u2019s right to terminate her employment. Thus, plaintiff cannot maintain an action for breach of contract as a result of her dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">This Court has held that contracts for permanent employment are for an indefinite period of time and are presumptively construed to provide employment at will. <em>Lynas v Maxwell Farms, </em>279 Mich 684, 687; 273 NW 315 (1937). When contract claims rest on proofs of oral representations, the presumption provides assurance that oral contracts for an indefinite term, which fall outside the statute of frauds, will be recognized only where circumstances suggest both parties intended to be bound. The presumption may be overcome by proof of an express contract for a definite term or a provision forbidding discharge in the absence of just cause, or it may be overcome by proofs which permit a promise implied in fact of employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>security, i.e., for a particular period of time or to terminate only for just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">In <em>Lynas, </em>the Court declined to imply a durational term where the plaintiff accepted an offer of a \"permanent lifetime position with the defendant.\u201d The Court observed, however, that the presumption of employment at will can be overcome if a contract is accompanied by \"distinguishing features or provisions,\u201d or additional consideration supporting a term of permanent employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Again, in <em>Toussaint v Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Michigan, supra, </em>p 600, the Court stated that \"[b]ecause the parties began with complete freer dom, the court will presume that they intended to obligate themselves to a relationship at will.\u201d In general, parties to an employment contract \"remain free to provide, or not to provide, for job security.\u201d <em>Valentine v General American Credit, Inc, </em>420 Mich 256, 258; 362 NW2d 628 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">In <em>Toussaint, </em>we had the opportunity to expand on the rule in <em>Lynas </em>and explore the kinds of \"distinguishing features or provisions,\u201d or special circumstances which limit an employer\u2019s right to discharge on an open-ended contract. This Court there found sufficient factual evidence to permit a jury to imply a limitation on the employer\u2019s right to discharge and held that a provision of termination for just cause may become part of a contract for indefinite duration by express agreement, or \"as a result of an employee\u2019s legitimate expectations grounded in an employer\u2019s policy statements.\u201d 408 Mich 598. However, the Court was careful to limit the effect of its holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-8\">Employers are most assuredly free to enter into employment contracts terminable at will without assigning cause. We hold only that an employer\u2019s express agreement to terminate <em>only </em>for cause, or statements of company policy and procedure <em>to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number><em>that effect, </em>can give rise to rights enforceable in contract. [408 Mich 610. Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Plaintiff asserts that oral statements made to her at a prehiring interview amounted to a contract to terminate only for just cause, while defendant asserts that the plaintiff was an employee at will. However, this is not a situation in which interpretation requires an express determination of credibility. <em>McIntyre v Smith-Bridgman &amp; Co, </em>301 Mich 629; 4 NW2d 36 (1942). Rather, this is a situation in which the parties attach different meanings to undisputed facts, and the Court is asked to conclude that the jury was entitled to determine from the conduct of the parties that a promise existed limiting the employer\u2019s ability to discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">Again, we are asked here to decide whether an employer\u2019s oral statements and written policy statements created an employment contract terminable only for cause. We do <em>not </em>decide that the words and conduct of parties cannot, as a matter of law, create an issue submissible to a jury regarding the existence of a contract implied in fact. Moreover, we do <em>not </em>suggest that a contract of employment is too indefinite to be enforced where the employee\u2019s consideration is the work performed in response to a unilateral offer. Nor do we depart from the concept that the presumption of employment at will is a rule of construction rather than a substantive limitation. As Justice Ryan acknowledged in his dissent in <em>Toussaint, supra, </em>p 645, \"[w]e have no doubt that circumstances could exist in which an employer\u2019s written policies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>. . . might be incorporated by reference, expressly or impliedly, into an otherwise oral employment contract and thus become a declaration of the employment agreement.\u201d It is just as true, however, that the party bearing the burden of overcoming the presumption of employment at will must convince the court either that it should supply an omitted term or that the circumstances are such that the jury should be permitted to so conclude.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">In determining whether a reasonable factfinder can find a promise of job security implied in fact, we look to all the facts and circumstances to evaluate the intent of the parties. As stated in <em>Miller v Stevens, </em>224 Mich 626, 632; 195 NW 481 (1923):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-6\">A contract is implied where the intention as to it is not manifested by direct or explicit words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>between the parties, but is to be gathered by implication or proper deduction from the conduct of the parties, language used or things done by them, or other pertinent circumstances attending the transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">In deciding whether there was mutual assent to a just-cause provision, we use an objective test, \"looking to the expressed words of the parties <em>and their visible acts.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Goldman v Century Ins Co, </em>354 Mich 528, 535; 93 NW2d 240 (1958); <em>Stark v Kent Products, Inc, </em>62 Mich App 546; 233 NW2d 643 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">The starting point in analyzing oral statements for contractual implications is to determine the meaning that reasonable persons might have attached to the language, given the circumstances presented. In our analysis, we agree with the federal district court in <em>Carpenter v American Excelsior Co, </em>650 F Supp 933, 936, n 6 (ED Mich, 1987):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-7\">After all <em>Lynas </em>as well as reality compels recognition of the fact that neither party to the beginning of an employment relationship expects it to be unsatisfactory, and both hope it will have a significant duration. This hope and noncontractual wish is expressed in terms of language such as \"as long as you do the job.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">Consequently, the court stated that any orally grounded contractual obligation for permanent employment \"must be based on <em>more than </em>an expression of an optimistic hope of a long relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">Along the same lines, Justice Griffin\u2019s remarks in <em>Bullock, supra </em>at 517, are instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-10\">Surely, a modicum of realism and common sense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>is needed. An assurance such as that alleged in the instant case simply cannot be separated from the realities of the working world. It should be recognized that \"lifetime\u201d employment contracts are extraordinary and, being so, \"must be expressed in clear and unequivocal terms before a court will conclude that an employer intended to enter into such a weighty obligation.\u201d [Griffin, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part. Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">To be sure, because of the difficulty in verifying oral promises, the statements must clearly permit a construction which supports the asserted meaning. The \"overreaching principle of contract interpretation\u201d is that the court looks to all the relevant circumstances surrounding the transaction, including all writings, oral statements, and other conduct by which the parties manifested their intent. Farnsworth, Contracts, \u00a7 7.10, p 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">We thus look to the facts in <em>Toussaint </em>to guide us in evaluating the oral statements implicated in the case before us. Both of the plaintiffs, Mr. Toussaint and Mr. Ebling, \"negotiated specifically regarding job security with the persons who interviewed and hired them.\u201d 408 Mich 612. Prior to being hired, Toussaint had several interviews with the cotreasurer of the company, and the position he sought was assistant to the treasurer. Toussaint claimed he was promised he would not be terminated \" 'as long as I did my job.\u2019 \u201d Further, upon inquiring about job security, he was handed a manual which expressly confirmed that he could be released \" 'for just cause only.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">Ebling also had several interviews prior to being hired. He was interviewed by the executive vice president and the general manager about a marketing director position. He expressed concerns specifically about job security to the vice president. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>In particular, he voiced concerns about a personality conflict with his supervisor. Subsequent to negotiations, the vice president agreed not to terminate Ebling as long as he was doing his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">In the instant case, plaintiff was interviewed for the job by Vern Harryman, sales manager of the appliance department. Although defendant had been advertising to attract salespersons, plaintiff told Harryman \" 'Well, I hadn\u2019t seen the ad, I just kind of stumbled in there ....\u2019\u201d With regard to representations pertinent to job security, plaintiff testified that \"[h]e said that he needed somebody to sell sewing machines and vacuum cleaners and that this job would involve selling, <em>and as long as I sold, I would have a job at Montgomery Ward.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b891-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Contrasting the surrounding circumstances of this case with <em>Toussaint </em>and <em>Ebling </em>to determine if there was mutual assent on a provision for permanent employment, or if the statements were noncontractual expressions of \"optimistic hope of a long relationship,\u201d we find the oral statements insufficient to rise to the level of an agreement providing termination only for just cause. Although the \"as long as\u201d statement bears resemblance to remarks made in <em>Toussaint, </em>we find objective evidence lacking to permit a reasonable juror to find that a reasonable promisee would interpret Harryman\u2019s statements and actions as a promise of termination only for cause implied in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">Unlike <em>Toussaint, </em>plaintiff did not engage in preemployment negotiations regarding security. She simply \"stumbled\u201d into the store one day and had one interview before being hired. Nor is there any testimony suggesting that plaintiff inquired about job security. Therefore, Harryman\u2019s statements could not have been addressed to any inquiry regarding job security. In short, no objective evidence exists that their minds met on the subject of continued employment. In addition, we note that in <em>Toussaint, </em>the plaintiffs were applying for singular, executive job positions. That the positions were unique supports the finding that the terms were specifically negotiated. Here, plaintiff was one of many departmental salespersons. The fact that plaintiff applied for one of several identical positions militates against the likelihood that the contract terms were negotiable and suggests that company policy was more likely to govern.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Furthermore, in <em>Toussaint, </em>in response to in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>quiries about job security, Toussaint was given a manual specifically providing termination only for just cause, and containing extensive disciplinary classifications. The manual offered objective support for the oral representations made to the plaintiff. In the instant case, the objective support was lacking. Upon being hired, plaintiff signed a \"Rules of Personal Conduct\u201d sheet. The sheet did not contain elaborate disciplinary procedures and, more importantly, did not contain the \"release for just cause only\u201d language. Moreover, the signed sheet conflicts with plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of the oral remarks that she would have a job as long as she achieved her sales quota, and undercuts any belief that a contract arose from the interview. The rules listed conduct such as theft, destruction of property, falsification of records, and moral impropriety which would result in immediate dismissal. Plaintiff\u2019s agreement to abide by those rules suggests that any subjective belief she maintained that she could only be dismissed for failure to obtain her quota was not reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Lastly, we find that Harryman\u2019s testimony was insufficient to support an agreement of termination only for just cause. As suggested by our holding in <em>Lynas, </em>supra, and supported by this Court\u2019s treatment of the facts in <em>Toussaint </em>and <em>Ebling, </em>an employee who seeks to establish from conduct a promise implied in fact must meet a higher standard than an employee who relies on express language. Logic compels the conclusion that where parties expressly negotiate with offers and counteroffers, it is more reasonable to anticipate mutual assent. Conversely, there is less chance that the parties desired or intended the result prayed for where, as here, conduct and oral statements are claimed to create a promise of job security implied in fact. See <em>DiBonaventura v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number><em>Consolidated Rail Corp, </em>372 Pa Super 420; 539 A2d 865 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Thus, we conclude that the oral statements of job security must be clear and unequivocal to overcome the presumption of employment at will. As stated by Justice Ryan in his separate opinion in <em>Toussaint, supra </em>at 632-633:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-6\">The second exception to the general rule consists of those instances in which the employment agreement includes some \"distinguishing feature[s] or provision^],\u201d as the Court put it in <em>Lynas, supra, </em>so as to preclude a construction of employment at will. A classic example of this type modification of an indefinite hiring is the modern collective bargaining agreement in which there is often included a provision that an employee shall be discharged only for cause. Provisions of this nature clearly and forcefully indicate a mutual intention to limit the employer\u2019s discretion in terminating the employment relationship.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Harryman\u2019s words were couched in general terms, more akin to stating a policy as opposed to offering an express contract. His words were vague when discussing termination (e.g., <em>\"generally, </em>as long as <em>they </em>generated sales and were honest . . . <em>they </em>had a job at Wards\u201d; \"about the only way that you could be terminated would be if you failed to make your draw . . . .\u201d). (Emphasis added.) We find that these words do not clearly indicate an intent to form a contract for permanent employment. Rather, the context of Harry-man\u2019s comments suggests that they were merely intended to emphasize the number one priority of plaintiff\u2019s job \u2014 sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">We also reject plaintiff\u2019s contention that the \"Rules of Personal Conduct\u201d created a contract to terminate only for cause. In signing the sheet, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>plaintiff agreed that she would be dismissed if she engaged in the prohibited conduct. Nothing in the rules suggested that the enumerated conduct was the only basis for dismissal, and the rules were consistent with a termination-at-will policy. Thus, we find no evidence from which a reasonable promisee could find a promise of job security. Consequently, we find no evidence from which reasonable minds could find that there was mutual assent on a term of employment terminable only for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">\u2018Having concluded that the employer\u2019s oral statements and the \"Rules of Personal Conduct\u201d did not form contracts for permanent employment, we must next decide whether the disciplinary guidelines promulgated by defendant gave rise to an employment contract providing termination only for just cause where defendant concurrently issued sign-off sheets containing an employment-at-will policy. We find that plaintiff cannot maintain an action for breach of contract on the basis of the disciplinary guidelines because the last handbook which plaintiff received clearly set forth an employment-at-will policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">In <em>Toussaint, </em>this Court held that an employer\u2019s written policy statements announcing a policy of termination only for cause may create contract rights if the statements give rise to \"legitimate expectations\u201d of just-cause employment in the employee. In that case, the Court determined a jury question was presented regarding whether a policy manual created such expectations. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-8\">Since Blue Cross published and distributed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>260-page manual establishing elaborate procedures promising \"[t]o provide for the administration of fair, consistent and reasonable corrective discipline\u201d and \"to treat employees leaving Blue Cross in a fair and consistent manner and to release employees <em>for just cause only,\u201d </em>its employees could justifiably rely on those expressions and conduct themselves accordingly. [408 Mich 617. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Referring to the just-cause provision, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-6\">There were, thus, on this separate basis alone, special circumstances sufficient to overcome the presumptive construction that the contract was terminable at will. [408 Mich 614.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">In <em>In re Certified Question, supra, </em>the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals certified the following question to this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-8\">\"Once a provision that an employee shall not be discharged except for cause becomes legally enforceable under <em>Toussaint </em>[supra], as a result of an employee\u2019s legitimate expectations grounded in the employer\u2019s written policy statements, may the employer thereafter unilaterally change those written policy statements by adopting a generally applicable policy and alter the employment relationship of existing employees to one at the will of the employer in the absence of an express notification to the employees from the outset that the employer reserves the right to make such a change?\u201d [432 Mich 441.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">In responding to the certified question, this Court held that a company\u2019s written policy statements, which created legitimate expectations in the employee of discharge for cause only, could be unilat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>erally modified by the employer. The Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-5\">[a]n employer may, without an express reservation of the right to do so, unilaterally change its written policy from one of discharge for cause to one of termination at will, provided that the employer gives affected employees reasonable notice of the policy change. [432 Mich 441.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">The Court also required that the notice be uniformly given to employees affected by the policy change.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">Much of the same documentation as in the case before us was involved in <em>Dell v Montgomery Ward &amp; Co, Inc, </em>811 F2d 970, 972 (CA 6, 1987). In <em>Dell, </em>the plaintiff sued for breach of contract after he was terminated by the defendant. The plaintiff alleged a contract terminable only for cause arose out of the defendant\u2019s Progressive Discipline Reference Guide (pdrg). The pdrg was designed to give supervisors a procedure to follow when punishing employees. However, within the pdrg, it was stated that \"[t]his procedure does not form an employment contract.\u201d (Emphasis deleted.) Also, the defendant\u2019s Human Resources Policy Manual contained a provision that discharge could be with or without cause, and also that discipline procedures did not constitute employment contracts. Furthermore, the plaintiff signed a sheet in 1982 which stated that employment could be terminated with or without cause. Writing for the court, Judge Ryan determined that there was no contract making employment terminable only for cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-8\">It is difficult to imagine what more the defendant might have done to make it crystal clear to Dell, and all Montgomery Ward employees, that, unless some other arrangement were made di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>rectly with the President and Chief Executive Officer or Executive Vice President of Human Resources, Montgomery Ward employees are employees \"at will\u201d who may be discharged with or without cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-4\">. . . The unequivocal language in the \"sign off sheet\u201d in this case, which stated that the employees could be discharged \"with or without cause and without any previous notice,\u201d means what it says and is binding upon the parties. Similarly, the plain and simple statement in the pdrg, that the due process procedures established there did \"not form an employment contract,\u201d likewise means what it says. [811 F2d 974.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">In the instant case, plaintiff received handbooks containing disciplinary guidelines.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> She claims the guidelines at least create a question for the jury regarding the existence of a contract providing termination for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">However, similar to the \"sign-off sheet\u201d in <em>Dell, </em>in the instant case the 1983 handbook<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> contained unequivocal language expressing defendant\u2019s termination-at-will policy. Under a heading entitled \"Employment Relationship,\u201d a paragraph in. the 1983 handbook provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-7\">Because business requirements fluctuate often in our industry, your employment conditions and status are subject to change at any time. Therefore, although you may have been hired for a specific position, with specified hours, pay, duties, etc., all of these can be reduced, increased or, in fact, terminated without advance notice and for any reason. Consequently, you also have the right to terminate your employment in the same man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>ner, at any time, for any reason. This lack of a guarantee or an employment contract also applies to other benefits, privileges and working conditions of employment at Montgomery Ward.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Whatever the nature of plaintiff\u2019s expectations with regard to termination prior to the issuance of the 1983 manual, the last handbook distributed to plaintiff, we find that the 1983 manual clearly and unambiguously notified plaintiff of the company\u2019s termination-at-will policy. We are persuaded therefore that the 1983 manual would have succeeded in modifying any prior expectations of termination only for cause.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">Furthermore, we reject plaintiff\u2019s argument that she did not have reasonable notice of the policy. In addition to the May, 1983, manual, the two earlier sign-off sheets distributed in 1982 asserted a termination-at-will policy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Plaintiff was asked several times by the personnel department to sign the January, 1982, sign-off sheet, but she refused. We also note that the August, 1982, sheet was addressed to \"employees,\u201d not \"new employees.\u201d Also, plaintiff was not discharged until March 8, 1984. The last handbook distributed to plaintiff was sent out at least nine months before her discharge. Therefore, as a matter of law, we find that the existence of three handbooks clearly providing for termination at will, the last of which was sent to plaintiff at least nine months prior to termination, constituted reasonable notice of defendant\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">Moreover, we find the fact that plaintiff did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>sign the employment at will disclaimers is not determinative. If plaintiff had a prior express contract to be discharged only for cause, her assent would be required to modify the agreement. However, there was no such prior agreement. Consequently, we agree with the Court of Appeals statement that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-5\">Her disagreement with the provisions contained therein cannot negate their effect. She was aware of the provisions and, therefore, any contrary expectations she may have harbored cannot be deemed reasonable. [Unpublished opinion per curiam, decided November 9, 1988 (Docket No. 93817), pp 5-6.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">In light of our findings, we would hold that upon receiving the May, 1983, manual, plaintiff could no longer harbor any legitimate expectations of a discharge-for-cause policy. Defendant expressly and clearly reserved the right to discharge employees at will.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">hi<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">Justice Levin\u2019s lengthy dissent clearly evidences an insistence that this Court broaden the reach of his majority opinion in <em>Toussaint </em>which we elect not to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">Thus, we respond \u2014 briefly\u2014noting:</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">\u2014In his dissenting opinion, Justice Levin relies on \u00a7 32 of the Restatement of Contracts, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-11\">Today, this Court, without reference to \u00a7 32 of the first Restatement of Contracts [presently \u00a7 33 of the Restatement of Contracts, 2d], and ignoring cases enforcing contracts with \u201das long as\u201d terms, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>promulgates its own restatement of the law in holding that Rowe may not maintain an action to enforce a promise to employ her for as long as she did \"the work\u201d \u2014 selling\u2014because, among other reasons, the promise did not include a durational term or a sufficiently definite durational term. [Slip op, p 22.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">While we acknowledge the Restatement as persuasive authority on the subject of contracts, this Court is not, nor is any other court, bound to follow any of the rules set out in the Restatement. Moreover, even assuming, as Justice Levin urges, that our ruling is inconsistent with the Restatement, the writings of the American Law Institute do not control the rulings of this Court, nor is the contract law of this state necessarily written to be consistent with the Restatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">\u2014In section ii(f) of his opinion, Justice Levin remarks that \"[c]ourts generally regard 'as long as\u2019 contracts as considerably more than expressions of a 'hope and noncontractual wish,\u2019 but, rather, as expressing a durational term.\u201d <em>Post, </em>p 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">However, 56 CJS, Master and Servant, \u00a7 31, p 414, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-9\"><em>Permanent employment contracts. As a general rule </em>employment contracts which in some form purport to provide for permanent employment, as where the agreement is for the employee to have a permanent position or permanent employment or employment for life, or the employee is hired to fill a \"permanent vacancy,\u201d <em>or where the employment is to be for as long as the master is operating, as long as the employee desires the position, or as long as the employee satisfactorily performs his duties, </em>are terminable at will by either party where they are not supported by any consideration other than the obligation of service to be performed on the one hand and wages or salary to be paid on the other. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Furthermore, this Court has previously found an \"as long as\u201d statement insufficient to supply a durational term. In <em>Lynas, supra, </em>p 687, \"plaintiff was offered a permanent position or one for life so long as his services were satisfactory to defendant.\u201d The Court held that a durational term was lacking and that the relationship was for an indefinite term and terminable at will.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">The <em>Lynas </em>Court analogized that case to <em>Lord v Goldberg, </em>81 Cal 596, 597-598; 22 P 1126 (1889). In <em>Lord, </em>it was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-6\">agreed by and between plaintiff and defendants that in consideration of his entering into their employment as such solicitor, and using all his efforts to secure certain-named persons as customers, and to extend their business, \"they <em>would give him permanent employment so long as he should use his best efforts to extend their business, </em>paying him at the rate of twenty dollars per week, and increase his salary as the business increased\u201d .... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">The court determined that the agreement was for an indefinite term and terminable at the will of either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">In illustrating its holding, the <em>Lynas </em>Court also cited <em>Rape v Mobile &amp; ORR Co, </em>136 Miss 38, 45; 100 So 585 (1924), where the plaintiff was promised to have permanent and steady employment \" 'as long as he was able and willing to perform such services properly.\u2019 \u201d The court found that there was no durational term and the agreement was terminable at will.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">In another case cited as illustrative by the <em>Lynas </em>Court, <em>Arentz v Morse Dry Dock &amp; Repair Co, </em>249 NY 439, 441; 164 NE 342 (1928), the plaintiff alleged that he was orally promised a permanent position, or a lifetime employment contract. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>finding an agreement for termination at will, the Court of Appeals of New York stated that \"[a]n agreement to employ the plaintiff in such a position for life is so unusual that we would expect to find it contained in some writing.\u201d The court later asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b902-4\">Are we justified in saying that under all these circumstances the plaintiff has proved a life employment, or what amounts to about the same thing, an employment which is to last as long as the corporation does business, and the plaintiff\u2019s services are satisfactory? Such contracts at least should be specific and definite, with little or no room for misunderstanding, even if they are not required to be in writing. <em>[Id., </em>p 443.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">The history behind the <em>Lynas </em>case teaches us that \"as long as\u201d statements do not necessarily provide durational terms, and contracts providing for permanent employment should be specific and definite with regard to duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">\u2014Many of the cases cited by Justice Levin in section ii(f) of his opinion are distinguishable from this case. Of the ones that are not distinguished here, none are controlling with respect to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">\u2014The following cases cited in Justice Levin\u2019s opinion are distinguishable from this case because they are not employment contract cases: <em>City of Superior v Douglas Co Telephone Co, </em>141 Wis 363; 122 NW 1023 (1909); <em>Caplis v Monroe, </em>228 Mich 586; 200 NW 123 (1924); <em>Long Beach Drug Co v United Drug Co, </em>13 Cal 2d 158; 88 P2d 698 (1939); <em>Fuchs v United Motor Stage Co, Inc, </em>135 Ohio St 509; 21 NE2d 669 (1939); <em>Phelps v Shawprint, Inc, </em>328 Mass 352; 103 NE2d 687 (1952); <em>Big Spring v Texas Bd of Control, </em>404 SW2d 810 (Tex, 1966); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number><em>State v Orkin Exterminating Co, Inc, </em>528 So 2d 198 (La App, 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">\u2014In the following cases, the contract provisions outlining durational terms are clearly and specifically set out in writing so that the parties\u2019 intent is more easily discernible. Of course, in the instant case, we must attempt to ascertain the parties\u2019 intent from vague oral statements: <em>Fuchs; Long Beach Drug Co; Big Spring, supra; McMullan v Dickinson Co, </em>60 Minn 156; 62 NW 120 (1895); <em>Kirkley v FH Roberts Co, </em>268 Mass 246; 167 NE 289 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">In <em>Diggs IV v Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Co, Inc, </em>861 F2d 914 (CA 6, 1988), the court found an enforceable oral promise that as long as the plaintiff\u2019s performance was satisfactory, he would have a job. However, in <em>Diggs, </em>the promise was made in response to the plaintiff\u2019s direct inquiries about job security. In the instant case, plaintiff made no inquiries about job security. Whether the parties to a contract negotiate or specifically discuss a subject is relevant to a determination regarding mutual assent. Furthermore, the court in <em>Diggs </em>mischaracterizes the district court\u2019s decision in <em>Carpenter, supra. </em>The court in <em>Diggs </em>states that \"[u]nlike Carpenter, Diggs did not sign an 'employment-at-will\u2019 clause.\u201d 861 F2d 918. However, the plaintiff in <em>Carpenter </em>also did not sign the employment application containing the clause.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">In <em>Ehrenworth v Stuhmer &amp; Co, </em>229 NY 210; 128 NE 108 (1920), the plaintiff agreed to exclusively sell black bread made by the defendant, and the defendant agreed to furnish the plaintiff with all his black bread requirements. The agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>was to last as long as both parties remained in business. Since the plaintiff was an exclusive agent, selling only the defendant\u2019s black bread, the circumstances were more conducive to finding a durational term. Also, the statement that as long as both parties are in business provides a definite standard, whereas \"as long as she sold\u201d is a vague, isolated statement on which to pin a term of duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">In <em>State v Orkin Exterminating Co, Inc, supra, </em>p 199, pest control services were \"for the lifetime of the treated structure so long as the customer paid a specified annual renewal fee.\u201d The court focused on the phrase the \"lifetime of the structure\u201d in finding the term definite and ascertainable. However, in this state, lifetime employment contracts are indefinite and terminable at will.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">\u2014In section vn of his opinion, Justice Levin incorrectly determines that plaintiff did not assert that the 1983 manual, or procedures found therein, provided a basis for a finding of just cause employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">Virtually the same disciplinary guidelines are found in each of the manuals. Plaintiff\u2019s brief sets out what it refers to as \"four major evidentiary features\u201d in the case: (1) the 1982 handbook, (2). the 1983 handbook, (3) the \"sign-off \u201d sheet, and (4) the testimony of Mr. Harryman and 1976 Rules of Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">Further, the plaintiff\u2019s brief later states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-9\">It is Plaintiff\u2019s contention that the 1982 hand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>book is a reiteration of the \"for cause\u201d policy first established by Mr. Harryman\u2019s statement and the 1976 personal rules of conduct. <em>This means that there are three separate bases for Ms. Rowe\u2019s objective expectancy that she would not be terminated except for cause, i.e., the oral statements, the 1976 Personal Rules of Conduct (Exhibit 2), and the 1982 handbook (Exhibit 10). </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">Plaintiff also argued in the Court of Appeals that the disciplinary classifications found in the manuals supported an agreement for just-cause employment. The Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-5\">Plaintiff asserts that the jury was properly allowed to decide what type of contract existed in the instant case because two factors raised an issue for the trier of fact. Those two factors were: (1) the promise allegedly made to plaintiff at her job interview that she would have a job as long as she met her sales quota, and (2) defendant\u2019s disciplinary classification and procedure. As to the latter factor, plaintiff claimed that, because the classification encompassed misconduct that would constitute good cause for discharge, such created a reasonable expectation in the employees that they would not be discharged except for good cause. [Slip op, p 5.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">Along the same lines, Justice Levin argues that we incorrectly framed the issue. In so arguing, he states that \"Rowe\u2019s express contract claim for wrongful discharge does not depend at all on Montgomery Ward\u2019s 'written policy statements\u2019 or on terms left to inference,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> thus flying in the face of the passages set out above that plaintiff did assert that the guidelines found within the manuals formed the basis for a just-cause contract.</p>\n<p id=\"A40k\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">In summary, we find the oral statements relied on by plaintiff insufficient to rise to the level of an agreement providing termination only for just cause. Moreover, the circumstances do not support a finding of mutual assent on a provision for permanent employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">We also find that the \"Rules of Personal Conduct\u201d did not create a contract terminable only for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">Finally, plaintiff cannot maintain an action for breach of contract on the basis of the disciplinary guidelines because the last handbook which plaintiff received clearly set forth an employment-at-will policy. Thus, we would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b906-8\">Brickley and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-9\">APPENDIX</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-10\">Disciplinary Action Guidelines</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-11\">Disciplinary guidelines have been established so that you know exactly what the company expects of you.

This inference may be nothing more than a legal fiction because it is possible that in a given case, the parties never truly contemplated how long the employment would last even though additional consideration is present. Even so, the at-will presumption would be overcome. On the other hand, if the parties specifically agreed that the employment would be <em>at-will, </em>even though additional consideration were present, we would expect a court to construe the contract according to the parties\u2019 stated intention and hold it to be at-will. Thus, we start with the usual at-will presumption which, let us say, has not been overcome by evidence of a contract for a term or for a reasonable length of time. Then, if sufficient additional consideration is present, the law presumes this to be sufficient to rebut the at-will presumption. . . . However, the presumption created by the additional consideration rule could <em>itself </em>be rebutted by evidence that the parties specifically contracted for employment at-will.

Otherwise stated, it is circumstantial evidence that the omitted durational term that the court would otherwise infer (employment at will) does not reflect the parties\u2019 intent. Thus, while the oral contract prong of <em>Toussaint </em>and <em>Ebling </em>recognizes that validation devices<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provide circumstantial evidence rebutting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>the presumption of employment at will, neither case is to be construed as creating a rule of substantive law that words of commitment must be interpreted as words of promise which must be submitted to the factfinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">As Professor Perritt states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-5\">Part of the idea of offer and acceptance or meeting of the minds in contract theory is to require that a promise be supported by some sort of validation device before the law enforces it. A competing approach to promise enforcement has received little support in the cases: essentially to forget about validation devices and enforce employer promises of employment security merely upon proof the employer made them.

Farnsworth, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3.28, p 197.

However, absent other manifestations of intention, how shall a court read a definite term into such a contract to provide an appropriate remedy . . . ?

An enforceable obligation under the contract prong of <em>Toussaint </em>can arise from an explicit promise or can be inferred from words or other conduct.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \"Sometimes a contract that results from words is described as 'express,\u2019 while one that results from conduct is described as 'implied in fact,\u2019 but the distinction as such has no legal consequences.\u201d Farnsworth, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3.10, p 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">When the communication between parties has more than one possible meaning and that formula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>tion is submitted to a court, the court employs its own criteria for interpretation. Likewise, when a contract is incomplete because it fails to provide for a contingency, courts both at common law and under the Restatement may supply constructive conditions or \"gap fillers\u201d to avoid failure for indefiniteness. See, generally, Goetz &amp; Scott, <em>The limits of expanded choice: An analysis of the interaction between express and implied contract terms, </em>73 Cal L R 261 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Thus, even in employment contracts where courts have been much more reluctant to cure indefiniteness in duration, if the amount of work to be done is definite, a term that it must be done within a reasonable time will be supplied and enforced, <em>Browne &amp; Co v Sharkey Co, </em>58 Or 480; 115 P 156 (1911), as would a reference to a measurable time period such as, \" 'as long as\u2019 John Engler is Governor, or Michael F.

Farnsworth, <em>Disputes over omission in contracts, </em>68 Colum L R 860, 874 (1968).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-7\">The first step in deciding whether the requirement of definiteness has been met is to interpret the language of the agreement. [Farnsworth, Contracts, \u00a7 3.28, p 195.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">Thus, the process of supplying omitted terms begins with an incipient dispute over expression, for finding an omitted term \"is itself an exercise in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>interpretation of the contract to decide whether or not the parties have provided for the case.\u201d Farnsworth, 68 Colum L R 873-874.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">In this case, to determine what the parties have not said, we examine the language \"as long as she sold,\u201d which the dissent finds is a \"definite term of employment.\u201d <em>(Post, </em>p 688. Emphasis added.) The dissent eschews interpretation of the language in question, and characterizes the language as an absolute promise that would terminate only on the happening of a condition or event, i.e., failure to sell the quota.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">It is apparent, however, that the \"as long as\u201d language can be interpreted two ways: either in a temporal sense or in a qualitative sense,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that is, that your employment will last \"as long as\u201d you sell or your employment will last \"as long as\u201d your sales are satisfactory. The term is less definite than \"lifetime\u201d or \"permanent employment,\u201d which has a temporal reference only, but in referring to a sales draw, it may be understood to mean as long as the employee is able to do the work properly and the employer continues in the business. Stated otherwise, the words \"as long as,\u201d like \"permanent\u201d and \"lifetime,\u201d may be taken either literally as an obligation in perpetuity or seen as an offer of steady employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">Since, in this case, there is more than one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>possible meaning of the language \"as long as\u201d she sold, a meaning that signals a temporal limit and another that provides in generalized terms for the performance expectation of the employer, I cannot agree that the \"plain meaning\u201d of the language employed addresses when or how termination will occur, or binds the employer for any particular length of time.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-5\">Terms such as \"permanent employment\u201d have no immutable meaning. When used in different concrete situations by different individuals different meanings may fairly be attached to the term. If the employee has paid in money or in some other way for the promise of \"permanent employment,\u201d it is likely that both parties understood that employment was to endure as long as the employee is able to perform the work for which he is hired or at least until retirement age. The payment of a consideration is an evidentiary factor bearing on the proper interpretation of the parties\u2019 intention. It follows that other evidentiary factors can perform the same function. In each case all of the circumstances are to be considered. It may be shown that the parties meant or did not mean something definite. [Calamari &amp; Perillo, Contracts (3d ed), \u00a7 2-9, pp 60-61.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">If this problem is analyzed as a dispute over interpretation, i.e., the meaning of \"as long as,\u201d I read Justice Riley\u2019s opinion as fully consistent with the rule of construction, acknowledged in <em>Toussaint, </em>that the Court\u2019s task is \"to construe 'permanent\u2019 consistent with the circumstances surrounding the formation of the contract . . . .\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">If analyzed as a case of an omitted term, Farnsworth, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 7.17, pp 531-532, the result is also fully consistent with courts that have regularly found that an agreement that is silent with re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>spect to termination is an omitted case, despite absolute promises on both sides. Then, by implication, they have almost invariably supplied a term allowing either party to terminate at will.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">When one party seeks to terminate an agreement that is silent with respect to termination, the other party may claim that silence is not omission and that, since the promises of the parties are absolute, the agreement admits of no termination. Despite the superficial appeal of this argument, courts have had little difficulty in resolving the threshold problem of interpretation so as to find an omitted case. Farnsworth, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 7.17, pp 531-532. Farnsworth emphasizes that although this dispute arises frequently in the employment context, \"[c]onscious of the traditionally intimate nature of the relationship between employer and employee, courts have regularly found that termination is an omitted case, despite absolute promises on both sides. Then by implication they have almost invariably supplied a term allowing either party to terminate at will.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">Farnsworth explains that, just as modern courts conclude that promises in a bilateral contract are not absolute, but include constructive conditions of exchange, they conclude that the promise relied on here cannot be read to supply a durational term. In the seventeenth century, early common-law courts held that bilateral promises were absolute unless one of the parties explicitly qualified the promise. Thus, if one party failed to perform, the other party \"could not escape liability merely because the other party had not performed what he had promised in return.\u201d Farnsworth, 68 Colum LR 863. Later common-law courts concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>despite an absolute promise, the performance of each parties\u2019 promise \"is made a condition of the duty to perform the other . . . Farnsworth, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 8.9, p 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">According to Farnsworth, modern courts do not follow a literal approach to contract construction but \"take greater liberties in defining its [the contract\u2019s] scope.\u201d Farnsworth, 68 Colum LR 863. Rather than interpreting the promises as absolute, modern courts conclude that each promise defines the party\u2019s performance, but does not necessarily address the conditions of performance. Thus, the courts conclude that they are dealing with an omitted term, the conditions of performance. The same reasoning applies when courts consider language such as the \"as long as she sold\u201d statement upon which the plaintiff predicates her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">Despite the fact that modern courts reject this literal approach and conclude that neither party intended the language to cover the duration or scope of the obligation, Farnsworth, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 7.17, pp 531-532, the dissent would read the words as absolute, resulting in an obligation conceivably extending for the plaintiff\u2019s life. The approach confirms the accuracy of the observation that the dissent \"clearly evidences an insistence that this Court broaden the reach of . . . <em>Toussaint,\u201d </em>Riley, J., <em>ante, </em>p 651, an observation that is further supported by comparing the analysis here with that of the <em>Toussaint </em>majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">In <em>Toussaint, </em>the majority assumed the validity of precedent that a contract for \"permanent\u201d employment was for an indefinite term, <em>Lynas v Maxwell Farms, supra, </em>and found that an employee hired for an indefinite term may nonetheless have an enforceable obligation of \"for cause\u201d discharge. In this case, despite the recognition in <em>Toussaint </em>of the fact that our precedents require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>construing \" 'permanent\u2019 consistent with the circumstances surrounding the formation of the contract,\u201d <em>id., </em>p 609, the dissent relies on the plain meaning of \"as long as\u201d to supply a durational term.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Finally, I read Justice Riley\u2019s opinion as consistent with the modern view of 1 Restatement Contracts, 2d, \u00a7 33 and the UCC 2-204(3), that indefiniteness regarding material terms does not prevent a contract from existing,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and that context is referenced to determine the meaning of the agreement. 1 Restatement Contracts, 2d, \u00a7 33 appears in the chapter of the work which deals with offers. It expresses the view that a court should not find that there is no contract simply because \"one or more of the terms of a proposed bargain are left open or uncertain,\u201d \u00a7 33(3). That the illustration relied on by Justice Levin addresses the enforceability of the promise, not its duration, is supported both by comment (d) that \"[w]hen the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>calls for successive performances but is indefinite in duration, it is commonly terminable by either party, with or without a requirement of reasonable notice,\u201d and by the Reporter\u2019s note to comment (d), citing <em>Tanenbaum Textile Co, Inc v Sidran, </em>423 SW2d 635, 637 (Tex Civ App, 1968). In <em>Tanenbaum, </em>a manufacturer was obligated to pay a one percent commission on sales produced by the plaintiff, against the defendant\u2019s claim that \"the agreement ... is too indefinite to be enforceable in that: (1) its duration is not specified . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A4t\">While holding that the law would imply that a reasonable time was the durational term intended by the parties and that the contract was not too indefinite to be enforced, the court specifically stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-5\">Where a contract is silent as to the time it is to run, or provides that it is to run for an indefinite term, it is not invalid for that reason <em>but may be terminated by either party at any time. [Id., </em>p 637. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">In sum, I read part i of the opinion to be fully consistent with the black letter rule that where the parties have failed to set forth a material term, the court must interpret the language and conduct to determine the parties\u2019 intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">The plaintiff relied on a promissory theory of liability and the implied-in-law policy prong of <em>Toussaint. </em>In the context of employment arrangements, a promissory theory of liability is analyzed in light of the presumption of employment at will, a procedural device that, like other presumptions, is simply a legal recognition of the normal expec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>tations of parties in most employment situations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Where it is asserted that the proofs are insufficient to create an issue of fact, the promissory implied-in-fact claim requires the court to focus on the words or actions of the defendant to determine whether there is sufficient evidence manifesting an intention to make a commitment of job security. Where the defendant\u2019s commitment-making actions predominate, that is, where it is more likely than not that a reasonable promisee would believe that the employer was making a commitment that amounted to a promise, the presumption is overcome. Where the defendant\u2019s commitment-making actions do not predominate and there exists no other basis to supply a term regarding the scope or duration of the obligation, the promissory theory is an inappropriate rationalization for an enforceable obligation.

Where facts and circumstances are contradicted and reasonable minds can differ, the jury will determine the facts and circumstances that actually obtained, whether there was a commitment amounting to a promise, and whether the promise was breached. Where the facts and circumstances produced would not warrant a reasonable juror in finding a promise of job security, the question cannot be put to the jury, <em>Leslie v Mendelson, </em>302 Mich 95, 104; 4 NW2d 481 (1942). To experienced practitioners of employment law, this formulation may appear at best, unnecessary \u2014 at worst, simplistic. It is here to balance the perhaps unduly cryptic language in <em>Bullock v Automobile Club of Michigan, </em>432 Mich 472, 483; 444 NW2d 114 (1989), that the determination (of the effect of these manuals) \"must await further discovery and <em>perhaps </em>trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b913-6\"> Chief Justice Cavanagh incorrectly observes that the oral contract claim in <em>Toussaint </em>did not \"rely on the policy manual,\u201d <em>post, </em>p 721. \"Toussaint\u2019s case is, if anything, stronger because he was handed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>a manual of Blue Cross personnel policies which reinforced the oral assurance of job security,\u201d <em>Toussaint, </em>p 597. \"Toussaint\u2019s testimony was sufficient to create a question of fact for the jury whether there was a mutual understanding that it was company policy not to discharge an employee 'as long as [he] did [his] job,\u2019 and that this policy, expressed in documents (which said 'for just cause only\u2019), assertedly handed to Toussaint when he was hired, would apply to him as to other Blue Cross employees.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 613.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b915-8\"> In the area of sales of goods, for example, courts will infer almost every kind of term except the quantity term.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b916-8\"> Contrary to Justice Levin\u2019s assertion, the Rules of Personal Conduct (or other policy statements) may be relevant to an inquiry into Rowe\u2019s claims under the contract prong of <em>Toussaint </em>The facts of <em>Toussaint </em>are illustrative.

The majority concludes that to maintain an action on an express \"as long as\u201d promise of employment, a promisee must establish an implied promise by the promisor not to discharge at will. The conclusion that a promisor may renege at will unless he impliedly promised not to renege at will is without support in the cases,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and should be viewed by promisors generally \u2014 even those who may, in the short run, believe that today\u2019s decision is to their advantage\u2014 as excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">The majority compounds the errors in misstating the issue (subpart A, p 677), and in proceeding to decision on the mistaken assumption that the promise made to Rowe did not state a durational term (subpart b, p 678), by donning the mantle of trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">On the basis of its subjective intuition that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Montgomery Ward did not \"in reality\u201d agree to limit \"managerial discretion\u201d to discharge at will,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the majority finds that there was not \"mutual assent,\u201d and that the \"minds\u201d of the parties did not meet.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">Under the traditional objective approach, the correct focus is not on what the promisor, Montgomery Ward, <em>actually </em>intended, but on what a reasonable person in the position of the promisee, Rowe, would conclude the offer meant.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">The lead opinion begins with a comment about <em>Toussaint v Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Michigan, </em>408 Mich 579; 292 NW2d 880 (1980), stating that there this Court \"extended job security to non-unionized employees.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\"><em>Toussaint </em>did not, however, extend job security to nonunion employees. It simply ruled that promises of job security that had been extended \u2014 not by the courts, but rather by employers \u2014 were enforceable in a court of law. In <em>Valentine v General American Credit, Inc, </em>420 Mich 256, 258; 362 NW2d 628 (1984), a unanimous Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-9\"><em>Toussaint </em>makes employment contracts which provide that an employee will not be dismissed except for cause enforceable <em>in the same manner as other contracts.

It simply ruled that if an employer promises job security, a court of law will enforce that promise. Today, the court retreats from enforcement of a promise found on an adequate record to have been made to an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Montgomery Ward, apparently responding to <em>Toussaint, </em>has required all persons newly hired since 1982 to \"sign off\u201d any claim of job security by acknowledging in writing that no promise of job security was made.

Similarly, where the agreement is to make weekly payments <em>so long </em>as the promisor conducts a certain business, or where a vessel is chartered to the government for one month and <em>as much longer </em>as it may be required by the war department. Also, <em>where plaintiff's employment was to continue so long as workers trained by plaintiff were retained by the employer, the employment agreement was held sufficiently de\u00f1nite as to duration to constitute a contract, and was </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number><em>not terminable at the will of the employer. </em>[Simpson, Contracts (2d ed), \u00a7 48, p 75.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b939-4\">Section 32 of the first Restatement of Contracts spoke of the need for certainty in expression, and specifically included promises of employment.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The Restatement illustrated the \u00a7 32 \"black letter\u201d statement of the rule concerning \"certainty\u201d with the following example:<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-5\">A promises b to employ him for a stated compensation and b promises A <em>to serve therefor as long as b is able to do the work, </em>or as long as a specified business is carried on. <em>These promises create contracts, as a method is provided for determining the length of the engagement. </em>[1 Restatement Contracts, \u00a7 32, comment c, illustration 3, pp 41-42.

It is of course freely waivable by a joint expression of contrary intention. When the <em>law </em>introduces a just-cause requirement, it flies in the face of ordinary understandings and thus rests upon an assumption that just-cause arrangements are in the broad run of cases either more frequent or desirable than the contract at will, though neither is the case. Where this rule of construction is used, therefore, contracting-out will have to take place in the very large number of cases where the parties desire to conform to the norm by entering into a contract at will. Furthermore, it may be difficult to waive the for-cause requirement in fact, even if waiver is formally allowable as a matter of law, because of high standards for \u201cinformed\u201d waiver that cannot be met after the fact. By degrees, the original presumption against the contract at will could so gain in strength that a requirement that is waivable in theory could easily become conclusive in fact.

Suppose that a worker has put in the effort to obtain for the firm a large contract on which he is to be paid a commission. If the firm dismisses him under an at-will contract before the sale is consummated and the commission is formally due, most courts will (rightly) imply a term of good faith that gives the employee the commission for the work done, unless the agreement explicitly provides otherwise. Thus in <em>Coleman v Graybar Electric Co, Inc </em>[195 F2d 374 (CA 5, 1952)], the plaintiff\u2019s claim for compensation rested in part upon commissions that were paid annually based upon the sales record in the previous period.

But somehow or other the subject came up. When Harryman was asked whether he had informed Rowe of the \"reasons for which she may be terminated,\u201d Harryman testified, \"[t]heft or, you know, obviously, murder, or something like that; theft of any company properties, or so on.\u201d Also, Rowe signed the Rules of Personal Conduct, which enumerated grounds for discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">Since the record provides at least an issue properly submissible to the jury regarding whether Rowe and Harryman discussed job security, it should not be of any importance whether Rowe \"inquired\u201d about job security before Harryman brought it up and described the current policy as he understood it.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">Yet, even if Rowe had \"inquired\u201d about job <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>security, that would not satisfy the majority. With still another analysis, the signers of the lead opinion observe that in <em>Toussaint, supra, </em>the plaintiff was applying for a \"singular, executive job position[ ],\u201d while Rowe \"was one of many departmental salespersons.\u201d The lead opinion observes that Rowe\u2019s application was for one of \"several identical positions\u201d and reasons that this circumstance \"militates against the likelihood that the contract terms were negotiable and suggests that company policy was more likely to govern.\u201d<footnotemark>90</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">The record does not, however, indicate that there was a \"company policy\u201d contrary to Rowe\u2019s and Harryman\u2019s testimony. The Montgomery Ward manager who discharged Rowe testified that she would have had to rely, at the time she was hired, on what Harryman told her and what the Rules of Personal Conduct provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">The lead opinion does not state or describe the \"company policy\u201d adverted to in the opinion. Thus, in addition to assessing, as trier of fact, the <em>\"likelihood </em>that the contract terms were negotiable,\u201d and finding that \"company policy was <em>more likely </em>to govern,\u201d the lead opinion appears to hypothesize or posit, without record support, an unstated and undescribed \"company policy\u201d that was neither consistent with Harryman\u2019s statements to Rowe nor reflected in the Rules of Personal Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">The lead opinion states that \"[ujnlike <em>Toussaint, </em>plaintiff did not engage in preemployment negotiations regarding security.\u201d<footnotemark>91</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-9\"><em>Toussaint </em>dealt with the consolidated appeals in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Charles Toussaint\u2019s action against Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Michigan, and Walter Ebling\u2019s action against Masco Corporation. Both Toussaint and Ebling were employed in middle-management positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Ebling dealt directly with the executive vice president of Masco, and did indeed specifically \"negotiate\u201d for job security. The <em>Toussaint </em>opinion does not, however, indicate that Toussaint negotiated for job security any more than did Rowe.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> An officer at bcbsm advised Toussaint of the current policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\"><em>Ebling </em>is distinguishable in this regard from <em>Rowe, </em>but <em>Toussaint </em>is not. Toussaint may have been a higher level employee than Rowe, but nothing in the <em>Toussaint </em>record suggests that the terms of Toussaint\u2019s employment with bcbsm were any more negotiable than the terms of Rowe\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">The effort to distinguish <em>Toussaint </em>on the basis of negotiations for job security does not bear analysis insofar as the case of Charles Toussaint is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">The concurring opinion adverts to \"the circumstances identified as objective indications of intent\u201d<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> said to be set forth in the lead opinion.

Be that as it may, the \"circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>stances identified as objective 'indications of intent\u201d tend \u2014 objectively or subjectively viewed \u2014 to support Rowe.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">The author of the concurring opinion postulates still another rule of construction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-7\">[W]hen considering whether a statement constitutes an offer, in the context of commercial contracts, courts construe a statement as nonpromis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>sory if it would expose the maker to the risk of being bound to perform <em>beyond his means to perform.[</em><footnotemark><em>95</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b963-4\">This suggests that providing job security for commissioned salespersons for as long as they sell might have been beyond the means of Montgomery Ward. There is nothing in the record to support such a finding, and under the circumstance that commissioned salespersons are paid only when they sell, it is unlikely that this rule of construction has any application on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">In this connection, especially noteworthy are the decisions of the Supreme Courts of Texas and California, and of the Louisiana Court of Appeal,<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> because in each of those cases the contracts \u2014 to provide water, pest control, or an exclusive selling agency \u2014 proved to be onerous during their long terms. The courts did not, however, relieve the contracting party of the \"as long as\u201d promise. Again, however, there is nothing to suggest that employing Rowe, on a straight commission basis, as long as she sold might be economically disadvantageous to Montgomery Ward.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">The \"issue\u201d dealt with in part n of the lead opinion was not briefed or argued by Rowe, and hence cannot properly be decided at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">This issue is addressed in two cases pending in this Court on applications by <em>employers </em>for leave to appeal, <em>Henry v Montgomery Ward, </em>Docket No. 90134, and <em>Schippers v SPX Corp, </em>Docket No. 90702.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">The first paragraph of part ii of the lead opinion reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-5\">Having concluded that the employer\u2019s oral statements and the \"Rules of Personal Conduct\u201d did not form contracts for permanent employment, we must next decide whether the disciplinary guidelines promulgated by defendant gave rise to an employment contract providing termination only for just cause where defendant concurrently issued sign-off sheets containing an employment-at-will policy. <em>We \u00f1nd that plaintiff cannot maintain an action for breach of contract on the basis of the disciplinary guidelines because the last handbook which plaintiff received clearly set forth an employment-at-will policy.[</em><footnotemark><em>97</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">The <em>\"last </em>handbook\u201d was issued in 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">While Rowe argued that the Rules of Personal Conduct, which she signed in August, 1976, when she was hired, were <em>part of her express </em>contract of employment and gave rise to reasonable expectations of termination only for cause, she did not assert that the procedure set forth in the 1983 manual or handbook \u2014 the sign-off sheet which she did not sign \u2014 gave rise to an <em>implied promise </em>of termination only for cause.

Rowe agreed, but added that she might have to attend to a personal matter on Saturday afternoon and had even considered taking all day Saturday off. Rowe also testified that the commissioned employees switched their shifts back and forth from time to time. Rowe had attempted on the previous evening to reach her supervisor to tell him of the switch, but he did not work on Friday and did not come in on Saturday. Morris confirmed Rowe\u2019s testimony about trading shifts in general, and specifically with respect to the trade that occurred that Saturday.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">Rowe testified that she was familiar with the staffing needs of the department, and that she did not leave the store without assuring herself that there was an adequate number of persons staffing the major appliance department. Another employee confirmed her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">Harryman testified that while all employees were required to punch in and out, these policies frequently changed. He indicated that they really had little application to commission salespersons. He said, \"The number one thing was to work, attain those draw figures. It was sales.

I am in substantial .agreement with the analysis of my Brother Levin\u2019s dissenting opinion, with the exception of parts ii(e) and vn, <em>ante, </em>pp 693-694, 715-719. Justice Levin persuasively demonstrates why the majority\u2019s analysis is simply erroneous with regard to the law, and constitutes a virtual overruling of <em>Toussaint v Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Michigan, </em>408 Mich 579; 292 NW2d 880 (1980). I add only the following observations:</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">First, my Brother Levin, in part iv(c), <em>ante, </em>pp 712-713, demonstrates why the majority\u2019s reliance on the fact that Rowe did not specifically \"negotiate\u201d for job security, see <em>ante, </em>pp 641-642, fails <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>adequately to distinguish this case from <em>Toussaint. </em>I would go further, however, and point out that the majority fails to convincingly explain why \"negotiation\u201d or the lack of it is even relevant. The relevant issue regarding the terms of Rowe\u2019s oral employment contract \u2014 including the durational or job security term, if any \u2014 is <em>what </em>terms were in fact agreed to, not how or whether they were \"negotiated.\u201d The majority\u2019s reasoning suggests that a company is legally incapable of offering an oral just-cause employment contract to a prospective employee on a standardized, \"take-it- or-leave-it\u201d basis. Yet offering such contractual job security as a matter of standard routine, even without \"negotiation\u201d or prompting or inquiry from the applicant, would seem to be an attractive \"selling point\u201d for any company seeking employees, and would seem likely to aid the company in finding and keeping good employees. The majority\u2019s reasoning, carried to its logical limit, would permit companies to reap the benefits of offering such contractual job security, without holding them to their promises. This is neither fair nor countenanced by any accepted contract principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Second, my Brother Levin demonstrates that the majority confuses the issue whether Rowe\u2019s claim is supported by express contractual statements with the separate issue whether her claim is supported by the employer\u2019s written policy statements, see <em>ante, </em>pp 678-682 (part i[b]), and that, to the extent \"objective support\u201d for the express oral contract in this case is relevant, such factors support Rowe, see <em>ante, </em>pp 713-714 (part v). I agree and would point out that the majority\u2019s newly invented requirement of \"objective support\u201d for such an express oral contract from policy manuals or statements, see <em>ante, </em>p 644, plainly alters and misapplies this Court\u2019s holding and reasoning in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number><em>Toussaint </em>and its companion case, <em>Ebling. </em>While it is true, as the majority notes, that \"Toussaint was given a manual specifically providing termination only for just cause,\u201d <em>ante, </em>p 644, we did not rely on the policy manual in <em>Toussaint </em>to support the existence of Toussaint\u2019s oral just-cause contract. The policy manual was relevant only to Toussaint\u2019s <em>separate </em>claim that his dismissal without cause was barred by \"legitimate expectations\u201d created by the manual. See 408 Mich 598-599 (holding that \"[i]n <em>Toussaint, </em>as in <em>Ebling, </em>there was sufficient evidence of an express agreement to justify submission to the jury,\u201d and <em>separately </em>holding that \"[a] jury could <em>also </em>find for Toussaint based on legitimate expectations grounded in his employer\u2019s written policy statements\u201d) (emphasis added). The majority ignores the fact that in <em>Ebling </em>there was no policy manual providing any \"objective support,\u201d but only oral statements establishing an oral just-cause contract. See <em>id. </em>at 625-626 (opinion of Ryan, J., joined by Coleman, C.J., and Fitzgerald, J.). Yet this Court, while dividing four to three in Toussaint\u2019s favor, held <em>unanimously </em>that Ebling had produced sufficient evidence of an oral just-cause contract \"to justify submission to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598 (opinion of the Court), and at 633-636 (opinion of Ryan, J., joined by Coleman, C.J., and Fitzgerald, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Finally, I would note that the majority in this case, despite its disclaimers, effectively takes upon itself the role of jury and factfinder. See, generally, <em>ante, </em>pp 640-646. The majority makes quite clear that, were it sitting as the jury in this case, it would not be convinced that a just-cause contract of employment was entered into. It is well established, however, by a fifty-year-old line of controlling precedents (unbroken until now) that whether two parties have, by express oral statements, en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>tered into a contract providing for just-cause employment is, ultimately, a question of fact for the jury. See <em>McIntyre v Smith-Bridgman &amp; Co, </em>301 Mich 629, 637; 4 NW2d 36 (1942); <em>Toussaint, </em>408 Mich 613 (opinion of the Court), and at 635 (opinion of Ryan, J., joined by Coleman, C.J., and Fitzgerald, J.); <em>Bullock v Automobile Club of Michigan, </em>432 Mich 472, 484-485; 444 NW2d 114 (1989). It is equally well established that the jury\u2019s determination of factual issues should not be disturbed unless, considering the record in the light most favorable to the verdict, there is <em>no </em>competent or sufficient evidence from which reasonable minds could reach the jury\u2019s conclusion. See <em>Kupkowski v Avis Ford, Inc, </em>395 Mich 155, 167-168; 235 NW2d 324 (1975); <em>Dodd v Secretary of State, </em>390 Mich 606, 612; 213 NW2d 109 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">The majority has not demonstrated how the oral just-cause employment contract in this case\u2014 which clearly enjoys sufficient factual support to justify the jury\u2019s verdict \u2014 is barred or precluded by any supervening principles of contract law, properly analyzed. This case, for all relevant and dispositive purposes, is legally and factually indistinguishable from <em>Toussaint. </em>I therefore dissent from the majority\u2019s overturning of the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<judges id=\"b970-6\">Mallett, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
