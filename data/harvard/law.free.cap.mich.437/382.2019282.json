The defendant and his two friends, Mr. White and Mr. Johnston, were at Mr. White\u2019s home. They left Mr. White\u2019s house, drove around the corner to the home of Mr. Bland and accused him of stealing Mr. White\u2019s car. When Mr. Bland denied stealing the car, the defendant and his friends returned to Mr. White\u2019s home. As they pulled into the driveway of Mr. White\u2019s home, Mr. Bland, accompanied by his older brother and the victim, Steven Powers, approached.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Mr. Bland repeatedly denied knowing anything about the theft. At this point, Mr. White went into his house and did not come back outside until after the shooting. The defendant, as well as Mr. Johnston, the two Bland brothers, and Mr. Powers, remained outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">As the argument continued, Mr. Powers threatened to put the defendant \"on his head\u201d and called the defendant names.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The decedent walked to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>wards the defendant, but Mr. Bland held the decedent back.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant said \"don\u2019t walk up on me.\u201d There were no blows struck; indeed, there was no physical contact of any kind between the decedent, the defendant, or anyone else. The defendant testified that the decedent was not armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-3\">After this verbal exchange, the defendant walked into the house. He went to the back of the house and retrieved a gun from a closet. He then came back outside, approximately thirty seconds later, carrying a shotgun. As he was coming out, he instructed Mr. Johnston to hit Mr. Powers with a monkey wrench. Mr. Johnston swung the wrench, but the decedent ducked out of the way. At that point, the defendant fired one shot, hitting Mr. Powers in the abdomen. Mr. Johnston ran home, as did the two Bland brothers, who called the police. The defendant and Mr. White drove off in the defendant\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">The defendant was charged with first-degree murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. On the murder charge, the judge instructed the jury on first-degree murder, second-degree murder, involuntary manslaughter, and careless and reckless use of a firearm resulting in death. The judge refused the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>request for an instruction on voluntary manslaughter, finding that the evidence offered at trial did not support this offense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On September 22, 1987, the jury found the defendant guilty of second-degree murder and felony-firearm. He was sentenced to a term of ten to fifteen years for the murder conviction and a mandatory term of two years for the felony-firearm conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court and remanded for a new trial. 183 Mich App 216; 454 NW2d 130 (1989). The panel believed there was sufficient evidence of provocation and passion in the record to support an instruction on voluntary manslaughter. The panel based its finding on various witnesses\u2019 testimony regarding the argument between the defendant and the decedent. <em>Id. </em>at 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">This Court granted leave to appeal by order dated July 18, 1990, to consider whether the trial judge erred in not instructing on voluntary manslaughter, 435 Mich 868 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">It is the duty of the court to \"instruct the jury as to the law applicable to the case . . . .\u201d MCL 768.29; MSA 28.1052. However, a verdict shall not be set aside where the court fails to instruct on any point of law unless the accused requests such instruction. MCL 768.29; MSA 28.1052.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">It is undisputed that the defense counsel in this case made a proper request for an instruction on voluntary manslaughter. Therefore, the issue before us is whether the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct on voluntary manslaughter was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>The court\u2019s duty to instruct on the law applicable to the case depends on the evidence presented at trial. This case deals with a cognate lesser included offense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The test to determine whether an instruction on a cognate lesser included offense must be given is as follows: The record must be examined, and if there is evidence which would support a conviction of the cognate lesser offense, then the trial judge, if requested, must instruct on it. <em>People v Van Wyck, </em>402 Mich 266, 270; 262 NW2d 638 (1978); <em>People v Van Wyck (On Remand), </em>83 Mich App 581; 269 NW2d 233 (1978).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under this standard, there must be more than a modicum of evidence; there must be sufficient evidence that the defendant could be convicted of the lesser offense. Only then does the judge\u2019s failure to instruct on the lesser included offense constitute error. 402 Mich 270. If the evidence presented could not support a conviction of the lesser offense, then the judge should not give the requested instruction. See <em>People v Beach, </em>429 Mich 450, 480; 418 NW2d 861 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">To determine whether the judge erred in not instructing on voluntary manslaughter, we must ascertain whether there was evidence presented at the defendant\u2019s trial which would support a conviction of voluntary manslaughter._</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>ii</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">MCL 750.321; MSA 28.553 specifies the punishment for the crime of manslaughter. However, it is the common law which defines the crime. Voluntary manslaughter, an intentional killing, has been defined by this Court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">[I]f the act of killing, though intentional, be committed under the influence of passion or in heat of blood, produced by an adequate or reasonable provocation, and before a reasonable time has elapsed for the blood to cool and reason to resume its habitual control, and is the result of the temporary excitement, by which the control of reason was disturbed . . . then the law, out of indulgence to the frailty of human nature . . . regards the offense as of a less heinous character than murder, and gives it the designation of manslaughter. <em>[Maher v People, </em>10 Mich 212, 219 (1862).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Murder and manslaughter are both homicides and share the element of being intentional killings. However, the element of provocation which characterizes the offense of manslaughter separates it from murder. Murder and manslaughter are separate offenses, but, as noted above, voluntary manslaughter is a cognate lesser included offense of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">The above definition of voluntary manslaughter encompasses several components which comprise the test for voluntary manslaughter: First, the defendant must kill in the heat of passion. Second, the passion must be caused by an adequate provocation. Finally, there cannot be a lapse of time during which a reasonable person could control his passions. <em>Maher </em>at 219-220. See also Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law (3d ed), p 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The provocation necessary to mitigate a homicide from murder to manslaughter is that which causes the defendant to act out of passion rather than reason. <em>People v Townes, </em>391 Mich 578, 590; 218 NW2d 136 (1974). One commentator interprets the law as requiring that the defendant\u2019s emotions be so intense that they distort the defendant\u2019s practical reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">The law does not excuse actors whose behavior is caused by just any . . . emotional disturbance. . . . Rather, the law asks whether the victim\u2019s provoking act aroused the defendant\u2019s emotions to such a degree that the choice to refrain from crime became difficult for the defendant. The legal doctrine reflects the philosophical distinction between emotions that only cause choice and emotions so intense that they distort the very process of choosing.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">In addition, the provocation must be adequate, namely, that which would cause the reasonable person to lose control. <em>Id. </em>at 590. Not every hot-tempered individual who flies into a rage at the slightest insult can claim manslaughter.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The law cannot countenance the loss of self-control; rather, it must encourage people to control their passions. Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law, p 84._</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>The determination of what is reasonable provocation is a question of fact for the factfinder. <em>Id. </em>at 589. However, the judge does play a substantial role. The judge furnishes the standard of what constitutes adequate provocation, i.e., that provocation which would cause a reasonable person to act out of passion rather than reason. When, as a matter of law, no reasonable jury could find that the provocation was adequate, the judge may exclude evidence of the provocation. Maher, <em>supra </em>at 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">A review of the evidence establishes that none of the three prongs necessary for a finding of voluntary manslaughter are present. There is no evidence that the defendant was in a highly inflamed state of mind: he testified that at the time that he went into the house to retrieve the gun, he was not angry.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This reveals that the defendant\u2019s ability to reason was not blurred by passion; his emotional state did not reach such a level that he was unable to act deliberately. Indeed, he stated that he was not angry at all. Even if he was scared and confused, his decision to retrieve the gun was a deliberate and reasoned act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Furthermore, the claimed provocation in this case consists only of words, which other courts generally have held do not constitute adequate provocation, <em>Allen v United States, </em>164 US 492; 17 S Ct 154; 41 L Ed 528 (1896), and in some instances words alone did not even justify an assault and battery, <em>Goucher v Jamieson, </em>124 Mich 21; 82 NW 663 (1900). However, words of an informative nature, rather than mere insults, have been considered adequate provocation. See LaFave &amp; Scott, Criminal Law, \u00a7 76, pp 576-577. But this is not such a case, for this case involves insulting words, not words of an informational character. Nonetheless, we decline to issue a rule that insulting words per se are never adequate provocation. Instead, we reiterate that what constitutes adequate provocation is a factual question, and on these facts, the provocation was not adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The evidence offered at trial painted a picture of a verbal fracas between six young men. The decedent insulted the defendant, but there were no punches thrown. There was no physical contact of any kind between the defendant, the decedent, or any of the six.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The judge was absolutely correct in ruling that as a matter of law there was insuffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>cient evidence to establish an adequate provocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\">Finally, sufficient time passed to constitute a \"cooling-off period.\u201d After a few insults were exchanged, the defendant went into the house, a safe harbor. There was no evidence that the defendant was compelled to go back outside by anyone. The defendant could have stayed in the house, as did Mr. White. Instead, the defendant chose to retrieve the shotgun from a closet in the back of the house and chose to go back outside. Once outside, shotgun in hand, he instructed Mr. Johnson to hit Mr. Powers with the wrench. When that failed, the defendant shot and killed Mr. Powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">The evidence adduced at trial would not support finding the defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter. This is the finding that the trial judge made in deciding not to give the requested instruction on voluntary manslaughter.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because of this, the trial judge was correct in refusing the requested instruction on voluntary manslaughter. To instruct the jury on an offense not supported by the evidence would confuse the jury, and be \"a distortion of the factfinding process.\u201d <em>Beach, supra </em>at 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The law of voluntary manslaughter developed as a means of taking into consideration the weaknesses of human beings. Key to any finding of voluntary manslaughter is evidence of adequate provocation that a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the defendant, overcome by emotion, could not choose to refrain from the crime. Adequate provocation does not excuse or justify mur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>der, but rather designates one guilty of manslaughter less culpable than one guilty of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"ACqk\">We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b641-5\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Levin, Brickley, Boyle, Riley, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Mallett, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-10\"> At trial, the defendant testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-11\"><em>A. . . . </em>Steven Powers had said, what is he [Mr. White] going in the house for. . . .
