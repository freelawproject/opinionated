INTRODUCTION AND FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">This case is a wrongful discharge/religious discrimination action brought against the defendant, Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Incorporated, by Jane Scholz, a- former employee of defendant at its North Kent Mall Store in Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">The Court held in abeyance defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal pending decisions in <em>Bullock v Automobile Club of Michigan, </em>432 Mich 472; 444 NW2d 114 (1989), and <em>In re Certified Question, Bankey v Storer Broadcasting Co, </em>432 Mich 438; 443 NW2d 112 (1989). On May 2, 1990, we granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">The sole issue to be decided in this appeal is whether plaintiff had a contract not to be terminated for refusing to work on Sundays on the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>of oral statements and circumstances surrounding her employment. We hold, as a matter of law, that at the time of her discharge plaintiff\u2019s employment relationship was governed by the employer\u2019s 1982 sign-off sheet, and that plaintiff was an employee at will. Thus, plaintiff cannot maintain an action for wrongful discharge. Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed to the extent it found that plaintiff could bring an action for breach of contract, and the case is remanded to the trial court for entry of an order pursuant to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The facts of this case are set forth in the Court of Appeals decision, unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, decided January 27, 1987 (Docket No. 86118):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">Plaintiff was hired by defendant as a sales person on August 31, 1970, at defendant\u2019s location at the North Kent Mall in northern Kent County. At the time of her hiring, she discussed Sunday working hours with the personnel director, Donald Hansen. At that time, the North Kent Mall store was not open for business on Sundays. Nevertheless, plaintiff indicated her desire not to work on Sundays. Hansen took the matter up with the store manager, Robert Bergman. Bergman indicated that, although he did not anticipate the store opening on Sundays, there would be no difficulty in honoring plaintiff\u2019s request in the event the store opened on Sundays. Hansen relayed this decision to plaintiff, who accepted a position with defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">Four or five months later, the store opened for Sunday trade. Two years after that, plaintiff was asked to work on Sundays. She refused, citing religious convictions. The matter was dropped. Sometime later, in 1977, plaintiff was formally notified by defendant that she would have to work on Sundays. Plaintiff\u2019s pastor, Wesley A. Samuelson of Bethlehem Lutheran Church in Grand Rap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>ids, sent a letter to defendant indicating that plaintiff\u2019s religious convictions prevented her from working on Sundays. Although she was scheduled to work three Sundays in 1977, she refused. No action was taken by defendant. In 1982, defendant issued a policy manual. On the face of the manual, there was a sheet entitled \"new employees sign-off sheet,\u201d which plaintiff signed on May 10, 1982. That sheet contained, inter alia, the following paragraph:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">\"I have read and fully understand the rules governing my employment with Montgomery Ward. I agree to employment with Montgomery Ward under the conditions explained. I understand these conditions can be changed by the Company, without notice, at any time. I also understand and agree that my employment is for no definite period and may, regardless of the time and manner of payment of my wages and salary, be terminated at any time, with or without cause, and without any previous notice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">In 1983, plaintiff was informed that if she refused to work on Sundays, she would be terminated. She responded by letter that it was her understanding at the time of hiring that she would not be required to work on Sundays. She was scheduled for work on Sundays, she refused to work on Sundays, and she was terminated. Defendant admits plaintiff had an excellent work record and that the sole reason for her discharge was her failure to report for Sunday work. [Slip op, pp 1-2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Plaintiff brought suit in Kent Circuit Court on January 16, 1984, against Montgomery Ward, alleging age and religious discrimination and breach of contract. A jury awarded her $8,250 on the religious discrimination claim and $16,503 on the breach of contract claim, plus costs, interest, and attorney fees. <em>Scholz, supra, </em>slip op, p l.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following the trial, defendant moved for a judgment notwith<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>standing the verdict<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or, in the alternative, for a new trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The trial court denied both motions. Defendant appealed, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motions, reasoning that Toussaint v <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Michigan, </em>408 Mich 579; 292 NW2d 880 (1980), reh den 409 Mich 1101 (1980), does not permit an employer to unilaterally modify a contract. <em>Scholz, supra, </em>slip op, p 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The Court of Appeals concluded that since the question whether defendant retained the right to unilaterally change the terms of the oral employment contract with plaintiff was one of fact for the jury and not one of law for the trial court, the jury reasonably could have concluded that provisions of the 1970 oral contract remained in force. Therefore, the trial court properly denied the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and similarly did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a new trial. <em>Scholz, supra, </em>slip op, pp 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">In <em>Toussaint, </em>we recognized that employers may provide a contract of employment at will by way of express disclaimers in their employment policies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>In <em>Valentine v General American Credit, Inc, </em>420 Mich 256, 258-259; 362 NW2d 628 (1984), we reaffirmed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\">Employers and employees remain free to provide, or not to provide, for job security. Absent a contractual provision for job security, either the employer or the employee may ordinarily terminate an employment contract at any time for any, or no, reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">In the instant case, plaintiff relies on the prehiring statements made by Mr. Hansen, Montgomery Ward\u2019s personnel director, to allege an express contract that she was not required to work Sundays.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Plaintiff also relies on several instances during her employment where defendant acquiesced in her refusal to work Sundays. Even if we were to assume plaintiff had an express oral contract with Montgomery Ward that she did not have to work on Sundays, she reached a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>understanding with Montgomery Ward governing the terms of her employment status once she signed the disclaimer providing employment at will in May of 1982.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Montgomery Ward took action which we expressly approved of in <em>Toussaint </em>and entered into a contract with plaintiff making her employment terminable at will. On the basis of this agreement, Montgomery Ward properly terminated plaintiff\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">This case is analogous to <em>Ledl v Quik-Pik Stores, </em>133 Mich App 583; 349 NW2d 529 (1984). In <em>Ledl, </em>the plaintiff was given assurances at the time she accepted employment that she would continue to be employed as long as her performance was satisfactory. Approximately seven and one-half years after being hired, she signed an employment agreement which provided that the defendant could terminate her employment with or without cause. The Court of Appeals concluded that the plaintiff failed to state a claim for breach of an employment contract because the language of the contract negated any prior oral agreements she may have had that were based on her employer\u2019s assurances.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">In the instant case, on May 16, 1982, thirteen years after plaintiff was hired, she signed an employment agreement which provided that her employment was at will. A closely related sign-off sheet was involved in <em>Dell v Montgomery Ward &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>Co, Inc, </em>811 F2d 970 (CA 6, 1987).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Dell, </em>the plaintiff alleged a breach of contract claim under <em>Toussaint </em>against Montgomery Ward after being fired for deceptively covering up the wrongful conduct of one of his subordinates. The plaintiff executed the sign-off sheet, expressly acknowledging that his employment was at will and was terminable with or without just cause. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling on the <em>Toussaint </em>issue. Writing for the court, Judge Ryan concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">It is difficult to imagine what more the defendant might have done to make it crystal clear to Dell, and all Montgomery Ward employees, that, unless some other arrangement were made directly with the President and Chief Executive Officer or Executive Vice President of Human Resources, Montgomery Ward employees are employees \"at will\u201d who may be discharged with or without cause. <em>[Id., </em>p 974. See also <em>Haas v Montgomery Ward &amp; Co, Inc, </em>812 F2d 1015 (CA 6, 1987).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Plaintiff argues that although she read and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>understood the written employment-at-will agreement, she did not believe it applied to her Sunday work arrangement. Plaintiff contends that because mutual assent is lacking, the executed sign-off sheet defining her status as an employee at will did not alter the fact that she would not be terminated for refusing Sunday employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">It is well settled that the failure of a party to obtain an explanation of a contract is ordinary negligence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, this estops the party from avoiding the contract on the ground that the party was ignorant of the contract provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">As this Court has previously held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">The stability of written instruments demands that a person who executes one shall know its contents or be chargeable with such knowledge. If he cannot read, he should have a reliable person read it to him. His failure to do so is negligence which estops him from voiding the instrument on the ground that he was ignorant of its contents, in the absence of circumstances fairly excusing his failure to inform himself. <em>[Sponseller v Kimball, </em>246 Mich 255, 260; 224 NW 359 (1929).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">If plaintiff did not understand the terms of the sign-off sheet, she had a duty to inquire about its contents. The record does not reflect any attempt by plaintiff to find out whether or not she was excused from Sunday employment under the terms of the disclaimer. In any case, we find the disclaimer unambiguous on the subject of discharge and comprehensive on the subject of termination. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>It does not suggest that she was immune from discharge for refusing Sunday work.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">In sum, Montgomery Ward took the action expressly approved in <em>Toussaint </em>and entered into a contract with plaintiff making her employment terminable at will. Plaintiff assented to the terms of the employment agreement by signing the sign-off sheet and returning it to Montgomery Ward. Upon the basis of this agreement, Montgomery Ward terminated plaintiff\u2019s employment. Therefore, regardless of whether an express oral contract actually existed at the time of her hiring, as a matter of law, plaintiff and Montgomery Ward later reached a mutual understanding with regard to termination through the sign-off sheet. We find that plaintiff\u2019s employment with Montgomery Ward was, as a matter of law, an employment-at-will relationship. Therefore, plaintiff cannot prevail in her breach of contract action.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Plaintiff also argues that defendant acquiesced in her refusal to work Sundays, thus creating a contract implied in fact that she not be terminated for such refusal. Regardless of whether an implied contract arose, as a matter of law, it did not apply to plaintiff at the time she was discharged because the express modified contract under the terms of the sign-off sheet was in effect at the time of her discharge. An implied contract cannot be enforced where the parties have made an express contract covering the same subject matter. <em>In re De Haan </em>Estate, 169 Mich 146; 134 NW 983 (1912); <em>Steele v Cold Heading Co, </em>125 Mich App 199, 202-203; 336 NW2d 1 (1983); <em>Hickman v General Motors Corp, </em>177 Mich App 246, 251; 441 NW2d 430 (1989). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Under the rule set forth above, plaintiff cannot prevail on her claim for breach of contract.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Our decision recognizes that once a disclaimer providing employment at will is signed by an employee, excepting any subsequent modification, the employee may be terminated for any, or no, reason. Thus, in the present case, plaintiff cannot prevail on a claim for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The decision of the trial court and Court of Appeals is reversed with regard to the breach of contract claim, and a judgment notwithstanding the verdict shall be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">However, we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling on the religious discrimination issue because of defendant\u2019s failure to object to the instructions given at trial. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b342-8\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Brickley, Boyle, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Riley, J._</judges>\n<author id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5D\">The jury found that Montgomery Ward</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">\u2014agreed that Jane Scholz would not be required to work on Sunday, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AI1\">\u2014wrongfully discharged her when she refused to work on Sunday.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">The majority does not challenge the jury\u2019s findings of fact. It states rather that \"[e]ven if we were to assume plaintiff had an express oral contract with Montgomery Ward that she did not have to work on Sundays,\u201d a contract Scholz claimed was entered into when she was hired, Scholz subsequently reached a \"new understanding\u201d with Montgomery Ward, in May, 1982, when she signed the sign-off sheet, \"governing the terms of her employment status\u201d and providing for employment at will. <em>(Ante, </em>pp 89-90.)</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">The majority concludes that because Scholz was an employee at will she cannot maintain an action for wrongful discharge. It affirms the verdict for Scholz on the religious discrimination claim, and to that extent I concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The \"new understanding\u201d is embodied in the following paragraph of the \"new employee sign-off sheet\u201d that Scholz was asked to and did sign in May, 1982, although she was not a new employee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">I have read and fully understand the rules governing my employment with Montgomery Ward. I agree to employment with Montgomery Ward under the conditions explained. I understand these conditions can be changed by the Company, without notice, at any time. I also understand and agree that my employment is for no definite period and may, regardless of the time and manner of payment of my wages and salary, be terminated at any time, with or without cause, and without any previous notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Scholz testified that she did not understand that by signing the sign-off sheet she could be required to work on Sundays. Scholz argued that the rules and regulations in the Welcome to Montgomery Ward Handbook that accompanied the new employee sign-off sheet had nothing to do with Scholz\u2019 \"other agreement,\u201d entered into when she was hired, whereby she had conditioned her employment on not working on Sundays, and to which Montgomery Ward had agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">The facts are essentially undisputed. This is not a case where the testimony of the witnesses for the employer differed significantly from the testimony of the employee\u2019s witnesses. Employer claims that juries are inclined to be sympathetic to employees, and, on that basis, in defiance of the evidence, resolve against employers disputed factual issues are, insofar as this case is concerned, misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Mr. Hansen, Montgomery Ward\u2019s personnel director, testified that when Jane Scholz was hired the store manager was looking for more mature women. Hansen spoke with the store manager when Scholz raised a question about Sunday work. Hansen then reported to Scholz that he had counseled with the store manager and that \"there wasn\u2019t a problem with her working on Sundays.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">When Scholz was hired, Montgomery Ward was not open on Sundays. A short time later Montgomery Ward opened on Sundays, and Scholz was thereafter asked by a person other than Hansen to work on Sundays. She refused to do so, and no action was taken by Montgomery Ward.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Five years later, in 1977, a new store manager asked Scholz to work on Sundays. When she explained that she was not required to work on Sunday, he asked her to obtain a letter from her pastor, which she did. Scholz was not required, until the events that led to her discharge, to work on Sunday at any time during the thirteen years of her employment with Montgomery Ward. She worked holidays to make up for the time that she did not work on Sundays.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">In May, 1982, Scholz signed the new employee sign-off sheet. Subsequently, another employee manual was issued, but Scholz did not sign an accompanying employee sign-off sheet. The employee sign-off sheet that Scholz did <em>not </em>sign contained language corresponding to the language in the sign-off sheet considered in <em>Dell v Montgomery Ward &amp; Co, Inc, </em>811 F2d 970 (CA 6, 1987), discussed in the majority opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>In September, 1983, Ralph Bevan was Scholz\u2019 immediate supervisor. He insisted that she begin working on Sundays. The matter was discussed with the personnel and store managers. The store manager testified that he discussed the matter with \"corporate people in Chicago.\u201d Thereafter, the personnel manager wrote Scholz that she would be discharged if she did not work on Sunday, November 13, 1983. A copy of that letter was sent to the Chicago personnel and area managers. She did not work that Sunday and was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Scholz was then three years short of retirement at age seventy. Montgomery Ward required that Scholz work one Sunday a month for perhaps three hours \u2014 it was the policy to permit persons who attended church, which Scholz did every Sunday, to report for work Sunday afternoon. The controversy thus concerned no more than forty hours a <em>year </em>for <em>three </em>years \u2014 one hundred twenty hours \u2014 which Scholz would have been willing to make up by working on national holidays. The store manager testified that it was nevertheless necessary to discharge Scholz because \"store policy required uniformity in treatment of employees,\u201d the Law of the Medes and the Persians.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Scholz asserts that she did not understand that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>by signing the sign-off sheet she was agreeing to work on Sunday, or abrogating a right not to be discharged for refusing to work on Sunday. The majority responds to her assertion that \"we find the disclaimer unambiguous on the subject of discharge and comprehensive on the subject of termination. It does not suggest that she was immune from discharge for refusing Sunday work.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The premise of the majority is, thus, that the language of the sign-off sheet is unambiguous, and can have only one meaning. Professor Corbin wrote that statements about \" 'plain and clear\u2019 \u201d meaning \"assume a uniformity and certainty in the meaning of language that do not in fact exist . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The United States Supreme Cpurt has said that \"[i]t is hornbook contract law that the proper construction of an agreement is that given by one of the parties when 'that party had no reason to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>know of any different meaning attached by the other, and the other had reason to know the meaning attached by the first party.\u2019 Restatement (Second) of Contracts, \u00a7201(2)(b) (19S1).[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] See also Farnsworth, Contracts 487-488 (1982).\u201d <em>United States v </em>Stuart, 489 US 353, 368, n 7; 109 S Ct 1183; 103 L Ed 2d 388 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The record establishes that Scholz would not have agreed to work on Sunday, did not know or have reason to know that Montgomery Ward attached to the sign-off sheet the meaning that she could, by signing it, thereby be required to work on Sunday, and would not have signed it if she thought that by doing so she was agreeing to work on Sunday. The record also establishes that Montgomery Ward knew or had reason to know<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that Scholz claimed she was not required to work on Sunday, and would not, if she were to sign the writing, attach to the writing a meaning that would require her to work on Sunday.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>On the principle recognized by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Stuart, </em>and set forth in the Restatement, Scholz\u2019, rather than Montgomery Ward\u2019s, meaning or understanding is to be attached to the writing. Montgomery Ward knew or had reason to know that Scholz understood that their agreement would continue to be that she was not required to work on Sunday, and that Scholz did not know or have reason to know that Montgomery Ward was seeking to abrogate, by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>words used in the new employees sign-off sheet, a right, established when she was hired, not to work on Sunday.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Scholz argues that the new employee sign-off sheet had nothing to do with her \"other agreement,\u201d entered into when she was hired, whereby she had conditioned her employment on not working on Sundays, and to which Montgomery Ward had agreed. This presents the question whether the sign-off sheet was a complete integration of all the terms of the employment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">\"[A] writing cannot of itself prove its own completeness, and wide latitude must be allowed for inquiry into circumstances bearing on the intention of the parties.\u201d 2 Restatement Contracts, 2d, \u00a7 210, comment b, p 118.

Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">It is, I think, clear that the new employee sign-off sheet was not a complete integration. It was in terms addressed to new employees, persons who perforce would not have entered into prior oral agreements with Montgomery Ward. The sign-off sheet did not purport to supersede any prior agreement, oral or written.

Also, requiring Scholz to work on Sunday was not \"fair and equitable\u201d under all the circumstances. She could have been asked to work forty hours a year on national holidays and clearly would have agreed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">The majority concludes \"as a <em>matter of law, </em>plaintiff and Montgomery Ward later reached a <em>mutual </em>understanding with regard to termination through the sign-off sheet.\u201d Ante, p 93.

The statement in <em>Toussaint, </em>quoted in <em>Dell, </em>spoke of a \"company policy of requiring <em>prospective </em>employees to acknowledge that they served at the will or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>pleasure of the company . . . <em>Toussaint, supra, </em>p 612. (Emphasis added.) Scholz was not a \"prospective employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">In <em>Toussaint, </em>this Court said, and later, in <em>Valentine v General American Credit, Inc, </em>420 Mich 256, 258; 362 NW2d 628 (1984), repeated that employment is at will absent another agreement, and that a contract of employment may properly so expressly provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Modification of an employment contract is in general subject to the same rules of law applicable to the modification of other contracts. These rules of law, the product of experience, seek to achieve a reasoned balance between competing values and policies and to protect and enforce the true agreement. There are no special rules of law designed to lighten the burden on an employer who seeks to modify an express oral agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Affirming the jury verdict that Scholz was wrongfully discharged would not negate an employer\u2019s power to negotiate for modification of a prior oral just- or good-cause contract, or, as here, a contract that no work will be required on Sunday.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Employers have full freedom of contract and managerial control. When, however, they enter into an agreement with an employee, they give up something as does any person who enters into a contract. Presumably employers who enter into agreements with their employees hope to obtain, and probably generally do obtain, something worthwhile in return.__</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Employers, insurers, banks, credit card companies, and others have a need for standardized agreements.
