First, whether plaintiffs have actions for breach of contract on the basis that they were informed of a particular compensation system upon entering defendant\u2019s work force, and the system was subsequently changed. A subissue is whether those plaintiffs who were promised the policy would remain in force \"forever\u201d have actions for breach of contract. The second question is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>whether plaintiffs can maintain claims for unjust enrichment against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">We hold that the Court of Appeals improperly determined that plaintiffs could maintain actions against defendant for breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Therefore, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">In the instant case, approximately 180 plaintiffs are suing the Auto Club Insurance Association. Plaintiffs are current and past members of defendant\u2019s insurance sales force.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">Upon commencing employment, all plaintiffs were informed that they would be paid under the \"Accrued Commission Plan.\u201d Under the commission plan, they would receive seven percent<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> commissions on insurance policies sold and upon policy renewals. The commission amounts were tied to policy premiums. Also, for the first year of employment, new salespersons received a base salary to supplant renewal commissions which were unavailable during the first year. All sales employees were on the same compensation system with regard to the seven percent commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">Early in 1977, defendant realized a substantial drop in its cash reserves and decided to address the problem. In the wake of analyses by defendant\u2019s outside accounting firm, defendant concluded that the payment system for the commissioned sales force was a major contributor to its cash reserve problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">On December 2, 1977, defendant notified its sales force in writing of its intent to change the compensation plan. Instead of commissions based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>on a percentage of the premiums, salespersons would be paid a flat rate for each policy sold. Though the new plan was implemented by January 1, 1978, during the period from January to July, defendant adjusted compensation so that no employees would experience a reduction in income unless their volume of business fell. The new \"unit commission plan\u201d became fully effective July 1, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">On February 8, 1978, a union was certified to represent defendant\u2019s sales force. The union filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board in May of 1978, alleging unfair labor practices by defendant in unilaterally changing the commission system and refusing to bargain with the union. In August, 1979, the board ruled in favor of defendant, finding that the plan was instituted before the union was certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">On May 26, 1983, plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Wayne Circuit Court, alleging breach of contract, violations of the Civil Rights Act, fraud and misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, and promissory estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">On January 10, 1984, pursuant to a motion for summary disposition filed by defendant in July of 1983, the circuit court dismissed claims based on new policies, or renewals based on those policies, purchased after the date of the change in payment plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">On January 18, 1984, plaintiffs filed a motion for rehearing which was denied on February 29, 1984. Subsequently, plaintiffs\u2019 application for interlocutory appeal was denied by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">On August 19, 1986, the trial court ruled on motions for partial summary disposition filed by defendant and plaintiffs respectively. For the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>pose of clarity, the court divided plaintiffs into three groups:</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\"><em>Group a </em>consisted ,of 139 plaintiffs who were informed of the. seven percent commission system upon being hired. This group was not promised that the payment system would be in place for any particular duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\"><em>Group b </em>consisted of twenty plaintiffs who were told by defendant prior to or at the time of hiring that the seven percent commission plan would last \"forever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\"><em>Group c </em>consisted of twenty plaintiffs. Group c began employment with the same understanding as Group a, but after they began work they were told by defendant that the seven percent plan would last \"forever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">With regard to Group a, the court determined that no claim for breach of contract existed and granted summary disposition for defendant. The court reasoned that defendant did not foreclose its right to change its compensation plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">With regard to Group b, the trial court decided a factual issue existed regarding whether the word \"forever\u201d created an enforceable promise not to change the payment plan. However, the court dismissed the claims on the basis of the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">With regard to Group c, the court granted summary disposition for defendant because the oral promise subsequent to hiring lacked consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">The court also dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claims of fraud, misrepresentation, promissory estoppel, age discrimination, and unjust enrichment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">On October 3, 1986, the trial court entered the final order regarding summary disposition. Plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>tiffs appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary disposition regarding the breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims. <em>Dumas v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>168 Mich App 619; 425 NW2d 480 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Defendant appealed, and this Court held <em>Dumas </em>in abeyance pending decisions in <em>In re Certified Question, Bankey v Storer Broadcasting Co, </em>432 Mich 438; 443 NW2d 112 (1989), and <em>Bullock v Automobile Club of Michigan, </em>432 Mich 472; 444 NW2d 114 (1989). On May 4, 1990, subsequent to the issuance of opinions in those cases, this Court granted leave to appeal. 434 Mich 911 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">The first question to be addressed is whether plaintiffs can maintain claims for breach of contract where defendant unilaterally altered the terms upon which plaintiffs were compensated. Plaintiffs do not challenge the new system with regard to new policies purchased after the date of the change. Plaintiffs only challenge the system as it applies to renewals of old policies purchased before the change in compensation plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">A. GROUP A</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">Group a was informed of the seven percent commission at the time of hiring, but defendant made no explicit promises to plaintiffs regarding the duration of the policy. In framing the breach of contract action with regard to Group A, it is important to note that because no express promises of permanency were made to plaintiffs, any contractual rights to that effect had to spring from the \"legitimate expectations\u201d leg of <em>Toussaint v Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Michigan, </em>408 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>579, 598; 292 NW2d 880 (1980).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the threshold inquiry for Group a should be whether to extend the \"legitimate expectations\u201d leg of <em>Toussaint </em>beyond wrongful discharge disputes to cover an employer\u2019s compensation policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We choose not to extend the \"legitimate expectations\u201d cause of action to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">In <em>Toussaint, </em>this Court held that a company\u2019s written policy statements providing for dismissal for just cause may create contractual obligations if the statements give rise in the employee to legitimate expectations of dismissal for just cause. In <em>Toussaint, </em>this Court found that the plaintiff\u2019s wrongful discharge claim based on written policy statements and express oral statements could be submitted to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">While <em>Toussaint </em>created a \"legitimate expectations\u201d claim in the wrongful-discharge setting, earlier cases held that written policy statements could give rise to contractual obligations outside the discharge context.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although some of the cases dealt with compensation policies, those policies created contract rights with regard to <em>deferred </em>compensation. As Justice Ryan stated in his dissent in <em>Toussaint, supra, </em>p 648:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>In each of the cases cited, policy statements by the employer announced the existence of bonus, profit-sharing or pension benefits and the employer or the claimant-employee satisfied the burden of proof that <em>work already performed was in consideration of the announced bene\u00f1t and that what was sought was merely deferred compensation. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">In other words, a change in a compensation policy which affects vested rights already accrued may give rise to a cause of action in contract. <em>In re Certi\u00f1ed Question, supra, </em>p 457, n 17. However, in the instant case, there were no representations made to plaintiffs with regard to deferred compensation. The right to renewal commissions depends on the contract between the agent and insurance company. <em>Stevenson v Brotherhoods Mutual Benefit, </em>317 Mich 575, 580; 27 NW2d 104 (1947). Unless otherwise provided by contract, renewal commissions or future commissions do not rest upon the sale of the original policy. Renewal contracts are separate from the originals, in part requiring additional effort and consideration by salespersons in keeping policies alive. <em>Id. </em>at 581. In the instant case, plaintiffs do not contend that their contracts provided for the vesting of renewal commissions upon the sale of original policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">In fact, each of the cases cited in n 5 operate under traditional contract principles. For instance, in <em>Cain v Allen Electric &amp; Equipment Co, </em>346 Mich 568, 579-580; 78 NW2d 296 (1956), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-7\">In short, the adoption of the described policies by the company constituted an offer of a contract. This offer . . . \"the plaintiff accepted ... by continuing in its employment beyond the 5-year period specified in exhibit b . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>While the deferred compensation cases are subject to contract law, the \"legitimate expectations\u201d doctrine of <em>Toussaint </em>does not follow traditional contract analysis. Therefore, it does not logically follow that <em>Toussaint </em>should be extended to the area of compensation. Also, since employees\u2019 accrued benefits are protected by the presence of traditional contract remedies, there is no need to extend the expectations rationale to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">In addition to the lack of precedent extending <em>Toussaint </em>to facts similar to those presented here, policy considerations weigh in favor of containing <em>Toussaint </em>to the wrongful-discharge scenario. Were we to extend the legitimate-expectations claim to every area governed by company policy, then each time a policy change took place contract rights would be called into question. The fear of courting litigation would result in a substantial impairment of a company\u2019s operations and its ability to formulate policy. Justice Griffin\u2019s majority opinion in <em>In re Certified Question, supra, </em>p 456, discussed the nature of a business policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-6\">In other words, a \"policy\u201d is commonly understood to be a flexible framework for operational guidance, not a perpetually binding contractual obligation. In the modern economic climate, the operating policies of a business enterprise must be adaptable and responsive to change.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Our opinion in <em>In re Certified Question </em>was in furtherance of this Court\u2019s traditional reluctance to limit or second guess the decision-making ability of business management. As stated in <em>In re Butterfield Estate, </em>418 Mich 241, 255; 341 NW2d 453 (1983), \"[a] court should be most reluctant to interfere with the business judgment and discretion of directors in the conduct of corporate affairs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Much the same conclusion was reached by Justice Griffin in <em>Bullock v Automobile Club of Michigan, supra, </em>pp 521-522:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-5\">Even if it can be said that policy considerations were sufficient to justify the <em>Toussaint </em>intervention to protect job security, it is difficult to imagine the scope of difficulties and mischief that would be encountered if <em>Toussaint </em>were to be extended beyond wrongful discharge into every facet of the employment relationship. Particularly in light of the enormous potential cost to the system that such an extension would entail, including damage to the delicate balance of the employee-employer relationship, I take this occasion to express the view that it would be prudent and wise to leave to the Legislature the public policy decision whether, or to what extent, <em>Toussaint </em>should be extended beyond wrongful discharge. [Griffin, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Given the traditional reluctance of courts to interfere with management decisions and the needed flexibility of businesses to change their policies to respond to changing economic circumstances, we conclude that <em>Toussaint </em>should not be extended to create legitimate expectations of a permanent compensation plan. Previous cases have not extended the legitimate-expectations theory to facts similar to these, and we decline the opportunity to extend the theory to compensation terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">B. GROUP B</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">Members of Group b claim they were told before or at the time of hiring that they would receive seven percent commissions \"forever\u201d on policies sold. Group B plaintiffs argue that defendant breached the express terms of their employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>contracts by changing the payment system to award a flat rate upon the sale of each renewal policy. We disagree. We find the claimed promise by defendant that the seven percent renewal commissions would last \"forever\u201d to be unenforceable under the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The relevant section of the statute of frauds, MCL 566.132(a); MSA 26.922(a), provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-6\">In the following cases an agreement, contract or promise shall be void, unless that agreement, contract, or promise, or a note or memorandum thereof is in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith, or by a person authorized by him:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-7\">(a) An agreement that, by its terms, is not to be performed within 1 year from the making thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">To determine whether an agreement comes within this section, the proper inquiry is whether the contract is capable of performance within one year of the agreement. This Court discussed the rule in <em>Smalley v Mitchell, </em>110 Mich 650, 652; 68 NW 978 (1896):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-9\">The mere fact that the contract may or may not be performed within the year does not bring it within the statute. The rule is that if, by any possibility, it is capable of being completed within a year, it is not within the statute .... [See also <em>Fothergill v McKay Press, </em>361 Mich 666; 106 NW2d 215 (1960).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">In <em>Drummey v Henry, </em>115 Mich App 107; 320 NW2d 309 (1982), the plaintiff sued the defendant for sales commissions allegedly owed under an oral employment contract. The defendant countered that any such agreement could not be performed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>within one year and was unenforceable under the statute of frauds. The trial court directed a verdict for the defendant on the basis of the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The Court of Appeals reversed, finding that the record was devoid of evidence showing that the agreement could not be performed within one year. The Court stated that it was possible, though unlikely, that the plaintiff would have made sales within the first year. Thus, the contract was capable of performance within one year and outside the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Defendant argues that <em>McLaughlin v Ford Motor Co, </em>269 F2d 120 (CA 6, 1959), controls this case. In <em>McLaughlin, </em>the plaintiff was promised by the defendant that after he worked for one year in the cost department, he would be offered a position in general management. Th\u00e9 plaintiff began working several days after the oral agreement was reached. After working for more than three years, and without being offered a general management position, the plaintiff was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">The plaintiff sued the defendant for failing to uphold its promise, and, subsequently, the jury found for the defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the agreement was invalid under the statute of frauds. The court reasoned that the parol agreement was invalid because the plaintiff could not have become a general manager until more than one year had elapsed from the time of the agreement. The agreement was not capable of performance within one year. Thus, the agreement was barred by the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">In the instant case, the Court of Appeals distinguished <em>McLaughlin </em>\"because plaintiffs [in Dumas] were not seeking to enforce a promise that they would receive the renewal commissions. Instead, plaintiffs sought to enforce a promise that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>commissions would be paid as long as plaintiffs were employed by defendant.\u201d 168 Mich App 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">However, we are not persuaded by the Court of Appeals attempt to distinguish <em>McLaughlin. </em>We find that plaintiffs were seeking to enforce the payment of seven percent renewal commissions as long as they were employed by defendant. Similar to <em>McLaughlin </em>where the plaintiff sued to enforce the agreement with regard to the general management position, in the present case plaintiffs sued to enforce agreements encompassing promised renewal commissions which could not accrue until more than one year from the time of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Nor are we persuaded by Justice Levin\u2019s argument that <em>McLaughlin </em>is distinguishable from the present case because <em>McLaughlin </em>involves a contract for a definite term. Justice Levin states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-7\">The <em>Hodge [v Evans Financial Corp, </em>262 US App DC 151; 823 F2d 559 (1987)] court addressed the kind of contract considered in <em>McLaughlin, </em>and in the three Michigan cases on which <em>McLaughlin </em>relied, when it said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-8\">\"Under the conventional view of the statute, an oral employment contract for a stated, definite term of years exceeding one year (like those alleged in <em>Prouty </em>[v <em>Nat\u2019l R Passenger Corp, </em>572 F Supp 200 (D DC, 1983)] and <em>Gebhard [v GAF Corp, </em>59 FRD 504 (DC, 1973)]) is unenforceable on the rationale that the employee\u2019s possible death within one year would 'defeat\u2019 rather than 'complete\u2019 the express terms of the contract.\u201d <em>[Post, </em>p 612.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">However, the contract in <em>McLaughlin </em>was clearly not one for a definite term. In <em>McLaughlin, </em>the plaintiff signed an employment agreement providing \" 'I understand that my employment is not for any definite term and may be terminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>at any time 269 F2d 123. Furthermore, the court stated that \"[i]t will be noticed that the oral contract does not provide for a specified period of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">We can certainly agree with Justice Levin that a contract for an indefinite term has traditionally been considered capable of performance within the first year. Thus, employment contracts for indefinite terms are generally outside the statute. We can also agree that the contracts involved in the instant case were of indefinite duration. However, we do not hold, as Justice Levin suggests <em>(post, </em>pp 574-575), that each plaintiff\u2019s entire employment contract is unenforceable under the statute of frauds. We simply find that the asserted promises of seven percent renewal commissions \"forever\u201d are unenforceable. Furthermore, the dissent does not focus on the kind of promise at issue in this case. In the <em>Hodge </em>case relied on by the dissent, the primary issue was whether the plaintiff was wrongfully discharged. Thus, the focus was on the duration of the entire employment contract. The instant case differs from <em>Hodge </em>because the primary focus is on one term of the entire employment contract that plaintiffs are entitled to seven percent renewal commissions permanently. The dispute here is not over duration of an entire employment contract; nor is it over an employee\u2019s discharge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>In Michigan, if the terms of a contract are not severable, and part of a contract is within and part is outside the statute of frauds, the entire contract is unenforceable. Where a portion of a contract within the statute of frauds is severable from a part of the contract outside the statute, the severable portion alone will be rendered unenforceable. <em>Cassidy v Kraft-Phenix Cheese Corp, </em>285 Mich 426; 280 NW 814 (1938); 73 Am Jur 2d, Statute of Frauds, \u00a7 523, p 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">In <em>City of Lansing v Lansing Twp, </em>356 Mich 641, 658; 97 NW2d 804 (1959), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-6\">As a general rule, a contract is entire when, by its terms, nature and purpose, it contemplates that each and all of its parts are interdependent and common to one another and to the consideration, and is severable when, in its nature and purpose, it is susceptible of division and apportionment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-7\">The singleness or apportionability of the consideration appears to be the principal test. The ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>tion is ordinarily determined by inquiring whether the contract embraces one or more subject matters, whether the obligation is due at the same time to the same person, and whether the consideration is entire or apportioned. If the consideration to be paid is single and entire, the contract must be held to be entire, although the subject thereof may consist of several distinct and wholly independent items.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">In <em>Stevenson v Brotherhoods Mutual Benefit, </em>312 Mich 81, 88; 19 NW2d 494 (1945), the Court found that the plaintiff had been properly dismissed under a just-cause contract. The plaintiff was a field representative for the defendant insurance company, and he claimed that despite his dismissal he was entitled to commissions, including renewals, which were due at the time he was discharged. The defendant argued that the plaintiff\u2019s breach barred him from recovery of commissions because the contract was indivisible. The Court quoted from Beach on the Modern Law of Contracts, \u00a7 731, p 887:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-6\">\"A familiar and well-settled principle of the common law is that an entire contract cannot be apportioned. The good sense and reasonableness of the particular case must always guide and govern courts in determining whether a contract is divisible or entire. The question depends, to some extent, upon the intention of the parties, and this must be discovered in each case by considering the language employed and the subject matter of the contract. No precise rule can be laid down for the solution of the question. <em>When the price is expressly apportioned by the contract, or the apportionment may be implied by law, to each item to be performed, the contract will generally be held to be severable.\u201d </em>[Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">After viewing the circumstances surrounding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>agreement, the Court decided the contract was severable and the plaintiff could collect the commissions to which he was entitled at the time of his departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">In the instant case, we find the provisions affording seven percent renewal commissions to plaintiffs severable from the remainder of the employment contracts. The agreements between the parties were that plaintiffs would receive a seven percent commission on each renewal of an old policy. The consideration for each renewal can be clearly and easily apportioned \u2014 for each policy successfully renewed by an employee, the employee is paid seven percent of the premium. There is no problem apportioning the consideration with regard to promised renewal commissions, and the nature of the contracts are such that they are \"susceptible of division and apportionment.\u201d <em>City of Lansingsupra </em>at 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">We find the claimed promise that Group b would remain under the then-existing compensation plan \"forever\u201d fits squarely within the statute of frauds and is unenforceable. Members of Group b were allegedly promised before or at the time of hiring that seven percent renewals would last \"forever.\u201d Under the \"Accrued Commission Plan,\u201d the renewal commissions could not vest before one year had elapsed from the time of hiring. The agreement with regard to renewals was not capable of performance within one year because it was not possible for renewal commissions to accrue until after the first year. Thus, any promise that the renewal commission plan would last \"forever\u201d is unenforceable under the statute of frauds.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Plaintiffs argue that the doctrine of part performance removes the agreement from the statute of frauds. The doctrine is explained in <em>Guzorek v Williams, </em>300 Mich 633, 638-639; 2 NW2d 796 (1942):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-5\">If one party to an oral contract, in reliance upon the contract, has performed his obligation thereunder so that it would be a fraud upon him to allow the other party to repudiate the contract, by interposing the statute, equity will regard the contract as removed from the operation of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">However, in support of their argument that part performance removes the case from the statute, plaintiffs only cite cases involving land. No cases are offered which apply the doctrine in an employment context.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">In <em>Oxley v Ralston Purina Co, </em>349 F2d 328, 332 (CA 6, 1965), the court stated that \"[t]he doctrine of part performance has historically been applied only to contracts involving the sale of land . . . .\u201d Citing 3 Williston, Contracts (3d ed), \u00a7 533, p 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">In <em>Ordon v Johnson, </em>346 Mich 38, 46; 77 NW2d 377 (1956), quoting Pomeroy, Specific Performance (3d ed), \u00a7 100, p 241, it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-9\">\"The clause relating to contracts not to be performed within a year from the making thereof, seems by its very terms, to prevent any validating effect of part performance upon all agreements embraced within it. As the prohibition relates not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>to the subject matter, nor to the nature of the undertaking, but to the <em>time of the performance itself, </em>it seems impossible for any part performance to alter the relations of the parties, by rendering the contract one which, by its terms, may be performed within the year.\u201d [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">We find the doctrine of part performance to be inapplicable to this case. Plaintiffs offer no support that the doctrine applies to the situation presented by this case other than cases involving land. Furthermore, past decisions of this Court have declined to recognize that the part performance doctrine operates to remove a contract from the statute of frauds section concerning contracts not to be performed within a year. <em>Ordon v Johnson, supra; Whipple v Parker, </em>29 Mich 369 (1874).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, we decline to apply the part performance doctrine to the facts of this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">There being no enforceable agreement that plaintiffs would be paid a seven percent commission \"forever,\u201d members of Group b find themselves in the same position as members of Group <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>A, and we have already determined that members of Group a cannot maintain actions for breach of contract against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">c. group c</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Members of Group c claim they were told at some point after they were hired that they would receive seven percent commissions \"forever.\u201d Group c plaintiffs also argue that defendant breached the express terms of their employment contracts by changing the payment system to award a flat rate upon the sale of each renewal policy. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">When analyzing employment contracts, it is important to keep in mind that parties begin the relationship with complete freedom. <em>Toussaint, supra, </em>p 600. An employer retains its managerial powers and prerogatives unless they are limited by contract. As Justice Griffin stated in <em>Bullock, supra, </em>pp 519-520, \"[a]n employer\u2019s intention to give up permanently a right so fundamental as the ability to make changes in its method of compensation is not to be lightly inferred.\u201d (Griffin, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.)</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">Our inquiry must focus on the intent of the parties and whether they intended to bind themselves to a seven percent renewal commission permanently. In deciding whether mutual assent existed to permanently freeze the renewal commission, we employ an objective test, \"looking to the expressed words of the parties and their visible acts.\u201d <em>Goldman v Century Ins Co, </em>354 Mich 528, 535; 93 NW2d 240 (1958); <em>Stark v Kent Products, Inc, </em>62 Mich App 546; 233 NW2d 643 (1975). It is proper to consider the circumstances at the time the asserted contracts were made to determine the intent of the parties. <em>W J Howard &amp; Sons, Inc v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number><em>Meyer, </em>367 Mich 300; 116 NW2d 752 (1962); <em>Miller v Stevens, </em>224 Mich 626; 195 NW 481 (1923). This is especially true in oral contracts where the parol evidence rule does not impair consideration of extrinsic facts. <em>Redinger v Standard Oil Co, </em>6 Mich App 74; 148 NW2d 225 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Upon reviewing the circumstances of the alleged promises to Group c, we find as a matter of law that mutual assent was lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">At the time of hiring, members of Group c were in the same position as members of Group a. No promises were made regarding the duration of the commission plan, yet plaintiffs in both Groups a and c accepted employment. Group c alleges that after accepting employment, defendant made extraordinary contractual promises that the commission system would be in place \"forever.\u201d However, it is not at all clear from the statements allegedly made to members of Group c that defendant intended to bargain away its right to change the method of compensation. The meaning of the statements could be interpreted in several ways falling short of a contractual commitment. The statements could have been intended to bolster morale and enhance employee pride in the company. It is also possible the statements were merely stated opinions of management representatives that the company would not change its commission rate. Another possible interpretation is that the statements were designed as assurances by management that in the foreseeable future, there were no rate changes planned.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Whether the statements rise to contractual obligations depends on the context and circumstances in which the statements were made. In analyzing the parties\u2019 intent, we note that the record does not reflect that any negotiations took place between plaintiffs and defendant. All indications are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>that the comments were isolated. Also, we find the term \"forever\u201d is inherently vague. If the parties had negotiated the duration of the compensation plan, it is unlikely they would have characterized the agreement with such a precatory expression. Furthermore, in the employment context, this Court has been reluctant to accept terms which connote permanent or lifetime employment at face value. In <em>Lynas v Maxwell </em>Farms, 279 Mich 684; 273 NW 315 (1937), the Court determined that absent distinguishing features or consideration in addition to services to be performed, a contract for permanent employment should be interpreted to be terminable at the will of either party. Although <em>Lynas </em>deals with discharge as opposed to compensation terms, a contract which forever restricts an employer\u2019s right to change compensation has the same effect of permanently tying an employer\u2019s hands on a term of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">We note that nothing was offered by plaintiffs in addition to their continued employment that would reasonably prompt defendant to make such extraordinary contractual commitments.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We are persuaded that it defies logic to believe that defendant would intend to bind itself to a specified renewal commission on the basis of isolated statements when plaintiffs had already accepted employment without the benefit of durational guarantees with regard to compensation. It also defies logic that defendant would enter into these commitments after, as opposed to before, being hired. It is more reasonable to believe that defendant would legally obligate itself to such a promise before hiring in order to attract an employee or induce acceptance of employment. In the case of Group c, we can perceive no manifest reason for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>defendant to offer a permanently fixed rate on renewals.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">We also find it relevant to our inquiry into mutual assent to examine the changes in the compensation and commission system with regard to sales representatives in the years leading up to the employment of plaintiffs. In 1940, defendant adopted a seven percent commission for all representatives.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In 1958, the commission for out-state salespersons was changed to seven and one-half percent. From 1962 to 1976, most salespersons were hired pursuant to the \"Accrued Commission Plan,\u201d which is the system applicable to this case. In 1963, a merit commission plan was adopted which allowed a salesperson to earn more or less than seven percent on the basis of the individual\u2019s productivity. This plan was discontinued after nine months. In 1964, defendant established a high-risk insurance company, but rather than base commissions on the higher premiums, defendant paid commissions on the basis of the lower premiums of the standard company. However, this plan was discontinued after a short while. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, defendant made several changes in its compensation and commission plan for membership sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">These changes made throughout the years suggest that it is unlikely that defendant would permanently guarantee a particular renewal policy. The numerous recent fluctuations show the company\u2019s changing compensation program and demonstrate that it was unreasonable for members of Group c to maintain any belief that their commission plan was to be locked in permanently. For these reasons, we find that in objectively reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>the circumstances of this case, there was no mutual assent to establish seven percent renewal commissions permanently. We are persuaded that defendant did not intend to bargain away its right to make adjustments in its compensation plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Plaintiffs allege that defendant was unjustly enriched as a result of changing compensation plans. The trial court disagreed and granted summary disposition for defendant. The Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">The Court of Appeals described the basis of an unjust enrichment claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-8\">The process of imposing a \"contract-in-law\u201d or a quasi-contract to prevent unjust enrichment is an activity which should be approached with some caution. The essential elements of such a claim are: (1) receipt of a benefit by the defendant from the plaintiff and, (2) which benefit it is inequitable that the defendant retain. [168 Mich App 638.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">With regard to Groups a and c, since we have determined that defendant had the right to impose a new compensation plan, we find that defendant, as a matter of law, was not unjustly enriched. Defendant simply exercised its prerogative to change compensation. With regard to members of Group b, the statute of frauds does not bar the assertion of an unjust enrichment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">The Restatement Restitution, \u00a7 1, comment c, p 13, states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-11\"><em>Unjust retention of bene\u00f1t. </em>Even where a person has received a benefit from another, he is liable to pay therefor only if the circumstances of its receipt or retention are such that, as between the two persons, it is unjust for him to retain it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>In <em>Hollowell v Career Decisions, Inc, </em>100 Mich App 561; 298 NW2d 915 (1980), the plaintiff sued the defendant for unjust enrichment after she was terminated from her job of vice president of an employment agency.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Court ruled that summary judgment in favor of the defendant was proper under GCR 1963, 117.2(3)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> because the plaintiff failed to offer any proof that the defendant benefited from her services, and she \"failed to offer any proof to indicate that the value of the services she performed exceeded the compensation she received.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">In the instant case, we find that there is no genuine issue of material fact with regard to the unjust enrichment issue and that members of Group b may not maintain actions for unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Under the circumstances presented, no evidence suggests that defendant has <em>unjustly </em>benefited by the change in compensation policies. There is no dispute that a worsening financial condition within the company prompted the decision to change compensation plans. Continued significant decreases in the reserves of the business threatened availability of insurance funds. Also, the plaintiffs were well informed of the compensation policies in force at any given time, and there is no evidence to indicate that plaintiffs were not paid for any sale of a membership or policy. Furthermore, plaintiffs have offered no proof which would support a finding that the value of the services they performed exceeded the compensation received in return.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">The dissent states</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>the sales representatives are entitled to recover the reasonable value of their services in building the books of business <em>if </em>the promise to pay a seven percent commission on policy renewals of old sales was in part a promise to pay deferred compensation for making the new sale. <em>[Post, </em>pp 622-623. Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Plaintiffs do not argue that the renewals were a form of deferred compensation which vested at the time of the original sale. In fact, it is undisputed that to earn renewal commissions, plaintiffs had to continue to service and renew their policies.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Given the good-faith actions of the company, the fact that plaintiffs were always compensated for their sales, the lack of evidence suggesting that the compensation was not in line with the services, and the absence of an agreement providing that renewals are a form of deferred compensation, we find that defendant was not unjustly enriched by the change in the policy. We note further that there is no factual basis supporting plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that defendant confiscated and diminished the value of their books of business.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">As a matter of law, we would hold that plaintiffs are unable to bring actions against defendant for breach of contract. With regard to Group a, there were no express contracts that plaintiffs would \"forever\u201d be entitled to seven percent renewal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>commissions, and we decline to extend the legitimate-expectations theory beyond the wrongful-discharge context. Any promise made to members of Group b was unenforceable under the statute of frauds because the asserted agreement regarding renewal compensation was not capable of performance within one year. With regard to members of Group c, we find that the circumstances demonstrate that no mutual assent was reached on the permanency of the commission plan with respect to renewals.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Finally, we would hold that defendant was not unjustly enriched by virtue of changing its compensation scheme. The change was within the proper realm of its managerial powers with regard to members of Groups A and c. With regard to Group b, the record lacks evidence which would support a claim for unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b797-7\">Brickley and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b773-11\"> Salespersons located outside the metropolitan Detroit area received 7.5 percent commissions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b775-13\"> This appeal only concerns the claims of breach of contract and unjust enrichment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b777-7\"> Plaintiffs assert that Group a received the same oral promises as Group b.

There is a difference, however, between bonus or compensation terms pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>able after one year, as in <em>White Lighting, </em>and renewal commissions payable after one year. At the end of a year, the work which entitles an employee to a bonus is complete. However, in the instant case, it cannot be said that at the end of the first year, plaintiffs had completed work which legally entitled them to renewals without additional service. See <em>id., </em>p 344, n 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">Another case cited for the proposition in <em>Hodge </em>is <em>Miller v Riata Cadillac Co, </em>517 SW2d 773 (Tex, 1974). In <em>Miller, </em>the employee was to be paid an annual bonus. The court found the statute of frauds did not bar enforcement of the contract. However, the court also noted that the bonus could have been ascertained and paid within one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">Furthermore, there are cases which hold that a bonus payable after one year is void under the statute of frauds. In <em>Dickinson v Auto Center Mfg Co, </em>594 F2d 523 (CA 5, 1979), the plaintiff was hired under an oral contract providing for permanent employment. The plaintiff was promised a stock bonus to be given one year and four months after the contract was made. The court determined that the contract could not be performed within one year and was unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">In ED <em>Lacey Mills, Inc </em>v <em>Keith, </em>183 Ga App 357; 359 SE2d 148 (1987), the defendants were promised annual bonuses consisting of a percentage of profits. The court decided the promise of a bonus was not to be performed within a year of the agreement, thus it was unenforceable under the statute of frauds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b787-7\"> The dissent argues that even if the contracts for permanent seven percent renewals would be invalid for lack of a written agreement, defendant admitted in court documents that it \" 'paid a seven percent commission on new sales and policy renewals.\u2019 \u201d <em>Post, </em>p 618. Thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>dissent argues the written admissions remove the agreements from the statute of frauds. However, just because defendant admitted it promised to pay a seven percent commission on renewals is not to say that defendant admitted that the seven percent system would be permanent. The crux of the dispute is whether the seven percent renewals were permanent terms. Clearly, defendant\u2019s statement that it \" 'paid a seven percent commission on new sales and policy renewals\u2019 \u201d does not amount to an admission of permanency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b789-7\"> Nonetheless, Michigan cases do permit recovery under the theory of quantum meruit where a party has performed and conferred a benefit on another party under a contract within the statute of frauds. <em>Whipple, supra; Fuller v Rice, </em>52 Mich 435; 18 NW 204 (1884); <em>Smith v Chase &amp; Baker Piano Mfg Co, </em>185 Mich 313; 151 NW 1025 (1915).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b789-8\"> Courts applying Michigan law have recognized exceptions to the one-year provision on the basis of theories other than part performance: <em>Reeck v Caloy Corp, </em>329 Mich 453; 45 NW2d 349 (1951) (substantial consideration given); <em>Pursell v Wolverine-Pentronix, </em>44 Mich App 416; 205 NW2d 504 (1973) (equitable estoppel); <em>McMath v Ford Motor Co, </em>77 Mich App 721; 259 NW2d 140 (1977) (promissory estoppel); <em>Rowe v Noren Pattern &amp; Foundry Co, </em>91 Mich App 254; 283 NW2d 713 (1979) (equitable estoppel); <em>McLaughlin, supra </em>(consideration separate and apart from performance); <em>Oxley, supra </em>(equitable estoppel).

This is no more than most employees concerned with building a career hope to achieve. To allow a jury to find on these facts a term limiting termination only to just cause would substitute for the presumptive employment-at-will term a dismissal-for-cause rule in every employment arrangement in which predictions of a rosy future were made to prospective employees. <em>Cummings v Kelling Nut Co, </em>368 Pa 448; 84 A2d 323 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 commission claims, properly analyzed, assert an irrevocable right to renewal commissions on automobile insurance arising in the context of an employment-at-will relationship,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> on the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>of a promise to pay seven percent (Group a) and a promise to pay seven percent \"forever\u201d (Groups b and c).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">For the reasons stated by Justice Riley in Rowe,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>1 would hold that plaintiffs in Group A have not alleged circumstances that would permit the factfinder to conclude that the offer of specific compensation would continue for the duration of employment (or beyond).

Even if this characterization is correct, it ought logically to follow that if renewals of old sales were intended to be a form of deferred compensation, they would be payable regardless of termination. The promises alleged are indefinite, not only in the sense that there is no durational term for renewals of \"old sales,\u201d but also because there are two possible constructions of the duration of \"renewal of old sales\u201d claim \u2014 renewals of old sales as long as employed \u2014 and renewals of old sales whether employed or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">As observed in the concurrence in Rowe, even under the Uniform Commercial Code\u2019s liberalized requirements of definiteness in relation to commercial contract formation, there must be a manifest intention to make a contract and a reasonably certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy.

Thus, again assuming that a promise of compensation for a durational term would be enforceable, summary disposition might have been appropriate if there was a basis for the factfinder to draw an inference that the parties expected that a prevailing commercial practice obtained.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> None has been advanced.

On the record, briefs, and argument submitted here, it is entirely speculative that trade usage or other rules of construction assist in supplying omitted durational terms or as bearing on the parties\u2019 intent. Nor, of course, can speculation that representations were made to plaintiffs with regard to \"deferred compensation,\u201d <em>post, </em>p 600, create a jury submissible issue regarding the parties\u2019 intent. Unlike the benefit cases noted in Justice Ryan\u2019s dissent in <em>Toussaint v Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Michigan, </em>408 Mich 579, 648; 292 NW2d 880 (1980), in which the employer or the claimant employee \"satisfied the burden of proof that work already performed was in consideration of the announced benefit and that what was sought was merely deferred compensation,\u201d plaintiffs do not characterize their claims as \"deferred compensation,\u201d nor do they contend they have fully performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Viewed in a light most favorable to plaintiffs, we are left with the precatory term \"forever\u201d appended to descriptions of the compensation system, with the fact that the persons making such statements were sales managers and that the state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>ments were made, in some cases, in response to concerns that commissions were low.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">In order to give legal effect to these claims, we would have to conclude that a missing term central to the intent of the parties could be inferred by the factfinder, i.e., that the method of compensation would never be changed. We would, in effect, be allowing the factfinder to determine that, despite the fact that the defendant retained the right to discharge these employees when it hired them, it nonetheless intended to assume the risk of a drop in its cash reserves.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Both the Restatement and the ucc express a preference for finding an enforceable obligation and preventing an evasion of obligation by resort to a claim of indefiniteness. Restatement Contracts, 2d, \u00a7 33(b); UCC 2-204(3). Under both the Code and Restatement, however, the parties must intend to contract, and there must be a reasonably certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy. Calamari &amp; Perillo, Contracts (3d ed), \u00a7 2-9, p 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">In this case, there is neither an objective manifestation that the employer was making a commitment that amounted to a promise nor a reasonably certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy. Aside from the precatory term \"forever,\u201d there is simply no objective indication that overcomes the presumption that there was no durational term for compensation with respect to future renewals.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">In <em>Toussaint, supra </em>at 613, the Court expressly recognized a nonpromissory basis of \"a situation 'instinct with an obligation\u2019 \u201d distinct from and independent of contract analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Most recently, in <em>In re Certified Question, Ban-key v Storer Broadcasting Co, </em>432 Mich 438; 443 NW2d 112 (1989), we unanimously reaffirmed the principle that it is socially desirable to recognize the enforceability of personnel policies. In doing so, we explicitly acknowledged that policy considerations extraneous to the contract-as-promise analysis, such as stability and consistency in the work environment, were the judicial premises underlying the legitimate-expectations prong of <em>Toussaint.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">In this case, plaintiffs rely principally on a promissory theory of liability. Thus, we are not faced with ''[t]he crucial, difficult question facing the courts in the modern cases . . . not whether to choose unilateral or bilateral contract analysis, but whether to employ any contractual analysis at all.\u201d Pettit, <em>Modern unilateral contracts, </em>63 Boston U L E 551, 575 (1983). Because plaintiffs assert a promissory claim, we deal with the principles of individual autonomy on which the law of private contract is based, and focus on the promissory basis of the asserted obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">As Professor Pettit observes,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-9\">Any assessment ... of the appropriateness of modern judicial use of unilateral contract theory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>must focus on the promissory basis of the asserted obligation .... Are courts imposing liability because of words or actions of the defendant manifesting an intention to make a commitment, or are they using unilateral contract as a device to enforce obligations arising from some sense of community standards? ... If the defendant\u2019s commitment-making actions do not predominate, unilateral contract is an inappropriate rationalization that allows judges to avoid confronting their true motivations. <em>[Id., </em>pp 576-577.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Thus, unless there is a nonpromissory basis for imposing an employer obligation,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> analysis of unilateral contract claims in implied-in-fact employment cases must begin with the question whether the words or action of the defendant manifested an intention to make a commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">In the absence of a viable unjust enrichment claim, of promissory estoppel, of bad faith, or a public policy ground for a different result, we have no basis on this record to permit a jury to impose promissory liability on the defendant.

The signers of the lead opinion <em>misstate the issue.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Further, they decide this case on the basis of an <em>issue not briefed, </em>the sufficiency of the evidence. Moreover, although the motion for summary disposition did not <em>\"specifically </em>identify,\u201d as provided in the court rule, as an issue the sufficiency of the evidence, they affirm the trial court\u2019s order granting summary disposition on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">The <em>incorrect description </em>is that the forty sales representatives testified to a \"vague and precatory promise\u201d that \"the seven percent commission system\u201d \"would last 'forever.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">The affidavit filed by the attorney for the Auto Club in support of its motion for summary disposition did not indicate whether all forty \u2014 or only one, or more than one \u2014 sales representative actually used the word \"forever\u201d or \"always\u201d to describe the durational term of the promise to pay renewal commissions. Because the depositions themselves were not filed, this Court is unable to determine the context in which the words \"forever\u201d or \"always\u201d were used. The signers of the lead and concurring opinions, nevertheless, state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>that <em>all forty sales representatives </em>claim the \u201cdefendant made extraordinary contractual promises that the commission system would be in place 'forever.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">\n<em>An even-handed summarization of the attorney\u2019s affidavit?</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>30</em>\n</footnotemark>\n<em> would recognize that perhaps only one, or only a handful, of the sales representatives may have used the word \"forever\u201d to describe the durational term.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">It was the obligation of the Auto Club to state carefully in the affidavit relied on to support its motion for summary disposition the deposition testimony of the sales representatives. It is most unlikely that all forty sales representatives said \"for as long as they were employed by the Auto Club,\u201d and <em>also </em>\u201cforever,\u201d and <em>also </em>\"always.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">This Court cannot, on the basis of this affidavit, properly portray these forty plaintiffs\u2019 deposition testimony as making a claim that they have not made, a claim that possibly only one sales representative may have expressed on deposition, that the promise was to pay on renewals \u201cforever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">The <em>incorrect assumption </em>is that the Auto Club\u2019s promise to pay \"a 7% commission on new sales and policy renewals\u201d did not, as a matter of law, express a durational term<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> for the Auto Club\u2019s promise to pay a seven percent commission on \"policy renewals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Contrary to the assumption made by the signers of the lead and concurring opinions, the words \"policy renewals\u201d may reasonably be interpreted by the promisee, the sales representative,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> as implicitly stating a durational term, namely, for as long as the Auto Club and the customer choose to renew the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">The policy renewal time frame for a particular customer is readily determinable. The period during which the Auto Club may choose to extend an offer to renew a policy, and the customer may choose to accept the offer, is the time frame for that renewal. The renewal time frame for a customer is for however long the Auto Club and the customer continue to do business on a renewal basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">Because the trier of fact could, absent other evidence, appropriately find that a promise to pay commissions on \"policy renewals\u201d might be reasonably interpreted and understood by the promisee as having that meaning,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> it is not, and should not be, determinative whether the sales representatives recall being told that renewal commissions would be paid on policy renewals \"for as long as they were employed by the Auto Club,\u201d or \"forever,\u201d or \"always.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">I ask the majority_</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>\u2014What does the term \"policy renewals\u201d mean if not \"an insurance policy issued when a customer accepts an insurer\u2019s offer to renew the policy\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">\u2014What does a promise to pay a seven percent commission on policy renewals mean \u2014 absent other evidence, such as a course of performance limiting the duration to the time that the sales representative remains in the employ \u2014 if not \"a promise to pay a seven percent commission on policy renewals for as long as the insurer and the customer choose to renew an earlier policy\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">The sales representatives do not claim \u2014 as the majority incorrectly states<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> \u2014 that a seven percent commission would be payable \"forever\u201d or that a seven percent commission would be payable on a policy renewal written after a sales representative left the employ of the Auto Club.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">The sales representatives recognize that they were expected to continue to provide service in respect to renewals and, accordingly, that no renewal commissions would be payable after a sales representative left the employ of the Auto Club. It further appears that the Auto Club \u2014 which paid a seven percent commission on policy renewals for over twenty-five years \u2014 did not pay any commission on policy renewals written after a sales representative left the employ of the Auto Club.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">The trier of fact could reasonably find that a promise to pay a renewal commission for \"as long as\u201d the insurer and the customer choose to renew the policy and the sales representative remains in the employ of the insurer, states a durational term. The contract formed when an offer making such a promise is accepted provides a means of determining the period of time during which the insurer is obliged to pay renewal commissions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>namely, the period during which the insurer offers to renew, the customer accepts the offer, and \u2014 on the basis of the other testimonial evidence and the course of performance \u2014 the sales representative remains in the employ of the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The duration of the contract is, therefore, determinable, and sufficiently definite, although it is uncertain how long the insurer will offer to renew, the customer will choose to renew, and the sales representative will remain in the employ of the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">The lead opinion <em>misstates the issue, </em>and in so doing builds on the incorrect assumption that there is not a durational term for the conceded promise to pay a seven percent commission on policy renewals.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">The signers of the lead opinion state that \"because no express promises of permanency<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> were made to [the Group a] plaintiffs, any contractual rights to that effect had to spring from the 'legitimate expectations\u2019 leg of <em>Toussaint </em>. . . .\u201d They then state that the \"threshold inquiry\u201d is \"whether to extend the 'legitimate expectations\u2019 leg of <em>Toussaint </em>beyond wrongful discharge disputes to cover an employer\u2019s compensation policy.

The source of the legitimate expectations, in the instant case, is an express promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The signers of the lead opinion confuse interpretation and implication. The central issue in this case is interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Interpretation of an express promise does not convert the express promise into an implied promise.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> In this case, there was an express promise concerning compensation and, in particular, concerning compensation on policy renewals. The central issue presented concerns the interpretation and meaning of the express promise to pay seven percent on policy renewals.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">A premise of the majority\u2019s conclusion is that because the Auto Club\u2019s promise concerns compensation, and the resulting contract is an employment contract rather than, say, a contract for the sale of goods, the employer will be deemed, at least where the contract of employment is oral, to have reserved the right to change the compensation unless the employer explicitly stated, when entering into an oral contract of employment, that it does <em>not </em>reserve the right to do so._</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>The majority does not cite any authority for this proposition, or explain when it became a feature of the law of contracts that a promise is not enforceable unless the promisor not only promises to act in a certain manner, but additionally promises that he will not unilaterally change or renege on the commitment.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Management does not, even having in mind \"the needed flexibility of businesses to change their policies to respond to changing economic circumstances,\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> have the prerogative of reneging on a contract, whether oral or written.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">The rules of contract construction are the same for written and oral contracts. The judicial preference for writings is understandable. They are tidier and, when well thought through and drafted, may make <em>our </em>task easier. The plethora of litigation over the meaning of writings suggests, however, that the course of performance, like circumstantial evidence, is sometimes the bearer of truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">Be that as it may, if the Auto Club had promised <em>in writing </em>that it would pay \"a 7% commission on new sales and policy renewals,\u201d it might be clear to the majority, as it is to me, that unless the Auto Club expressly reserved the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>unilaterally terminate the obligation to pay a seven percent commission on renewal of policies written before the announcement of a change in compensation, the Auto Club was not at liberty unilaterally to modify the compensation payable on renewals of policies written before the announcement of the change in <em>future </em>compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">This Court rules against the claims of the sales representatives in part because of an asserted insufficiency in their proofs.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The Auto Club, did not, however, in its motion for summary disposition, \"specifically identify\u201d as an \"issue,\u201d as provided by the court rule,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> that the sales representatives could not proffer at trial sufficient evidence in support of their pleaded allegation that they were promised that a seven percent commission would be paid \"on each renewal that they wrote during their entire employment.\u201d_</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>The motion for summary disposition asserted, rather, that one hundred thirty-nine of the one hundred seventy-nine sales representatives had stated on deposition that they had not been told or informed by the Auto Club that they would receive a seven percent renewal commission \" 'for as long as they were employed by the Auto Club,\u2019 \u201d or \" 'forever,\u2019 \u201d or \" 'always,\u2019 \u201d or \" 'any words to that effect.\u2019 \u201d Seven, it was asserted, \"gave contradictory and/or unclear answers,\u201d whether they were so informed, fourteen testified that they were so told before they were hired, and twenty testified that they were so told after they were hired.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">A court may properly grant summary disposition, on the basis that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, only where there has been \"a complete failure of proof concerning an <em>essential element </em>of the nonmoving party\u2019s case.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Establishing that the sales representatives had been \" <em>'told, or otherwise informed </em>by the Auto Club\u2019 \u201d that the seven percent renewal commission would be paid either \" 'for as long as they were employed by the Auto Club,\u2019 \u201d or \" 'forever,\u2019 \u201d or \" 'always,\u2019 \u201d or \" 'any words to that effect,\u2019 \u201d <em>was not an \"essential element\u201d </em>of the sales representatives\u2019 case. The sales representatives, whether in Group a, b or c5l could establish the alleged durational term \u2014 \"each renewal that they wrote during their <em>entire employment\u201d </em>\u2014 by other evidence such as the testimony of other sales representatives or persons, such as present or former employees of the Auto Club, or the course of performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">That the Auto Club did not \"specifically identify\u201d the sufficiency of the evidence in its motion for summary disposition, is borne out by an exami<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>nation of the brief filed by the Auto Club in this Court, which does not argue the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The brief,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> following the pattern of the motion for summary disposition, argued, rather, that the claim of the Group a sales representatives must fail because they had acknowledged they had not been told or informed of a durational term, and the claim of the Group b sales representatives must fail, not because of insufficiency in the evidence of a promised durational term, but rather because enforcement of the promise was barred by the statute of frauds, and the claim of the Group c sales representatives must fail, not because of insufficiency in the evidence of a promised durational term, but, rather, because the Group c sales representatives claimed that they were told or informed of the durational term after they were hired, and there was a \"lack of any consideration beyond the pre-existing cooperation and loyalty those plaintiffs had already committed to perform.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">A majority of the Court does not find against the claims of the one hundred thirty-nine representatives comprising Group a <em>solely </em>on the basis that they were not so told and informed. Nor is there a majority for finding against the claims of the Group b sales representatives on the basis that their claim is barred by the statute of frauds, or for finding against the claims of the Group c sales representatives on the basis of lack of consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">None of the justices find against the claims of the Group c sales representatives solely on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>basis sought by the Auto Club, either in its motion for summary disposition or in its brief filed in this Court. Indeed, none of the justices rule against the claims of the Group c sales representatives solely on the basis of lack of consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">All the justices comprising the majority rule against the claims of the Group c sales representatives on the basis that there is not sufficient evidence to support their claim that they were promised a seven percent commission on policy renewals \"that they wrote during their entire employment.\u201d Lack of \"special consideration\u201d for the asserted post-hiring promise was only one of the factors, not the sole factor considered by the majority. The majority rule, in effect, and correctly so, that lack of consideration or special consideration would not alone justify dismissal of a claim relying on an express promise, even one made after hiring.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">The fourth and fifth votes for reversal of the Court of Appeals, those of the Chief Justice and Justice Boyle, reject the claims of all the sales representatives on the basis of insufficiency of the evidence without regard to whether they are in Group a, b, or c, an issue that the Auto Club neither \"specifically identified\u201d in its motion for summary disposition nor argued in its brief in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">In <em>McCart v J Walter Thompson USA, Inc, </em>437 Mich 109, 116; 469 NW2d 284 (1991), this Court ruled in favor of an employer, in part because the plaintiff had \"failed to carry his burden under MCR 2.116(G)(4),\u201d providing that when a motion is filed asserting that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, \"an adverse party may not rest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>upon the mere allegations or denials of his or her pleading, but must, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">The same MCR 2.116(G)(4) further provides, however, that \"[a] <em>motion </em>[for summary disposition asserting that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact] <em>must speci\u00f1cally identify the issues </em>as to which the moving party believes there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The Auto Club\u2019s motion was carefully crafted to advert only to those \"factual\u201d matters about which there could be no dispute. The motion repeated what the sales representatives had stated on deposition in response to only one inquiry: whether they had been \"told or informed\u201d about a durational term for the promise to pay a seven percent commission on renewals, and, if so, whether this was at the time of hiring or thereafter.

Justice Boyle proceeds on the assumption that the contracts provided for employment at will and did not include a term regarding termination only for just cause.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>The eighth amended complaint alleged, however, that the contracts of employment with the sales representatives provided that they could be dismissed only for just cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-5\">7.

[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The Auto Club\u2019s motion for summary disposition did not seek to controvert the allegation of a just-cause contract, or assert that there was no factual support for the claim of a just-cause contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">The Auto Club asserted, rather, in the accompanying memorandum of law, as the last of four specifically identified reasons, that \"even <em>if </em>the claims of all of the plaintiffs are treated as arising under some integrated 'just cause\u2019 employment contract, their claims <em>are barred by collateral estoppel. \u201d </em>The memorandum further asserted that the nlrb finding<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> that the change in the compensation system was motivated by legitimate business considerations <em>collaterally estopped </em>the sales representatives from asserting their claims. Later in the memorandum of law, the Auto Club again expressly avoided controverting, on a factual basis, the allegation in the amended complaint that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>employment was not at will but, rather, was governed by just-cause contracts.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">The sales representatives were obliged to set forth, \"by affidavits or otherwise,\u201d specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> only with regard to the four reasons specifically identified, none of which related to whether the employment contracts were <em>factually </em>just-cause contracts, or at-will contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The central issue in the instant case, and in <em>Rowe, </em>is the same, namely, whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the particular case, may Mary Rowe in <em>Rowe, </em>and the sales representatives, in the instant case, maintain actions for breach of an express contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">That issue turns on whether there is sufficient evidence to justify a finding by the trier of fact that a reasonable person in the position of the employee-promisee in concluding that the employer-promisor intended, in the case of Mary Rowe, to provide employment not terminable at will, but only for cause,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> or, in the case of the sales representatives, to pay a seven percent commission on renewals written while, and for as long as, they remained in the employ of the Auto Club.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-8\">[A] party\u2019s intention will be held to be what a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>reasonable man in the position of the other party would conclude his manifestation to mean. [Calamari &amp; Perillo, Contracts (3d ed), \u00a7 2-2, p 27.][<footnotemark>53</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The test is, thus, objective, focusing on what a reasonable person in the position of the employeepromisee would understand. The subjective intent of the employer-promisor is not relevant, except insofar as a reasonable person in the position of the employee-promisee was, or possibly should have been, aware of the employer-promisor\u2019s subjective intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">The signers of the lead and concurring opinions clearly err in focusing on whether the Auto Club actually \"intended to bargain away its right to change the method of compensation,\u201d and in deciding whether there was \"mutual assent\u201d based on their assessment of the Auto Club\u2019s intent.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AQ9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">A number of the sales representatives asserted, in responses to interrogatories propounded by the Auto Club, that when they were employed they were told they should build books of business so that in later years they would earn a seven percent commission on policy renewals. Similar claims were advanced by sales representatives in <em>Bullock v Automobile Club of Michigan, </em>432 Mich 472; 444 NW2d 114 (1989), and <em>Farrell v Automo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number><em>bile Club of Michigan (On Remand), </em>187 Mich App 220; 466 NW2d 298 (1991).<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Bullock alleged that he was promised lifetime employment, and that \" 'if he worked hard and built up his \"book of business,\u201d he would be able to earn large sums of money\u2019 \u201d and \" 'enjoy his later working years with [the Automobile Club] by realizing commissions from the book of business\u2019 \u201d based on the seven percent commission.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> In <em>Bullock, supra, </em>p 485, this Court, in an opinion signed by Justices Boyle, Bkickley, Cavanagh and Archer, ruled that Bullock had \"pled an action for a breach of an oral contract of employment alleged to have arisen at the commencement of his employment.\u201d I concurred in a separate opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Farrell similarly claimed that his branch manager \"had informed him at the time he was hired that his responsibility was to sell some insurance and to make his 'book\u2019 of insurance grow. According to plaintiff, [the branch manager] told him at the time of his hiring that he need only handle his book of business, sell some insurance and he would be set financially for the rest of his life if he worked at it for three or four years.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>One of the plaintiff sales representatives asserted, in response to interrogatories propounded by the Auto Club, that he observed at the time he was hired that the seven percent commission was about half that paid by other insurers, and he was told that while the seven percent commission might not seem much at the time, as the years go by the number of his accounts would grow so that seven percent would begin to pyramid to provide him a very comfortable living and lifestyle as long as he worked hard and continued to increase the volume of customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Some sales representatives did better than others. One, employed by the Auto Club for over thirty years, claimed, in responding to the interrogatories, that he had 8,000 to 9,000 accounts. Six sales representatives, employed for over twenty years, claimed that they had 5,000 or more accounts. Seven claimed that they had 4,000 to 4,800 accounts. Twenty-four that they had 3,000 to 3,900 accounts. Thirty-nine that they had 2,000 to 2,900 accounts, and the balance claimed that they had less than 2,000 accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">The Auto Club has not denied the allegations in the complaint, as supplemented by the answers to interrogatories, that the sales representatives were encouraged to build books of business and were told that they would be rewarded for their efforts by earning a seven percent commission on policy renewals.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">The Auto Club contends, rather, that because it had been advised by its accountants that it was no longer economically advisable or good business to pay a seven percent commission on new sales and policy renewals, that it could not only revise the commission system so that it would no longer be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>obliged to pay a seven percent commission on new sales, but could also refuse to pay a seven percent commission on policy renewals of old sales to those sales representatives who had built up their books of business <em>beyond less than 2,000 to 3,000, 4,000, or 5,000 or more accounts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">The Auto Club states, on brief without supporting affidavit, that its position is justified because it never told the sales representatives that the \"commission paid could never be changed or would never change.\u201d A number of sales representatives asserted, however, in their <em>answers to the interrogatories, </em>that that is precisely what they were told. That dispute frames an issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">The factual dispute whether particular sales representatives were told that the commission to be paid on policy renewals of prior sales would not be changed cannot properly be resolved against the claims of the sales representatives who so assert without a trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">The signers of the lead opinion find as a fact that \"there were no representations made to plaintiffs with regard to deferred compensation.\u201d They further find as a fact that \"renewal commissions or future commissions do not rest upon the sale of the original policy,\u201d but rather require \"additional effort and consideration by salespersons in keeping policies alive.\u201d They assert and find that, unless otherwise <em>agreed </em>\u2014 ignoring <em>that the sales representatives assert that it was otherwise agreed </em>\u2014 the right to renewal commissions does not \"rest upon the sale of the original policy.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>A number of sales representatives do assert that representations were made to them that they would benefit from building books of business and that they would thereby earn commissions on policy renewal of old sales. Because this case has not been tried, the record is incomplete whether less effort may be required to obtain a policy renewal of an old sale than to prospect for new sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">It may very well be that little or no \"additional effort\u201d need be exerted by a sales representative to obtain a policy renewal where the customer sends a check promptly after receipt of a bill for a renewal from the Auto Club. In such cases, a renewal commission might, contrary to the assertion of the majority, be a form of deferred compensation. Renewal commissions may also be a form of deferred compensation in those cases where some additional effort, although less than that of prospecting for a new sale, is required to earn the renewal commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">In all events, the questions whether representations were, in fact, made to plaintiffs with regard to deferred compensation, and whether renewal commissions are in part deferred compensation, depend on the agreement of the parties, and cannot be decided as a matter of law without a trial on the merits. The majority\u2019s analysis begs the question whether the correct construction of the oral contracts of employment between the Auto Club and the sales representatives permitted the Auto Club to change or eliminate the seven percent commission it had agreed to pay on policy renewals of old sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The course of performance for over twenty-five years would appear to support a finding that renewal commissions were <em>not </em>payable on policies renewed after a sales representative ceased to be an employee of the Auto Club.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Forty sales representatives testified on deposition that they were told or informed, before or after they were hired, that they would receive a seven percent commission on renewals, <em>either \"for as long as they were employed by the Auto Club,\u201d or </em>\"forever,\u201d or \"always.\u201d Their testimony, together with the other evidence set forth in the responses to the interrogatories propounded by the Auto Club, and the evidence of the course of performance for over twenty-five years, would appear to be sufficient to permit the trier of fact to conclude, were the majority to allow this case to go to trial, that the Auto Club\u2019s conceded promise to pay a seven percent commission on policy renewals was a promise, as set forth in the complaint, to pay all one hundred seventy-nine sales representatives a seven percent commission \"on each renewal that they wrote during their <em>entire employment.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">The majority holds, in effect, that because the course of performance \u2014 indicating that the promise to pay a seven percent commission applied to renewals while the sales representative remained in the employ of the Auto Club but did not apply to renewals after he ceased to be employed by the Auto Club \u2014 was not stated to all potential sales representatives when they were interviewed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>hired, the course of performance is not a part of the contract of employment.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">\"Course of performance\u201d is the context, the circumstances, in which a promise is made, and is generally established by evidence, often oral, separate and apart from evidence of the promissory exchange and manifestations. The enforceability of the oral employment contracts does not depend on whether the promisor explicitly stated the course of performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Usage is compelling evidence concerning not only the obligations of the sales representatives, but also the durational term of the Auto Club\u2019s promise to pay a seven percent commission on policy renewal of old sales. Further, it is well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>established that terms will be implied as part of the agreement of the parties where necessary to give business efficacy to a promise in a contract.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Professor Farnsworth stated that \"[c]ourts have often supplied a term calling for best efforts under exclusive dealing agreements,\u201d as in <em>Wood v Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, </em>222 NY 88; 118 NE 214 (1917). Farnsworth explained that since Lady Duff-Gordon\u2019s \"remuneration depended entirely on [Wood\u2019s] efforts, the court supplied a term requiring that Wood use his best efforts to sell her fashions.\u201d Farnsworth continues that \"[c]ourts also supply terms requiring best efforts under percentage leases. ... If the lease is silent on the matter, the court will supply a term requiring the lessee to use best efforts, in addition to the normal obligation of good faith.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">This Court has implied a term requiring a lessor to supply water to a building constructed for the operation of a restaurant. <em>Stimac v Wissman, </em>342 Mich 20; 69 NW2d 151 (1955).<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Accepting as true the pleaded allegations of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>sales representatives,<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> as supplemented by the answers to the interrogatories, where an insurer, the Auto Club, promises to pay a seven percent commission on policy renewals of old sales and encourages its sales representatives to build books of business to pyramid their earnings, the trier of fact may properly find that the insurer has by implication agreed \u2014 in order to give business efficacy to the promise that induces such effort \u2014 that it will not change or eliminate the rate of commission it agreed to pay on policy <em>renewals </em>of old sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>E</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The sales representatives alleged in their complaint that they were promised they would not be disciplined or fired without just cause. The Auto Club denies the allegation of just-cause contracts, and contends that the contracts of employment are at will. The majority ignores the sales representatives\u2019 well-pleaded allegation that the Auto Club expressly agreed to just-cause contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">The correct construction of the contracts of employment does not depend, however, on whether the Auto Club expressly agreed that the sales representatives could only be discharged for good or just cause. Even if the Auto Club did not expressly so agree, when it agreed that the sales representatives would be paid a seven percent commission on policy renewals of old sales, it agreed, by implication, that the sales representatives would not be deprived, as a result of discharge from employment other than for good or just cause, of the opportunity to earn the seven percent commission on policy renewals of old sales by exerting whatever additional effort, if any, might be required to obtain such renewals.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"AKP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">I conclude that the trier of fact could properly find that</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">\u2014The term \"policy renewal\u201d means an insurance policy issued when a customer accepts an insurer\u2019s offer to renew a policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">\u2014A promise to pay a commission on policy renewals is, therefore, implicitly a promise to pay a commission on policy renewals for as long as the insurer and the customer choose to renew an earlier policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">\u2014When the Auto Club indisputably promised to pay its sales representatives a seven percent commission on policy renewals, it <em>expressly </em>promised and contracted that it would pay a seven percent commission on renewal of a policy first written before the announcement that the Auto Club would no longer pay renewal commissions, <em>for as long as the Auto Club and the customer choose to renew the policy, </em>even though a durational term for the promise was not <em>explicitly </em>stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">\u2014Because the course of performance and other evidence tends to show that a renewal commission would not be payable after a sales representative left the employ of the Auto Club, the express promise to pay a seven percent commission on policy renewals meant for \"as long as the Auto Club chooses to offer to renew the policy, the customer chooses to accept the offer, and the sales representative remains in the employ of the Auto Club.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">vi</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">The lead opinion\u2019s reference to \"the traditional reluctance of courts to interfere with management <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>decisions and the needed flexibility of businesses to change their policies to respond to changing economic circumstances\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> suggests that the construction of employment contracts is henceforth to be subject to different rules than other business contracts.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">If the correct construction of these contracts is that the Auto Club obligated itself to pay a seven percent commission on renewal after 1977 of policies sold before 1978, the Auto Club did not have a managerial prerogative to break that contract without paying damages. Nor does the \"needed flexibility of businesses to change their policies to respond to changing economic circumstances\u201d entitle the Auto Club to break a contract without paying damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">The theme of the majority<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> appears to be that, because the business community generally needs to be able to change .the compensation of employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>ees in response to changes in the business, the economy, or competition, promises respecting compensation will be construed as reserving to the employer a power to change compensation, absent compelling evidence that the employer did not intend to reserve a power to change the compensation. This theme was expressed by Justice Griffin in dissent in <em>Bullock, supra </em>at 519-520:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-5\">An employer\u2019s intention to give up permanently a right so fundamental as the ability to make changes in its method of compensation is not to be lightly inferred.[<footnotemark>68</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">While the sales representatives originally asserted in this action that the Auto Club had committed itself to pay the seven percent commission on new sales generated at any time while they remained in the employ of the Auto Club and, thus, was not at liberty to revise the compensation system, even for new sales, they no longer assert that the Auto Club agreed not to revise the commission system for new sales. They have now limited their claims to the assertion that the Auto Club was not at liberty to change the seven percent commission on renewals of policies sold before the announcement of the revised compensation system.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">The sales representatives thus no longer challenge the managerial prerogative to change the rate of compensation, except insofar as the employer promised to pay commissions on renewal of old sales. Recognition of the legitimacy of the sales representatives\u2019 claims would not, accordingly, undermine the asserted managerial prerogative to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>change compensation, except insofar as the employee expended effort in generating sales and building a book of business in the expectation that he would have the opportunity of obtaining further compensation should the customer renew the policy and continue to do business with the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Turning to the statute of frauds, the Auto Club asserts, and the signers of the lead opinion and I agree, that the employment contracts were not for a fixed term of years. Indeed, it is well established that an employment contract, other than for a fixed period of time, can be performed within one year<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> because the employee may die within the year, and does not violate the one-year statute of frauds.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">The signers of the lead opinion justify their conclusion that the agreement to pay a seven percent commission on policy renewals is within the one-year statute by severing the promise to pay a seven percent commission on new sales from the promise to pay a seven percent commission on renewals, treating the latter promise as a separate and distinct contract.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> The lead opinion then holds that this promise is within the statute because it was not \"possible for renewal commissions to <em>ac</em>crue\u201d within one year.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">The Auto Club indisputably agreed to pay \"a <em>1% </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>commission on new sales <em>and </em>policy renewals.\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> At least some part \u2014 if the case were tried, it might appear a very substantial part<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> \u2014 of the compensation for a new sale is the opportunity to earn a commission on a policy renewal. It is entirely artificial to view such an employment contract, whereunder the employer concededly agreed to pay \"a 7% commission on new sales <em>and </em>policy renewals\u201d and which the employee accepted by generating new sales and policy renewals, as constituting two separate contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">The question whether a contract can be performed within a year depends on the <em>duration of the contract, </em>and not on the time of performance of a <em>particular term </em>of the contract.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> Accordingly, the sales representatives\u2019 employment contracts\u2014 not for a fixed term, and hence not within the statute because the employee may die within the year \u2014 are not brought within the statute irrespective of whether renewal commissions could accrue within the year.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">The lead opinion relies on <em>McLaughlin v Ford Motor Co, </em>269 F2d 120 (CA 6, 1959), where the employee was allegedly promised that after he worked for one year in the cost department, he would be offered a position in general management. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit found that the action could not be maintained because, among other things, the agreement was invalid under the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>According to the lead opinion, the Court \"reasoned that the parol agreement was invalid because the plaintiff could not have become a general manager until more than one year had elapsed from the time of the agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AoR\">In <em>McLaughlin, </em>the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-4\">It is clear that the <em>oral agreement </em>in the present case provided for employment <em>to begin </em>more than a year after the making of the agreement and comes squarely within the terms of the statute. <em>Davis v Michigan Mutual Life Ins Co, </em>127 Mich 559; 86 NW 1021 [1901]; <em>Gudenau v Farm Crest Bakeries, Inc, </em>268 Mich 399; 256 NW 462 [1934]; <em>Lawton v Contract Purchase Corp, 298 </em>Mich 712, 720; 299 NW 777 [1941]. <em>[Id. </em>at 124. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">McLaughlin was allegedly told that if he accepted a job in the cost department \"for a year,\u201d he would thereafter be given a job in general management. In the Michigan cases cited by the Sixth Circuit, the employees asserted that they had entered into oral contracts of employment for <em>one year, </em>to begin at a subsequent date. Such contracts are deemed to be for a fixed term, and are covered by the statute.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> The contracts entered into by the sales representatives in the instant case, however, were not for a fixed term._</p>\n<p id=\"A4o\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">The traditional and correct analysis, adhered to by this Court<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> and courts throughout the land,<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> is set forth in a recent decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, <em>Hodge v Evans Financial Corp, </em>262 US App DC 151, 154; 823 F2d 559 (1987), where the employee claimed he had been discharged from his position as general counsel in violation of an oral contract to employ him permanently. He argued successfully that the contract was not within the statute because \"it is capable of full performance within one year if the employee were to die within the period.\u201d The court said that this \"view of the statute\u2019s applicability to lifetime or permanent employment contracts has, in fact, been accepted by an overwhelming majority of courts and commentators.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The <em>Hodge </em>court addressed the kind of contract considered in <em>McLaughlin, </em>and in the three Michigan cases on which <em>McLaughlin </em>relied, when it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-7\">Under the conventional view of the statute, an oral employment contract for a stated, definite term of years exceeding one year ... is unenforceable on the rationale that the employee\u2019s possible death within one year would \"defeat\u201d rather than \"complete\u201d the express terms of the contract.[<footnotemark>81</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">The court observed that, far from asserting the existence of a contract for a fixed term, Hodge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>employer \u2014 like the Auto Club \u2014 had consistently argued that the plaintiff \"must be deemed to be an at-will employee precisely because he was <em>not </em>promised employment for 'any fixed period of time.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 155. (Emphasis in original.)<footnotemark>82</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The employer had argued that the contract was within the statute because a letter from the employer<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> stated that the employee would receive a minimum bonus of $6,000, not payable for more than a year from the making of the contract. The court said that the letter referred only to \"a particular contract term\u201d <em>and was not pertinent to the question of the duration of employment:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-6\"><em>Courts have speci\u00f1cally and consistently held that the presence of bonus or salary terms payable after one year does not bring a long-term inde\u00f1nite employment contract within the statute. [Id. </em>at 157. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">The inquiry, then, is not whether it was \"possible for renewal commissions to accrue\u201d within one year, but whether the <em>duration of the contract </em>was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>for a fixed term of one year or more. The contracts of employment with the sales representatives were not, as the Auto Club consistently argued, for a fixed term.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">In <em>Toussaint, </em>p 612, n 24, this Court said that \"an agreement for an indefinite term is generally regarded as not being within the proscription of the statute of frauds.\u201d In <em>Rowe v Montgomery Ward, </em>p 636, this Court said that \"oral contracts for an indefinite term, <em>which fall outside the statute of frauds, </em>will be recognized only where circumstances suggest both parties intended to be bound.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>84</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">A number of courts<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> have held that an employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>ment contract that is not for a fixed term of years is enforceable although a payment obligation would not accrue until after a year had passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">In <em>White Lighting Co v Wolfson, </em>68 Cal 2d 336; 66 Cal Rptr 697; 438 P2d 345 (1968), an employee was promised a salary, benefits, and one percent of gross sales per year. The contract did not specify a durational term. The employer claimed that the contract was unenforceable because of the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">The court held that \"[s]ince . . . the alleged oral contract may be terminated at will by either party, it can, under its terms, be performed within one year.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 344. Further, although the amount of the bonus could not be determined or paid until more than one year after the time of contracting, the bonus clause, as well as the salary and benefit provisions, was enforceable. The key issue was whether the contract, <em>in its entirety, </em>could be fully performed within a year.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">The signers of the lead opinion fail to differenti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>ate between a contract that is fully performable within a year, and one that is not. Taking as true the allegations of the sales representatives, and assuming the validity of the Auto Club\u2019s contention that employment was at will, the employment contract calling for the Auto Club to pay its agents a seven percent commission on the sale of new policies and a further seven percent on renewals of those policies would be fully performed within a year should either party terminate, or any of the sales representatives die, <em>even if </em>no renewal commissions were earned.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">The Auto Club has introduced no evidence to support a finding that the sales representatives would have entered into the employment contract had it provided only for a seven percent commission on new policies sold. The agreement to pay seven percent on renewals is not a separate and independent agreement. The employment contracts must be considered in their entirety.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>The cases cited by the lead opinion for its conclusion that the contract\u2019s terms are severable are not analogous. <em>Cassidy v Kraft-Phenix Cheese Corp, </em>285 Mich 426; 280 NW 814 (1938), addressed a wholly executory contract for the sale of goods over $100, where the Uniform Commercial Code provides that part performance will take the contract out of the statute of frauds. <em>City of Lansing v Lansing Twp, </em>356 Mich 641; 97 NW2d 804 (1959), dealt not with the statute of frauds, but with apportionment of costs between the two parties to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>a written construction contract. <em>Stevenson v Brotherhoods Mutual Benefit, </em>312 Mich 81; 19 NW2d 494 (1945), dealt with a claim for post-discharge commissions under a written employment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">Even assuming that the employment contracts violated the statute of frauds because they were not in writing, they are still enforceable because the Auto Club has acknowledged, in affidavits filed in this proceeding, that the sales representatives were hired on the understanding that the Auto Club \"paid a 7% commission on new sales and policy renewals.\u201d<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> The Restatement of Contracts provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-7\">Memorandum Not Made as Such</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAU\">Except in the case of a writing evidencing a contract upon consideration of marriage, <em>the Statute may be satis\u00f1ed by a signed writing not made as a memorandum of a contract. </em>[1 Restatement, Contracts, 2d, \u00a7 133, p 345.

The sales representatives no longer question the Auto Club\u2019s right to change its compensation scheme at any time, but seek only to construe the contract so as to enforce the benefit of the bargain with respect to renewals of policies sold before the change.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">In all events, courts in Michigan and elsewhere have held, contrary to the view taken by the signers of the lead opinion, that a writing sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds need not state all the material terms of the contract, nor even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>the substance of controverted terms, but need only confirm that a contract was, in fact, made.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>F</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">While the signers of the lead opinion err in their assertion that the part performance doctrine may be applied to remove only contracts involving land from the statute of frauds,<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> Michigan case law does not appear to support the sales representatives\u2019 argument that their partial performance, through their sale of the original new policy, removes their employment contracts from the confines of the one-year provision of the statute. Although there is authority to the contrary,<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> resolution of this issue does not depend on overruling <em>Ordon v Johnson, </em>346 Mich 38; 77 NW2d 377 (1956), and establishing a part performance exception to the statute of frauds._</p>\n<p id=\"b870-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>G</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">The signers of the lead opinion state that the sales representatives cannot maintain an action to recover for unjust enrichment. They should, however, be permitted to do so if the basis of the ruling against them is that their contracts of employment were within the statute of frauds. The Restatement of Contracts provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-5\">Restitution When Contract Is Within Statute of Frauds</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-6\">A party who would otherwise have a claim in restitution under a contract is not barred from restitution for the reason that the contract is unenforceable by him because of the Statute of Frauds unless the Statute provides otherwise or its purpose would be frustrated by allowing restitution. [3 Restatement Contracts, 2d, \u00a7 375, p 219.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Illustration 1 to comment (a) indicates that an employment contract violative of the one-year statute is a contract for which a restitutionary or quasi-contract recovery is permitted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-8\">A makes an oral contract to furnish services to b that are not to be performed within a year (\u00a7 130).

SUMMARY OP ARGUMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">1. There was no breach of any contract with the Group A plaintiffs under either alternative prong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>of <em>Toussaint. First, </em>assuming a legitimate expectation theory, the plaintiffs did not demonstrate that the Auto Club\u2019s modification of its compensation policy contravened the criteria of <em>In re Certified Question. </em>The Auto Club provided \"reasonable notice of the change . . . uniformly given to affected employees.\u201d <em>In re Certified Question, </em>432 Mich at [457]. It acted in good faith for a legitimate business reason. <em>Second, </em>under an express contract approach, the Group a plaintiffs\u2019 contract claim similarly must fail. There was admittedly no durational term to their contract[<footnotemark>96</footnotemark>] and any agreement could, accordingly, be altered at will. Moreover, the Auto Club\u2019s announcement of a new compensation policy was an offer to modify any pre-existing contract which was accepted[<footnotemark>97</footnotemark>] when the plaintiffs thereafter worked pursuant to that new policy for five years before filing this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">2. There was also no breach of any contract with the Group b and c plaintiffs. If their claim is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>analyzed under a legitimate expectation approach, the result is the same as that of the Group A plaintiffs. If, instead, the Group b and c plaintiffs\u2019 claim is determined under an express contract theory, the addition of a \"forever\u201d durational term either adds nothing or, at most, only infuses their contracts with a just cause requirement for modification. Just cause was patently present here where the compensation policy change was undisputedly motivated by legitimate business reasons.[<footnotemark>98</footnotemark>] The Group b plaintiffs\u2019 contract claim should additionally be barred by the Statute of Frauds.[<footnotemark>99</footnotemark>] Any contract those plaintiffs had with respect to renewal commissions could be neither performed nor breached in the first year of their employment. Moreover, their alleged contract contemplated a duration of more than one year and, in the context <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>of employment contracts, as other courts have concluded, such an agreement must be in writing. The Group c plaintiffs\u2019 contract claim contains a further defect: lack of any consideration beyond the pre-existing cooperation and loyalty those plaintiffs had already committed to perform.[<footnotemark>100</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">3. There was no unjust enrichment as a result of the change in the compensation policy.

The contract consisted of the defendant\u2019s agreement to subscribe to the plaintiff\u2019s capital stock (not within the one-year statute of frauds), and his agreement to rent a telephone from the plaintiff for a period of three years (within the statute). The two agreements were held <em>not </em>severable: the defendant agreed to subscribe to the capital stock <em>only </em>because he wanted to obtain the telephone, and he would not have otherwise agreed to subscribe.
