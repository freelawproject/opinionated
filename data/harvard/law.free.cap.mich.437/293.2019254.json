They added that the automatic expungement of juvenile convictions \"is delusive and purposeless if law enforcement agencies may continue to use supposedly expunged records against a defendant to his prejudice. Following the <em>Jones </em>approach effectively subverts MCR 5.913.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The dissenting judge said that he believed that <em>Jones </em>represented \"the better-reasoned analysis.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The presentence investigation report outlined Smith\u2019s previous record, which included twelve juvenile entries.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Smith\u2019s lawyer indicated that the report was accurate. The sentencing judge said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>that the sentence was imposed because Smith\u2019s record included seven prior felonies and three misdemeanors, and he viewed the sentence as appropriate to punish Smith, to protect society, and to deter others from committing like offenses. The judge added that the sentence would be served concurrently with another sentence Smith was then serving.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">In <em>People v McFarlin, </em>389 Mich 557; 208 NW2d 504 (1973), this Court held that a sentencing judge could properly consider an adult offender\u2019s juvenile offense record although the Probate Code provided that a disposition of a child by a probate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>court shall not be proper evidence against the child for \"any purpose whatever\u201d in any civil, criminal, or other cause except in a case against the child under the Juveniles and Juvenile Division Chapter of the Probate Code.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">When <em>McFarlin </em>was decided, the court rules did not provide for expungement of records. In 1978, this Court adopted JCR 13,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which, as shortly thereafter amended, provided for the automatic expungement of the records of a juvenile offender if, after the seventh year following the discharge of the child from the court\u2019s jurisdiction, there has been no subsequent felony conviction.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>MCR 5.913,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the rule in effect at the time Smith was sentenced, replaced JCR 13.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Shortly after the adoption of this rule, the Legislature enacted \u00a7 18e of the Juveniles and Juvenile Division Chapter of the Probate Code.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Section 18e provides that a juvenile court judge may not set aside a conviction of a juvenile offense which if committed by an adult would be a felony for which the maximum punishment is life imprisonment, or an adjudication for a traffic offense involving the operation of a motor vehicle that is a felony or misdemeanor. Other juvenile offenses that, while serious, are not potentially life-sentence offenses (designated as \"reportable\u201d in the court rule), may be set aside by a juvenile court judge subject to the limitations of and pursuant to \u00a7 18e. Such offenses would include breaking and entering.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">While \u00a7 18e makes it a misdemeanor knowingly to use a juvenile offense that has been set aside except as permitted in \u00a7 18e(13), subsection (d) provides that a record of a conviction of a juvenile offense shall be made available \"[f]or the court\u2019s consideration in determining the sentence to be imposed upon conviction for a subsequent offense that is punishable as a felony or by imprisonment for more than 1 year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Section 18e, a legislative enactment, expresses the public policy of this state. This Court, follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>ing the enactment of \u00a7 18e, adopted MCR 5.925(E)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> in lieu of MCR 5.913, the rule extant when Smith was sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">In <em>People v Price, supra, </em>p 399, relied on by the Court of Appeals in the instant case, the Court, recognizing that the general rule reflected in <em>Mc-Farlin </em>is that a defendant\u2019s juvenile record may be considered by a sentencing judge in imposing a sentence for an adult offense, stated that this Court had \"in no uncertain terms, placed a limit on the relevance of one\u2019s past juvenile record.\u201d The Court said that \"MCR 5.913 provided an automatic mechanism by which the juvenile record of a former offender was expunged at the age of twenty-seven, the age at which an individual has been an 'adult\u2019 for purposes of criminal penalty for a period of ten years.\u201d The Court continued that \"[i]n our view, an unexpunged juvenile record may create a lifelong handicap because of the stigma it carries. We believe former MCR 5.913 was designed to remedy such a situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">In <em>People v Jones, </em>another panel of the Court of Appeals held that a juvenile record, automatically expunged at age twenty-seven, was properly included in a thirty-one-year-old defendant\u2019s presentence report. The Court said, relying on <em>Mc-Farlin, </em>that \"[m]odern sentencing policy attempts to tailor the sentence to the particular offender and the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>People v Jones, supra, </em>p 343. The Court added that \"complete information is necessary to set an individualized sentence and that rehabilitative goals would not be served by preventing a sentencing judge from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>considering information about a defendant\u2019s juvenile criminal history.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">We conclude that the <em>Jones </em>panel reached the correct result and that <em>Price </em>should no longer be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Rules calling for the \"expungement\u201d or destruction of juvenile records have been enacted or adopted in many states. Some states have enacted \"sealing\u201d statutes or have otherwise imposed restrictions that would leave juvenile records unimpaired, but would restrict their use in court proceedings.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Literature describing these rules indicates that their \"basic purpose ... is to overcome the stigma of delinquency.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> At the same time, however, these rules \"have generally been construed as not being applicable to the use of a juvenile court record for sentencing purposes. Accordingly, almost all the courts . . . have taken the position that an accused\u2019s juvenile court record may be taken into consideration by a judge in sentencing the accused for an adult offense.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">The general judicial construction of expungement statutes and rules restricting the use of a juvenile offense record indicates, by permitting the use of such offense records when sentencing a juvenile offender as an adult, that the \"stigma of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>delinquency\u201d with which the statutes and rules are concerned is the social or civil stigma, and economic disabilities that accompany a criminal record.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The purpose of the court rule, and of similar rules or statutes in other jurisdictions, is to prevent a juvenile record from becoming an obstacle to educational, social, or employment opportunities.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> When, however, a juvenile offender appears in court again as an adult, his juvenile offense record may be considered in imposing sentence. The law contemplates a differentiation in sentencing between first-time offenders and recidivists, juvenile or adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">In <em>McFarlin, supra, </em>pp 574-575, this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">If \u2014 in an effort to enforce an absolute restriction on the use of juvenile records \u2014 we were to bar all waivers of the restriction and prohibit any consideration by the sentencing judge of juvenile history,. the best and the worst sentencing risks might be indistinguishable. A judge hesitant to take risks, uncertain whether a young adult offender is a first offender, might sentence him to prison when, with complete information, he would place him on probation or sentence him under the Holmes [Youthful Trainee] Act. [MCL 762.11; MSA 28.853(11).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">The modern view of sentencing is that the sentence should be tailored to the particular circumstances of the case and the offender in an effort to balance both society\u2019s need for protection and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>interest in maximizing the offender\u2019s rehabilitative potential. ... A judge needs complete information to set a proper individualized sentence. A defendant\u2019s juvenile court history may reveal a pattern of lawbreaking and his response to previous rehabilitative efforts. This, together with information concerning underlying social or family difficulties, and a host of other facts are essential to an informed sentencing decision, especially if the offender is a young adult.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In providing, in JCR 13, adopted five years after <em>McFarlin </em>was decided and in MCR 5.913, adopted in 1985, for the automatic expungement of a juvenile offense record when the offender is twenty-seven, this Court did not intend to bar a sentencing judge from considering, when sentencing an adult offender, the offender\u2019s juvenile offense record which the Court had so recently, in <em>McFarlin, </em>authorized the judge to consider. JCR 13 simply provided that the offense record would be automatically expunged without elaborating on what ex-pungement meant. In light of the Court\u2019s recent expression in <em>McFarlin, </em>it is clear that the Court did not mean or intend that the expunged record could not be considered in sentencing the offender as an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Reversed and remanded to the Court of Appeals for consideration of the remaining issues advanced by Smith on his appeal to that Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b552-7\">Cavanagh, C.J., and Brickley, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-10\"> This Court\u2019s order granting leave to appeal limited the grant to the question stated in the accompanying text. <em>People v Smith #2, </em>434 Mich 901 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b543-11\"> <em>People v Smith, </em>181 Mich App 223; 448 NW2d 794 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b543-12\"> MCL 750.110; MSA 28.305.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">Smith was charged with breaking and entering a building with intent to commit larceny.

If it interprets that term as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>requiring the probate court to physically destroy all evidence of a juvenile record automatically once a juvenile offender has reached age twenty-seven and therefore allows use of an adjudication at sentencing only if a probation officer can discover the information from another source, then I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">If the probate court destroys all information at the age of twenty-seven, there is no secondary source unless the twenty-seven-year-old defendant has previously been convicted as an adult and the previous presentence report contained the juvenile record. Thus, for a defendant first convicted as an adult at twenty-seven, the \"secondary-source\u201d rule means that the trial judge will have no access to the probate court information which may bear on \"an informed sentencing decision,\u201d <em>People v McFarlin, </em>389 Mich 557, 575; 208 NW2d 504 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Moreover, if a sentence was imposed before the defendant was twenty-seven years old, the efficacy of the secondary-source rule depends on the likelihood of locating the source, which in turn depends on whether the defendant admits to it or if the probation officer happens to find it. Thus, for example, if a defendant was over twenty-seven at the time of conviction in Detroit and had a prior conviction at the age of twenty-four in Grand Rapids and a juvenile record there, the Detroit court\u2019s access to that information would depend on the fortuity of the defendant\u2019s revealing the fact that he had been convicted in Grand Rapids, or the officer\u2019s locating the presentence report in the Kent Circuit Court from some other source. I fail to see what interest is served by forcing the probation officer, who is charged with the duty of investigating the defendant\u2019s \"antecedents, character, and circumstances,\u201d MCL 771.14(1); MSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>28.1144(1), to conduct a circuitous search for information directly available from the probate court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The issue in this case is whether a sentencing court can use information concerning an adult offender\u2019s juvenile record when it has received such information. I agree with the lead opinion that the answer is yes. Even before the adoption of MCR 5.913, this Court determined in <em>People v McFarlin, supra </em>at 574-575, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">[t]he modern view of sentencing is that the sentence should be tailored to the particular circumstances of the case and the offender in an effort to balance both society\u2019s need for protection and its interest in maximizing the offender\u2019s rehabilitative potential. ... A judge needs complete information to set a proper individualized sentence. A defendant\u2019s juvenile court history may reveal a pattern of lawbreaking and his response to previous rehabilitative efforts. This, together with [other] information . . . [is] essential to an informed sentencing decision ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Former MCR 5.913 should not be interpreted as a limit on the sentencing court\u2019s authority to obtain information relevant to sentencing from the juvenile court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">Additionally, interpreting MCR 5.913 to permit the physical destruction of all juvenile court records, perpetuates the frequently asserted claim that the defendant is entitled to be resentenced because he was not represented by counsel and did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>not waive counsel when his juvenile offense was adjudicated. If there is no record available because of its physical destruction, the prosecutor may be unable to rebut this contention.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The apparent purposes for the automatic ex-punction provision in former MCR 5.913 were to protect the rehabilitated juvenile offender and to cure an administrative problem, i.e., the probate court\u2019s concern regarding space for its files. Where the juvenile is subsequently convicted as an adult, the first concern no longer obtains. This Court should accommodate the second concern by reading the rule to create a distinction that allows the probate court to expunge its \"files\u201d and requires it to retain some \"record\u201d of juvenile entries such as it would typically have for case control purposes. By allowing the latter to be maintained, the probate court\u2019s administrative concern regarding available space can be alleviated without infringing upon the sentencing court\u2019s interest in juvenile entries listed for an adult offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>The current court rule reflects the legislative intent evidenced in MCL 712A.18e; MSA 27.3178(598.18e) and prohibits the automatic ex-punction of any life offense, criminal traffic violation, or adjudicated \"[rjeportable juvenile offense.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> MCR 5.925(E)(2)(b). In addition, if an adjudicated \"[r]eportable juvenile offense\u201d is set aside by the probate court according to the procedures set out in MCL 712A.18e; MSA 27.3178(598.18e), the court must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">send a copy of the order to the Central Records Division of the Department of State Police and to the law enforcement agency involved in the apprehension of the juvenile .... [MCR 5.925(E)(3)(c)(i).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">MCL 712A.18e(13)(d); MSA 27.3178(598.18e)(13)(d) also requires the State Police to maintain a nonpublic record of that order and the correlative juvenile record which <em>shall </em>be made available to a court of competent jurisdiction for sentencing purposes. MCR 5.925(F) provides that when the juvenile offense record of an adult convicted of a crime is made available \"to the appropriate agency . . . the record must state whether, as to each adjudication, the juvenile had counsel or voluntarily waived counsel.\u201d When read together, it becomes evident that MCL 712A.18e; MSA 27.3178(598.18e) and the current court rule impose reporting requirements that insure that, in circumstances similar to the instant case, the sentencing court will receive information concerning an adult offender\u2019s juvenile record.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Consequently, although there is every reason a sentencing court should be allowed to consider an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>adult offender\u2019s juvenile record, too narrow an interpretation of the term \"expunge\u201d under former MCR 5.913 may preclude that result. It is in \"window cases,\u201d such as this, falling between <em>Mc-Farlin </em>and MCR 5.925, where the presence or absence of a juvenile court record is critical.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">I would hold that, while the rule permits destruction of case \"files and records,\u201d it does not permit destruction of fundamental case data, such as the nature of the proceeding, the ultimate disposition, and whether the defendant was represented by counsel or waived representation. This construction would permit the probate court to maintain its own housekeeping system without imposing a \"secondary source\u201d rule on probation officers and trial judges.</p>\n<judges id=\"b557-5\">Riley and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b557-6\">Mallett, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b554-10\"> The Court\u2019s proportionality analysis in <em>People v Milbourn, </em>435 Mich 630, 661; 461 NW2d 1 (1990), underscores the need for accurate data permitting identification whether a sentence is \"disproportionately severe or lenient.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b554-11\"> Indeed, although the people do not advance the claim, it is arguable that both this limitation and the portion of the rule allowing the probate court to direct expungement of law enforcement files are not practice and procedure and are in conflict with statutory authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b555-7\"> Although an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction is not invalid unless a term of imprisonment is imposed, <em>Scott v Illinois, </em>440 US 367; 99 S Ct 1158; 59 L Ed 2d 383 (1979), it is unclear whether a prior uncounseled juvenile adjudication is constitutionally invalid. <em>People v Covington, </em>144 Mich App 652; 376 NW2d 178 (1985), lv den 426 Mich 866 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Federal cases have held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">evidence of a standard practice or customary procedure in a particular jurisdiction can be used to establish the probable constitutional validity of a prior conviction.
