We hold that where the facts are undisputed, the determination of whether an automobile is parked in such a way as to create an unreasonable risk of bodily injury within the meaning of \u00a7 3106(l)(a) is an issue of statutory construction for the court. Summary disposition in favor of the defendant insurance company is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">On January 26, 1985, at approximately 10:00 p.m., a snowmobile traveling north along the shoulder of highway M-19 struck an unoccupied automobile. The automobile was facing oncoming traffic with its lights off. The plaintiff\u2019s husband, a passenger on the snowmobile, was killed. The snowmobile was unlawfully traveling along the shoulder of the highway. The plaintiff sought survivor\u2019s benefits through State Farm Insurance Company, her husband\u2019s no-fault insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">State Farm denied benefits, and the plaintiff sought recovery in circuit court. The court granted summary disposition in favor of the insurance company, holding that the plaintiff offered no facts to support the conclusion that the vehicle was unreasonably parked. The Court of Appeals affirmed on the ground that even if the car had been unreasonably parked, it was not in use as a motor vehicle and summary disposition, therefore, was proper.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We granted leave to appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">The issue before this Court is whether it can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>determined, as a matter of law, whether an automobile parked on the shoulder of a highway is unreasonably parked under \u00a7 3106(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">No-fault benefits, including survivors\u2019 benefits, are available for \"accidental bodily injury arising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle . . . MCL 500.3105(1); MSA 24.13105(1). Since snowmobiles are not motor vehicles for purposes of the no-fault statute,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it must be determined whether the parked vehicle was in use as a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Under \u00a7 3106 of the no-fault act, parked vehicles are declared not to be in use as motor vehicles unless one of the stated exceptions is satisfied. In this case, the plaintiff is relying on \u00a7 3106(l)(a) which allows recovery when the vehicle \"was parked in such a way as to cause unreasonable risk of the bodily injury which occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">In its decision, the Court of Appeals cited <em>Autry v Allstate Ins Co, </em>130 Mich App 585; 344 NW2d 588 (1983), which has been cast into some doubt because of this Court\u2019s ruling in <em>DiFranco v Pickard, </em>427 Mich 32; 398 NW2d 896 (1986). The <em>DiFranco </em>reasoning does not operate to create a question of fact in this case because the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>provisions involved are distinguishable on several grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">In <em>DiFranco </em>we overturned prior case law by declaring that the \"question whether the plaintiff suffered a serious impairment of body function must be submitted to the trier of fact whenever the evidence ... is such that reasonable minds could differ as to the answer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69. This rule is in opposition to the customary rule requiring the jury to decide the facts and the judge to construe the law by interpreting statutory language. While there were compelling reasons for departing from that rule in <em>DiFranco, </em>there are no such reasons for abandoning it when construing the parking exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">One of the underlying policy considerations behind the no-fault insurance legislation was to reduce the number of cases seeking damages for economic loss.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The serious impairment clause is a threshold requirement which must be satisfied before the plaintiff can recover for <em>noneconomic </em>loss such as pain and suffering; what the plaintiff seeks here is <em>economic </em>loss, specifically survivor\u2019s benefits. The policy of keeping down the number of lawsuits applies to the plaintiff\u2019s effort to recover economic loss and favors a determination as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Furthermore, the Court in <em>DiFranco </em>opined that the phrase \"serious impairment of body function\u201d was not definable and that the Court of Appeals decisions had not been successful in clarifying the definition. <em>Id. </em>at 50. In contrast, the question whether a parked vehicle creates an \"unreason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>able risk\u201d is the type of question that confronts trial courts routinely, and there is no disparity among the Court of Appeals panels in their interpretation of \u00a7 3106. Each panel addressing the issue has appropriately held that a vehicle, parked in a prudent fashion and out of the flow of trafile, does not create an unreasonable risk of injury under \u00a7 3106.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We are persuaded that it promotes judicial economy and uniformity to determine this issue as a matter of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The phrase \"serious impairment of a body function\u201d refers to a particular injury, suffered by a particular plaintiff. Accordingly, it lends itself to individualized interpretation by a jury. In contrast, the phrase \"unreasonable risk\u201d examines not the action of the actor in parking the car, but the nature of the risk to unknown third parties, who are thereby put at risk. The standard must be objective and external, and it should be. the same for all persons. It is inappropriate to allow that standard to fluctuate with the vagaries of different jury panels. The phrase need not be individualized, and we accept the parking statutes and regulations to quantify the degree of risk to be deemed \"reasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This is an area of the law where a uniform standard should be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Finally in this regard, we note that unlike the \"serious impairment\u201d standard, the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>has provided some guidance to the courts through its parking regulations. Since there are no statutory guidelines for the definition of \"serious impairment,\u201d <em>DiFranco </em>qualified its result by stating: \"Without further guidance from the Legislature, we believe that juries are better suited to resolving threshold questions where reasonable minds can differ on the answer <em>\u201d Id. </em>at 57. Because there is statutory guidance relating to proper parking techniques, the court is well suited to resolving this threshold question when the facts are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Thus, when the facts are not disputed it becomes the function of the court, as a matter of law, to determine whether any of the statutory exceptions are satisfied. Whenever a vehicle is parked, it necessarily creates a degree of risk of collision with vehicles moving in proximity. That risk, however, is the same risk that inheres to any stationary object adjacent to the roadway. Recognizing that some risk is unavoidable, and respectful of the goal of the no-fault act to provide compensation for vehicular accidents, the court must examine the parking statutes and determine whether an alleged violation endangers a class of persons intended to be protected by the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">To establish the unreasonableness of the parking in this case, the plaintiff has alleged a violation of the lighted-vehicle statute which requires vehicles parked on a highway to display their lights.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although there is some question regarding whether the vehicle did in fact violate the statute,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Court of Appeals was nevertheless correct in upholding the summary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">On the basis of these facts, even if the Court were to hold that the automobile was parked in violation of a statute, the plaintiff could not prevail because the plaintiff\u2019s decedent was not in the class of plaintiffs sought to be protected by the lighted-vehicle statute. In view of the purpose behind the lighted-vehicle statute, the plaintiff\u2019s claim of unreasonable risk by virtue of a statutory violation must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Use of the phrase \"unreasonable risk\u201d in the parking exception appears, at first blush, to create a question of fact.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But where the facts are undisputed and the complainant is relying on a violation of a statute to establish that unreasonableness, it is a question of law for the court. The definition of proper parking techniques is provided by parking statutes and local parking ordinances. The court, as a matter of law, then applies those statutes and ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">In applying the parking regulations, the court must establish that the statutory purpose doctrine is satisfied.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The court can then determine whether the statute was intended to protect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>person injured and to prevent the harm suffered. The statutory purpose doctrine remains unfulfilled on these facts. The lighted-vehicle statute was designed to protect the safety of other vehicles traveling on a roadway. This Court examined an earlier version of the lighted-vehicle statute in <em>Ballinger v </em>Smith, 328 Mich 23; 43 NW2d 49 (1950), and concluded that it was \"intended to protect traffic on the highway.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31. A passenger on a snowmobile, traveling unlawfully<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> on the shoulder of a highway, is not in the class of persons intended to be protected by the lighted-vehicle statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">We are persuaded that, by its use of the term \"unreasonable,\u201d the Legislature has allowed for this inquiry into the statutory purpose. The parking exception in the no-fault statute does not say \"unlawfully parked\u201d and, therefore, mere demonstration of a statute violation is not enough to satisfy the parking exception. There may be situations where an automobile is illegally parked, as, for example, in a handicapped parking space, but this status as an illegally parked vehicle would not be sufficient to determine that the vehicle was \"unreasonably parked\u201d for purposes of no-fault liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Finally, to establish the unreasonableness of the parking in this case, the plaintiff points to the inability of the snowmobile driver to see reflector-type taillights because the automobile was parked facing oncoming traffic. We conclude that it is not unreasonable to park a vehicle without regard to the protection of persons who may not legally be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>on the shoulder where the vehicle is parked. The trial court in this case correctly determined that the vehicle was not unreasonably parked. It was completely off the roadway, it was not impeding traffic flow, and it was plainly visible.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The trial court correctly dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">We conclude that where the facts are not in dispute, the court is to determine whether a parked automobile satisfies one of the parking exceptions to allow for the recovery of no-fault, first-party benefits for personal injury resulting from the involvement of that parked automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Although we employ different reasoning from that of the Court of Appeals, we reach the same conclusion. The vehicle was not in use as a motor vehicle for purposes of \u00a7 3105(1) because it was a parked automobile and none of the exceptions of \u00a7 3106(1) applied. Accordingly, the grant of summary disposition in favor of the defendant insurance company is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b463-8\">Boyle, J., concurred with Cavanagh, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-9\"> MCL 500.3101 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 24.13101 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b456-10\"> 178 Mich App 263, 267; 443 NW2d 396 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b456-11\"> 434 Mich 900 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b457-10\"> For purposes of the no-fault act, \"motor vehicle\u201d is defined as \"a vehicle, including a trailer, operated or designed for operation upon a public highway by power other than muscular power which has more than 2 wheels.\u201d MCL 500.3101(2)(e); MSA 24.13101(2)(e).

While finding that \"unreasonable risk\u201d (the language of the no-fault act which concerns this case) presents a question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>of law, Chief Justice Cavanagh reaffirms the majority opinion in <em>DiFranco </em>that \"serious impairment of a bodily function\u201d is a question of fact.

I agree with the lead opinion that the issue is whether the instant automobile, parked on the shoulder of the highway at the time it was struck by the snowmobile, \"was parked in such a way as to cause unreasonable risk of the bodily injury which occurred.\u201d MCL 500.31Q6(l)(a); MSA 24.13106(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">My disagreement is with the analysis that enables the lead opinion to conclude that plaintiff is not included among those persons intended to be protected by the parking statute that was allegedly violated by the automobile being parked on the shoulder of the road, without its lights on, where it was struck by the snowmobile.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">I also take exception to the lead opinion\u2019s willingness to decide the question whether \"unreasonable risk\u201d is to be decided as a question of law, rather than as a factual determination, when that issue was not presented by either of the parties to this lawsuit or given any substantive analysis by the lower courts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>I conclude that the parking statute was violated and that the plaintiff snowmobiler was within the class of persons intended to be protected by that statute. I would reverse the summary judgment and remand for a determination whether the driver parked his automobile in a manner that created an unreasonable risk in view of the inference that the violation of such statute suggests.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Although sounding in tort, the phrase \"unreasonable risk\u201d adopted by the Legislature in \u00a7 3106(l)(a) is not utilized to determine whether a particular insured was at fault for an accident involving a parked motor vehicle. Rather, it is set forth as one of the standards for determining when a parked motor vehicle should be considered as being in use \"as a motor vehicle.\u201d The definition of \"unreasonable risk\u201d is not defined within the no-fault act itself, or within any other legislation of which I am aware. Accordingly, I think it is helpful to look to the tort analogy where these words have a familiar meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Reasonableness is one of the most significant elements of the tort of negligence. As we stated in <em>Moning v Alfono, </em>400 Mich 425; 254 NW2d 759 (1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Negligence is conduct involving an <em>unreasonable risk </em>of harm. <em>[Id. </em>at 433. Emphasis in original. See also <em>Cavaliere v Adults for Kids, </em>149 Mich App 756; 386 NW2d 667 (1986).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Therefore, it would appear that conduct intended to be covered by the term \"unreasonable risk\u201d is very much akin to, if not identical with the negligence standard, and, accordingly, that standard should be controlling in our interpretation of the clause at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">In negligence jurisprudence, the violation of a statute creates an inference of negligence which the factfinder is entitled to consider in rendering its decision. See <em>Klanseck v Anderson Sales, </em>426 Mich 78; 393 NW2d 356 (1986). Because of the similarity between the standard of negligence and the phrase \"unreasonable risk,\u201d it would seem that an identical inference from the violation of a parking statute should be permitted to establish the \"unreasonable risk\u201d standard within \u00a7 3106(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">A corollary of the statutory violation inference is the statutory purpose doctrine which insures that the statutory violation has a causal relationship to the injury. See <em>Zeni v Anderson, </em>397 Mich 117; 243 NW2d 270 (1976). In a negligence action the jury instruction permitting an inference of negligence from violation of a statute, SJI2d 12.01, can be given to the jury only if the statutory purpose requirements are satisfied.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-10\">This instruction [SJI2d 12.01] should be given only if defendant or plaintiff has alleged a statutory violation as a ground for negligence, and only if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>1. the statute is intended to protect against the result of the violation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\">2. the plaintiff is within the class intended to be protected by the statute; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">3. the evidence will support a finding that the violation was a proximate contributing cause of the occurrence.

[MCL 257.694; MSA 9.2394. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">Plaintiff asserts this as part of the basis for recovery of benefits from the defendant; thus, it must be determined whether this statute is appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>cable to the circumstances of this accident.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The automobile was parked upon the shoulder of the highway rather than upon the paved portion, therefore we first decide whether the vehicle was \"upon a highway\u201d as that phrase is used in the lighted-vehicle statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The term \"highway\u201d is uniformly defined in three different provisions within the Motor Vehicle Code.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">\"Highway or street\u201d means the entire width between the boundary lines of every way publicly maintained when any part thereof is open to the use of the public for <em>purposes of vehicular travel. </em>[MCL 257.20, 257.64, 257.1501(g); MSA 9.1820, 9.1864, 9.3200(l)(g). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">This statutory definition of \"highway\u201d is broader in scope than the common understanding of that term which would be limited to the traveled or paved portion. <em>Roy v Dep\u2019t of </em>Transportation, 428 Mich 330; 408 NW2d 783 (1987). The statutory definition of the term \"roadway\u201d is closer to a lay person\u2019s belief of what constitutes a \"highway.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-9\">\"Roadway\u201d means that portion of a highway [or street] improved, designed, or ordinarily used for vehicular travel. [MCL 257.55, 257.1501(h); MSA 9.1855,9.3200(l)(h).] .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">Therefore, if the Legislature had intended the lighted-vehicle statute application to be limited to the paved portion of the highway it could have used the phrase \"upon a roadway\u201d instead of \"upon a highway.\u201d_</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>In <em>Ballinger v Smith, </em>328 Mich 23, 32; 43 NW2d 49 (1950), this Court opined that the lighted-vehicle statute should apply to a motor vehicle parked on any portion of the right of way adapted, maintained, or intended for use of vehicular traffic.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-5\">We think the statute in question here must be construed as requiring the displaying of lights, during the period specified, on a parked vehicle left on that part or portion of the right of way adapted and maintained or intended for the use of vehicular traffic in an ordinary and reasonable manner.

[See also <em>Hoopingarner v Tucker Freight Lines, Inc, </em>6 Mich App 429; 149 NW2d 219 (1967).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Therefore, in deciding when a parked vehicle is \"upon a highway,\u201d as that phrase is used in the lighted-vehicle statute, it must be determined whether that portion of the right of way where the vehicle is parked is subject to vehicular travel. If the parked vehicle is located on that portion of the right of way maintained or designed for vehicular travel, which has been extended as far as a gravel shoulder in <em>Ballinger, </em>the lighted-vehicle statute is applicable. Defendant-appellee asserts that the parked vehicle in this case could not be considered \"upon the highway\u201d because of the definition of \"shoulder\u201d enacted in 1974 PA 152, subsequent to the decisions in <em>Ballinger </em>and <em>Hoopingarner.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">\"Shoulder\u201d means that portion of the highway contiguous to the roadway generally extending the contour of the roadway, <em>not designed for vehicular travel </em>but maintained for the temporary accommodation of disabled or stopped vehicles otherwise permitted on the roadway. [MCL 257.59a; MSA 9.1859(1). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>This statutory definition of shoulder appears to state that shoulders are not designed for vehicular travel, thus not within the statutory definition of highway and in effect reversing the <em>Ballinger </em>decision. However, the Legislature also adopted a different statutory definition of \"shoulder.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">\"Shoulder\u201d means that portion of a highway on either side of the roadway which is normally snowplowed <em>for the safety and convenience of vehicular traffic. </em>[MCL 257.1501(k); MSA 9.3200(l)(k).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">These two statutory definitions of \"shoulder\u201d conflict since one states shoulders are not designed for vehicular travel while the other states they are for the safety and convenience of vehicular travel. This Court has addressed the conflict of these different statutory definitions of \"shoulder\u201d in the context of a governmental immunity case. See <em>Gregg v State Hwy Dep\u2019t, </em>435 Mich 307; 458 NW2d 619 (1990). In <em>Gregg, </em>it was held that the shoulder of a highway was intended to accommodate vehicular travel, even if only for a brief amount of time.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">At the high speeds of modern vehicles, such an endeavor often results in significant travel, \"in the ordinary sense,\u201d on the shoulder of a highway. Indeed, it seems quite extraordinary, if not fictional, to assume that vehicles do not travel on shoulders or that shoulders are not designed for vehicular travel, albeit of a temporary sort. <em>[Id. </em>at 315.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">Additionally, we noted the distinction between the statutory definition of \"roadway\u201d and \"high<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>way\u201d to support the broad interpretation to be given the term \"highway.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\">More technically, the Motor Vehicle Code is quite precise in its definitions. It defines roadway quite narrowly as \"that portion of a highway improved, designed, or ordinarily used for vehicular travel.\u201d On the other hand, it defines \"[h]ighway or street ... [as the] entire width between the boundary lines of every way publicly maintained when any part thereof is open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel.\u201d If the Legislature had intended liability for the failure to maintain safe roadways only, it seems the Legislature would have done just that. It did not. <em>[Id. </em>at 315-316. Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Therefore, from the standpoint of clear precedent and statutory development, I conclude that the phrase \"upon a highway\u201d that is used in the lighted-vehicle statute should include the entire width between the boundary lines, including the shoulder, which is subject to vehicular travel by the general public.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Since there is no factual dispute that the automobile was parked on the shoulder of the highway without its lights on, I would find that it was parked in violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Once it is determined that the lighted-vehicle statute is applicable to the motor vehicle involved in this case, it then must be decided whether plaintiff is within the class of persons intended to be protected by that statute. The lead opinion concluded that a \"passenger on a snowmobile, traveling unlawfully on the shoulder of a high<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>way,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is not in the class of persons intended to be protected by the lighted-vehicle statute.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 214. The lead opinion also states that plaintiff is not within the class of persons intended to be protected by the lighted-vehicle statute since it was \"designed to protect the safety of other vehicles traveling on a roadway,\u201d citing a quotation from <em>Ballinger </em>in support of this proposition. <em>Ante, </em>p 214. However, it concedes that the language in <em>Ballinger </em>at 31, stated that the lighted-vehicle statute was intended to protect <em>traffic </em>on the <em>highway </em>and not merely the roadway.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">The purpose of the statutory requirement that vehicles parked on a highway at night should display lights of the character specified is obvious. It was intended to protect <em>traffic </em>on the <em>highway. </em>Its application also resulted in the protection of a parked vehicle. [Emphasis added.]_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>It is apparently conceded by the lead opinion that the snowmobile must have been operated upon the highway in order to be considered as \"illegal operation\u201d of the snowmobile.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus whether the snowmobile constituted \"traffic\u201d on the highway when it collided with the automobile parked upon the shoulder of the highway is the remaining consideration for determining if the plaintiff was intended to be protected by the lighted-vehicle statute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">\"Traffic\u201d means pedestrians, ridden or herded animals, <em>vehicles, </em>street cars and other conveyances either singly or together while <em>using any highway for purposes of travel. </em>[MCL 257.69; MSA 9.1869. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Therefore, the statutory definition of traffic includes all vehicles using a highway for the purpose of travel.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, the snowmobile traveling upon the shoulder of the highway constitutes traffic \"upon a public highway\u201d because it is a vehicle being operated on the public highway for the purpose of travel. The plaintiff, a passenger upon the snowmobile which collided with the automobile parked on the shoulder of the highway, must have been intended to be protected by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>lighted-vehicle statute since he constituted traffic traveling upon the public highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">For the reasons stated above, I conclude that the statutory definition of shoulder does not preclude it from being considered a part of the \"highway,\u201d as that term was defined in <em>Ballinger </em>and <em>Gregg; </em>thus, traffic on the shoulder of a highway, including the plaintiff, may be considered as being within the class intended to be protected by the lighted-vehicle statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The final issue in interpreting the \"unreasonable risk\u201d standard concerns how to factor in the injured party\u2019s conduct that contributed to the \"bodily injury which occurred.\u201d In view of the fact that \u00a7 3106(l)(a) is not a standard to determine the fault of either party, or the comparative fault as between them, it is at this point, in my judgment, that the tort analogy breaks down.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The clear emphasis of this statutory standard is on the manner in which the vehicle is parked, not the manner in which it is struck. The question posed is whether the motor vehicle was parked in a manner that creates an <em>\"unreasonable </em>risk of the bodily injury which occurred.\u201d It is not any risk but an <em>unreasonable </em>one, and not an injury that is reasonably or unreasonably incurred but an injury that <em>did </em>occur. The tort-like determination is focused on the parking event, not the injury-causing event.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Accordingly, I would pose the question as whether the owner of the automobile parked it in a manner that created an unreasonable risk of the event that occurred, namely, being struck by a snowmobile. The answer, of course, depends on whether it was in an area of the highway that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>frequented by snowmobiles and whether, for instance, it was summer or winter.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The insured automobile, parked as it was \u2014 in the nighttime without lights activated and facing in a direction that prevented the visibility of its reflector lights\u2014 did not create an unreasonable risk of being struck by an airplane falling from the sky, but it may well have created an unreasonable risk of the very event that occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">In conclusion, I would only factor in the snowmobiler\u2019s conduct to the extent that it made what occurred unlikely or unforeseeable and thus made the parking circumstances reasonable rather than unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">It is a matter of judicial discretion whether violation of a statute is relevant to the issues involved in a particular case and whether an inference of negligence from violation of that statute is available to either party. See <em>Klanseck </em>and <em>Zeni, supra. </em>Therefore, the trial court should interpret the applicability of a particular parking statute, in light of the facts of the case presented, to determine if an inference of \"unreasonable risk\u201d should be permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Therefore, I would hold that a claim for recovery of damages, pursuant to \u00a7 3106(l)(a) of the no-fault act and based upon violation of a parking statute, would require the statutory-purpose doctrine to be initially applied by the Court for a determination whether the cited parking statute was intended to address the situation presented in that particular case. If the statutory purpose of the relevant parking statute or ordinance was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>intended to cover the particular situation or risk presented, summary disposition would be the appropriate remedy when that is the only basis for the claim under \u00a7 31Q6(l)(a). This analysis is in accord with part of the lead opinion; however, I do not feel that the granting of summary disposition was appropriate in this case in view of my conclusion that plaintiff was within the class of persons intended to be protected by the lighted-vehicle statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The determination whether \"unreasonable risk\u201d is a question of law or fact is more problematic, especially in light of our decision in <em>DiFranco v Pickard, </em>427 Mich 32; 398 NW2d 896 (1986). The Court of Appeals panel determined that the question of \"unreasonable risk\u201d in \u00a7 3106(l)(a) is a matter of statutory construction for the court when the facts are not in dispute, relying upon <em>Autry v Allstate Ins Co, </em>130 Mich App 585; 344 NW2d 588 (1983). The lead opinion adopts a similar approach regarding this issue, but attempts to distinguish between the <em>DiFranco </em>determination of \"serious impairment of body function\u201d and the determination of \"unreasonable risk\u201d predicated upon violation of a parking statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">I am not as willing as the lead opinion to render an opinion in regard to whether the determination of \"unreasonable risk\u201d in \u00a7 3106(l)(a) is a question of law or fact. The Court of Appeals relied upon the <em>Autry </em>decision for its determination in regard to this issue; however, <em>Autry </em>is of questionable precedential authority after our decision in <em>Di-Franco, </em>and the Court of Appeals in this case was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>not presented with an opportunity to address the effect of <em>DiFranco </em>on <em>Autry. </em>Additionally, this issue, including the significance of our <em>DiFranco </em>decision, has not been presented for review by us by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Therefore, on the basis of the lack of consideration and analysis of our <em>DiFranco </em>opinion by the Court of Appeals, the failure of the parties to raise this issue for review, and the lack of briefing thereon, I would not address this issue.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">I would vacate the Court of Appeals decision and reverse the findings of the trial court which held that the injury suffered by the plaintiff was not the type of harm intended to be protected by this parking statute and remand for redetermination of whether the automobile was parked in such a manner as to create an unreasonable risk of the bodily injury that occurred, in light of the inference of unreasonableness resulting from a statutory violation and in light of the statutory prohibi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>tion regarding a snowmobiler\u2019s presence on the shoulder of the highway.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b478-5\">Levin, J., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b478-6\">Mallett, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-8\"> It should be noted the Court of Appeals did not determine whether plaintiff was within the class of persons intended to be protected by the parking statute, and the trial court had merely concluded it was not convinced \"the ordinance in question was to prevent the type of injury suffered herein.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b464-9\"> The Court of Appeals stated within its opinion that the determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>tion whether an automobile \" 'was parked in such a way as to cause unreasonable risk of the bodily injury which occurred\u2019 \u201d is an issue of statutory construction for the court to resolve, when the facts are undisputed. 178 Mich App 263, 266; 443 NW2d 396 (1980). However, this determination was based upon a previous Court of Appeals decision in <em>Autry v Allstate Ins Co, </em>130 Mich App 585; 344 NW2d 588 (1983), which has been called into question after our decision in <em>DiFranco v Pickard, </em>427 Mich 32; 398 NW2d 896 (1986). This issue was not addressed by the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b465-10\"> 1 would permit the parties to raise arguments concerning the propriety of summary judgment which had not been previously presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b467-12\"> This modified the requirements of the statutory purpose doctrine as they were stated in <em>Zeni v Anderson, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b468-11\"> It should be noted that the majority asserts that it does not address the issue whether the lighted-vehicle statute is applicable to the motor vehicle involved in this accident because it was determined that the plaintiff was not a person within the class intended to be protected by the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b470-10\"> Interestingly, this definition of shoulder is located in the section of the Motor Vehicle Code which regulates the operation of a snowmobile, which was involved in the accident in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b471-8\"> Additionally, in <em>Gregg, supra </em>at 314, n 4, we cited <em>Ballinger </em>with apparent approval for requiring lamps to be displayed on a vehicle which is parked on a shoulder of a highway that was intended for the use of vehicles in an ordinary and reasonable manner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b472-7\"> We note that while a snowmobile may not be operated on the shoulder of the highway, it may be legally operated on the extreme right of the open portion of the right of way.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">A person <em>shall not operate </em>a snowmobile <em>upon a public highway . . </em>. not specifically designated for the use of snowmobiles except under the following conditions and circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">(a) A snowmobile <em>may be operated on the right of way of a public highway, </em>except a limited access highway, if it is operated at the <em>extreme right of the open portion of the right of way </em>and with the flow of traffic on the highway.
