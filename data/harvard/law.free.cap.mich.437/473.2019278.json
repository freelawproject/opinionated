The issue before the Court is whether the Michigan Tax Tribunal properly computed the true cash value of petitioner\u2019s property for the purposes of assessing ad valorem taxes for the years 1981, 1982, and 1983. We hold that although it is proper for the Michigan Tax Tribunal to take into account the value, if any, of a federal government mortgage subsidy, the tribunal and the Court of Appeals adopted a wrong principle by determining the true cash value of the subject real property under a flawed appraisal method. Thus, we reverse the decisions of the Tax Tribunal and the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the Tax Tribunal for redetermination of the true cash value of Meadowlanes\u2019 real property consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">\n<em>A. BACKGROUND AND FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">This appeal originated with petitioner-appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>lant\u2019s challenge to the real property tax assessments imposed by the City of Holland on its 22-building, 118-unit, federally subsidized housing complex for the tax years 1981 through 1983.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">In 1973, Meadowlanes purchased the housing complex from its original developer, HollandZeeland Area Nonprofit Housing Association. It paid $31,532 in cash, contributed $400,000 in equity into reserve accounts, and assumed the complex\u2019s underlying mortgage with the Michigan State Housing Development Authority (mshda), which carried a 6.35 percent interest rate and had a balance of $2,232,537. Mshda also approved a $400,000 increase in the mortgage amount so Meadowlanes would have additional funds to correct prior construction defects. Thus, Meadowlanes\u2019 total mortgage indebtedness at the time of purchase was $2,624,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The Meadowlanes housing complex was financed, built, and operates under \u00a7236 of the National Housing Act, 12 USC 1715z-l; 24 CFR 236.1 <em>et seq. </em>It also receives a rental assistance subsidy under \u00a7 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, 42 USC 1437f, for some of its units.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The rent subsidies are not at issue in this appeal. Both of these programs were designed to induce and assist developers in constructing and operating quality housing for low- and moderate-income families.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">In return for various benefits, the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>owner voluntarily entered into a regulatory agreement which subjects it to federal regulations and restrictions which include (1) a maximum return of six percent on initial equity investment in the property,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (2) rent<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>and operating restrictions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Meadowlanes property is also subject to mshda regulations because it is financed with a mshda mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The benefits that accrue to the owner of a \u00a7 236 property include: (1) federal mortgage insurance of a private, long-term (forty-year) mortgage loan in an amount not in excess of ninety percent of the FHA-determined certified cost of the project,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>(2) monthly interest reduction payments made by hud directly to the private mortgagee-lender on behalf of the mortgagor-owner for all interest due under the mortgage in excess of one percent (the \"interest subsidy\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 12 USC 1715z-l(c). The Internal Revenue Code was also amended to provide several tax benefits.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">\n<em>B. PROCEEDINGS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Meadowlanes filed a petition with the Michigan Tax Tribunal, challenging the City of Holland\u2019s assessment of the value of its housing complex for the tax years 1981 through 1983. Following an evidentiary hearing, the Michigan Tax Tribunal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>issued its opinion and judgment which determined that the true cash value of the property was $800,000 for 1981, $1,000,000 for 1982, and $1,100,000 for 1983.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In reaching its decision, the tribunal approved the valuation approach utilized by Meadowlanes\u2019 appraiser, Laurence Allen, and adopted his final estimates of true cash value for the years at issue. Allen described his valuation approach as a variant of the traditional income approach using a \"mortgage/equity\u201d component formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The city appealed the Tax Tribunal\u2019s 1984 decision raising four issues.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals rejected the city\u2019s first three arguments, but reversed on the fourth, and remanded the case to the tribunal for reconsideration and directed it to \"take into account the value, if any, of the 5.35 percent mortgage interest subsidy.\u201d 156 Mich App 238, 252; 401 NW2d 620 (1986) <em>(Meadowlanes I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">This Court denied Meadowlanes\u2019 application for leave to appeal from <em>Meadowlanes I </em>stating: \"[T]he Court [is] not persuaded that the questions presented should now be reviewed . . . .\u201d 428 Mich 866 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">On remand, the Tax Tribunal issued a supplementary judgment which once again adopted Meadowlanes\u2019 appraiser\u2019s mortgage/equity component <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>method, but recomputed the value of the mortgage component to include, rather than exclude, the value of the \u00a7236 interest subsidy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, the tribunal determined that the true cash value of the subject real property was $1,600,000 in 1981, $1,800,000 in 1982, and $1,900,000 in 1983.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">The Tax Tribunal denied the parties\u2019 motions to vacate the supplementary judgment and their motions for rehearing. Both parties then appealed in the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals affirmed the tribunal\u2019s supplementary judgment on remand.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">This Court granted Meadowlanes\u2019 application for leave to appeal from the Court of Appeals decision after remand in 176 Mich App 536; 440 NW2d 71 (1989) <em>(Meadowlanes II), </em>\"[l]imited to the issue whether, in computing the true cash value of real property, the Michigan Tax Tribunal may take into account the value, if any, of a federal government mortgage subsidy.\u201d 434 Mich 900 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"Ahy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b730-3\">This case presents issues similar to those addressed by this Court in <em>Antisdale v City of Galesburg, </em>420 Mich 265; 362 NW2d 632 (1984). Once again we must evaluate the ad valorem taxation of a federally subsidized housing complex. Before we can address the issue on which leave was granted, we must first evaluate the valuation method adopted by the Tax Tribunal and the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This approach deviates from the three traditional approaches to valuation of real property and is proper only if it is accurate and is reasonably related to the fair market value, or true cash value, of the subject real property. <em>Safran Printing Co v Detroit, </em>88 Mich App 376, 380; 276 NW2d 602 (1979); <em>Presque Isle Harbor Water Co v Presque Isle Twp, </em>130 Mich App 182, 190; 344 NW2d 285 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">After we analyze the appropriateness of the valuation approach, we must determine whether, in computing the true cash value of real property, the Tax Tribunal may rely on an approach that takes into account the value, if any, of a federal government mortgage subsidy.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">\n<em>A. APPELLATE SCOPE OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">We begin by acknowledging that appellate review of Tax Tribunal decisions, as set forth in Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28, is limited. All factual findings are final if supported by competent and substantial evidence. When fraud is not alleged, appellate courts are limited to determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>whether the tribunal made an error of law or adopted a wrong principle. <em>Antisdale, supra </em>at 277. Our review here addresses whether the tribunal committed an error of law or adopted a wrong principle by accepting a method of valuation which deviates from the three traditional approaches to value and whether it adopted a wrong principle when it adopted a valuation approach which values the interest reduction subsidy under a \u00a7 236 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">\n<em>B. APPLICABLE VALUATION PRINCIPLES</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The basic principles of valuation apply to the assessment of value of federally subsidized housing complexes in the same manner as they apply to all other real property. In this case, as in all other appeals from the Tax Tribunal, the fundamental principles concerning ad valorem taxation set out in art 9, \u00a7 3 of the Michigan Constitution provide the appropriate analytical framework.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This section mandates: (1) that the Legislature is to provide a uniform system of real property taxation, (2) that the tax must be assessed on the basis of the true cash value of the property, and (3) that the Legislature is to provide a determination of true cash value.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The Legislature complied with this constitutional mandate by enacting MCL 211.27(1); MSA 7.27(1), which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-7\">\u201d[C]ash value\u201d means the <em>usual selling price </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>the place where the property to which the term is applied is at the time of assessment, being the price that could be obtained for the property at private sale, and not at auction sale .... In determining the value, the assessor shall also consider the advantages and disadvantages of location; quality of soil; zoning; existing use; present economic income of structures .... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">As evidenced above, the Legislature has provided a broad definition of true cash value and has listed a variety of factors to be considered in the valuation determination. The Legislature did not direct that specific methods be used. Thus, the task of approving or disapproving specific valuation methods or approaches has fallen to the courts. <em>Antisdale, supra </em>at 276. This Court has acknowledged that it is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-7\">the goal of the assessment process to determine, in the abstract, the usual selling price of a given piece of property between a willing buyer and a willing seller and to develop methodologies that make it possible to achieve uniformity in making such determinations .... <em>[Washtenaw Co v State Tax Comm, </em>422 Mich 346, 363; 373 NW2d 697 (1985).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">There are three traditional methods of determining true cash value, or fair market value,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> which have been found acceptable and reliable by the Tax Tribunal and the courts. They are: (1) the cost-less-depreciation approach,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (2) the sales-com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>parison or Diarket approach,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and (3) the capitalization-of-income approach.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Variations of these approaches and entirely new methods may be useful if found to be accurate and reasonably related to the fair market value of the subject property.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Antisdale, supra </em>at 277, n 1. It is the Tax Tribunal\u2019s duty to determine which approaches are useful in providing the most accurate valuation under the individual circumstances of each case. <em>Antisdale, supra </em>at 277. Regardless of the valuation approach employed, the final value determination must represent the usual price for which the subject property would sell. <em>Safran Printing, supra </em>at 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">Under each approach, the appraiser analyzes data mathematically to determine an estimate of the fair market value of both the physical real estate and all the interests, benefits, and rights inherent in ownership of that real property.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> All three approaches should be used whenever possible, and an appraisal which disregards an approach by mere statements and without research justifying nonuse is considered incomplete.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The values derived under the various approaches are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>correlated, reconciled, and weighed in order to reach a final estimate of value.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The ultimate goal of the valuation process is a well-supported conclusion that reflects the study of all factors that influence the market value of the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">\n<em>C. VALIDITY OF THE ALLEN \"MORTGAGE/EQUITY\u201d COMPONENT APPROACH</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Before we can address the interest-subsidy question, we must first evaluate whether the Tax Tribunal and the Court of Appeals adopted a wrong principle when it decided the true cash value of the subject property could be determined by the valuation approach advocated by Meadowlanes\u2019 appraiser, Laurence Allen. We hold that the Tax Tribunal and the Court of Appeals did in fact adopt a wrong principle when they determined the true cash value of the Meadowlanes property using Allen\u2019s mortgage/equity component approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">Under this approach, two components of value, an \"equity\u201d component and a \"mortgage\u201d component, were separately calculated and then separately discounted to present value and finally added together to arrive at the true cash value of the subject property. Allen\u2019s \"mortgage/equity\u201d component method of valuation is to be distinguished from a variant used under the capitalization-of-income approach. Under the latter approach, the appraiser uses a mortgage/equity technique to develop an overall capitalization rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">There are two basic steps under the traditional capitalization-of-income approach: (1) calculate net operating income, and (2) develop an appropriate capitalization rate. True cash value is generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>derived by dividing net operating income by the capitalization rate. One method of developing an overall capitalization rate is the \"mortgage/ equity\u201d method which blends</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-4\">six factors . . . together in an algebraic formula. The factors are: (1) Holding period, a limited term of ownership before selling, refinancing or exchanging the property; (2) Equity-yield rate, the rate of return to maturity on dollars actually invested; (3) Loan term, the dollar amount of the mortgage as a percentage of the value or purchase price; (4) Loan term, length of loan in terms of years; (5) Loan interest rate; and (6) Appreciation/ depreciation, estimated percentage of possible change in property value within the projected holding period. See I. Johnson, <em>Instant Mortgage-Equity, </em>(Lexington, Mass: DC Heath &amp; Co, 1980), p 73. The six component parts are derived from the market that the property falls into .... <em>[Dowagiac Ltd Dividend Housing Ass\u2019n v Dowagiac, </em>166 Mich App 232, 239; 420 NW2d 114 (1987).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The approach described above was originally developed by L. W. Ellwood, an investment analyst, and is \"based on the theory that mortgage financing strongly influences real property prices and values\u201d; thus, this factor is considered when developing an overall capitalization rate.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Allen\u2019s \"mortgage/equity\u201d component approach does not follow the Johnson or Ellwood technique. It is not used to derive an overall capitalization rate. Instead, it separately calculates the value of the equity and mortgage components of the real property and then discounts each component separately, using different methods and rates to arrive at their present value.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Under Allen\u2019s approach, the owner\u2019s equity component is determined by adding together the pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>ent value of (1) the property\u2019s maximum allowed cash flow from operations, which Allen determined was the maximum six percent return on the owner\u2019s initial equity investment, (2) the value to the investor of tax shelter benefits, and (3) the value of the property\u2019s reversionary interests which the appraiser determined was a negative value in the instant case; thus, he subtracted the anticipated tax cost the owner would incur upon disposition of the property.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Each element of the equity component was discounted using a capitalization rate of 20.5 percent.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Under the mortgage component of his valuation approach, Meadowlanes\u2019 appraiser simply calculated the cash-equivalent value of the real property\u2019s underlying mortgage in the current mortgage paper market assuming it carried a one percent interest rate. He adjusted the mortgage balance ($2,456,207 on December 31, 1982) and derived the value of the mortgage component</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-7\">essentially ... by determining the amount of [cash] a prospective purchaser would need to invest [in a government-insured investment] as of each tax date in order to produce enough income to pay off [Meadowlanes\u2019 portion of] the mortgage .... <em>[Meadowlanes I, supra </em>at 244.][<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Using this approach, Allen concluded that the value of the mortgage component was $659,000 for 1983. Added together, the mortgage and equity components derived a true cash value for 1983 of $1,100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">The mortgage component of Allen\u2019s method is premised on the faulty notion that true cash value is not represented by the likely selling price of the subject property if a sale involves the assumption of a low-interest mortgage.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Stated otherwise, Allen discounted the value of the assumable mortgage, and assumed true cash value is determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>by the cash or cash equivalent of the likely selling price, i.e., the cash down payment and the cash equivalent value of the assumable mortgage. This approach ignores the fact that the \"touchstone of uniform assessment is the true cash value or usual selling price of the property,\u201d not the cash equivalent of that selling price. <em>CAF Investment Co v Saginaw Twp, </em>410 Mich 428, 463; 302 NW2d 164 (1981). Allen\u2019s approach, in discounting the underlying mortgage paper, also ignores the principle of leverage which recognizes that the ability to invest the smallest amount necessary of one\u2019s own funds, borrow the rest, and use the earnings from the purchased property to pay off the loan enhances the subject property\u2019s value.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Allen testified that he would not discount a new mortgage. Therefore, under his approach, if the mortgage is new, the true cash value of the real property will reasonably approximate its selling price. If the mortgage is assumed, however, the true cash value of the real property will be the equivalent of its cash down payment added to the discounted value of its underlying mortgage. We find no reason to distinguish, as Meadowlanes appraiser does, between new and assumed mortgages. Carrying Allen\u2019s approach to its logical end, the only persons required to pay ad valorem taxes predicated upon a value approaching the usual selling price of their property will be those unfortunate owners who either got new mortgages or paid cash. The resulting lack of uniformity in the assessment of real property for ad valorem tax purposes violates Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Meadowlanes\u2019 appraiser justified discounting the mortgage component by claiming it was necessary to do so to comply with this Court\u2019s decision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number><em>Washtenaw, supra. </em>In <em>Washtenaw, </em>this Court held that if market data shows the sales price of a comparable property includes both (1) the value of real property, and (2) the value of a creative or atypical financing arrangement between the buyer and the seller, then the sales price of the comparable property must be adjusted to exclude the value attributable to the creative financing arrangement. Thus, the value of the underlying financing in a sales transaction is relevant to the property\u2019s true cash value only if the market data shows that the sales price of a comparable property includes a dollar amount for both of the above features.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">In his application of a cash-equivalency analysis in discounting or determining the present cash value of the subject property\u2019s underlying mortgage, the appraiser failed to acknowledge several important principles. First, contrary to accepted procedures, Allen used a cash-equivalency analysis outside its normal application, i.e., the sales-comparison approach. The theory behind the concept of cash equivalency is similar to this Court\u2019s rationale and holding in <em>Washtenaw, </em>i.e., that the financing terms of a sale may influence the stated sales price of comparable real property.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>the mortgage component of his \"mortgage/equity\u201d approach, however, Allen did not analyze comparable properties for evidence of \"atypical\u201d financing. Instead, Allen erroneously assumed that mortgage assumptions in and of themselves are conclusive evidence of creative financing arrangements between the buyer and seller which affect the property\u2019s usual selling price and thus require that a sales price be adjusted.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Second, under this cash-equivalency analysis, Meadowlanes\u2019 appraiser violated a basic principle under the comparable-sales approach by adjusting the value of the subject property rather than the sales price of a comparable property. To elaborate, under the sales-comparison approach, true cash value is derived by analyzing recent sales of similar properties, comparing those properties with the subject property, and adjusting the sales price of the comparable properties to reflect differences. The adjusted sales prices should fall within a range and allow the appraiser to estimate the true cash value of the subject property. Once ascertained, the true cash value of the subject property itself is <em>not </em>adjusted.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">As evidenced above, Allen\u2019s approach is flawed because it values the property in large part by valuing its underlying mortgage in a theoretical commercial paper market. The primary and overriding influence in this method of valuation is the current mortgage interest rate. The second most important value influence is the stated interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>rate on the property\u2019s underlying mortgage note. By placing such great weight on the discounted value of the underlying mortgage note, two identical properties, one built at a time when interest rates are high and the other when interest rates are low will have vastly disparate estimates of value under Allen\u2019s approach. Thus, it violates the constitutional mandate of uniformity in real property taxation.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">We find further evidence that Allen\u2019s valuation approach is flawed because it derives a value for ad valorem tax purposes that fails to parallel a likely valuation estimate derived for other purposes, i.e., a sales price, financing, insurance, calculating net worth in a financial statement, or federal income tax purposes. This is contrary to basic valuation principles which emphasize the appraisal conclusion, i.e., the estimate of value, is not adjusted to accommodate the use of the appraisal. \"Whatever the circumstances, the numbers associated with the defined value [i.e., market value] will be the same.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In fact, in the context of federally subsidized housing, the tax courts and the Internal Revenue Service generally require independent verification that the purchase price does not exceed the property\u2019s market value as a means of ensuring that the buyer is not overpaying so that he may take inflated tax deductions.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> With this in mind, we note that the Meadowlanes housing complex did sell in 1984 for $3.7 million.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>For the above reasons, we find that the portion of Meadowlanes\u2019 appraiser\u2019s approach which values the mortgage is flawed.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Thus, the Tax Tribunal adopted a wrong principle by using Allen\u2019s \"mortgage/equity\u201d component approach in determining the true cash value of the subject property. This approach makes a number of invalid assumptions allowing it to value in large part the underlying mortgage paper rather than the real property. In so doing, it has the potential for creating irrational disparities in the true cash value of real property and thus violates the constitutional mandate of uniformity in the assessment of ad valorem taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">\n<em>D. THE INTEREST-REDUCTION SUBSIDY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Under his valuation approach, Meadowlanes\u2019 appraiser did not take into account the $8,520.74 portion of the monthly mortgage payments which represented the interest subsidy paid by hud to the mortgagee-lender.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Initially, the Tax Tribunal also excluded the interest subsidy from its final estimate of the subject property\u2019s true cash value. However, on remand, the tribunal recalculated its final valuation of the property, taking into account the interest subsidy under the mortgage component of the Allen method.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Meadowlanes claims the tribunal adopted a wrong principle when it adopted a valuation ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>proach which took into account the value of a federal government mortgage interest subsidy available to it as a \u00a7 236 property owner. We have concluded that the tribunal did adopt a wrong principle when it used Meadowlanes\u2019 appraiser\u2019s valuation approach. However, this does not end our discussion. We find it necessary to answer the issue on which leave was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">On remand, the true cash value of the subject property is to be redetermined using the three traditional valuation approaches. We recognize that the tribunal when evaluating the value estimates derived under these approaches, especially the capitalization-of-income approach, will once again be faced with the issue whether it is appropriate to consider the value, if any, of the interest subsidy. We hold, similar to our decision in <em>Antis-dale, supra </em>at 285, that because the interest-subsidy payments made on behalf of the owner-mortgagor of the \u00a7236 property affect the usual selling price of the property, it is proper for the Tax Tribunal to consider those payments in the valuation process.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">In <em>Antisdale, </em>this Court addressed the true cash value of property similar to the Meadowlanes housing complex and focused on the legislative definition of true cash value in MCL 211.27(1); MSA 7.27(1). We noted that that statute lists a number of value-influencing factors such as zoning and location that should be considered when determining the \"usual selling price\u201d of real property. In particular, we recognized that although these factors are intangibles, and not taxable in and of themselves, they can increase or decrease the value of property. We concluded that tax shelter benefits are also value-influencing factors and, although intangibles, should be reflected in the assessment process to the extent that they in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>crease or decrease the value of the subject real property. <em>Antisdale, supra </em>at 284-285.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Similarly, although the mortgage-interest subsidy is an intangible, and not taxable in and of itself, it is a value-influencing factor. In <em>Antisdale, supra </em>at 284, we recognized that without the subsidy these types of properties would not exist. Therefore, the value of the subsidy, if any, should be reflected in the assessment process. We agree with the <em>Meadowlanes I </em>Court\u2019s conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">Just as tax benefits affect the selling price of federally subsidized property, so does the existence of an interest subsidy attached to a mortgage being assumed by the purchaser. <em>[Id. </em>at 250.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">As clarified above, the subsidy is not taxed in and of itself. It is merely an intangible value influencer to be considered in the valuation and assessment process in the same manner as tax benefits, location, zoning, and other intangible value influences. Thus, Meadowlanes missed the point when it argued that consideration of the value of the mortgage interest subsidy in the assessment process constitutes double taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">We also reject Meadowlanes\u2019 argument that the subsidy does not affect the value of the real property because the owner of a \u00a7 236 property derives no benefit from it. The interest subsidy reduces the property\u2019s total operating costs and adds value by increasing the amount of debt the property can carry.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Thus, it makes lower rents possible and allows the owner of \u00a7 236 property to take advantage of a highly leveraged rate of return on his equity investment in addition to reaping a number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>of tax shelter benefits.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Despite the fact that the tenants benefit from the subsidy in the form of reduced rent, the statutory language creating the interest subsidy clarifies that the government\u2019s payment of all interest in excess of one percent (in this case $8,520.74 per month) is a considerable benefit to the owner of \u00a7 236 property.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">Meadowlanes also supported its position by erroneously claiming that the subsidy is not income taxable to the owner.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> In <em>Graff v Comm\u2019r, </em>74 TC 743 (1980), aff\u2019d 673 F2d 784 (CA 5, 1982), the United States Tax Court specifically concluded that the interest reduction payments made by hud on behalf of a \u00a7 236 property owner were taxable to the owner as income.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The <em>Graff </em>court found that the interest reduction payments \"took the place of rents that otherwise would have been charged the tenants. As such, the payments were a substitute for rent.\u201d <em>Graff </em>at 757. Thus, recognizing their value to the property owner, the Tax Court held that the interest subsidy amount is both includable as income and deductible as an interest expense for federal income tax purposes.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Since the benefits of the subsidy inure to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>owner, their value is properly considered in the determination of the true cash value of the subject real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Furthermore, contrary to Meadowlanes\u2019 assertions, the term \"creative financing\u201d as defined by this Court in <em>Washtenaw, supra, </em>does not include the federal interest subsidy simply by virtue of its presence in a program designed to induce private construction and operation of low-income housing projects. The <em>Meadowlanes I </em>Court did not err when it found that the interest subsidy was closer in nature to value-influencing factors such as property tax and typical costs of borrowing which are appropriately considered in the valuation process. <em>Meadowlanes I, supra </em>at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">In the instant case, the appraiser\u2019s decision to exclude the subsidy was not based on market-data evidence of sales of similar properties where the sales price required adjustment to exclude consideration given for an atypical financing arrangement between the buyer and seller. To the contrary, the interest subsidy applies to all \u00a7 236 property and is transferable. This is not a negotiable term that would allow a seller to extract an artificially enhanced price upon a sale. Thus, Meadowlanes\u2019 reliance on <em>Washtenaw </em>in this context is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">A survey of decisions from other jurisdictions supports our conclusion that it is appropriate to consider the federal interest subsidy in the computation of value for real property tax purposes. For example, in <em>Rebelwood, Ltd v Hinds Co, </em>544 So 2d 1356 (Miss, 1989), the taxpayer-owner of a federally subsidized low-income housing complex challenged its assessed value for property tax purposes. The <em>Rebelwood </em>court emphasized that the valuation process must consider any circumstance that tends to affect the real property\u2019s value. It found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>that both the \u00a7 8 rent and \u00a7 236 mortgage interest subsidies were to be considered in the valuation process since they were transferable and they made ownership of the property more desirable than it would be without them.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">Several other jurisdictions have determined that rent subsidies affect the value of federally subsidized housing complexes because (1) they affect its income-earning capacity, and (2) since they are transferable, they will be considered by a willing buyer and seller when determining fair market value. Thus, these courts have concluded that the rent subsidy must be considered in the valuation process.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The same rationale applies to the interest-reduction subsidy since its availability makes the \u00a7 236 property economically feasible and desirable.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">An overriding theme in the decisions addressing the ad valorem taxation of federally subsidized real property is that the valuation process must consider both the positive and negative aspects of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>the regulatory agreement voluntarily entered into between the owner and the government. This comports with the well-established rule that all factors relevant to property value should be considered in the assessment process.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Thus, we note that the <em>Meadowlanes I </em>Court was correct in emphasizing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">Section 236 properties are subject to unique restrictions and advantages. All of them, including the subsidized interest feature, must be at least considered in the assessment process. <em>[Meadow-lanes I, supra </em>at 251.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Finally, w\u00e9 reject the argument advanced by amici curiae on Meadowlanes\u2019 behalf<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> that consideration of the interest subsidy in the valuation process frustrates public policy. Other courts have considered and rejected this same argument. After reviewing the relevant statutory scheme and legislative history, these courts have concluded there is no indication Congress intended to create subsidies by local units of government in addition to the significant economic incentives it provided to induce private developers to construct and operate quality low-income housing.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The Tax Tribunal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>has also considered and rejected this public policy argument in the context of a \u00a7 236 property.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">For the above reasons, we hold that in computing the true cash value of real property, the Michigan Tax Tribunal may take into account the value, if any, of a federal government mortgage subsidy. We affirm those portions of the decisions of the Tax Tribunal and the Court of Appeals in <em>Meadowlanes I </em>and <em>Meadowlanes II </em>that comport with this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">Although the tribunal and the Court of Appeals correctly considered the value of the interest subsidy, they did so using a flawed method. Thus, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand to the Tax Tribunal for a new hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">We direct that on remand, the tribunal be presented with factually supported estimates of the fair market value of the Meadowlanes property derived from the three recognized valuation approaches: (1) the replacement-cost-less-depreciation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>approach, (2) the market or comparison-sales approach, and (3) the capitalization-of-income approach. These traditional approaches are based on concepts that apply to subsidized housing complexes just as they apply to other types of real property. A survey of relevant decisions in other jurisdictions reveals reliance on these three recognized approaches.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Evidence of an entirely new method of valuation may also be presented, but it must be demonstrated to be accurate and reasonably related to the fair market value of the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">The values derived under the various approaches are to be correlated, reconciled, and weighed in order to reach a final estimate of value. It is the Tax Tribunal\u2019s duty to determine which approaches provide the most accurate valuation under the individual circumstances of each case. An appraisal approach is to be disregarded only if there is research justifying its nonuse. In addition, the final estimate of true cash value must represent the physical real estate and all the interests, benefits, and rights inherent in ownership of the subject real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">With these basic principles in mind, we acknowledge that there is no single correct approach for determining the true cash value of federally subsidized real property. Therefore, the appraiser should use variants of all three traditional approaches, valuing the property both as private apartments and as a federally subsidized housing complex. Also, any other approach demonstrated to be accurate and reasonably related to the fair market value of the subject property is acceptable. We believe it is best to provide the tribunal with all the relevant data so as to allow it to compare, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>correlate, and reconcile the information and make an informed decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Thus, on remand, the tribunal is to be presented with value estimates using (1) the cost approach, valuing the real property as subsidized; (2) the cost approach, valuing the real property as private apartments; (3) the capitalization-of-income approach, using all figures and valuing the real property as subsidized and considering the risk, leverage and yield to maturity factors that are developed from the subsidized housing market; (4) the capitalization-of-income approach, valuing the real property as a private housing complex; (5) the sales-comparison approach, using subsidized properties as comparables; (6) the sales-comparison approach, using private housing complexes or apartments as comparables; and (7) other new approaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">When using approach (1), economic or external obsolescence should be calculated, recognizing that the real property is devoted to its highest and best use as subsidized housing property. If there is a market for subsidized housing at the location where it is built and a sufficient number of individuals who can afford to pay the rent required, then there will be little economic obsolescence under this approach. Finally, when using a sales-comparison approach, the appraiser should adjust the sales price of comparables for differences in size, age, condition, location, and other value influences that buyers and sellers of real property take into account as opposed to the value influences considered by buyers and sellers of commercial paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">We reverse the decisions of the Tax Tribunal and the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the tribunal for a redetermination of the true cash value of the subject real property in a manner consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b752-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Cavanagh, C.J., and Brickley, Riley, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-7\"> The property\u2019s design is modern and attractive, and all but the one-bedroom units are townhouses with basements.
