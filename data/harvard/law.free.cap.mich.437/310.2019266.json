We hold that townships have the authority to regulate boat docking and launching for the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of persons and property within their communities under the township ordinance act. Accordingly, we vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to Oakland Circuit Court to enter an order pursuant to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">In the early 1960s, Milton and Barbara Sloban owned land adjacent to Square Lake in Bloomfield Township zoned as single-family residential use. The Slobans, who requested and were denied a variance to build apartments on their property, challenged the township\u2019s zoning classification. Following trial, Judge Arthur E. Moore, Oakland Circuit Court, entered a judgment invalidating the township\u2019s single-family zoning classification as applied to the Square Lake property and authorized multiple-family residential use.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">The Slobans split the property in two, conveying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>the back-lot portion and an easement of 160 feet of beach frontage to Square Lake Apartments, Inc. (Phase One), and retained the front-lot portion adjacent to Square Lake. A few years later, the Slobans developed the lake-front property (Phase Two) into seventy-eight multifamily rental units.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With the two apartment complexes in place, approximately forty homes and 152 multifamily units had access to Square Lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Square Lake Apartments, Inc., conveyed the Phase One development back to the Slobans early in 1973. As a result, the easement created for the Phase One residents was extinguished by merger of title. Later that year, the Slobans sold the Phase Two development to Lake Front Apartments and created another easement to allow Phase One residents access to the lake.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Square Lake Hills Associates bought Phase One seven years later. They converted the apartments into condominiums, erected a small boat dock off of its easement, and advertised the units as affording lake-access rights for year-round recreation.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Meanwhile, Bloomfield Township responded to a call for inland lake regulation in 1974 by adopting ordinance no. 278. This ordinance restricted the use of inland lakes to owners or occupants of riparian parcels.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In 1981, the township repealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>ordinance no. 278. In its place, it adopted ordinance no. 340<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which required nonriparian owners who used the township\u2019s inland lakes to obtain prior approval from the Township Zoning Board of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">In 1984, Bloomfield Township sued the current and former owners of the Phase Two development directing them to comply with ordinance no. 340 and prohibiting Phase One residents access to the beach-front easement area.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While the lawsuit was pending, the Bloomfield Township Board of Supervisors proposed ordinance no. 397.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This ordinance limited township riparian property owners, with a minimum of 150 feet of lake frontage, to launching and docking one motorboat. Plaintiff\u2019s representative and the riparian property owners of Square Lake appeared at the township board meeting on April 13, 1987, to discuss the proposal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After a lengthy hearing, the township board unanimously voted to approve the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Soon thereafter, plaintiff filed the instant lawsuit challenging ordinance nos. 340 and 397. Bloomfield Township, questioning the substantive grounds of plaintiff\u2019s complaint, responded with a motion for summary disposition. Plaintiff cross motioned for partial summary disposition on the basis of <em>Fox &amp; Associates, Inc v Hayes Twp, </em>162 Mich App 647; 413 NW2d 465 (1987), which held that townships do not have authority under the Township Rural Zoning Act to enact ordinances restricting boat docking or funnel development.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Judge Norman L. Lippitt heard both motions and concluded that <em>Fox &amp; Associates </em>prohibited Bloomfield Township from regulating Square Lake under both the Township Rural Zoning Act and the township ordinance act.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">In appealing Judge Lippitt\u2019s decision, Bloomfield Township additionally sought an order from this Court to consolidate with <em>Fox &amp; </em>Associates.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We denied Bloomfield Township\u2019s motion to consolidate because we were not persuaded the questions presented by the township should be reviewed by this Court before consideration by the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The Court of Appeals subsequently affirmed the trial court, premising its decision on <em>Fox &amp; Associates. </em>After its motion for reconsideration was denied, Bloomfield Township applied for leave to appeal in this Court. We granted the township\u2019s motion, limiting review to the following issues:<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">(1) Whether the delegation of powers in the township ordinance act allows Bloomfield Township to regulate by ordinance boat launching and boat docking; and</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">(2) Whether the Township Rural Zoning Act allows Bloomfield Township to regulate by ordinance boat launching and boat docking.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Under the separation of powers doctrine,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> township regulations enacted under the township ordinance act are not subject to judicial intervention absent abuse of discretion, excessive use of power, or error of law. <em>Tireman-Joy-Chicago Improvement Ass\u2019n v Chernick, </em>361 Mich 211; 105 NW2d 57 (1960); <em>Sheffield Development Co v City of Troy, </em>99 Mich App 527, 530; 298 NW2d 23 (1980). When asked to review a township ordinance, we will not substitute our judgment for that of a township official. Rather, we heed the advice of Justice Talbot Smith in <em>Brae Burn, Inc v Bloomfield Hills, </em>350 Mich 425, 431; 86 NW2d 166 (1957):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">The people of the community, through their appropriate legislative body, and not the courts, govern its growth and its life. Let us state the proposition as clearly as may be: <em>It is not our function to approve the ordinance before us as to wisdom or desirability. For alleged abuses involving such factors the remedy is the ballot box, not the courts. We do not substitute our judgment for that of the legislative body charged with the duty and responsibility in the premises. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">As the majority in <em>Brae Burn </em>held, our function is to determine whether a township ordinance is within the range of conferred discretionary powers and then determine if it is reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 437. See also <em>People v Gibbs, </em>186 Mich 127, 133; 152 NW 1053 (1915); <em>1426 Woodward Ave Corp v Wolff, </em>312 Mich 352, 371; 20 NW2d 217 (1945); <em>State, County &amp; Municipal Employees Local 339 v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number><em>Highland Park, </em>363 Mich 79, 86; 108 NW2d 898 (1961). The reasonableness of an ordinance, while a question of law, depends upon the particular facts of each case. <em>Id. </em>The test for determining whether an ordinance is reasonable requires us to assess the existence of a rational relationship between the exercise of police power<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare in a particular manner in a given case. <em>People v Armstrong, 73 </em>Mich 288, 292; 41 NW 275 (1889); <em>People v Gibbs, supra; Alderton v City of Saginaw, </em>367 Mich 28, 33; 116 NW2d 53 (1962); <em>Delta Charter Twp v Dinolfo, </em>419 Mich 253, 271; 351 NW2d 831 (1984).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>At common law, we narrowly construed township ordinances enacted pursuant to the delegated police power in the township ordinance act. <em>Harding v </em>Bader, 75 Mich 316, 319; 42 NW 942 (1889); <em>Clements v McCabe, </em>210 Mich 207, 219; 177 NW 722 (1920). The delegates to the 1961 Michigan Constitutional Convention replaced the common-law rule of strict construction by constitutionally requiring courts to liberally construe all legislative and constitutional powers conferred upon townships. Const 1963, art 7, \u00a7 34; see also, 1 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, pp 1048-1058. While this constitutional directive does not provide an independent grant of authority for townships to act in a particular area, its mandate of liberal construction does provide a framework for analysis of Bloomfield Township\u2019s arguments.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Arrowhead Development Co v Livingston Co Road Comm, </em>413 Mich 505, 511; 322 NW2d 702 (1982); <em>Eyde Construction Co v Meridian Twp, </em>149 Mich App 802, 807; 386 NW2d 687 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Plaintiff first<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> argues that Bloomfield Township acted beyond the delegated police powers in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>township ordinance act when it limited the use of its easement by controlling the number of boats docked and launched on Square Lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Central to plaintiff\u2019s analysis is the 1989 amendment of the township ordinance act which now provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">The township board of a township may, at a regular or special meeting by a majority of the members elect of the township board, adopt ordinances regulating the public health, safety, and general welfare of persons and property, <em>including, but not limited to </em>fire protection, licensing or use of bicycles, trafile and parking of vehicles .... [MCL 41.181; MSA 5.45(1). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Thus, plaintiff maintains the Legislature did not intend for townships to have an unlimited amount of regulatory power under the township ordinance act. Moreover, plaintiff maintains the Legislature intended to restrict the authority of townships to act in situations where it expressly authorized township control.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">However, plaintiff\u2019s argument fails to consider that in 1959 the Legislature amended the township ordinance act to include the authority to \"adopt ordinances\u201d regulating the \"public health, safety, and general welfare of persons and property.\u201d We view this amendatory action as evidencing the Legislature\u2019s intent to broaden the township powers. Thirty years later, the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>added the words \"including, but not limited to\u201d to indicate that the areas of regulation were not confined to those expressly mentioned in the statute. The 1989 amendment adds nothing new to powers granted to townships in the township ordinance act. Rather, it reaffirms the Legislature\u2019s intent that townships have the authority to resolve local matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">We find <em>Miller v Fabius Twp Bd, </em>366 Mich 250, 253; 114 NW2d 205 (1962), supportive of our interpretation of the township ordinance act. The <em>Miller </em>Court examined the police power language of the township ordinance act in light of a township ordinance limiting the hours of water-skiing and powerboat racing on an inland lake. In holding that Fabius Township had the authority to enact its water-skiing ordinance on the basis of the police power language in the township ordinance act, the court weighed the benefits of township control of inland lakes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">While the general problem with reference to water skiing and motorboating and the use of our inland lakes by different classes of sportsmen are State-wide problems, there are peculiar circumstances that are local in <em>character </em>\u2014 such <em>as the number of boat users on the lake; the amount of \u00f1shing on the lake; the congestion and conflict between \u00f1shermen and water skiers; the location of the lake to densely populated areas </em>\u2014 which the 1959 amendment authorizes townships to deal with under the \"health and safety of persons and property\u201d clause. <em>[Miller v Fabius Twp Bd, supra </em>at 259. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Similarly, in <em>Checker Cab Co v Romulus Twp, </em>371 Mich 232; 123 NW2d 772 (1963), the plaintiffs challenged a Romulus Township ordinance that required taxicab drivers working at Metropolitan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Airport to obtain local licenses. The Court sustained the township regulation under the township ordinance act as a legitimate use of its police power because the taxicab business affected the health and safety of motorists, pedestrians, and other persons and property within the township.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">We find the reasoning in <em>Miller </em>and <em>Checker Cab </em>particularly instructive in answering the question presented in this appeal. When the Legislature added the language to the township ordinance act giving townships the ability to \"adopt ordinances regulating the public health, safety and general welfare of persons and property,\u201d it provided a statutory mechanism for townships to adopt and enforce regulations, purely local in nature, to enhance the health and safety within its community. <em>Miller v Fabius Twp Bd, supra </em>at 259. The regulation of boat docking and launching by Bloomfield Township on inland lakes is a perfectly reasonable use of township police power.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Furthermore, we cannot agree with plaintiff\u2019s conclusion that ordinance no. 397 is a zoning ordinance because it limits the use of lake frontage based on the number of feet of lake frontage owned. Bloomfield Township ordinance no. 397 is <em>not </em>a zoning ordinance. The ordinance does <em>not </em>regulate the use of land or lake frontage. Rather, it regulates an \"activity\u201d by limiting the number of boats that can be parked or \"launched and/or docked adjacent to each separate frontage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">A zoning ordinance is defined as an ordinance which regulates the use of land and buildings according to districts, areas, or locations. 8 Mc-Quillin, Municipal Corporations, \u00a725.53, p 137. The question whether or not a particular ordinance is a zoning ordinance may be determined by a consideration of the substance of its provisions and terms, and its relation to the general plan of zoning in the city.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Id._</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>We find plaintiff\u2019s argument analogous to the argument made in <em>Recreational Vehicle United Citizens Ass\u2019n v City of Sterling Heights, </em>165 Mich App 130; 418 NW2d 702 (1987). In that case, the plaintiffs challenged a local regulation which restricted the parking and storage of recreational vehicles, enclosed campers, boats, snowmobiles, and utility trailers upon public and private property in a single-family residential area. The plaintiffs claimed the ordinance was not a regulation, but rather a \"zoning ordinance\u201d because it limited the use of their property, and invalid because the city did not follow the procedural guidelines in the Township Rural Zoning Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The Court of Appeals held that defendant\u2019s ordinance was in fact a zoning ordinance because it regulated the storage and parking of plaintiffs\u2019 vehicles without reference to a public street or sidewalk. However, relying on an earlier decision, <em>Belanger v Chesterfield Twp, </em>96 Mich App 539, 541; 293 NW2d 622 (1980), rev\u2019d on other grounds 409 Mich 941 (1980), the Court held that where a local ordinance regulates the parking of vehicles on its streets or sidewalks, the ordinance is regulatory. <em>Recreational Vehicle United Citizens Ass\u2019n v Sterling Heights, supra </em>at 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Launching and docking boats on inland lakes are \"activities,\u201d and the number of boats that can be launched or docked is very much akin to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>parking regulation on a residential street. It follows that since township parking regulations on residential streets are within the scope of a township\u2019s regulatory police power, <em>Belanger v Chesterfield Twp, supra </em>at 541, a township regulation of docking and launching boats on its inland lake is within the same scope of regulatory police power.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">We therefore conclude that townships have the authority, under the township ordinance act, to enact ordinances regulating boat docking and launching on inland lakes as a measure to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of persons and property within a township.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Plaintiff also argues that even if Bloomfield Township has the authority to regulate boat docking and launching through the township ordinance act, ordinance no. 397 is an unreasonable use of police power.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The township board determined that lack of regulation resulted in (1) a nuisance condition, (2) an impairment of important and irreplaceable natural resources, (3) the destruction of property values, and (4) a threatening of the public health, safety, and welfare. We conclude that each of the concerns raised by the township is reasonable and addresses a legitimate governmental interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The problems inherent in overcrowded lakes, pollution, and destruction of wildlife are shared by cities, townships, and villages throughout the state. The 1961 Constitutional Convention delegates recognized this concern by establishing a constitutional directive to protect the state\u2019s wa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>ters from pollution, impairment, and destruction.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 52; see also, 2 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, pp 2602-2612. In <em>Thompson v Enz, </em>379 Mich 667, 699; 154 NW2d 473 (1967), Justice Brennan, in his dissenting opinion, urged the Legislature to address the problem of preserving Michigan\u2019s lakes by enacting</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">wise and forethinking legislation, which will protect our lakes from overcrowding, and the pollution which flows from immoderate use, so that all of the people of the State, including riparian cottage owners, will be able to enjoy our great natural bounty for centuries to come.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The Legislature responded by enacting the Inland Lakes and Streams Act, Marine Safety Act, and the Wetland Protection Act, MCL 281.701; MSA 18.595(51). Under these acts, the Department of Natural Resources may choose which lakes, rivers and streams it wishes to regulate.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Accordingly, local governments are left to regulate waterways not managed by the Department of Natural Resources. MCL 281.708(4); MSA 18.595(58)(4), MCL 281.904; MSA 11.419(4), MCL 281.1015; MSA 18.1287(15).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">In the instant case, Bloomfield Township determined that it was necessary to regulate boat usage in order to preserve and protect the health, safety, and welfare of persons using and living near the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>inland lakes. The township found that lack of regulation resulted in a nuisance condition, an impairment of important and irreplaceable natural resources, the destruction of property values, and a threatening of the public health, safety, and welfare. Furthermore, the township recognized that if proper safety precautions were not immediately taken, the use of boats on inland lakes could be very dangerous to the persons and riparian property owners using the lake. In our view, Bloomfield Township took reasonable steps to alleviate future problems by recognizing this potential hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that the objective sought to be achieved by the ordinance, in requiring a minimal amount of lake frontage for boat dockage through a uniform scheme of regulation to lessen the congestion and density of boats docked and launched around Square Lake, is a reasonable use of the township police power under the township ordinance act.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In the instant case, we granted leave to appeal to determine whether townships have the authority to regulate by ordinance boat launching and docking. We conclude that the delegated police power authority in the township ordinance act enables townships to regulate docking and launching boats for the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of persons and property within their communities.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and we remand this case to Oakland Circuit Court for entry of an order pursuant to this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b575-8\">Brickley and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>APPENDIX A</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\">BLOOMFIELD TOWNSHIP ORDINANCE NO. 340</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">AN ORDINANCE TO AMEND ORDINANCE NO. 265 KNOWN AS THE ZONING ORDINANCE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">THE TOWNSHIP OF BLOOMFIELD ORDAINS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">Section 1.01.

Intent and Purpose: In its deliberations leading to the adoption of this Ordinance, the Township Board has recognized and concluded that the use of water resources, including the inland lakes situated in the Township, should be considered within a framework of long-term costs and benefits to the Township, and that it is desirable to retain and maintain the physical, cultural and aesthetic characteristics of lakes in the Township. Moreover, it has been recognized that, as the shore lines of lakes become further developed, the cumulative impact of boat usage from each respective property must be regulated in order to preserve and protect the rights of riparian owners as well as the Township as a whole. It has further been recognized that the lack of regulation shall result in a nuisance condition and an impairment of these important and irreplaceable natural resources of the Township, and shall further result in the destruction of property values and threaten the public health, safety and welfare of all persons making use of lakes within the Township and properties adjacent to lakes in the Township.

In <em>Bane, </em>Pontiac Township adopted an ordinance, pursuant to the township building regulation enabling statute, 1943 PA 185, that required running water in dwellings, indoor plumbing, and adopted a definition of substandard dwellings as defined in the state housing law. <em>Id. </em>at 485. Residents of Pontiac Township who lived without running water and indoor plumbing sought a declaratory judgment from the court to prevent the township from enforcing the ordinance against them. The <em>Bane </em>Court held the township had the authority to enact the regulation, but could not enforce it retroactively against the petitioners. The Court did not hold, as the dissent suggests, that the township regulation had the effect of zoning and could not be enforced against them. Rather, the Court expanded the principle of nonconforming use, retroactivity in zoning, and the use of declaratory judgments. The dissent\u2019s reliance on the words \"ha[ve] 'the effect of zoning,\u2019 \u201d can only be viewed as dicta and not controlling authority for this case. <em>Post, </em>p 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Moreover, <em>Bane </em>has never been interpreted by this Court or the Court of Appeals in the manner suggested by the dissent.

Since then, Bloomfield Township has been striving to show that ordinance no. 397 is <em>not </em>a zoning ordinance. Nevertheless, in its brief on appeal to this Court, Bloomfield Township states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">[I]t is a matter of elementary logic that regulation of waterways and water front development, <em>including boat launching and boat </em>dockage, is clearly contemplated in the <em>overall scheme of township planning and zoning.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">It will be demonstrated in the Argument portion of this Brief that it would be legally sound to construe Act 246 [the township ordinance act] and zea [Township Rural Zoning Act] as delegating to townships the authority to regulate boat launching and boat dockage. Moreover, construing Act 246 and zea in such a manner is compelled by the policy consideration that planning, <em>zoning </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>regulation is effective only when undertaken on a township-wide basis.

Attempting to avert the perceived detrimental effects of \"funnel development,\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Bloomfield Township in 1974 began the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>first in a series of attempts to limit the lake-access rights of back-lot owners.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The majority asserts that \"[ljaunching and docking boats on inland lakes are 'activities/ and the number of boats that can be launched or docked is very much akin to a parking regulation on a residential street.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">A street parking regulation does not, however, preclude the \"launching\u201d of a vehicle, parked in a garage or elsewhere, into the stream of traffic.

Ordinance no. 397 thus does not allocate the available parking, as does a street parking regulation, but rather seeks to reduce the available parking.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Characterizing launching and docking as an \"activity\u201d does not advance the analysis. Regulating the use of lands and buildings is clearly zoning, although one who uses lands and buildings is clearly, when using lands or buildings, engaged in an activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">The majority states that \"[a] zoning ordinance is defined as an ordinance which regulates the use of <em>land </em>and <em>buildings </em>according to districts, areas, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>locations.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> To the extent that the majority\u2019s analysis depends on distinguishing between a regulation of the use of <em>\"land </em>and buildings\u201d and a regulation respecting launching and docking boats on \"inland <em>lakes,\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>33</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the analysis tends to support the conclusion of the Court of Appeals in <em>Fox &amp; Associates:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-4\">Even with the liberal construction of the provisions of the constitution in mind, we do not believe that the trza grants authority to townships to regulate or limit boat dockage construction or riparian access rights.

As a property right, the right to dock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>boats might more appropriately be accomplished under the provisions of the trza.

But the ordinance at issue does more than regulate activities. Article IV, \u00a7 4.1 of the contested ordinance declares that \"not more than one boat shall be launched and/or docked adjacent to each separate frontage.\u201d The ordinance restricts the riparian rights of the property owners on the basis of the length of lake frontage, it is, therefore, distinguishable from ordinances regulating activities as in <em>Miller v Fabius Twp Bd, </em>366 Mich 250; 114 NW2d 205 (1962), and <em>Checker Cab Co v Romulus Twp, </em>371 Mich 232; 123 NW2d 772 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">I would affirm that portion of the Court of Appeals decision which held that the township does not have authority under the township ordinance act to regulate these property rights.</p>\n<judges id=\"b601-6\">Mallett, J., took no part in the decision of this case._</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-9\"> Bloomfield Township ordinance no. 397, art III, \u00a7 3.1(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b582-10\"> <em>Bane v Pontiac Twp, </em>343 Mich'481, 492; 72 NW2d 134 (1955).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b582-11\"> MCL 41.181; MSA 5.45(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b583-10\"> MCL 125.271; MSA 5.2963(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b583-11\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 316, n 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">See <em>Korash v Livonia, </em>388 Mich 737, 746; 202 NW2d 803 (1972), quoted in text following n 22.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b583-13\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 313.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b583-14\"> See <em>Miller v Fabius Twp Bd, </em>366 Mich 250; 114 NW2d 205 (1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b585-7\"> Because the plaintiff condominium association prevailed both at the trial court and Court of Appeals levels, it has not had occasion to develop the record evidence tending to show that the real reason for the adoption of the ordinance is not overcrowding of the lake, but rather to restrict further development of the back land.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b585-8\"> [A]ll the riparian proprietors have an equal or common right to use the water, but each must exercise his rights in a reasonable manner and to a reasonable extent, so as not to interfere unnecessarily with the corresponding rights of others.

West Bloomfield Township attempted to distinguish <em>Fox &amp; Associates </em>by arguing that it was regulating land use, which is authorized by the trza, and not regulating water use as was Hayes Township in <em>Fox &amp; Associates.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b595-7\"> The brief states:</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">The Township Zoning Enabling Act, MCL 125.271, <em>et seq. </em>[MSA 5.2963(1) <em>et seq.], </em>expressly authorizes the enactment of a zoning ordinance to achieve: the needs of the state citizens for natural resources and recreation; facilitate adequate and efficient provisions for water and recreation; to conserve natural resources; and to promote the public health, safety and welfare.
