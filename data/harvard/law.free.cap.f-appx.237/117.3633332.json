Prior to Williams\u2019s first direct appeal, the district court sentenced him to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment on each of the marijuana counts and 240 months\u2019 imprisonment on each of the cocaine base counts, all to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">In Williams\u2019s first appeal, we reversed his conviction for possession with intent to distribute more than five grams of cocaine base due to a defect in the indictment and remanded the case with directions to vacate that count of conviction. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>429 F.3d 767, 775 (8th Cir.2005) <em>(\u201cWilliams I</em>\u201d). On remand, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> complied with our directions and conducted a brief hearing in the presence of Williams, his attorney and an assistant United States Attorney. The court vacated Williams\u2019s conviction on the relevant count and reduced the special assessment by $100, leaving intact the remaining 240 month term of imprisonment. At that point the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-11\">THE COURT: If there\u2019s nothing further we\u2019ll bring this matter to a close. Yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-12\">THE DEFENDANT: I have a Sixth Amendment violation. What I was charged with was outside the scope of my indictment because I was arrested on October 25th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-13\">THE COURT: Well, at any rate the Eighth Circuit has affirmed the other counts and I\u2019m following the Eighth Circuit orders and will not take any further action. Anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-14\">[ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY]: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-15\">THE DEFENDANT: Can I have a new appointment of counsel because I want to continue my direct appeal on the issues that he addressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-16\">THE COURT: That will be up to you to solicit counsel, and if you want to appeal and you are not able to hire one, you may solicit the assistance of the clerk of this court who will assist you in drafting a notice of appeal and will assist you in lodging that with the Eighth Circuit. If there\u2019s nothing further we\u2019ll bring this matter to a close. Marshal, he\u2019s in your custody.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-17\">With there being no additional comments, the district court terminated the hearing. Williams appeals, arguing that the district court denied him allocution under Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(i)(4)(A)(ii) at resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-18\">Ordinarily, we review the question of whether a criminal defendant was afforded an opportunity for allocution de novo. <em>See United States v. Kaniss, </em>150 F.3d 967, 969 (8th Cir.1998). Neither Williams nor his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>counsel objected to the district court\u2019s purported denial of allocution, but it remains an open question in this circuit whether we review for plain error in these circumstances. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Griggs, </em>431 F.3d 1110, 1114 n. 4 (8th Cir.2005). As in <em>Griggs, </em>we believe that it is unnecessary to decide this question here because we hold that the district court substantially complied with Rule 32(i)(4)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">We will assume without deciding that Williams had a right to allocution at his resentencing hearing, even though the district court\u2019s vacating the count for possession with intent to distribute cocaine base had no effect on the length of Williams\u2019s prison term, <em>see United States v. McKnight, </em>17 F.3d 1139, 1145 (8th Cir.1994) (vacating some counts of conviction and holding that remand for resentencing was unnecessary because the district court had ordered the prison terms on the vacated counts to be served concurrently with the other counts). Even so, the transcript of the resentencing hearing shows that on three occasions, the district court invited Williams to comment, and Williams freely accepted the invitation on the first two of those occasions. On the third occasion, Williams said nothing, and the court recessed. We share the concern expressed in <em>Griggs </em>that \u201ca district court should expressly comply with Rule 32\u2019s allocution requirement\u201d by addressing the defendant personally. 431 F.3d at 1115. However, the facts of this case are nearly identical to those in <em>Griggs, </em>where the district court asked prior to sentencing, \u201cAnything else that anybody wants to place on the record?\u201d and Griggs remained silent. <em>Id. </em>at 1113. Here, not only did the district court offer three opportunities for Williams to allocute, but Williams in fact spoke on his own behalf on two of those occasions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On these facts, we hold that the district court substantially complied with Rule 32(i)(4)(A)(ii). <em>See id. </em>at 1114.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-19\">. The late Honorable George Howard, Jr., ' United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b139-6\">. Williams suggests that the district court \"shut him off\u201d and did not permit him to speak on his own behalf. We see no evidence of this in the record. At most, the district court declined Williams\u2019s invitation to address the Sixth Amendment issue that he raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
