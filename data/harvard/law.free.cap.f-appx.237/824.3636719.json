While on supervised release, Flowers was charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. A jury convicted Flowers on this charge, and the conviction served as the basis for the district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release. The district court sentenced Flowers to six months\u2019 imprisonment on revocation, to be served consecutively to Flowers\u2019 fifty-one month sentence on the firearm conviction. Flowers timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-17\">Counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), contending there are no meritorious issues for appeal but requesting this Court review whether the district court erroneously imposed a consecutive six-month sentence after finding Flowers\u2019 violated the terms of his supervised release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Flowers did not file a pro se supplemental brief, despite being notified of his right to do so. The Government declined to file a responding brief. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-18\">We will affirm a sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release if it is within the prescribed statutory range and not plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1813, 167 L.Ed.2d 325 (2007). In making this determination, we first consider whether the sentence is procedurally or substantively unreasonable, and if so, whether it is \u201cplainly\u201d unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>While the district court must consider the <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) Chapter 7 policy statements and statutory requirements and factors applicable to revocation sentences under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a) and 3583 (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006), the district court ultimately has broad discretion to revoke the previous sentence and impose a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-21\">Flowers\u2019 underlying cocaine distribution conviction was punishable by a statutory maximum of forty years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) (2000). The underlying conviction was therefore a Class B felony, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>(2000), for which Flowers could have been sentenced upon revocation of his supervised release to a statutory maximum of three years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2006). Based on Flowers\u2019 Grade B violation of supervised release, <em>see </em>\u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(2), and criminal history category of I, the district court properly found Flowers\u2019 range of imprisonment upon revocation was four to ten months. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 7B1.4(a) (revocation table). The district court\u2019s imposition of a six-month sentence was well within both the statutory maximum and the sentencing guidelines range. Further, the district court properly imposed the revocation sentence to run consecutively to Flowers\u2019 sentence on the firearm conviction. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 7B1.3(f). We therefore conclude Flowers\u2019 revocation sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the revocation of Flowers\u2019 supervised release and the sentence imposed by the district court. This court requires that counsel inform Flowers, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Flowers requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Flowers.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-13\">. Counsel asserts we should vacate the district court's revocation order if Flowers' firearm conviction is reversed on appeal. However, we recently affirmed Flowers\u2019 conviction and sentence in that case. <em>See United States v. Flowers, </em>235 Fed.Appx. 965 (4th Cir.2007) (unpublished).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
