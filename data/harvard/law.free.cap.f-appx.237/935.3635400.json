Haynes challenges his underlying conviction and sentence, arguing that the district court erred by denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition in that it failed to perform \u201can actual innocence analysis\u201d which would have shown that he has been incarcerated for an offense to which he neither pleaded guilty nor was found guilty by a jury. Haynes also asserts that he is entitled to proceed under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 as he is actually innocent of the offense of which he was convicted. Haynes seeks remand to the district court for an evidentiary hearing or resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-22\">Although Haynes seeks to proceed under \u00a7 2241 pursuant to the savings clause of \u00a7 2255, he has not shown that the remedy available under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). To the extent Haynes argues that the <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), or <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), lines of authority apply retroactively to cases on collateral review and entitle him to file a \u00a7 2241 petition, his argument is unavailing in light of <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005). Haynes is hereby warned that submitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>repetitive or frivolous filings in the future will invite the imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b955-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
