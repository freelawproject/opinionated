After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-25\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b595-26\">Acting on a tip from a confidential informant, police detained and then arrested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>Thompson at a motel in Mobile, Alabama. A search of the motel room uncovered 1.5 kilograms of cocaine and 217 grams of crack cocaine and a receipt in Thompson\u2019s name for a storage unit in Massachusetts. While in custody, Thompson asked a woman named Tanya Lee to go to the storage unit in Massachusetts to remove evidence. Lee complied and removed a suitcase that she said contained a gun, money and crack cocaine. Thompson was tried and convicted on charges of drug trafficking and obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">In a prior appeal, this Court vacated Thompson\u2019s sentences, concluding that the district court committed constitutional <em>Booker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>error when it applied a firearm enhancement to Thompson\u2019s sentence, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), under a mandatory guidelines scheme. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>171 Fed.Appx. 823 (11th Cir.2006). The Court noted that on remand the district court should determine what sentence was reasonable after considering the guidelines as advisory and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but that issues already or necessarily decided could not be reargued.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 831 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">On remand, Thompson argued that he did not possess a firearm for purposes of \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) and that such possession must be found by a jury. The district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Thompson possessed the gun and applied the firearm enhancement in calculating Thompson\u2019s advisory guidelines range of 360 months to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Thompson also argued for a mandatory minimum 20-year sentence, below the advisory guidelines range, because: (1) his father had induced him to try crack and join the drug culture when Thompson was only thirteen years old; (2) his ailing mother and his children relied upon him; (3) his drug operation had been limited in scope; (4) he needed opportunities for rehabilitation; (5) other drug defendants and his co-conspirators had received lesser sentences; and (6) it would be unjust for him to spend such a significant portion of his life in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">During the sentencing hearing, the district court commented that Thompson\u2019s extensive criminal history was serious. The district court noted that it had read the letters from Thompson\u2019s relatives requesting a lesser sentence. While acknowledging that the letter writers were good people, the district court questioned their conclusion that Thompson was a good person given his extensive criminal history. The district court stated that, based on Thompson\u2019s criminal record, it believed Thompson was not a good person, but a bad person who had \u201cappeared before judge after judge after judge in [his] history.\u201d The district court also stated that, under the circumstances, a minimum sentence would not be appropriate, but wanted to hear what Thompson would say before choosing an appropriate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">The district court then allowed Thompson to allocute. Thompson argued that, although he had done some bad things, he had not committed any violent crimes and did not believe that he deserved what amounted to almost a life sentence. Thompson expressed remorse for his crimes and stated that he had a good heart and believed that he could be rehabilitated. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Thompson also asked for a lesser sentence because his mother was ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The district court acknowledged that it had heard Thompson and had come to the hearing with an open mind, but felt that a 480-month sentence was appropriate after considering the advisory guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court stated that a 480-month sentence \u201cmeets the sentencing objectives of punishment, deterrence and incapacitation.\u201d Thompson filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">On appeal, Thompson contends that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to consider properly at sentencing Thompson\u2019s arguments made in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court, in determining a reasonable sentence, must consider the correctly calculated advisory guidelines range and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, an acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice. <em>Id. </em>at 1329-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">We review a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence for reasonableness in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.2006). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">During Thompson\u2019s sentencing hearing, the district court stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the advisory guidelines range. The district court specifically noted Thompson\u2019s extensive criminal history. The district court also listened to and acknowledged all of Thompson\u2019s arguments in mitigation of his sentence, including the fact that his father introduced him to drugs at an early age and that his co-defendants received lesser sentences. The district court was not required to address each fact in mitigation or to address explicitly each \u00a7 3553(a) factor. Given Thompson\u2019s extensive criminal history and the seriousness of his offenses, which included attempts to hide evidence after his arrest, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s 480-month sentences are unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">Thompson also argues that the district court\u2019s application of the firearm enhancement violated his Sixth Amendment rights. This argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1323-24 (11th Cir.2005), in which we concluded that <em>Booker </em>does not prohibit extra-verdict enhancements under an advisory guidelines system. Because Thompson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>was resentenced under an advisory guidelines scheme, there was no Sixth Amendment violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-7\">. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b596-8\">. In his first appeal, with the exception of the <em>Booker </em>challenge to the firearm enhancement, Thompson did not challenge the district court\u2019s guidelines calculations. Thus, the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines, with the exception of the firearm enhancement, is the law of the case. <em>See United States v. Escobar-Urrego, </em>110 F.3d 1556, 1560-61 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b597-9\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the sentencing guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
