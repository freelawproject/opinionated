Specifically, Aguirre-Lopez argues that this sentence was unreasonable because the district court erroneously presumed that a sentence within the Sentencing Guidelines would be reasonable and gave undue weight to the Guidelines. Aguirre-Lopez also argues that we should hold his case until the Supreme Court has decided <em>Rita v. United States.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the sentencing court must not only correctly calculate the guideline imprisonment range, but must also treat that range as advisory and impose a reasonable sentence. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2006). We review a sentence for reasonableness in light of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Martin, </em>455 F.3d 1227, 1237 (11th Cir.2006). This statute provides that the sentencing court shall impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing, namely reflecting the seriousness of the offense, promoting respect for the law, providing just punishment for the offense, deterring criminal conduct, protecting the public from future criminal conduct by the defendant, and providing the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The statute also instructs the sentencing court to consider certain factors, including the history and characteristics of the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">We do not require the district court to discuss or to state that it has explicitly considered each part of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. Instead, an explicit acknowledgment that the district court has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005). The burden of proving that a sentence is unreasonable rests on the sentence challenger. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Here, nothing in the record demonstrates that the district court assumed that a sentence within the guidelines imprisonment range would be reasonable. Rather, the district court explicitly acknowledged that it had the authority to impose any reasonable sentence. Also, the district court expressly stated that it had considered the arguments of both parties and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court ultimately was influenced by Aguirre-Lopez\u2019s criminal history, which is one of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Accordingly, because the district court did not make any erroneous assumption and considered everything required of it before sentencing, the sentence imposed was reasonable. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786; <em>Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324. Therefore, we affirm Aguirre-Lopez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">We also note that because the district court did not presume that a sentence within the guidelines imprisonment range was reasonable, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rita </em>will not affect the outcome of the instant appeal. Therefore, it is unnecessary to hold the instant case until <em>Rita </em>is decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-18\">. On February 20, 2007, the Supreme Court heard arguments to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-19\">1) Was the district court\u2019s choice of within-Guidelines sentence reasonable? 2) In making that determination, is it consistent with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), to accord a presumption of reasonableness to within-Guidelines sentences? 3) If so, can that presumption justify a sentence imposed without an explicit analysis by the district court of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>any other factors that might justify a lesser sentence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJM\"><em>See Rita v.
