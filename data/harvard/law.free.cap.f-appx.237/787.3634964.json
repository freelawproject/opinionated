Horace was also convicted of conspiracy to use firearms in a drug trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(n), three counts of possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1), and being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Because Joseph had previously been convicted of two prior state felony drug offenses, he was sentenced to a mandatory minimum sentence of life in prison under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and \u00a7 846. Horace was also sentenced to an aggregate term of life in prison. The Campbells timely appealed, and their appeals have been consolidated in this court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">The Campbells first challenge the district court\u2019s denial of motions to suppress information obtained from wiretaps. \u201cPri- or to granting an order authorizing a wiretap, the issuing judge must find, in addition to probable cause, that \u2018normal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed or reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Oriakhi, </em>57 F.3d 1290, 1298 (4th Cir.1995) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(3)(c)). We conclude this claim fails because the relevant standard was met and the motions to suppress were properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The Campbells also argue that the Government\u2019s delay in producing certain documents was a violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). The failure to disclose evidence favorable to the accused violates due process \u201cwhere the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment.\u201d <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194. However, \u201cno due process violation occurs as long as <em>Brady </em>material is disclosed to a defendant in time for its effective use at trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith Grading &amp; Paving, Inc., </em>760 F.2d 527, 532 (4th Cir.1985). We conclude this claim fails because the relevant evidence was not material to either Horace or Joseph\u2019s guilt or punishment and, in any event, the material was disclosed in sufficient time for its effective use at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Next, the Campbells argue that the district court violated the Due Process and Ex Post Facto Clauses when it increased the maximum sentence on the basis of facts not charged in the indictment or proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt pursuant to the remedial holding in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 244-71, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We conclude this claim fails because retroactively applying the remedial portion of <em>Booker </em>does not violate the Due Process or Ex Post Facto Clause. <em>See United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 369-70 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">Joseph also argues that the district court inaccurately instructed the jury with regard to the drug amounts attributable to him. We conclude that the jury was properly instructed with regard to its determination of the drug amounts attributable to Joseph.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">Joseph next argues that the indictment and jury instructions were insufficient because they did not require a determination of the time frame that Joseph was actually involved in the conspiracy in order to sentence him to a mandatory minimum life sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and \u00a7 846. We conclude that the indictment and jury instructions were sufficient in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">Additionally, Joseph claims that the jury was required to determine that the two prior convictions were \u201cfelony drug offenses\u201d according to the holding in <em>Booker </em>and its related cases. We conclude this claim fails because the district court could properly make this determination. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number><em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 567-68, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002); <em>United States v. Groce, </em>398 F.3d 679, 682 n. 2 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Finally, while Joseph also argues that his two prior state felony convictions should have been considered one offense, we conclude this claim fails because the three month interval between each offense was sufficient to establish that the two offenses were separate for purposes of sentencing Joseph to a mandatory minimum life sentence. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>187 F.3d 429, 431 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the Appellants\u2019 convictions and sentences. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
