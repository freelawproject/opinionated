In No. 06-2117, the Board adopted and affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s decision denying the Petitioners\u2019 requests for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture, and in No. 07-1173, the Board denied their motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-22\">In their petition for review in No. 06-2117, the Petitioners challenge the determination that they failed to establish their eligibility for asylum. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that the Petitioners fail to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Moreover, we find that substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s determination that the Petitioners failed to meet their burden of establishing that it would not be reasonable for them to relocate to another part of Indonesia. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3)\u00ae (2006). We therefore uphold the denial of asylum relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-24\">Additionally, we uphold the denial of the Petitioners\u2019 request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because the Petitioners fail to show that they are eligible for asylum, they cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal. <em>See also 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(1)\u00ae(B) (2006) (providing that an alien is not eligible for withholding of removal if internal relocation is a reasonable option).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we deny the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>petition for review in No. 06-2117.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">In No. 07-1173, we find that the Petitioners have failed to raise any issues pertaining to the Board\u2019s denial of their motion to reopen. We therefore find that they have failed to preserve any issues for review, <em>see Edwards, </em>178 F.3d at 241 n. 6, and deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: Mozes, </em>No. A95-395-016(L) (B.I.A. Feb. 8, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Accordingly, we deny both petitions for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b824-17\"> In their brief before this court, the Petitioners have failed to raise any challenges to the denial of their request for protection under the Convention Against Torture. We therefore find that they have waived appellate review of this claim. <em>See Edwards v. City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number><em>Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
