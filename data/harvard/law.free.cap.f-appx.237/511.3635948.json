The petitioners argue that the BIA abused its discretion in denying their motion because they submitted previously unavailable evidence showing a material change in country conditions. After review, we deny the petition for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-19\">An applicant may file only one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and that motion \u201cshall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (B). A motion to reopen must be filed no later than 90 days after the final administrative decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The 90-day time limit does not apply if the motion to reopen is filed on the basis of changed circumstances in the country of the movant\u2019s nationality. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c) (7)(C) (ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). To meet this exception, a movant must show material evidence that was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Moreover, the BIA \u201chas discretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the party moving has made out a prima facie case for relief.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). We have held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">[a]t a minimum, there are at least three independent grounds upon which [the BIA] may deny a motion to reopen: 1) failure to establish a prima facie case; 2) failure to introduce evidence that was material and previously unavailable; and 3) a determination that despite the alien\u2019s statutory eligibility for relief, he or she is not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-6\"><em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1302 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Here, the BIA denied petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen because it was untimely and because petitioners failed to show changed conditions in Colombia or offer new, material evidence that was not available at the time of their removal hearing. The BIA affirmed petitioners\u2019 removal order on May 10, 2006. Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen was filed on August 29, 2006, 111 days after the BIA\u2019s May 10 order. The petitioners do not contest the BIA\u2019s finding that their motion to reopen was untimely, but rather argue only that they showed changed country conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen because they failed to introduce evidence that was material and previously unavailable. Petitioners submitted several affidavits from family members in Columbia that stated that petitioners were persecuted and would continue to be persecuted if they returned, but did not attempt to establish a material change in country conditions. Petitioners failed to show that these affidavits previously were unavailable or material. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">Likewise, nothing in the petitioners\u2019 submitted newspaper articles suggests a material change in country conditions. These articles describe incidents of violence by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) during the months in 2006 leading up to and just after national elections, including the reelection of President Uribe, who has cracked down on the FARC. However, several of the articles also suggest that these incidents are merely the latest in the ongoing four-decade-long war the FARC has waged against the Colombian government and rival right-wing paramilitary militias.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">Accordingly, the petitioners failed to show a material change in country conditions or that the information they presented was unavailable at the time of their hearing. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h); <em>Al Najjar, 257 </em>F.3d at 1302. Therefore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-14\">. \"We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Abdi v.
