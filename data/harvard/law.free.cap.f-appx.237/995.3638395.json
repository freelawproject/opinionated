Given the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), Dominguez-Hernandez is correct. <em>See United States v. Estrada-Mendoza, </em>475 F.3d 258, 260-61 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1845, 167 L.Ed.2d 340 (2007). Dominguez-Hernandez\u2019s sentence is vacated as to the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l) adjustment, and the case is remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-9\">Dominguez-Hernandez\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Dominguez-Hernandez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Dominguez-Hernandez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-10\">Dominguez-Hernandez\u2019s motion to summarily affirm in part and to vacate in part and remand for resentencing is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-11\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART FOR RE-SENTENCING; MOTION DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1015-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
