He argues that the district court erred in treating his prior Texas conviction for unlawful delivery of a controlled substance as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d for the purpose of a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). Because Aguilar-Uriostigue did not object to this adjustment below, we review the district court\u2019s determination for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 272 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-17\">As the Texas statute and Aguilar-Uriostigue\u2019s state indictment indicate that he may have been convicted for activity that does not constitute a drug-trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2, the district court plainly erred by applying \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) on this basis. <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 712, 716 (5th Cir.2007). Absent the 16-level adjustment under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i), the applicable guideline range of imprisonment would have been significantly lower than the imposed sentence, even if an 8-level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>adjustment under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) had been applied. This error therefore affected Aguilar-Uriostigue\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, this error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id. </em>Aguilar-Uriostigue\u2019s sentence must therefore be vacated on this basis, and the case remanded for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Aguilar-Uriostigue also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. As Aguilar-Uriostigue concedes, his constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), <em>see Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 276, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED FOR RE-SENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b959-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
