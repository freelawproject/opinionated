Although Deal concedes that his sentences are to be reviewed for reasonableness under this court\u2019s precedent, Deal also asserts that the presumption of reasonableness standard is unconstitutional. There is no need in this case to rely on a presumption of reasonableness, and we explicitly do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-16\">We turn to Deal\u2019s challenges to the reasonableness of his sentences. Specifically, Deal argues that his consecutive sentences of 33 months and 10 months of imprisonment, which are within the applicable advisory sentencing guideline ranges, are unreasonable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) because the district court failed to give the mitigating factors proper consideration. The record belies this argument. The district court listened to the argument of Deal\u2019s counsel urging the court to take into consideration in fashioning Deal\u2019s sentence his military service, his lack of criminal history (with the exception of the pri- or transporting conviction), and his drug use which allegedly led him to commit the second transporting offense. The court expressed concern that an educated man with a military background and an important trucking job would turn to being a felon. The court was also \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the fact that Deal had committed the alien transporting offense while on supervised release for the same offense. The court noted that Deal had received a \u201crelatively lenient sentence\u201d \u2014 eight months \u2014 on the prior transporting case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>The court described itself as \u201cmotivated by those concerns\u201d when it imposed sentence. To argue that the district court did not consider the mitigating factors proffered by Deal or the \u00a7 3553(a) factors generally in fashioning the sentence assessed is simply not consistent with the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Deal has not shown that the 33 month sentence was unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). Deal\u2019s consecutive 10 month sentence on the revocation of supervised release is neither unreasonable nor plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 119-20 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1083, 126 S.Ct. 1804, 164 L.Ed.2d 540 (2006). Accordingly, the judgments of the district court are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b930-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
