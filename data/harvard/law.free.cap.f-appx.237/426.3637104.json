The court found that Patterson\u2019s warrant-less search of Dockery\u2019s apartment did not violate Dockery\u2019s Fourth Amendment constitutional rights. The court also concluded that Patterson is entitled to qualified immunity as to Dockery\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">I. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">On September 30, 2003, Detective Patterson met two officers and another detective from the DeKalb County Police Department at Towering Pines Apartments. (R.l-37 at 3.) Their purpose was to question Courtney Dockery about an armed robbery and aggravated assault. <em>(Id.) </em>Courtney lived with his mother, Carolyn, and brother, Marques, in one of these apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">The officers considered Towering Pines to be a high crime area. (R.l-36, \u201cAffidavit of Pamela Patterson\u201d at 3.) Upon arriving at the apartment, Patterson noticed that the front door was \u201ccracked open.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 4.) Another officer saw that the doorframe had small marks, which he believed indicated forced entry. (R.l-36, \u201cAffidavit of Scott R. Malette\u201d at 3.) The officers knocked and announced \u201cDeKalb Police.\u201d (R.l-36, \u201cAffidavit of Pamela Patterson\u201d at 4.) No one responded. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">While knocking, one officer heard noises from inside. (R.l-36, \u201cAffidavit of Scott R. Malette\u201d at 3.) The officer said the noises sounded like footsteps. <em>(Id.) </em>The officers concluded that a forcible felony was occurring. (R.l-36, \u201cAffidavit of Pamela Patterson\u201d at 5.) The officers opened the door, while continuing to knock and announce \u201cpolice.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-14\">The officers walked down a hallway and encountered Marques in a back room. <em>(Id. </em>at 7.) Patterson asked that Marques show photo identification, which he did. <em>(Id.) </em>Marques explained that his mother was at work; that she could not be reached by telephone; and that Courtney was not home. <em>(Id.) </em>The officers then left. <em>(Id. </em>at 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-15\">Dockery called Patterson that evening. <em>(Id.) </em>Patterson explained that they had entered believing a forced-entry felony was in progress. <em>(Id.) </em>Patterson visited the next day, and Dockery gave written consent for a search of the apartment. <em>(Id.) </em>Patterson subsequently obtained a warrant for the arrest of Courtney. <em>(Id. </em>at 9.) He was eventually arrested, convicted of aggravated assault and armed robbery, and sentenced to ten years in prison. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-16\">II. ISSUES ON APPEAL AND CONTENTION OF THE PARTIES</p>\n<p id=\"b447-17\">Dockery asserts that: (1) the court misapplied the summary judgment standards in rendering its decision in favor of Patterson; (2) the court erroneously found that Patterson met her burden of showing probable cause and exigent circumstances; and (3) the court erred in granting Patterson qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Patterson contends that the search did not violate Dockery\u2019s constitutional rights. Moreover, Patterson contends that even if Dockery could prove a constitutional violation, she is entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">A. Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Dockery contends that the court misapplied the summary judgment standards, failing to view the evidence and all factual inferences in the light most favorable to her, the non-moving party. We find no reversible error, however, in the court\u2019s application of summary judgment standards or in its view of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">B. The Fourth Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">To establish a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must show that she was deprived of a right secured under the U.S. Constitution or federal law and that such a deprivation occurred under color of state law. <em>Arrington v. Cobb County, </em>139 F.3d 865, 872 (11th Cir.1998). We conclude that the question of whether the Fourth Amendment was violated is a difficult one, and we therefore assume <em>arguendo </em>that Patterson violated Dockery\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, and turn to the qualified immunity issue, which we find easier to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">C. Qualified Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">\u201cQualified immunity shields a \u00a7 1983 defendant from liability for harms arising from discretionary acts, as long as the discretionary acts do not violate clearly established federal statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Sauls, </em>206 F.3d 1156, 1164 (11th Cir.2000). Dockery contends that clearly established law gave Patterson notice that this search did not fall into the exigent circumstances exception to the Fourth Amendment. She cites <em>United States v. Holloway, </em>290 F.3d 1331 (11th Cir.2002) and <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>720 F.2d 1520 (11th Cir.1983) as the clearly established law that provided this notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-15\">In <em>Holloway, </em>290 F.3d at 1338, this court held that, based on the exigent circumstances of a 911 call reporting arguing and gunshots, \u201cpolice officers in this case did not violate the Fourth Amendment when they conducted a warrantless search of Appellant\u2019s home.\u201d In <em>Burgos, </em>720 F.2d at 1526, we held that although agents conducted a warrantless search of defendant\u2019s home, the \u201cthreat of injury to the neighborhood and arresting officers justified the avoidance of delay involved in obtaining a warrant.\u201d Nothing in these decisions establishes that Patterson\u2019s conduct violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-16\">We have recognized an \u201cemergency\u201d exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement. Where officers reasonably believe that a person is in danger, and immediate response is required, the \u201cemergency\u201d exception applies. <em>Holloway, </em>290 F.3d at 1331. However, the Defendant must show both probable cause<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and exigency. <em>Id. </em>at 1337. Based on the facts presented and the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that Patterson demonstrated arguable probable cause and exigency. The totality of the circumstances included \u201ca visibly unsecured door ... the rampant burglaries and crimes in Towering Pines Apartment complex ... and [Patterson\u2019s] knowledge, through a fellow officer, that noises were heard in the apartment.\u201d (R.l-36, \u201cAffidavit of Pamela <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Patterson\u201d at 5-6.) Additionally, another officer testified that \u201cthere were small tool marks on the doorframe, which appeared to be indicative of the use of some small, sharp tool.\u201d (R.l-36, \u201cAffidavit of Scott R. Malette\u201d at 3.) The \u201cfacts and circumstances within the collective knowledge of the law enforcement officials ... are sufficient to cause a person of reasonable caution to believe that an offense has been or is being committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Blasco, 702 </em>F.2d 1315, 1324 (11th Cir.1983). Therefore, we find no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that Patterson is entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Dockery\u2019s motion for summary judgment and the grant of summary judgment to Patterson.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b447-10\">.
