They alleged that their immediate supervisor, Richard Fetner, made repeated and unwelcome sexual remarks to them and touched them inappropriately at various times throughout their employment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Fetner\u2019s last harassing act occurred on August 1, 2004. Yet they did not report Fetner\u2019s behavior to officials at Jeld-Wen, Inc., until October 13, 2004. Upon investigation, Fetner promptly resigned, and the plant where Minix and the Simses worked was shut down shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-16\">Following discovery, the district court, 2006 WL 2971654, granted summary judgment to Jeld-Wen, Inc., holding the company not vicariously liable for Fetner\u2019s harassment. The district court concluded that none of the plaintiffs suffered a tangi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>ble employment action and that Jeld-Wen, Inc., successfully established both elements of the vicarious-liability affirmative defense spelled out in <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998), and <em>Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. 742, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Minix and the Simses appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">On appeal, Minix and the Simses collectively argue:</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">First, that the <em>Faragher/Ellerth </em>affirmative defense to vicarious liability is inapplicable because Jeld-Wen, Inc., is directly liable for Fetner\u2019s harassment; its direct liability stemming from either</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">(a) the fact that the company had actual notice about Fetner\u2019s harassment of their co-worker, Kathy Thornton, yet failed to take remedial action, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">(b) the fact that the company had constructive notice of Fetner\u2019s harassing behavior toward multiple female employees, yet failed to take remedial action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">Second, that Jeld-Wen, Inc., is vicariously liable for Fetner\u2019s harassment and not entitled to avail itself of the <em>Faragher/Ellerth </em>affirmative defense because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">(a) Jeld-Wen, Inc., did not exercise reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct Fetner\u2019s behavior; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-10\">(b) Minix and the Simses reasonably complied with the reporting provisions of the company\u2019s anti-harassment policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">Linda Sims separately argues that, with respect to her claim, Jeld-Wen, Inc., cannot avail itself of the <em>Faragher/Ellerth </em>affirmative defense because the harassment she suffered resulted in a tangible employment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-14\">We will address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-15\">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b600-16\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, applying the same standard that bound the district court and viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving parties. <em>See Drago v. Jenne, </em>453 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when \u2018there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-17\">II. DIRECT LIABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"AQL\">A. Actual Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b600-18\">Minix and the Simses first argue that Jeld-Wen, Inc., actually knew about Fetner\u2019s harassment, yet failed to take steps to remedy it. If that is true, then JeldWen, Inc., is directly liable for the harassment on the basis of its own negligence. <em>See Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. at 759, 118 S.Ct. at 2267 (\u201c[A]n employer can be liable [for a supervisor\u2019s sexual harassment] where its own negligence is a cause of the harassment. An employer is negligent with respect to sexual harassment if it knew or should have known about the conduct and failed to stop it.\u201d); <em>see also Dees v. Johnson Controls World Servs. Inc., </em>168 F.3d 417, 421 (11th Cir.1999). To support their argument, Minix and the Simses say that their co-worker, Kathy Thornton, who worked under Fetner and who was also sexually harassed by him, reported Fet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>ner\u2019s harassment to fellow employee Joe Mendoza as early as September 2008. Because Mendoza was told of Fetner\u2019s harassment, Minix and the Simses reason that Jeld-Wen, Inc., itself had actual notice of it and should be held hable for not preventing Fetner\u2019s further harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"A7CS\">At all relevant times, Jeld-Wen, Inc., maintained a written anti-harassment policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That policy required that complaints of sexual harassment be reported to the harassed employee\u2019s \u201cimmediate Supervisor\u201d or to the harassed employee\u2019s \u201cGeneral or Corporate Manager, Vice President or Subsidiary President\u201d or to a member of the Jeld-Wen, Inc., \u201cLegal Department.\u201d Mendoza, however, was a Group Manager \u2014 i.e., a foreman \u2014 of a six-employee department that did not include Thornton. Thus Mendoza was not Thornton\u2019s supervisor \u2014 immediate or otherwise, Nor was Mendoza a \u201cGeneral or Corporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Manager, Vice President or Subsidiary-President,\u201d or a member of the \u201cLegal Department.\u201d Accordingly, Mendoza was not one of the persons specifically designated by Jeld-Wen, Inc.\u2019s anti-harassment policy to receive harassment complaints. This fact is dispositive of Minix and the Simses\u2019 \u201cactual notice\u201d argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">We held in <em>Coates v. Sundor Brands, Inc. </em>that when an employer promulgates an adequate and reasonable anti-harassment policy the employer \u201citself answer[s] the question of when it [is] deemed to have notice of the harassment sufficient to obligate it or its agents to take prompt and appropriate remedial measures.\u201d 164 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.1999). And we said in <em>Madray v. Publix Supermarkets, Inc. </em>that once an anti-harassment policy has been effectively disseminated to an employer\u2019s employees \u201cit is incumbent upon the employees to utilize the procedural mechanisms established by the company specifically to address the problems and grievances.\u201d 208 F.3d 1290, 1298-99 (11th Cir.2000) (citation omitted). We concluded in <em>Madray </em>that the employer did not have actual notice of sexual harassment because the aggrieved employee brought her complaints \u201cto individuals <em>not designated </em>by [the employer] <em>to receive or process sexual harassment complaints.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). In this case, when Thornton complained about Fetner to Mendoza \u2014 who, again, was not her immediate supervisor and did not hold a management position mentioned in the anti-harassment policy \u2014 she, like the employee in <em>Madray, </em>complained to an individual \u201cnot designated [by Jeld-Wen, Inc.] to receive or process sexual harassment complaints.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we conclude that Thornton\u2019s complaint to Mendoza did not put Jeld-Wen, Inc., on actual notice of Fetner\u2019s sexual harassment, and the company cannot be held directly liable on that ground. <em>See id. </em>at 1294 n. 3</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">B. Constructive Notice</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">Minix and the Simses next argue that Jeld-Wen, Inc., should be charged with constructive notice of Fetner\u2019s harassing behavior because \u201cFetner was harassing six female employees simultaneously.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at 17. As a general rule, constructive notice of sexual harassment, when combined with a failure to act, is sufficient to impose direct liability on an employer based on the employer\u2019s own negligence \u201cwhen the harassment was so severe and pervasive that management reasonably should have known of it.\u201d <em>Watson v. Blue Circle, Inc., </em>324 F.3d 1252, 1259 (11th Cir.2003). But in this case Minix and the Simses cannot rely on constructive notice as a basis for holding JeldWen, Inc., directly liable for Fetner\u2019s harassment. That is because, as noted above and as discussed below in the context of the <em>Faragher/Ellerth </em>affirmative defense, Jeld-Wen, Inc., had in place at the time of Fetner\u2019s harassment an effectively disseminated written anti-harassment policy. The presence of that written policy forecloses resort to constructive notice as a means of establishing the notice required for direct liability. <em>See Dees, </em>168 F.3d at 422 (stating that \u201cin regard to the direct liability standard ... the employer\u2019s notice of the harassment is of paramount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>importance\u201d and that actual or constructive notice \u201cis required for direct liability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">We held in <em>Farley v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co. </em>that \u201conce a company has developed and promulgated an effective and comprehensive anti-sexual harassment policy, aggressively and thoroughly disseminated the information and procedures contained in the policy to its staff, and demonstrated a commitment to adhering to this policy, it has fulfilled its obligation to make reasonably diligent efforts to \u2018know what is going on\u2019 within the company.\u201d 115 F.3d 1548, 1554 (11th Cir.1997). In <em>Farley </em>we concluded as a matter of law that \u201can employer is insulated from liability under Title VII for a hostile environment sexual harassment claim <em>premised on constructive knowledge </em>of the harassment when the employer has adopted an anti-discrimination policy that is comprehensive, well-known to employees, vigorously enforced, and provides alternative means of redress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Minix and the Simses argue that the <em>Farley </em>rule does not apply in this case. For support, they cite on our decision in <em>Watson v. Blue Circle, Inc., </em>a hostile-environment sexual harassment case in which we determined that the district court erred when it relied on the <em>Farley </em>rule as a basis for granting summary judgment to the employer. 324 F.3d 1252, 1259 (11th Cir.2003). The district court erred, we held, because there was a disputed issue of fact about whether \u201c[the employer] ha[d] an <em>effective </em>sexual harassment policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Our decision in <em>Watson </em>turned on the questionable effectiveness of the employer\u2019s anti-harassment policy and is, for that reason, distinguishable from this case. <em>See also Miller v. Kenworth of Dothan, Inc., </em>277 F.3d 1269, 1279-80 (11th Cir.2002) (refusing to apply the <em>Farley </em>rule where the anti-harassment policy at issue was not \u201ceither comprehensive or effective\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">Our holdings in <em>Watson </em>and <em>Miller </em>were compelled by <em>Farley\u2019s </em>recognition that \u201c[w]here there is no policy, or where there is an <em>ineffective or incomplete </em>policy, the employer remains liable for conduct that is so severe and pervasive as to confer constructive knowledge.\u201d <em>Farley, </em>115 F.3d at 1554 (emphasis added). Here, in contrast to <em>Watson </em>and <em>Miller, </em>Jeld-Wen, Inc., had in place an anti-harassment policy that was both comprehensive and vigorously enforced. It was neither incomplete nor ineffective.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consequently, the <em>Farley </em>rule applies and Minix and the Simses cannot establish liability against Jeld-Wen, Inc., <em>on </em>the basis of the <em>company\u2019s </em>constructive notice of Fetner\u2019s harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">III. VICARIOUS LIABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">Direct liability to the side, Minix and the Simses argue that Jeld-Wen, Inc., is vicariously liable for Fetner\u2019s harassment. Generally, \u201c[a]n employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate ... authority over the employee.\u201d <em>Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. at 765, 118 S.Ct. at 2270. If the harassing supervisor takes a tangible employment action against the victimized employee, the employer will be vicariously liable to the employee without the benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>of a legal defense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 762-63, 118 S.Ct. at 2269; <em>see also Dees, </em>168 F.3d at 422; <em>see also Frederick v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., </em>246 F.3d 1305, 1311 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201c[W]hen a supervisor engages in harassment which results in an adverse \u2018tangible employment action\u2019 against the employee, the employer is automatically held vicariously liable for the harassment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">But \u201c[w]hen no tangible employment action is taken, a defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages.\u201d <em>Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. at 765, 118 S.Ct. at 2270. The <em>Faragher/Ellerth </em>vicarious-liability defense \u201ccomprises two necessary elements: (a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The employer has the burden of proving each element by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">A. Reasonable Care to Prevent and Correct Harassment</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">To establish the first element of the <em>Faragher/Ellerth </em>affirmative defense, Jeld-Wen, Inc., must show that it \u201cexercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior.\u201d <em>Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. at 765, 118 S.Ct. at 2270. Although \u201can employer\u2019s showing that it has a sexual harassment policy does not automatically satisfy\u201d the first element of the <em>Faragher/Ellerth </em>defense, <em>Frederick, </em>246 F.3d at 1314, the presence of such a policy is nevertheless a highly relevant factor, and we have consistently held that where an employer promulgates a comprehensive anti-harassment policy \u2014 one that is effectively communicated to employees and that contains reasonable complaint procedures \u2014 the employer has satisfied its burden on the prevention prong of the first element.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Baldwin v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield, </em>480 F.3d 1287, 1303 (11th Cir.2007); <em>Walton v. Johnson &amp; Johnson Servs., Inc., </em>347 F.3d 1272, 1287 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Madray, </em>208 F.3d at 1298-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">At all relevant times, Jeld-Wen, Inc., maintained a comprehensive anti-harassment policy that was effectively communicated to its employees, including Minix and the Simses. In addition to having received a copy of the policy when they were hired, Jeld-Wen, Inc.\u2019s employees received extensive training about the policy in the summer of 2003 in the wake of Minix\u2019s complaint of sexual harassment against fellow employee Ronald Bowen.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That train<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>ing was conducted by Rob Sturm, Senior Corporate Counsel in Jeld-Wen, Inc.\u2019s in-house legal department. Minix and the Simses attended the training session and were well aware of the policy\u2019s terms and its reporting provisions. There is no dispute about the fact that the policy was effectively distributed to the company\u2019s employees or that Minix and the Simses understood its requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The policy is very explicit about the manner in which perceived harassment is to be reported. The policy expressly identifies five categories of workers (and one entire corporate department) to whom sexual harassment complaints must be brought. In relevant part, the policy states: \u201cAny employee who believes that he/she is being subject to objectionable conduct should promptly notify either their immediate supervisor, their General or Corporate Manager, Vice President or Subsidiary President, or the Legal Department.\u201d The policy lists the telephone number of the Legal Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Minix and the Simses say that Jeld-Wen, Inc.\u2019s anti-harassment policy was not effective (and therefore cannot be relied upon to establish the prevention prong of the first element of the <em>Faragher/Ellerth </em>defense) because it was incapable of being vigorously enforced. They insist that the pokey\u2019s major shortcoming \u2014 its vagueness and indefiniteness \u2014 is evidenced by the fact that two corporate officials held different views about whether certain conduct would violate the policy. They also insist that Jeld-Wen, Inc., does not take sexual harassment seriously, and this, they say, is evidenced by the fact that Fetner, upon his resignation, received roughly $8,000 in severance pay to which he was not entitled under company rules. We are not persuaded that either of these facts undermines the effectiveness of the anti-harassment policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Any argument that the policy was rendered ineffective due to reasonable disagreements about the scope of its coverage, or that the company did not take harassment seriously, is fatally undermined by the thorough and comprehensive investigations undertaken by Jeld-Wen, Inc., to determine the veracity of the allegations against both Bowen (in 2003) and Fetner (in 2004). The investigations that were conducted \u2014 the effectiveness of which cannot be doubted, given that both resulted in the near-immediate resignations of the alleged harassers \u2014 clearly demonstrate that Jeld-Wen, Inc., vigorously and systematically enforced its anti-harassment policy in an effort to honor its pledge, stated in the policy itself, that \u201c[h]arassment in any form will not be tolerated by the company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">We conclude that Jeld-Wen, Inc., has established the first element of the <em>Faragher/Ellerth </em>defense \u2014 that it \u201cexercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior.\u201d <em>Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. at 765, 118 S.Ct. at 2270.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">B. Compliance with the Anti-Harassment Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">To establish the second element of the <em>Faragher/Ellerth </em>defense, Jeld-Wen, Inc., must show that Minix and the Simses unreasonably failed to take advantage of the anti-harassment policy\u2019s complaint procedures or otherwise failed to avoid harm. <em>See Frederick, </em>246 F.3d at 1315. According to the EEOC charges filed by the plaintiffs, the Simses were last harassed by Fetner on August 1, 2004, and Minix was last harassed by Fetner on July 1, 2004. Yet they did not report Fetner\u2019s harassment to any company official specifically designated by the anti-harassment policy until months later on October 13, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>2004.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That is the date on which the plaintiffs met with Dan Hees, a Coordinating General Manager at Jeld-Wen, Inc. Hees was one of the policy-designated officials authorized to receive sexual harassment complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">The Court in <em>Ellerth </em>stated that, although it is not strictly necessary, an employee\u2019s <em>\u201cunreasonable </em>failure to use any complaint procedure provided by the employer ... will normally suffice to satisfy the employer\u2019s burden under the second element of the defense.\u201d 524 U.S. at 765, 118 S.Ct. at 2270 (emphasis added). With that principle in mind, we have held that an employee unreasonably fails to take advantage of her employer\u2019s complaint procedures if she does \u201cnot us[e] the procedures in place <em>to promptly report </em>any harassment.\u201d <em>Baldwin, </em>480 F.3d at 1306 (emphasis added). We explained that, absent an extreme situation, a failure to promptly report the harassment \u201cis sufficient to establish the second element of the <em>[Faragher/Ellerth] </em>defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1306, 1307.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">In <em>Baldwin, </em>we emphasized that the harassed employee was under a \u201cprompt reporting duty\u201d \u2014 a duty expressly imposed by her employer\u2019s anti-harassment policy and by \u201cthe prophylactic rules the Supreme Court built into Title VII in the <em>Faragher </em>and <em>Ellerth </em>decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held that the employee \u201cwaited too late to complain\u201d about the harassment she had been subjected to because \u201c[h]er complaint came three months and two weeks after the first proposition incident and three months and one week after the second one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1307. The employee in <em>Baldwin </em>failed to comply with her reporting duty, we noted, because her complaints were \u201canything but prompt, early, or soon.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">The same is true here. Title VII and the explicit terms of Jeld-Wen, Inc.\u2019s anti-harassment policy placed Minix and the Simses under a \u201cprompt reporting duty\u201d just like the reporting duty we discussed in <em>Baldwin. </em>In fact, using identical language, Jeld-Wen, Inc.\u2019s policy says that an aggrieved employee \u201cshould <em>promptly notify\u201d </em>an appropriate company official about any \u201cobjectionable conduct\u201d she experiences. (Emphasis added.) Minix did not promptly notify any appropriate company official about Fetner\u2019s harassment. Her complaint to Dan Hees, made on October 13, 2004, came roughly three years after she claims to have been first harassed by Fetner. Nor did the Simses promptly notify any appropriate company official about Fetner\u2019s harassment. Their complaint to Hees, also made on October 13, 2004, came six months and two weeks after Linda Sims claims to have been first harassed by Fetner and four months and two weeks after Brenda Sims claims to have been first harassed by him. Like the employee in <em>Baldwin, </em>Minix and the Sims-es \u201cwait[ed] too late to complain\u201d and therefore unreasonably failed to comply with the reporting requirement set forth in Jeld-Wen, Inc.\u2019s anti-harassment policy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>We conclude that Jeld-Wen, Inc., has successfully established the second element of the <em>Faragher/Ellerth </em>defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">IV. TANGIBLE EMPLOYMENT ACTION</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Finally, Linda Sims argues that JeldWen, Inc., cannot avail itself of the <em>Faragher/Ellerth </em>defense because she was subjected to a tangible employment action. <em>See supra </em>at 583-84, In opposition to Jeld-Wen, Inc.\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Sims argued that when she rebuffed Fetner\u2019s sexual advances, Fetner ordered another employee to send Sims home from work, thus reducing the number of hours she could work and the amount of money she could earn.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This, she said, constituted a tangible employment action because it affected the terms and conditions of her employment. The district court recognized that Sims\u2019s allegation amounted to a tangible employment action, but rejected this as a basis for recovering against Jeld-Wen, Inc. The court held that Sims could not show a causal connection between Fetner\u2019s harassment and the fact that she was sent home early from work \u2014 events that the district court determined occurred nearly two months apart from each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">We too reject Sims\u2019s Title VII claim to the extent that it is premised on the occurrence of a tangible employment action. We do so because Sims did not allege facts in her EEOC charge from which it could be reasonably inferred that Fetner took a tangible employment action against her.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Instead, the facts alleged in Sims\u2019s EEOC charge demonstrate that she was alleging discrimination against JeldWen, Inc., solely under a hostile-environment theory. These are the only facts alleged in Sims\u2019s EEOC charge;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-10\">I began my employment during April of 2004 as a Router. Almost from the beginning of my employment I have been subjected to sexual harassment from the plant manager consisting of sexual comments regarding my body parts, requests to go out on dates, touching my body around the waist, placing his arms around me and pulling me close to his body. He often referred to my buttocks as basketballs and he would say he wanted to go dribbling. I rejected the harassment but it continues. I believe I am being discriminated against because of my sex, female, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">As is clear from her EEOC charge, Sims did not allege that her refusal to submit to Fetner\u2019s sexual demands culminated in a tangible employment action \u2014 e.g. a reduction in hours<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>\u2014the very allegation she is now pursuing judicially.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">\u201cThe starting point of ascertaining the permissible scope of a judicial complaint alleging employment discrimination is the administrative charge and investigation.\u201d <em>Alexander v. Fulton County, Ga., </em>207 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>1303, 1332 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cNo action alleging a violation of Title VII may be brought unless the alleged discrimination has been made the subject of a timely-filed EEOC charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cEEOC regulations provide that charges should contain, among other things, \u2018[a] clear and concise statement of the facts, including pertinent dates, constituting the alleged unlawful employment practices.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA plaintiffs judicial complaint is limited by the scope of the EEOC investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Although we have stated that \u201cthe scope of an EEOC complaint should not be strictly interpreted,\u201d we have also been careful to \u201ccaution[] that allegations of new acts of discrimination are inappropriate.\u201d <em>Gregory v. Ga. Dep\u2019t of Human Resources, </em>355 F.3d 1277, 1279-80 (11th Cir.2004). We will consider judicial claims only if they \u201camplify, clarify, or more clearly focus the allegations in the EEOC complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1279. We must ask, then, whether the claims pursued in the judicial proceeding are \u201clike or related to, or grew out of, the allegations contained in [the employee\u2019s] EEOC charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">An allegation of harassment premised on a supervisor\u2019s tangible employment action is not \u201clike or related to\u201d and does not \u201cgr[o]w out of\u2019 an allegation of harassment premised solely on the existence of a hostile working environment. Those theories are wholly distinct and represent entirely different ways of demonstrating a violation of Title VII. Consequently, Sims\u2019s new allegation that Fetner took a tangible employment action against her does not in any way \u201camplify, clarify, or more clearly focus\u201d any of the hostile-environment allegations made in her EEOC charge. Rather, Sims\u2019s tangible-employment-action allegation is an \u201callegation[ ] of [a] new aet[ ] of discrimination\u201d that we have said is \u201cinappropriate\u201d where, as here, it has not been alleged in a previous EEOC charge. <em>See Gregory, </em>355 F.3d at 1279-80; <em>see also Cheek v. Western and Southern Life Ins. Co., </em>31 F.3d 497, 503 (7th Cir.1994) (\u201cWhen an EEOC charge alleges a particular theory of discrimination, allegations of a different type of discrimination in a subsequent complaint are not reasonably related to them unless the allegations in the complaint can be reasonably inferred from the facts alleged in the charge.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">To the extent that Sims attempted to rest her Title VII claim in the district court on a tangible employment action by Fetner, the claim was not properly before the court because allegations of such a claim were never made the subject of an EEOC charge of discrimination \u2014 a prerequisite to suit.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-9\">. Minix\u2019s EEOC charge says that she was harassed by Fetner as early as September 1, 2001, but that Fetner\u2019s harassment ended by July 1, 2004. Linda Sims\u2019s EEOC charge says that she was harassed by Fetner between April 1, 2004, and August 1, 2004. Brenda Sims\u2019s EEOC charge says that she was harassed by Fetner between June 1, 2004, and August 1, 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b600-12\">. For purposes of summary judgment only, Jeld-Wen, Inc., conceded in the district court (and concedes on appeal) that Fetner unlawfully harassed Minix and the Simses. Thus, in resolving Jeld-Wen, Inc.\u2019s summaiy-judgment motion, the district court focused exclusively on the issue of liability. Likewise, JeldWen, Inc.'s liability is the only issue before us in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b601-4\">. Jeld-Wen, Inc.\u2019s anti-harassment policy stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">JELD-WEN strives to provide a productive and comfortable working environment free from harassment or discrimination including that which may be construed to be offensive sexual conduct. This policy applies to every aspect of the employment relationship throughout the organization and to the dealings of employees with one another, as well as with vendors and customers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">Harassment in any form will not be tolerated by the company. Any employee who violates this policy is subject to discipline up to and including discharge. In addition, any client, customer or vendor of the company who engages in such conduct will be informed of our policy and will be dealt with accordingly, with the aim of completely eliminating the harassment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">Harassment includes, but is not limited to, the following behaviors, if such behaviors create an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">\u2022 Verbal Harassment: Derogatory comments, jokes, slurs or abusive language</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-10\">\u2022 Physical Harassment: Unwanted physical contact or assault,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-11\">\u2022 Visual Harassment: Leering, making sexual gestures, displaying derogatory or sexually suggestive objects, pictures, posters, cartoons, drawings, or clothing printed with derogatory material.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-12\">\u2022 Sexual Harassment: Unwelcome sexual advances, request for sexual favors, offering employment benefits in exchange for sexual favors, or any other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature that is directed toward an individual because of that person\u2019s gender.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-13\">Employees will be made aware of this policy and are encouraged to not tolerate harassment. Any employee who believes that he/she is being subject to objectionable conduct should promptly notify either their immediate Supervisor, their General or Corporate Manager, Vice President or Subsidiary President, or the Legal Department at (541) 882-3451. Any Supervisor, General or Corprorate Manager, Vice President or Subsidiary President, who has questions concerning harassment complaints shall contact the Legal Department. Additionally employees are encouraged to report any conduct they may witness against someone else, whether verbal, visual, physical, sexual, or otherwise, that they believe constitutes harassment. They should follow the same steps of contacting their immediate Supervisor, their General or Corporate Manager, Vice President, Subsidiary President, or Legal Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-15\">Every complaint of harassment will be investigated promptly, thoroughly, fairly, and objectively. A written investigative report will be completed for each complaint. The investigator will take detailed statements from the person making the complaint, the alleged harasser, the harassee, and the witnesses. The complaint will be kept as confidential as possible: information will be disseminated on a \"need-to-know\u201d basis only. Basic results of the investigation will be reported to the individual registering the complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-16\">If the information collected during the investigation establishes that harassment or other objectionable conduct did occur, disciplinary action will be promptly taken against the harasser, up to and including termination if appropriate. Employees will not be discriminated or retaliated against for reporting harassment or participating in an investigation.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b602-5\">. We reject as without merit the argument made by Minix and the Simses that Jeld-Wen, Inc.\u2019s anti-harassment policy is ambiguous with respect to identifying those officials authorized to receive harassment complaints; specifically, their argument that a jury could reasonably conclude that Mendoza\u2019s status as a manager \u2014 albeit a Group Manager \u2014 meant that he too was designated by the policy to receive harassment complaints. Under the policy\u2019s plain terms the only managers designated to receive complaints are General Managers and Corporate Managers. Mendoza was neither.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b603-7\">. For the reasons stated by the district court in its summary-judgment order, we reject the argument advanced by Minix and the Simses that Jeld-Wen, Inc.\u2019s anti-harassment policy was rendered ineffective by the fact that two company officials reached different conclusions about whether particular conduct would suffice to constitute sexual harassment under the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b604-8\">. Linda Sims argues below that Fetner subjected her to a tangible employment action, thus making Jeld-Wen, Inc., automatically vicariously liable to her and rendering the <em>Faragher/Ellerth </em>defense inapplicable. For the reasons stated below, we reject this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b604-9\">. \u201cThe first element of the <em>Faragher/Ellerth </em>affirmative defense requires that an employer demonstrate that it took reasonable care both to prevent <em>and </em>correct harassment.\u201d <em>Frederick, </em>246 F.3d at 1314. Neither Minix nor the Simses argue that Jeld-Wen, Inc., failed to promptly remedy Fetner\u2019s harassment. We conclude, as discussed below, that Jeld-Wen, Inc., has satisfied the remedial prong of the first element of the <em>Faragher/Ellerth </em>defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b604-13\">. Upon investigation into Minix\u2019s complaint against Bowen, Bowen promptly resigned from Jeld-Wen, Inc. Following Minix's complaint about Bowen, which Minix first made on June 27, 2003, Bowen continued to work at the plant for about three weeks while the investigation was being conducted, until his abrupt resignation on July 23, 2003. Despite the fact that Minix\u2019s problem with Bowen was resolved almost immediately, Minix maintains that she was dissatisfied with the company\u2019s response. In our view, however, Jeld-Wen, Inc.\u2019s swift response demonstrates that the company vigorously enforced its anti-harassment policy. Minix\u2019s complaint against Bowen forms no part of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b606-6\">. Before that date, they did not report Fetner's harassment to anyone \u2014 a policy-designated official or otherwise \u2014 at Jeld-Wen, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b606-7\">. Minix, for her part, explains that her decision to wait so long to complain about Fetner\u2019s harassment was reasonable based on her dissatisfaction with the way Jeld-Wen, Inc., handled her complaint against Bowen in 2003. Jeld-Wen, Inc., however, launched an immediate investigation into Minix\u2019s complaint against Bowen, and he abruptly resigned mere weeks after her complaint was made. Because Jeld-Wen, Inc.\u2019s response to the Bowen complaint was beyond reproach, we reject Minix\u2019s reasonable-delay argument as wholly without merit. The Simses offer no reason for their delay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b607-8\">. Jeld-Wen, Inc., says that Sims failed to make this argument in the district court and that we should, for that reason, reject it on appeal. Although the argument was made in the district court (albeit not forcefully), for the reasons discussed below, we reject it because Sims did not allege a tangible employment action in either her EEOC charge or in her complaint; she made the allegation for the first time in opposition to summary judgment \u2014 which, even if Title VII did not contain an exhaustion requirement, would be too late. <em>See Gilmour v. Gates, McDonald and Co., </em>382 F.3d 1312, 1313 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b607-14\">. Nor did Sims make such an allegation in her judicial complaint. Rather, Sims made this allegation for the first time in her brief in opposition to summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b607-15\">. <em>See Cotton v. Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc., 434 </em>F.3d 1227, 1231 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b608-6\">. We may affirm the judgment of the district court for any reason supported by the record. <em>See United States v. $121,100.00 in U.S. Currency, </em>999 F.2d 1503, 1507 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
