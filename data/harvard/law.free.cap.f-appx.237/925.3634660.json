He argues that the district court erred in increasing his offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines based on a determination that his prior Michigan conviction for attempted felonious assault with a knife (Mich. Compiled Laws \u00a7 750.82) was a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 (producing an otherwise unchallenged advisory guideline sentencing range of 46-57 months).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-20\">Avila-Nava acknowledges that we determined in <em>United States v. Saucedo-Roman, </em>202 Fed.Appx. 723 (2006), that the Michigan offense of felonious assault is a crime of violence because it falls within the definition of the enumerated offense of aggravated assault. He notes that <em>Saucedo-Roman </em>is nonprecedential and argues that it was wrongly decided. <em>Saucedo-Roman </em>is consistent with our published opinion in <em>United States v. Sanchez-Ruedas, </em>452 F.3d 409 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 315, 166 L.Ed.2d 237 (2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, \u201c[a]n at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>tempt to commit an offense that qualifies as a crime of violence is also a crime of violence.\u201d <em>United States v. Tzep-Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 522, 525 n. 4 (5th Cir.2006). The district court did not err by adjusting Avila-Nava\u2019s offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Avila-Nava\u2019s constitutional challenge to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Su preme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Avila-Nava properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b946-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
