The Board\u2019s order assessed a $1,500 civil penalty against Hopkins for operating an aircraft carelessly and without proper certifications. The assessment resulted from Hopkins\u2019s August 2003 collision with a power line and forced landing while operating a two-seat \u201cParaseender II.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">For reversal, Hopkins argues that, at the time of the August 2003 incident, he was the sole occupant of the Paraseender II, and it therefore qualified as an \u201cultralight vehicle\u201d under Part 103 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.1 (\u201can ultralight vehicle is a vehicle that: (a) Is used or intended to be used for manned operation in the air by a single occupant\u201d). As such, Hopkins continues, the regulations cited against him by the FAA did not apply to his operation of his Paraseender II.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-14\">In response, the Administrator agrees that ultralight vehicles are not regulated to the same degree as other aircraft. However, the Administrator argues, Hopkins\u2019s Paraseender II did not qualify as an ultralight vehicle under section 103.1(a) because it had two seats. The Administrator explains that Part 103 was promulgated with the recognition that ultralight vehicles are generally used in sparsely populated areas for recreation or sport and involve personal risks of which passengers on such vehicles cannot be presumed to know; thus, ultralight vehicles were purposely defined in the regulations as accommodating no more than one occupant (except if used for instructional purposes, for which an authorized exemption is required).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-15\">Jurisdiction in this court is proper under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 46110, 46301(d)(6). This court has exclusive jurisdiction to affirm, amend, modify, or set aside any part of the Board\u2019s order. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110(c). We review the Board\u2019s order to \u201cdetermine whether it was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or contrary to law, giving substantial deference to the FAA\u2019s interpretation of its statutes and regulations.\u201d <em>Edwards v. FAA, </em>367 F.3d 764, 767 (8th Cir.2004) (citation omitted); <em>see also Martin v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>499 U.S. 144, 150, 111 S.Ct. 1171, 113 L.Ed.2d 117 (1991) (\u201cIt is well established that an agency\u2019s construction of its own regulations is entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>to substantial deference.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Upon careful review, we hold that the Board\u2019s decision was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or contrary to law, and we defer to the Administrator\u2019s reasonable interpretation of section 103.1(a). <em>See Trans States Airlines, Inc. v. FAA, </em>439 F.3d 863, 864 (8th Cir.2006) (\u201cThe Supreme Court has cautioned courts to be hesitant to substitute an alternative reading for the [agencyl\u2019s unless that alternative reading is compelled by the regulation\u2019s plain language or by other indications of the [agency]\u2019s intent at the time of the regulation\u2019s promulgation.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Edwards, </em>367 F.3d at 768 (deference to administrative agency\u2019s reasonable construction of statute is appropriate where agency is entrusted with administration of statute); <em>cf. Watkins v. NTSB, </em>178 F.3d 959, 961 (8th Cir.1999) (per curiam) (whether agency\u2019s action is arbitrary and capricious depends on whether agency offered explanation for any decision that runs counter to evidence or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to difference in view or product of agency expertise). Moreover, substantial evidence presented at the hearing before the ALJ supported the Board\u2019s finding that information explaining the FAA\u2019s interpretation of section 103.1(a) was publicly available during the relevant time period. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46301(d)(6) (findings of fact of Board are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Accordingly, Hopkins\u2019s petition for review is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
