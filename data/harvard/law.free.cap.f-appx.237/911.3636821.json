The Supreme Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We requested and received supplemental briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b932-11\">In the district court and on appeal, Harrison challenged on Sixth Amendment grounds the district court\u2019s enhancement of his sentence. In his supplemental brief, Harrison challenges his sentences and his convictions on both counts on Sixth Amendment grounds in the light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b932-14\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court applied the Sixth Amendment holdings in <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. Specifically, the Court held that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738. The Court also excised 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) of the Sentencing Reform Act, rendering the Federal Sentencing Guidelines effectively advisory. <em>Id. </em>at 258-60, 125 S.Ct. 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-15\">Because the Supreme Court vacated and remanded this case for further consideration in light of <em>Booker, </em>Harrison\u2019s arguments that he was deprived of a fair trial because the Government introduced perjured testimony and withheld favorable evidence are not \u201cwithin the purview of the mandate of the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>See Gradsky v. United States, </em>376 F.2d 993, 996 (5th Cir.1967). To the extent that Harrison\u2019s supplemental brief challenges the sufficiency of the indictment, the sufficiency of the evidence, and the jury\u2019s verdict, these issues too are beyond the scope of the <em>Booker </em>remand. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b932-16\">Harrison preserved his Sixth Amendment challenge in the district court. <em>See United States v. Olis, </em>429 F.3d 540, 544 (5th Cir.2005). As the Government concedes, the district court committed error under <em>Booker </em>by enhancing Harrison\u2019s base offense level by two levels for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 based on the district court\u2019s factual findings. The Government concedes that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>cannot show that the <em>Booker </em>error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 286 (5th Cir.2005). Where, as here, a <em>Booker </em>error has been preserved in the district court and this court cannot say that the error is harmless, this court \u201cwill ordinarily vacate the sentence and remand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 284 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Harrison argues that resentencing \u25a0violates the Double Jeopardy Clause. The constitutional protection against double jeopardy \u201cprohibits resentencing only when a defendant has developed a legitimate expectation of finality in his original sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Benbrook, </em>119 F.3d 338, 340 (5th Cir.1997). In challenging his sentence, Harrison has \u201copened the door for the district court to revisit the entire sentence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Harrison argues that the remedial opinion in <em>Booker </em>has no application in his case. However, we \u201c \u2018must apply ... <em>both </em>the Sixth Amendment holding and [the Court\u2019s] remedial interpretation of the Sentencing Act-to <em>all </em>cases on direct review.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>411 F.3d 572, 576-77 (5th Cir.2005)(quoting <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 268, 125 S.Ct. 738) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">Because the enhancement for obstruction of justice is <em>Booker </em>error requiring remand for resentencing, we do not address Harrison\u2019s suggestion that his sentence was enhanced based on drug quantity in violation of <em>Booker, </em>but we \u201cleave to the discretion of the district court, whether in its discretion, it will impose the identical sentence with the identical departures or enhancements, or both.\u201d <em>United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 377 n. 62 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">We VACATE Harrison\u2019s sentences on both counts and REMAND in accordance with <em>Booker. </em>We REINSTATE our judgment affirming Harrison\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b932-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
