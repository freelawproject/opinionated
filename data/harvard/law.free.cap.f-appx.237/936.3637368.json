Price contends that the district court lacked authority under Fed. R.Crim.P. 35 to correct the judgment sua sponte. Price challenges the correction of the judgment to reduce his terms of imprisonment on two counts from 24 months to 23 months and his terms of supervised release from 24 months to 13 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-27\">The district court\u2019s corrected judgment imposed a legally correct sentence following the revocation of supervised release. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 705-07, 712-13, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000). Moreover, the corrected judgment benefited Price by reducing his sentence on the two counts at issue in this appeal. Any possible error by the district court in correcting the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>was harmless. <em>See United States v. Munoz, </em>150 F.3d 401, 412-13 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b956-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
