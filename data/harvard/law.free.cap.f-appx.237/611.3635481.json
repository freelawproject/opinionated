At the sentencing hearing, the district court calculated Yanez-Corbo\u2019s total adjusted offense level at 12, with a Criminal History Category of III. As a result, Yanez-Corbo was subject to a sentencing range of 15-21 months under the Sentencing Guidelines. Nevertheless, the district court varied from the Guidelines and sentenced Yanez-Corbo to 42 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-17\">On appeal, Yanez-Corbo argues that his sentence was unreasonable because it did not comply with the principles set forth in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). First, he argues that the district court\u2019s sentence was not consistent with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) because the court placed disproportionate weight on Yanez-Corbo\u2019s criminal history, which, apart from an attempted bombing offense, involved relatively minor offenses that took place over thirty years ago. Second, he argues that the district court\u2019s upward variance under \u00a7 3553(a) was \u201cin effect\u201d an upward departure for underrepresentation of his criminal history under the Guidelines, see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 (2005), imposed without following the procedural requirements for granting an upward departure. Third, he argues that the district court did not suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>eiently elicit objections at the conclusion of sentencing because the court merely asked if there were objections as to reasonableness but did not ask if there were objections to the sentence or the manner in which it was imposed as required by <em>United States v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097 (11th Cir.1990), <em>overruled on other grounds sub. nom. United States v. Morrill, </em>984 F.2d 1136 (11th Cir.1993) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">We review the final sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). Our review for reasonableness is deferential. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006). We consider the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and the district court\u2019s reasons for imposing the particular sentence. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1360-61 (11th Cir.2006), <em>pet. for cert. </em>filed, (U.S. Oct. 19, 2006) (No. 06-7352). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors take into account:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-8\"><em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]here is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose[,]\u201d and the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>(Id. </em>at 788). \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court[,]\u201d and this Court will not \u201csubstitute [its] judgment in weighing the relevant factors because [its] review is not de novo.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1363 (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-10\">When reviewing the length of a sentence for reasonableness, [this Court] will remand for resentencing if [it is] left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-11\"><em>(Id.). </em>Here, the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In its discussion, the district court particularly emphasized the possibility of recidivism and Yanez-Corbo\u2019s prior criminal history. The district court also stated that \u201ca sentence longer than the guidelines would promote respect for the law.\u201d While the district court did not expressly discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). The district court did not clearly err by emphasizing one factor, Yanez-Corbo\u2019s prior criminal history, because \u201c[t]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1363. Furthermore, the record shows that Yanez-Corbo has an extensive history of criminal behavior, which includes, but is not limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>to, drug-related offenses, an attempted bombing, and larceny.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Nor did the district court err when it imposed a sentence outside the Guidelines range without following the requisite procedures for an upward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 (2005). Because Yanez-Corbo did not raise this argument below, we review it for plain error. <em>See United States v. Road, </em>406 F.3d 1322, 1323 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 893, 126 S.Ct. 196, 163 L.Ed.2d 207 (2005). We have already considered and rejected the argument that the district court\u2019s election of an upward variance over an upward departure-and the fewer procedural requirements entailed by such a choice-amounts to plain error. <em>See United States v. Moton, </em>226 Fed.Appx. 936, 938-40 (11th Cir.2007) (unpublished). We did so in light of our decision in <em>United States v. Irizarry, </em>458 F.3d 1208 (11th Cir.2006), where we held that the advance notice for upward departures required by Rule 32(h) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure need not be given when the district court chooses to impose an upward vari ance under \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 1212. As we noted in <em>Moton, </em>accepting the argument that district courts must always choose guided departures over \u00a7 3553(a) variances is inconsistent with <em>Irizarry: </em>because any circumstance \u201crelevant to determining the appropriate sentence\u201d may be used to justify a departure, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(a)(2)(A), a departure may always be used in place of a variance, and thus the procedures for departures would be required in every case. <em>Irizarry </em>clearly does not contemplate such a result. Given this inconsistency, any error from failing to follow the Guidelines procedures before imposing the variance could not be plain. <em>See United States v. White, </em>416 F.3d 1313, 1319 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cAn error cannot meet the \u2018plain\u2019 requirement of the plain error rule if it is not clear under current law.\u201d (internal quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Yanez-Corbo\u2019s argument that the district court failed to elicit objections apart from those having to do with the reasonableness of the sentence is contradicted by the record. Yanez-Corbo relies on <em>Jones, </em>in which this Court required district courts to provide an opportunity for the parties to \u201cobject to the district court\u2019s ultimate findings of fact and conclusions of law and to the manner in which the sentence is pronounced.\u201d 899 F.2d at 1102. Yanez-Corbo is incorrect in his assertion that the district court \u201casked merely if the defendant objected to the reasonableness of the sentence.\u201d After asking if there were objections to reasonableness, the district court asked, \u201cAny objection from the defense?\u201d Yanez-Corbo\u2019s trial counsel then responded, \u201cOther than the reasonableness of it, no.\u201d As is clear from this exchange, the district court provided an opportunity for Yanez-Corbo to raise objections, an opportunity he declined. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Finally, we note that the statutory maximum penalty for each of Yanez-Corbo\u2019s offenses is 10 years\u2019 imprisonment, and the district court was bound only by the ceiling imposed by the statute. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(c)(l)(A)(i); <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1308 (11th Cir.2005) (recognizing that the statutory maximum sentence, not the guideline sentence, is the maximum sentence permitted by law). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Yanez-Corbo\u2019s total sentence of 42 months\u2019 imprisonment is far less than the statutory maximum he could have received for each of his offenses. Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 brief on appeal, there is no evidence that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in applying the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Yanez-Corbo\u2019s sentence was reasonable and, accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b634-5\">. The district court\u2019s reference to an \"auto theft\u201d when discussing Yanez-Corbo's criminal history at the sentencing hearing did not render the sentence unreasonable. Although Yanez-Corbo was never convicted of auto theft, he was convicted of possession of a stolen car.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
