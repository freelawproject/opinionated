He was sentenced to 50 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-20\">Terrones contends the district court erred by increasing his base offense level under the advisory Guidelines by 16 levels, having found that his Texas conviction of delivery of cocaine was a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). Because Terrones preserved this issue in district court, we review it <em>de novo. See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-22\">The indictment from Terrones\u2019 prior conviction, the only document introduced at sentencing in support of the 16-level increase, stated he \u201cdid unlawfully, knowingly and intentionally deliver, to-wit: actually transfer, constructively transfer, and offer to sell a controlled substance\u201d. Despite the pleading\u2019s conjunctive language, the statute is disjunctive, and the jury could have convicted Terrones based only on an offer to sell. <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 712, 715-16 (5th Cir.2007). Offering to sell a controlled substance, however, is <em>not </em>a drug trafficking offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>Id. </em>at 714-15; <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 273-74 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Accordingly, resentencing is required. <em>See Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d at 715-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Terrones also challenges the constitutionality of the treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. Terrones\u2019 constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Terrones properly concedes this; he raises the issue only to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">\n<em>CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b940-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
