Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (requiring, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201creasonableness\u201d review of <em>post-Booker </em>sentences, to be guided by the factors stated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). The district court\u2019s having granted Flores\u2019 objection to the use of a prior conviction in determining his criminal history score, his advisory Guidelines range was 70-87 months. The imposed 72-month sentence was at the low end of this range.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Because the sentence was within the properly-calculated Guideline range (Flores does <em>not </em>maintain otherwise), it is presumed reasonable. <em>E.g., United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Notwithstanding his claim that the district court failed to properly consider the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), such a sentence is afforded \u201cgreat deference\u201d, and we infer the sentencing court \u201chas considered all the [\u00a7 3553(a) ] factors for a fair sentence\u201d. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 828, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Flores has failed to rebut his sentence\u2019s presumed reasonableness. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554-55. Indeed, even though Flores contends this presumption of reasonableness violates <em>Booker, </em>he properly concedes this contention is foreclosed; he raises the presumption issue only to preserve its further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Flores also challenges, in the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated-felony convictions as sentencing factors, rather than elements of the offense. As he concedes, this challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Nonetheless, he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b951-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
