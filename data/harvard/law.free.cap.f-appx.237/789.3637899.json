In criminal cases, the defendant must file the notice of appeal within ten days after the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A). With or without a motion, upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause, the district court may grant an extension of up to thirty days to file a notice of appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>The district court entered its amended judgment <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> on December 15, 2005. The notice of appeal was filed on June 23, 2006. Because Jacobs failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b810-14\"> Jacobs filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion alleging his trial counsel ignored his request to file a notice of appeal from his criminal judgment. The district court granted the \u00a7 2255 motion to allow Jacobs to appeal from an amended judgment. The court\u2019s order instructed a notice of appeal must be filed within ten days of the court's order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
