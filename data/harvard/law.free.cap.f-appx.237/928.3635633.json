Lighteard was sentenced to concurrent imprisonment terms of 188 months on his drug conviction and 120 months on his firearm conviction. He appeals his firearm conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-16\">Lighteard challenges his firearm conviction on the ground that the factual basis supporting his plea did not establish that the firearm he possessed had traveled in or affected interstate commerce. Because Lighteard did not challenge the sufficiency of the factual basis in the district court, this court reviews the issue for plain error. <em>See United States v. Castro-Trevino, </em>464 F.3d 536, 541 (5th Cir.2006). The record contains no indication that Lighteard ever took issue with whether the firearm had traveled in or affected interstate commerce, and Lighteard does not argue that he would not have pleaded guilty but for the district court\u2019s error, thus waiving any such argument. <em>See United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004); <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>303 F.3d 606, 647 (5th Cir.2002). As such, Lighteard has failed to make the requisite showing. <em>See Castro-Trevino, </em>464 F.3d at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-17\">Lighteard also argues that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional on its face because it does not require a substantial affect on interstate commerce, relying on <em>Jones v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000), <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000), and <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number><em>Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995). This argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Rawls, </em>85 F.3d 240, 242 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b949-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
