Because it is not clear from the record that Harrell understood the full significance of the appeal waiver in his plea agreement, we will not enforce the waiver against him. Nevertheless, because the Mandatory Victim and Restitution Act of 1996, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A (\u201cMVRA\u201d), required the district court to order restitution in this case, it did not commit plain error by doing so. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order of restitution in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-22\">I. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-23\">In 2005, Harrell, with Dexter Harrison and Charles L. Harrell (\u201cCharles\u201d), was indicted in a 13-count superceding indictment. In the indictment, Harrell and Charles were jointly charged with conspiring to interfere with interstate commerce by threats, intimidation, and extortion, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a)(1) (Count 1), and interfering with interstate commerce by threats, intimidation, and extortion, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a)(1) (Count 2). Harrell was separately charged with interstate travel in aid of racketeering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952(a) (Count 3). Harrell and Harrison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>were jointly charged with: (1) conspiring to commit arson and mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 844(1), and 1341 (Count 5); (2) mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 (Count 6); and (3) arson, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(i), and 2 (Count 7). Harrell was also separately charged in the indictment with: (1) three counts of witness tampering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b)(1) (Counts 8, 9, and 10); (2) an additional count of interference with interstate commerce by threats, intimidation, and extortion, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a) (Count 11); and (3) making misleading statements, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b)(3) (Count 12). Finally, the indictment also separately charged Charles \"with witness tampering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b)(3) (Count 4), and charged Harrison with making misleading statements, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b)(3) (Count 13).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Thereafter, the court severed the counts in the indictment into three separate trials according to their relevance to each other. Specifically, the court ordered that Counts 4-10 and 12-13 would be tried first, and that later, separate trials would be held on Counts 1-3, and on Count 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">At the first trial, Harrell was convicted under Counts 5, 7, 10, and 12, but was acquitted of Counts 6, 8, and 9. Subsequently, before any additional trial was held, Harrell pled guilty to Count 1 in exchange for the dismissal of Counts 2, 3, and 11. In his plea agreement, Harrell \u201cknowingly and voluntarily\u201d agreed to waive his right to appeal his convictions or sentences on any of the counts of conviction from the trial or following his guilty plea, unless his sentence exceeded the guideline range. R3-318 at 4. The district court entered written findings following a change of plea hearing, finding, among other things, that Harrell had knowingly and willingly waived \u201cthe right to appeal any verdict of guilty and to be represented on appeal by counsel.\u201d R3320 at unnumbered 2. A transcript from the change of plea hearing is not included in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">According to the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d), in 2000, Harrell entered into a contract with Bill Chandler to raise cattle. At the conclusion of the contract, Harrell believed Chandler was not paying him what he was due and threatened him with bodily injury. Thereafter, Harrell and his father, Charles, conspired with two other men who lured Chandler from his home and then assaulted him. Chandler fought the men off, and one of the men was eventually apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">In 2001, Harrell entered into a conspiracy with Harrison to burn down a motel owned by Harrison. On 7 January 2002, Harrell sprayed a mixture of diesel fuel and gasolene in five interior areas of the motel, including near a natural gas line, and left containers of fuel throughout these areas. At that time there were 16 guests in the motel and 1 employee. Although all of the guests exited the motel, one of them suffered smoke inhalation that required treatment. The PSI also noted misrepresentations made by Harrell during the investigation of the arson, as well as Harrell\u2019s attempt to get his wife to stop assisting the authorities. Following the arson, Harrison\u2019s insurer paid him $319,145 for the damage to the motel.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">To calculate Harrell\u2019s offense level, the PSI divided the counts of conviction into three groups. In its calculation, the PSI added enhancements for: (1) Harrell\u2019s role as a leader under Count 1; and (2) obstruction of justice under all three groups. After applying the multiple count adjustment, the PSI assigned Harrell a total offense level of 34. Although the PSI listed some criminal conduct and arrests, it listed no criminal convictions and assigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Harrell zero criminal history points and a criminal history category of I. With a total offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of I,- the PSI calculated a guideline sentencing range of 151 to 188 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The PSI advised that the Court was required to order restitution pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(a). In this regard, the PSI noted that the injured motel guest had not submitted any statement of financial loss and reiterated that the insurer\u2019s total loss was $319,145.10. The PSI also noted that the advisory guidelines required that restitution be paid, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The government filed numerous objections to the PSI, including objecting to the restitution amount. Specifically, the government argued that Harrell should also have to pay the attorney\u2019s fees stemming from a civil suit filed by Harrison against the insurer following the fire. The probation officer responded, arguing that there was no evidence that Harrell had participated in Harrison\u2019s attempt to get more money from the insurer for the repairs to the motel, and that Harrison\u2019s actions in this regard were unrelated to Harrell\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Harrell objected to statements made in the PSI regarding conduct not included in the offense\u2019s relevant conduct, and argued that he should have received an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. In response, the probation officer argued that the adjustment was not appropriate because Harrell had been convicted on several counts and had been given an adjustment for obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">At the sentencing hearing, the court heard from witnesses called by both the government and the defense. Thereafter, the government argued its objections to the PSI, concluding by noting that the question of the amount of restitution was still open. In response, Harrell\u2019s counsel noted that Harrell had been acquitted of mail fraud and argued that the civil suit against the insurer had been initiated solely by Harrison and Harrell did not benefit from it. In conclusion, Harrell\u2019s counsel asked the court to adopt the recommendations in the PSI, particularly regarding the issue of restitution and upward departure. The government then argued that Harrell should be held responsible for some of the attorney\u2019s fees because he was deposed in the civil suit and could have told the insurer that the suit was a sham.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">After Harrell addressed it in allocution, the court overruled the government\u2019s objections and found that the guideline range was 151-188 months of imprisonment. However, the court then sentenced Harrell to a total sentence of 240 months of imprisonment. The court stated, among other things, that it had determined that a 240-month sentence was appropriate and complied with the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, specifically listing several of those factors. The court also ordered Harrell to pay $319,145.10 in restitution. The court also noted that Harrell had \u201cknowingly and voluntarily waived [his] statutory right to appeal with certain exceptions specified in [his] plea agreement, even as to the counts for which [he was] sentenced at the jury trial,\u201d but still cautioned him that if he did mean to file an appeal he had to do so within 10 days. R6-56. Finally, after consulting with the probation officer, the court, among other things, expressly overruled Harrell\u2019s request for an acceptance of responsibility adjustment, and clarified that it had imposed a variance in his sentence, not a departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">Thereafter, the court entered a written judgment in accordance with its oral sentence, and dismissing Counts 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, and 11. Harrell timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>II. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">A. <em>Whether Harrell waived his right to appeal his sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Although Harrell does not address this issue, the government briefly argues that because Harrell executed a plea agreement containing an appeal waiver as to all of the counts of conviction, and because the waiver \u201cwas explained to him on the record by the district court during his plea colloquy,\u201d he has waived his right to appeal. Appellee\u2019s Br. at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">We review the waiver of the right to appeal <em>de novo. United States v. Benitez-Zapata, </em>131 F.3d 1444, 1446 (11th Cir.1997) (citation omitted). Appeal waivers are valid if they are made knowingly and voluntarily. <em>United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1350 (11th Cir.1993). For an appeal waiver to be enforced, the government must show that either: (1) the district court specifically questioned the defendant concerning the appeal waiver during the plea hearing, or (2) it is manifestly clear from the record that the defendant otherwise understood the full significance of the waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Here, the government has failed to satisfy the first prong of the test in <em>Bushert </em>because there is no transcript of the change of plea hearing in the record. The government does not address the second prong in its brief, and the record shows only that: (1) the plea agreement contains a waiver and states that Harrell understands that waiver; (2) the probation officer believed it had been entered knowingly and voluntarily; and (3) the court also believed the waiver was knowing and voluntary. Outside the plea agreement, the record does not include any statement by the defendant that clarifies whether he understood the waiver\u2019s full significance. We have held that the text of the plea agreement itself is not sufficient to show that the waiver was knowing and voluntary. <em>Id. </em>at 1352. Accordingly, because \u201ca thorough review of the record [does not] yield any indication that [Harrell] otherwise understood the full significance of his sentence appeal waiver,\u201d we will not enforce the waiver. <em>See id. </em>at 1353.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">B. <em>Whether the district court plainly erred in sentencing Harrell to pay restitution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">On appeal, Harrell argues that the district court erred in holding him liable for the \u201crestitution regarding the insurance proceeds\u201d the insurer paid to Harrison, as he was acquitted of the mail fraud charge and did not receive any of the proceeds of the fraud.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s Br. at 14. He argues that this conclusion is supported by the fact that only Harrison was sentenced to repay the attorney\u2019s fees that resulted from the civil litigation regarding the repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">Because Harrell did not object to the restitution sentence in any way before the district court, we will only review this issue for plain error. <em>See United States v. Hasson, </em>333 F.3d 1264, 1276 (11th Cir.2003) (citations omitted). Accordingly, Harrell must establish that: (1) an error occurred; (2) it is plain; (3) it affects his substantial rights; and (4) it seriously affected the fairness and integrity of the proceedings. <em>See id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-14\">Under the MVRA, where a defendant is convicted of, among other things, a felony offense against property, the district court is required to \u201corder, in addition to ... any other penalty authorized by law, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>the defendant make restitution to the victim of the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a)(l), (c)(l)(A)(ii). The MVRA specifies that, in the case of an offense against property where no part of the property can be returned, the order of restitution must require the defendant to pay an amount equal to \u201cthe value of the property on the date of the damage, loss, or destruction.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(b)(l)(B)(i)(II).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">In this case, Harrell was convicted of conspiring to commit arson and of committing arson. The hotel that burned was not considered the victim in the PSI because the arson was committed with the intent of defrauding the building\u2019s insurer. Thus, the restitution amount identified in the PSI was the amount paid out by the insurer. This was in compliance with the MVRA and was not error, let alone plain error. <em>See Hasson, </em>333 F.3d at 1276 (citation omitted) (stating that \u201ca sentencing court does not commit plain error by relying on factual findings contained in the [PSI] regarding a defendant\u2019s ability to pay restitution\u201d). The attorney\u2019s fees figure that was ordered paid by Harrison is irrelevant to Harrell as he was not implicated in the suit against the insurer. Thus, the district court did not err in ordering restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">III. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">The government\u2019s insistence that Harrell\u2019s appeal be dismissed because of a valid appeal waiver is not adequately supported by the record. On consideration of the merits of Harrell\u2019s appeal wherein he challenges the sentencing court\u2019s order of restitution, we find no reversible error. Accordingly, the sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b465-9\">. He also argues that the government has conceded this error. As the government argues in its brief in response, however, this appears to be based on a misinterpretation of the government\u2019s arguments at sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
