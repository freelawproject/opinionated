Zhou contends that the BIA erred because its decision was either not supported by substantial evidence or was based on a misapplication of the law. Zhou asserts that the lack of corroborating evidence is not an adequate ground for denial because neither the IJ nor the BIA made a finding as to whether Zhou could have obtained documentary evidence un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>der the circumstances. Zhou argues that his specific, consistent, and detailed testimony was adequate to meet his burden of proof. He also argues that the BIA\u2019s decision misstated the record by asserting that Zhou\u2019s family continues to practice the Falun Gong religion in China without any problems. Finally, Zhou claims that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, which he claims was adopted by the BIA, was not adequately supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, \u201cexcept to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, because the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision, and added some comments of its own, we review both.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">We begin by considering what claims are properly before us. The government argues that Zhou has abandoned several of his claims by failing to adequately pursue them before the BIA or in this appeal. We do not have jurisdiction to review claims that have not been raised before the BIA. <em>Amayar-Artunduaga v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006). Nor do we have jurisdiction to review claims if the appellant fails to raise that argument on appeal. <em>Sepulveda v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Zhou has abandoned any claim of past persecution because he did not sufficiently advance such an argument in either his appeal to the BIA or in this appeal. <em>See id. </em>Zhou\u2019s brief makes several passing references to past persecution, but he never claims that the IJ or the BIA erred in finding no past persecution. Even if we read his <em>pro se </em>brief liberally, <em>see Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998), we still find that he abandoned this portion of his claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">Accordingly, Zhou\u2019s asylum claim hinges on his ability to show a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his Falun Gong practices. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287-88. He must demonstrate a well-founded fear that is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. The subjective component can be proven by \u201ccredible testimony\u201d that he \u201cgenuinely fears persecution,\u201d while the objective component \u201ccan be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he ... has a good reason to fear future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">Both the IJ and the BIA determined that Zhou failed to prove either the subjective or objective component of a well-founded fear. According to both the BIA and the IJ, Zhou\u2019s testimony, which was not supported by corroborating documents, was insufficiently detailed regarding his parents\u2019 arrest, imprisonment, and alleged torture. Additionally, there was no evidence that the Chinese authorities were or are after him. Zhou\u2019s actions prior to leaving China \u2014 staying with a fellow Falun Gong member the night his parents were arrested and then leaving his aunt\u2019s home and returning to his parents store to live and work after their release from prison \u2014 further diminish Zhou\u2019s claims. Finally, both courts agreed that the fact that Zhou\u2019s parents currently live <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>in China and practice Falun Gong without problems undermines Zhou\u2019s asserted well-founded fear of future persecution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Our review of the IJ\u2019s factual determination is extremely deferential, and we \u201caffirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted and alteration in original). In order \u201c[t]o reverse the IJ\u2019s decision, we must conclude that the record not only supports such a conclusion, but <em>compels </em>it.\u201d <em>Yang v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1202 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks omitted and alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Zhou argues that the IJ and the BIA erred in finding his testimony insufficient and in implicitly requiring corroborating documentation without finding that such documents could be reasonably obtained by Zhou. In certain cases uncorroborated testimony is sufficient. <em>Id. </em>at 1201 (\u201cUncorroborated but credible testimony may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof for demonstrating eligibility for asylum. The weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony, however, the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d (citations omitted)). Here, Zhou\u2019s uncorroborated testimony was weak and supporting documentation would have been helpful. Nevertheless, even if we were to accept Zhou\u2019s testimony as true, it was insufficient to establish a well-founded fear of past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Zhou did not qualify for asylum because he failed to show a well-founded fear of future persecution. His parents continue to live and work in China while practicing Falun Gong. There is nothing to suggest that the Chinese authorities are after Zhou or that he is in any danger. Zhou\u2019s decision to stay with a fellow Falun Gong practitioner on the night of his parents\u2019 arrest was inconsistent with his asserted fear. Given that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Zhou could not meet the lesser asylum burden, the BIA properly denied Zhou\u2019s petition for withholding of removal and CAT relief as well. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\">. Further, even if Zhou had not abandoned his past persecution claims, we would not be compelled to reverse the IJ\u2019s conclusion that he failed to proffer evidence sufficient to meet the persecution standard. If anything, Zhou was only indirectly threatened while in China, which is not enough. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (holding that threats to petitioner and her brother did not compel reversal of IJ's decision).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b627-8\">. Zhou claims that this finding is a misstatement of the record, but we disagree. In his application for asylum and withholding of removal, Zhou specifically stated that his \u201cparents still practice Falun Gong, but only doing it at home with very few and selective people.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
