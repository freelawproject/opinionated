This assertion lacks merit. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>a sentence is within a properly calculated guidelines range, our court infers that the requisite sentencing factors were considered and gives great deference to that sentence. <em>E.g., United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, <em>519 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 828, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). The record shows: the district court gave due weight to the \u00a7 3553 factors; and the sentence is <em>not </em>unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Gutierrez-Arriaga challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Gutierrez-Arriaga properly concedes this; he raises the issue only to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b950-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
