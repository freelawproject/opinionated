Chisholm, Louisiana prisoner #323477, moves for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. The district court denied Chisholm\u2019s IFP motion and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP, Chisholm is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-18\">Chisholm filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint and claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against Union Parish Detention Center (UPDC) officials alleging that: (1) UPDC officials confiscated his legal books and failed to return them, thus depriving him of his property without due process of law, (2) UPDC kitchen staff violated his rights under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment by giving him meals that were prepared in violation of his Muslim faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-23\">However, Chisholm\u2019s claims do not involve legal points arguable on their merits. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotations and citations omitted); <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. Accordingly, Chisholm\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is DENIED and his appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b923-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
