Wadley argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by imposing a sentence based on facts not admitted by him or found by a jury. Because Wadley did not raise this issue in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>324 F.3d 375, 381 (5th Cir.2003). Wadley has not shown any error, plain or otherwise, as this court has held that after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Sixth Amendment does not prevent a sentencing judge from finding all facts relevant to sentencing, including relevant conduct under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 553 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-15\">Wadley argues that the district court erred in finding that he was responsible for 2.65 grams of cocaine base sold by Kristal Simpson to an undercover officer as he was merely a passenger in the car when Simpson made the drug transaction. Wadley has not shown that the district court clearly erred in finding that he was responsible for the cocaine base. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>445 F.3d 815, 817 (5th Cir.2006). Further, any error was harmless as the exclusion of the 2.65 grams of cocaine base would not have changed Wadley\u2019s base offense level of 38. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-16\">Wadley also argues that the district court erred in considering an incident in which Wadley was present outside of a residence when officers executed a search warrant for illegal drugs. Wadley has not shown that the district court\u2019s consideration of this information played a part in the court\u2019s determination of the appropriate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-17\">Wadley argues that the sentence is unreasonable because it was based on his own admissions made in response to assurances from government agents that \u201cit would be best to tell the truth.\u201d Wadley\u2019s sentence was within the properly calculated guideline range and, therefore, is presumed reasonable. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2467-68, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>see also Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554. Wadley has not shown that the district court miscalculated the applicable guidelines range. Wadley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>has not shown that the district court clearly erred in determining that there was no government inducement for him to make a statement and that the PSR\u2019s drug quantity calculation was correct because the information provided by Wadley was corroborated by two confidential informants, Wadley\u2019s coconspirators, and an undercover officer\u2019s purchase of cocaine base from Wadley. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>445 F.3d at 817. The district court adequately considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including the nature and circumstances of the offense and Wadley\u2019s extensive criminal history. Wadley has not shown that the sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable as it was within the applicable guideline range and was based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Vargas-Garcia, </em>434 F.3d 345, 348-49 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1103, 126 S.Ct. 1894, 164 L.Ed.2d 578 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b990-11\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
