Perham.</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b651-17\" pgmap=\"651(72) 652(359)\">The evidence for defendant tended to show: That defendant did not know Mrs. Morris; had never bought goods of her and never, unless by implication of law, authorized any one to buy from Mrs. Morris. Defendant first knew of the purchase of these goods about eight months after they were bought. Knowledge of purchase was by receipt of the bill, dated July 23, 1900. That at the time of the purchase in question Mrs. Bonnev was not a member of the family of Mr. Bonney. That Mr. Bonney\u2019s income in 1899 was about $4,000, of which $2,500 went to Mrs. Bonney. That defendant never had received any bills from Mrs. Perham or Mrs. Morris (except this bill in question) and never paid any. That about December 1, 1899, Mrs. Bonney had three or four trunks full of hats, dresses and clothes of all kinds. That defendant kept Mrs. Bonney supplied with necessaries suitable to his estate and position. That Mr. Bonney was an attorney in 1899 and was connected with a street railway company which failed in April, 1900, and which is now in a receiver\u2019s hands. That he had 668 shares of its stock which had no market value. That he did not have any other business. That since September, 1899, he lived at the Chicago Athletic Club. Prior to that he lived at the Dakota and Metropole hotels in Chicago. That Mrs. Bonney never dressed as well as when she purchased the goods in controversy. That in 1897, 1898 and 1899,. her manner of dress was practically the same. That in 1899 she went to Europe three times. That Mr. Bonney had not seen Mrs. Bonney since September 6,1899, or about three months before the goods in question were purchased. That Mr. Bonney\u2019s brother, in 1899, advanced to Mrs. Bonney at defendant\u2019s request, about $4,500 for the payment of Mrs. Bonney\u2019s bills; and so on; that Mr. Bonney supplied her with moneys suitable to his condition in life; that Mr. Bonney did not draw any salary; that Mrs. Bonney got from seventy-five to eighty per cent of Mr. Bonney\u2019s income in addition to this $4,50L); that the $4,500 advanced -by defendant\u2019s brother to Mrs. Bonney was charged up to Mrs. Bonney; that in a divorce settlement Mrs. Bonney got $40,000 in real estate; that $2,500 was paid to her in December, 1899, being part of the $4,500 advanced by defendant\u2019s brother; that her debts were not known of; that in October and ^November, 1899, Mrs. Bonney received from defendant\u2019s brother' about $1,000.</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b652-5\" pgmap=\"652(20) 653(260)\">The jury found for the plaintiff, assessing the damages at $553. The jury also made special findings as follows : 1. That the defendant did not, between September 7, 1899, and December 7,1899, furnish his wife with money for the purpose of enabling her to provide herself with the necessaries of life in the sum of $1,000 and upward. 2. That the estate and income of the defendant, as it was between September 7,1899, and December 7, 1899, required defendant to expend more than $300 per month in providing his wife and children with the necessaries of life suitable to their condition in life. 3. That the condition in life of the wife and children during the year 1899 required a greater expenditure than $300 per month in providing them with necessaries of life suitable to such condition, and to his estate. 4. That the defendant did not at all times during 1899 provide his wife and family with the necessaries of life suitable to their condition, and to the extent of his ability, considering their former style of living, and the extent and productiveness of his estate. Judgment was entered on the verdict for the. amount thereof. The court, at the request of the plaintiff, instructed the jury \u201c that where goods are sold to the wife upon the credit of the husband, if the goods are necessary, and suitable to the wife\u2019s position in life, it may be inferred that she makes the purchase as the agent of her husband,\u201d and also \u201c that the husband is, in general, bound to furnish the wife with all necessary articles suitable to his condition in life.\u201d</p><attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b653-5\" pgmap=\"653\">Lyman M.

For necessaries furnished under such circumstances the burden is upon the tradesman to show that the wife was in need of the goods; that the husband failed to supply her, and that the wife was not at fault, or that the husband authorized or assented to the purchase. Schouler on Husband and Wife, Sec. 119; Vol. 9, 1st Ed. Am. &amp; Eng. Encv. of Law, p. 815-7, 810-11; Schunckle v. Bierman, 89 Ill. 454-156; Wilson v. Bishop, 10 Ill. App. 588-590.</p> <p id=\"b657-5\" pgmap=\"657\">. In the present case, when the goods for which this suit was brought were purchased, Mr. and Mrs. Bonney were permanently living apart, she in Iowa, he in Illinois. There was no evidence that he had not supplied her with necessaries, on the contrary there was evidence that for a man of his means he had furnished a very large sum of money with which to supply her wants, the evidence being that of his entire income of $4,000, he has devoted from sixty t\u00f3 seventy per cent. There was no evidence that the living apart was without her fault or because of his.</p> <p id=\"b657-6\" pgmap=\"657\">Bor did it appear that these goods were, or that any goods have ever been supplied by the plaintiff upon the credit of.the husband. Mrs. Bonney had frequently, before, purchased similar goods of Mrs. Morris; the charge was always made, as in this case, to Mrs. Bonney; the present bill was purchased by Mrs. Bonney December 1, and 2,1899. A bill therefor was rendered to Mrs. Bonney; thereafter a bill was sent to Mr. Bonney.</p> <p id=\"b657-7\" pgmap=\"657(43) 658(40)\">July 23, 1900, Mr. Bonney, by then receiving a bill, first learned of the purchase of these goods. The husband is not liable when the goods are supplied on the credit of a third person or that of the wife. Schouler on Husband and Wife, Sec. 109; Metcalfe v. Shaw, 3 Campbell, 22; Stammers v.

Gandasequi, 15 East, 62.</p> <p id=\"b658-6\" pgmap=\"658\">Nor is it the case, as the jury were instructed, that where goods are sold to the wife upon the credit of the husband, if the goods are necessary and suitable to the wife\u2019s position in life, it may be inferred that she makes the purchase as the agent of her husband. Her position in life may be far above his. She may be the president of a college; the chief officer of a fashionable woman\u2019s club; an author of distinction; a great artist or orator; the pastor of a large and wealthy church; and he a clerk, or servant, at a salary of forty dollars a month. In determining what are necessaries which the husband is bound to supply, as they must be paid for from his estate, the estate and degree of the husband should be considered. Compton v. Bates, 10 Ill. App. 78, 85. Neither the general nor the special verdicts are sustained by the evidence. Mrs. Morris testified that the goods in controversy were sold by her to Mrs. Bonney and belonged to her, Mrs. Morris; that she conducted her business under the name of Perham, and had done so for twelve years. The suit should have been brought by Mrs. Morris in her own name and not \u201cAnna M. Perham, for the use of M. Morris;\u201d describing herself, if she desired, as M. Morris, doing business under the name of Perham.</p> <p id=\"b658-9\" pgmap=\"658\">The judgment of the Superior Court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
