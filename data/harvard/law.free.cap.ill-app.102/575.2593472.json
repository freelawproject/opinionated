Before the bringing of this suit, November 6, 1893, plaintiffs sued the defendant in a justice court, placing their demand at $200, and recovered a judgment in such justice court against defendant for $175, December 5, 1893. From this judgment defendant appealed' to the Superior Court and filed his appeal bond in that court the 23d day of December, 1893. Plaintiffs also appealed from the same judgment to the same court. Thereafter, September 24, 1896, on the call of the common law docket of the Superior Court, the appeal of plaintiffs was dismissed. The 24th day of March, 1898, the appeal of the defendant was dismissed on his own motion, thereby rendering the judgment before the justice a final judgment. Thereafter, December 3, 1898, six terms after the court, by the dismissal of each appeal, had lost jurisdiction of the cause, an order was entered by the Superior Court as follows :</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-6\" pgmap=\"592\">\u201cH.

Black on Judgments, Sec. 164; Swift v. Allen, 55 Ill. 303; Angus v. Backus, 58 Ill. App. 259; Rauh v. Ritchie, 1 Ill. App. 188.</p> <p id=\"b592-18\" pgmap=\"592(9) 593(108)\">The order amending the entry of judgment not having been made upon notice, was void; the court having no jurisdiction over the defendant against whom the judgment was. A judgment can not, after the lapse of the term, be amended upon the mere recollection of the judge before whom it was obtained or the affidavit of a party thereto. The judgment before the justice being in full force, is it a bar to the plaintiffs\u2019 action in the present suit ? The sales made to the defendant were separate and distinct; each was for goods sold for $175; together they amounted to $350; one suit on both could not be maintained before a justice of the peace.</p> <p id=\"b593-4\" pgmap=\"593\">The statute requiring in suits before justices a consolidation of demands \u201c which are of a nature to be consolidated, and which do not exceed $200 when consolidated into one action or defense,\u201d has no application to distinct claims, the aggregate of which exceeds $200.

Sturgis, 16 N. Y. 548.</p> <p id=\"b593-6\" pgmap=\"593\">Such evidence as there is concerning that which was actually brought before and considered by the justice court is to the effect that only one of plaintiffs\u2019 causes of action was there presented. The court, upon the evidence presented in this case, should have rendered judgment for the price of the three machines sold in July, 1893', for $175, with such lawful interest thereon as, under the evidence, plaintiffs were entitled to.</p> <p id=\"b593-7\" pgmap=\"593\">The judgment of the County Court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
