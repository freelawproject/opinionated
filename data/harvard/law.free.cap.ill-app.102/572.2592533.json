As neither the defendant nor any one for him appeared at the trial there was no waiver of the right to have these pleas answered. In effect the defendant has been, by the trial in his absence, deprived of an opportunity to present the defense set forth in these pleas. Going to trial under such circumstance was error. Seavey v. Bogers, 69 Ill. 534-536; Blake v. Miller, 118 Ill. 500, 501, 502; Steelman v. Watson, 5 Gil. 250, 251; Paul v. People, 82 Ill. 82; Sammis v. Clark, 17 Ill. 398; Moore v.
