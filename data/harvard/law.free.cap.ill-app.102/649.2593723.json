The defendants answered the bill specifically denying the equities claimed; and the cause was referred to a master to take testimony and report. After much testimony had been taken the complainant and Louise Boeger agreed upon a settlement, in pursuance of which Louise Boeger paid the association $2,500 in cash, receiving in return therefor a conveyance of one acre of land and an agreement that the said suit should be dismissed, which was done the 2d of March, 1901. The dismissal was entered upon the filing of the following stipulation:</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-5\" pgmap=\"666\">\u201c I hereby enter my appearance as additional counsel for \u2022 the complainant, on this second day of March, \u00cd901.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-6\" pgmap=\"666\">N.

April 8,1901, an intervening petition was filed in said cause by Ossian Cameron, James J.

Oakland Cemetery Association,</p><p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-15\" pgmap=\"668\">By William Bauguth, Pres.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-16\" pgmap=\"668(129) 669(43)\">By the petition and affidavit in support thereof it was set forth that the petitioners had rendered service to the complainants as solicitors for them in said sujt to the value of $20,000; that the Oakland Cemetery Association and William Bauguth are now and were, each, at all times mentioned in the petition, totally insolvent and have no effects or property out of which any debt of any kind could be collected; that the defendants to said bill have at all times known that the petitioners had a written agreement with the complainants by which they, the petitioners, were to receive one-half the proceeds of said litigation; that by collusion between the complainants and defendants, FI. II. Ilanchette was employed to appear as counsel for said complainants and consent to the dismissal of said bill without notice to or knowledge by petitioners. That said dismissal was so made for the purpose of defrauding petitioners out of that compensation to which, under said agreement, they were lawfully and equitably entitled.</p><p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-4\" pgmap=\"669\">The defendants demurred to said petition, which demurrer was sustained and the suit dismissed, the court making the following finding:</p><p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-5\" pgmap=\"669\">\u201c The court being fully advised in the premises finds that the complainant herein, for the purpose of defrauding said Chester Firebaugh, Ossian Cameron and James J. Kelly out of their fees as solicitors, made said stipulation to dismiss this suit without notice to said Firebaugh, Cameron and Kelly, and combining and confederating with the defendants for the purpose aforesaid, caused this suit to be dismissed for the purpose aforesaid. But the court finds that the contract for solicitors\u2019 fees between the complainants and the said Firebaugh, Cameron and Kelly gave no interest in the subject-matter in the suit and that the complainant had the right to dismiss its suit.\u201d</p><attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b669-6\" pgmap=\"669\">Ossian Cameron, Chester Firebaugh and James J. Kelly, attorneys for appellants.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b669-7\" pgmap=\"669\">Thatcher &amp; Griffen, attorneys for appellees.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b669-8\" pgmap=\"669\">Mr. Justice Waterman</author> <p id=\"A9B\" pgmap=\"669\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p> <p id=\"b669-9\" pgmap=\"669\">If the petitioners under their agreement with the Cemetery Company, or anything done thereunder, became possessed of an interest in the subject-matter of the suit, they could and properly should have made themselves parties thereto. In chancery, suits are properly conducted in the name of the real parties in interest.</p> <p id=\"b669-10\" pgmap=\"669\">Did petitioners have an interest in the subject-matter of the suit? The agreement with petitioners was not an assignment to them of any portion of the subject-matter of the suit or that which might be obtained thereunder.\"</p> <p id=\"b669-11\" pgmap=\"669(36) 670(110)\">The agreement was, that petitioners should receive from the Oakland Cemetery Association and William Bauguth a certain portion of whatever should be obtained or realized as the result of the litigation, or if any. settlement was made pending the litigation, petitioners were to receive the same proportion of that obtained by settlement. A settlement by the complainants was clearly contemplated by the agreement with petitioners. The distinction between an assignment or actual appropriation of the fund, or some portion of it, and a mere promise to pay a part tif a debt or fund out of the fund when collected, is clearly pointed out in Wyman v. Snyder, 112 Ill. 99-103; Story v. Hull et al., 143 Ill. 506-511; Bromell v. Turner, 37 Ill. App. 561; Trist v. Child, 21 Wallace, 441-447; Christmas v. Russell, 14 Wallace, 69, and Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence, Section 1280.</p> <p id=\"b670-5\" pgmap=\"670\">An attorney has in this State no lien for his fees and the client can dismiss his suit when he will. Henchey v. The City of Chicago, 41 Ill. 136; North Chicago Street Ry. Co. v. Ackley, 171 Ill. 100-113.</p> <p id=\"b670-6\" pgmap=\"670\">The petitioners ask that in opposition to the wish of the complainants they be permitted to prosecute this suit; they insist that the complainants could not settle this litigation without the consent of their solicitors, because the complainants have agreed to give them a certain portion of that which may be recovered in the suit. There was no assignment of any portion of the fund to petitioners or any of them: They therefore have not shown themselves to be entitled to be made parties to the suit in which they were solicitors.</p> <p id=\"b670-7\" pgmap=\"670\">The decree and order of the Superior Court is affirmed. \u2022</p> <p id=\"b670-8\" pgmap=\"670\">Hr.
