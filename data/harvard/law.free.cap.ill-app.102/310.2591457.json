In his declaration he set forth that the - 24th of May, 1898, the defendant \u201c was possessed of and was operating, by means of a lease or otherwise, a certain line of street railway, commonly known as the Cicero and Proviso Street Eailwav, together with the street cars being operated thereon, in the city of Chicago, on Chicago avenue, near Forty-ninth street;\u201d that it \u201c was the duty of said defendant to so manage and control its said street cars, that persons rightfully traveling across or along, said Chicago avenue might not be subjected to any unnecessary danger or hazard thereby.\u201d The plaintiff then avers \u201c that the said defendant, on, to-wit, the 24th day of May, 1898, through its negligence, then and there failed to discharge its duty toward him \"(the plaintiff) in that behalf.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-4\" pgmap=\"327\">To this declaration the defendant, appellant herein, filed its plea of not guilty. A trial was had, resulting in a finding by the jury of the issues for the plaintiff and assessing his damages at $1,250, for which sum judgment was entered against the defendant, and from which it appeals.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-5\" pgmap=\"327\">It appeared from the testimony on behalf of the plaintiff that\"at the time of the accident in question, the defendant, the West Chicago Street Railroad Company, was running its cars over the line, under an agreement with the Cicero and Proviso Street Railway Company, which was, in effect, a lease of the road. That the car which struck the plaintiff\u2019s wagon belonged to the West Chicago Street Railroad Company is conceded.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-6\" pgmap=\"327(170) 328(133)\">Appellant, by way of defense, offered in evidence the record of a suit theretofore brought in the Superior Court of Cook County by Alfred Anderson against the Cicero and Proviso Street Railway Company, wherein and whereby the plaintiff in that suit sought to recover from the Cicero and Proviso Street Railway Company for damages sustained by Anderson by reason of the negligence of the Cicero and Proviso Street Railway Company. The declaration in said suit against the Cicero and Proviso Street Railway Company alleged that \u201c on the 24th day of May, 1898, in the city of Chicago, in the county of Cook, in the State of Illinois, the defendant was the owner and possessed of a certain line of street railway, and the cars being operated thereon, on West Chicago avenue, near Forty-ninth street, in said city,\u201d and that \u201citthen and there became and was the duty of the said defendant to so. manage and control its said cars, then and there, that persons rightfully passing upon and along .the said Chicago avenue, with their teams and wagons, might not be subjected to any unnecessary danger or hazard thereby.\u201d The declaration then averred that the evening of the 24th of May, 1898, the plaintiff was passing along and upon said Chicago avenue, and then and there, \u201c through the gross negligence of the said defendant, by its servant then and there, the said wagon was run against and upon with great force and violence, and broken by the said street car, and the said plaintiff * * * was thrown from the said wagon then and there,\u201d and received great and serious injuries. It is conceded that this injury was, in fact, the same injury alleged in the suit at bar to have been caused by the West Chicago Street Railroad Company.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b328-5\" pgmap=\"328\">John A.

Pennsylvania Co. v. Ellett, 132 Ill. 654, 659; Chicago &amp; Erie R. R. Co. v. Meech, 163 Ill. 305, 308.</p> <p id=\"b328-10\" pgmap=\"328\">Appellee might, in the first instance, have brought suit against the West Chicago Street Railroad Company, as he did against the Cicero and Proviso Street Railway Company, or he might have brought his action against the two jointly; thus he might have had a recovery against either or both.</p> <p id=\"b328-11\" pgmap=\"328(18) 329(20)\">Under the law the alleged negligence was that of both companies. Having sued the Cicero and Proviso Company and been defeated in his action against it, can the plaintiff sue and recover against the West Chicago Company %</p> <p id=\"b329-4\" pgmap=\"329\">All of the evidence as to the injury and alleged negligence admissible in one case was admissible in the other; unless a recovery could be had against the Cicero and Proviso Company, the principal, none could be obtained against the West Chicago Company, the agent, for doing only that which it was authorized by its principal to do. Emery v. Fowler, 39 Maine, 326-338.</p> <p id=\"b329-5\" pgmap=\"329\">In Pennsylvania Co. v. Ellett, the Supreme Court say:</p> <blockquote id=\"b329-6\" pgmap=\"329\">\u201c It follows, therefore, that no other negligence than that of the company or corporation permitted or authorized by the owner company to use its railway, need be alleged or proved to fix the liability of the owner.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b329-7\" pgmap=\"329\">The evidence given in the action against the West Chicago Street Bailroad Company might have entitled the plaintiff to a recovery against its lessor, the owner company.</p> <p id=\"b329-8\" pgmap=\"329\">Actions of trespass may be maintained against all or each of several joint trespassers. The plaintiff may begin and prosecute as many actions as there were trespassers. But if the cause of action in trespass against A, arise entirely out of his conduct as the agent of B, a judgment in favor of B, in an action against him for such conduct of his agent, may be pleaded in bar by A.
