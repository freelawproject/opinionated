That appellee has collected the said $2,432.30, but has not paid any portion-of the same to her; that he denies that he was ever employed by her or ever her attorney, and claims that the Columbia Iron and Steel Company refused to recognize or carry out the sale of its claim to appellant; and that he has paid over the money collected by him to the Columbia Iron and Steel Company, which payment to the Columbia Iron and Steel Company, appellant,, on information and belief, denies.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-7\" pgmap=\"515(56) 516(12)\">Complainant further,represents that appellee denies that he ever was employed as attorney for complainant or that he ever acted for her, except in filing an answer to the cross-bill herein mentioned, and that he did that solely as a matter of accommodation, and without expectation of any fee or reward for his professional services therein, and denies that he is indebted to this complainant in any sum whatever.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-5\" pgmap=\"516\">The court sustained a special demurrer to the bill.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b516-6\" pgmap=\"516\">James H.

The only complaint of all that appellee is charged to have done is in not paying to appellant the amount of the judgment alleged to have been collected by him. All that he is alleged to have done in collecting and recovering the money she approves of.</p> <p id=\"b516-11\" pgmap=\"516\">She insists that he should have paid to her the money he claims he collected and paid to the Columbia Iron Works. This is no more a charge of fraud than is any case against an attorney for failing to pay over money collected by him. The law courts afford several most efficient remedies against lawyers who fail to pay over money collected for clients. A court of equity will not take jurisdiction in such a case.

App. 281.</p> <p id=\"b516-12\" pgmap=\"516\">The bill discloses no such case for an accounting as gives a court of equity jurisdiction.</p> <p id=\"b516-13\" pgmap=\"516\">The decree of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
