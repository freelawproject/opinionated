The lease ran until the first of the succeeding March, and was of \u201c the tailor shop \u201d in the rear of 183 Sedgwick street, to be used as a tailor shop.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-5\" pgmap=\"216\">The lessees covenanted to surrender the premises at the end of the term in as good condition as they were at the beginning, reasonable use, wear and tear and damages by the elements excepted.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-6\" pgmap=\"216\">In February the trap of a pipe in the basement of the building froze and burst; this pipe led to a wash-basin in the work room above; the basement was occupied only by a gas engine, no fire being kept in it. The plaintiffs being notified of the bursting by the defendants and by them told \u201cto fix it,\u201d sent a plumber. The plumber had before been there three times and put in new traps; he, a witness for the defendants, testified that if he \u201c put in a new trap it would be froze every day and they couldn\u2019t use the sink, so it was no use of putting in a new trap there; so I just put down a straight piece of pipe; because there was no people living there and they had a tailor shop in the place; the basement was not occupied by people. The pipe connected only with a sink, not with a water closet.\u201d The plumber was not instructed to remove the trap.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-7\" pgmap=\"216\">After the removal of the trap, sewer gas came up; \u201c the house was full of it; \u201d the defendant\u2019s work-people complained and some of them and one of the tenants became ill. Mrs. Dennick was told by one of the defendants, of the sewer gas, and she said she would fix it, but did not.</p><attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b216-8\" pgmap=\"216\">James Harvey Hooper, attorney for appellants.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b216-9\" pgmap=\"216\">S.

Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, Vol. 18, p. 298. Where a constructive eviction is claimed the intent of the landlord to evict must appear, and this is a question of fact for the jury. Taylor on Landlord &amp; Tenant, Section 381.</p> <p id=\"b217-4\" pgmap=\"217\">In Morris v. Tilson, 81 Ill. 607-623, the Supreme Court said:</p> <blockquote id=\"b217-5\" pgmap=\"217\">\u201cThe rule laid down in Hayner et al. v. Smith and wife, 63 Ill. 430, and followed in Lynch v. Baldwin, 69 Ill. 210, and Walker et al. v. Tucker, 70 Id. 527, is, that acts by the landlord, in interference with the tenant\u2019s possession, to constitute an eviction, must clearly indicate an intention on the part of the landlord that the tenant shall no longer continue to hold the premises.\u201d See also, Chicago Legal News Co. v. Browne, 103 Ill. 317-321.</blockquote> <p id=\"b217-6\" pgmap=\"217\">Where a constructive eviction is claimed, the abandonment of the premises by the tenant must be within a reasonable time after the acts complained of. Dewitt v. Pierson, 112 Mass. 8; Edgerton v. Page, 1 Hilton (N. Y.) 320; same v. same, 20 N. Y. 281.</p> <p id=\"b217-7\" pgmap=\"217\">In the present case there is no evidence tending to show that the landlords intended to disturb the tenants, deprive them of the enjoyment of the premises or do anything that would cause them to abandon the same. .</p> <p id=\"b217-8\" pgmap=\"217\">The landlords were not bound to repair; but being requested by the tenants to do so they sent a plumber, giving him no directions as to in what manner the defect complained of should he remedied. Manifestly, the landlords did not intend to do a wrongful act, or one injurious to the tenants. The plumber, a licensed workman, used his own best judgment. What he did may not have been the best thing to do but he evidently thought it was.</p> <p id=\"b217-9\" pgmap=\"217\">The defendants thereafter continued in the place for some six months.</p> <p id=\"b217-10\" pgmap=\"217\">True it is, they did once complain to Mrs. Dennick of the sewer gas and she said she would fix it.</p> <p id=\"b218-3\" pgmap=\"218\">It does not appear that a complaint was made at anytime of the removal of the trap nor that it was stated that the removal of the trap caused the presence of the gas.</p> <p id=\"b218-4\" pgmap=\"218\">While, whether acts constitute an eviction is a mingled question of law and fact, there must be shown an intention of the landlord, manifested by acts, to deprive the tenant of the beneficial use of the premises\u2014in brief, a violation of the landlord\u2019s contract of enjoyment, to warrant a finding of eviction by a jury. Such there was not in this case.</p> <p id=\"b218-5\" pgmap=\"218\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
