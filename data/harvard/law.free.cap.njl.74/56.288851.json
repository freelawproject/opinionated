By statute a transfer of a license from one person to another, or from one place to another, is lawful. The statutes, with regard to transfers in cities, which sustain the view here stated are as follows: Generally, as to cities, see <em>Gen. Stat., p. </em>1815, \u00a7 153; as to cities of the second class, see <em>Gen. Stat., p. </em>1823, \u00a7 195; as to cities of the third class, see <em>Gen. Stat., p. </em>1819, \u00a7 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">On the second ground we think that the license transferred in this case was, at the time it was transferred, transferred to a location within two hundred feet of a then existing church building, in which religious services were regularly conducted, within the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">On the grounds last stated the transfer in this case will be set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
