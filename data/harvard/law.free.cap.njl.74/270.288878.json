It is equally obvious that the trial judge did not appreciate the precise ground of the exception prayed by counsel. Counsel could have been required to state his ground more specifically, but in the absence of such requirement his exception is sufficient. <em>Van Blarcom </em>v. <em>Central Railroad Co., </em>44 <em>Vroom </em>540.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
