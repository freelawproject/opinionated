The claim was that the gangplank was placed improperly, and that when Mrs. Gassert stepped upon it it tipped over, precipitating her to the dock. There was a verdict for the defendant company and the plaintiffs have sued out this writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">The first assignment is that the court-improperly charged the jury upon the question of contributory negligence, as follows: \u201cYou may ask yourselves another question \u2014 whether the plaintiff, Mrs. Gassert, was herself negligent; in other words, assuming, now, that the plaintiff\u2019s testimony is to be adopted, whether there was negligence on her part in stepping upon such a gangplank as this was, a little elevated above the surface of the dock?\u201d Part of the testimony submitted by the plaintiff, and given by her son, who was in her company at the time of the accident, was that more of the gangplank was on the dock than on the boat, and that the end of the gangplank was tilted up very perceptibly. Assuming this to have been the situation, it clearly was for the jury to say whether the plaintiff was negligent in failing to ob-\u2019 serve it; or if they found she did observe it, then whether she was negligent in stepping upon it as she did. There was no error, therefore, in leaving the question of contributory negligence to the jury in the manner in which it was submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">The only other assignment argued is that it was error for the judge to charge the jury that they \u201cshould consider that the point of junction of the ferry-boat and its dock may be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>point of clanger, and that the plaintiff was bound to use care accordingly.\u201d It is difficult to understand from the brief of counsel just why this instruction is considered erroneous. It is to be observed that the instruction was not that the point of junction of the ferry-boat with its dock is a point of danger, but that it \u201cmay be\u201d so. The truth of this statement seems to us to be obvious. The happening of the accident to Mrs. Gassert in this very ease demonstrates its accuracy. Not only did the trial judge have the warrant of common experience for this instruction, but he was further justified in it by judicial decisions. In the case of <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>New Jersey Railroad Co., </em>4 <em>Vroom </em>90, and, again, in <em>Dwyer </em>v. <em>New York, &amp;c., Railway Co., </em>18 <em>Id. </em>9, this court declared that the junction point of a ferry-boat and its dock \u201cmust in the nature of things be a place of same danger.\u201d Thes\u00e9 cases settle the law of the state with regard to the character of such places, so far as the Circuit Courts are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The judgment under review must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
