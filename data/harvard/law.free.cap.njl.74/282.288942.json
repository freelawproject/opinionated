He rang the bell to start the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-20\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>And what after that?</p>\n<p id=\"b337-21\"><em>UA. </em>He stopped it.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-22\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Did you get on ?</p>\n<p id=\"b337-23\"><em>\u201cA. </em>No, sir, not at first.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-24\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Where was the conductor standing?</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number><em>\u201cA. </em>Right inside of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Iiow long would you think you waited before Mrs. Speer came up to get on the car?</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Just a short time; probably fifteen or twenty seconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\"><em>e:Q. </em>In other words, you were running; you motioned for the car to stop and you went up and when j'nu got there, what did you do \u2014 put your hand on the rail?</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>On the front rail?</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>When you put your hand there to get on, you saw her . coming to the car?</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\"><em>\u201cA. </em>On the other side of the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Then what did you do?</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I stepped off to let her get on first.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-15\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Iiow did she fall?</p>\n<p id=\"b338-16\"><em>\u201cA. </em>The best I can say, is as she stepped on the ear the car started; as the car started, she got tangled up, somehow or other, and fell.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-17\">The conductor, sworn on the part of the defendant, testifies that he did not see Mrs. Speer fall from the car; did not see her attempt to board the car, and that she did not signal him so that she might get on the car, and, in answer to a question on cross-examination, \u201cIsn\u2019t it a fact that you don\u2019t remember this occurrence at all?\u201d saj's, \u201cI did not see her and did not know anything at all about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-18\">Where the conductor gives the signal for a trolley car to start, in the presence of a passenger who is boarding the car, and before the passenger has had opportunity .to get fully upon the car, and the passenger is thrown off and injured, there can be no doubt that the defendant\u2019s negligence is established.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-19\">It is the duty of the conductor to give every' person desiring to board a standing car an opportunity to do so. He cannot fully perform that duty unless he can see the persons attempting to board the car, or in some way receive reliable information as to their movements. He has no right to conclude that because the car has been stopped for what he con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>siclcrs sufficient time for all persons desiring to become passengers at that point that all such persons have safely boarded the car, and with that knowledge only start the car. He ought to ascertain before' he starts the ear that all persons so desiring have golten upon the car, otherwise for injury that ensues to any passenger the defendant is guilty of negligence. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">It is negligence in the conductor of a trolley car which lias conic to a stop at a street corner for the purpose of taking on passengers to start it until he has exercised due care to ascertain that all persons there waiting to take it have safely boarded the ear.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The case of <em>Pitcher </em>v. <em>People\u2019s Railway Co., </em>54 <em>Pa. St. </em>560, affirmed in 174 <em>Id. </em>402, has no application to this case, for there the person injured was attempting to board the car at the front platform under circumstances that did not charge the motorman or conductor with knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The duty involved in this case is not to use that high degree of care which is required of common carriers toward passengers, but only to exercise reasonable care. Whether the plaintiff, when injured, ivas a passenger of the defendant company, it is not, therefore, necessary to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">The question of the defendant\u2019s negligence was for the jury, and the evidence was sufficient for the finding of such negligence as would make the defendant liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">One of the reasons assigned for the direction of a verdict has reference to the physical condition of the plaintiff. She produced testimony that it was the result of the accident; the defendant insisted, in its testimony, that it existed in the same condition before the accident. This was purely a question of fact for determination by the jury. It affords no ground for error.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">We find no error in the refusal to nonsuit or to direct a verdict, and the judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
