At a preliminary hearing the court decides those questions and passes upon those matters which are material in determining the subsequent or further steps to be taken in the cause. There may be several preliminary hearings in a cause, but in the very nature of things there can be but one final hearing, at which the cause is absolutely disposed of by the entry of a final decree upon the merits of the suit.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b556-10\">2. Final Judgments and <em>Decrees\u2014Criterion to Determine Whether Decree Final or </em>Interlocutory.\u2014A decree is final when it either refuses or grants the relief sought by the party complaining, or it is interlocutory when the further action of the court is necessary to afford the complete relief contemplated by the court.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b556-12\">3. Final Judgments and <em>Decrees\u2014Definition of Final </em>Decree.\u2014 A final decree is defined to be one which disposes of the whole subject and gives all the relief that was contemplated by the suit, so that nothing remains to be done in the cause, or which adjudicates all the matters in controversy between the parties, although much may remain to be done before the decree can be carried completely into execution.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b556-14\">4. Final Judgments and <em>Decrees\u2014Final in Part, Interlocutory in Part\u2014Final as to one Party, Not as to Another </em>party.\u2014 While a decree cannot be in part final and in part interlocutory in the same cause for or against the same parties who remain in court, in Virginia it has often been decided that a decree may be final as to one party and not as to. another.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b556-16\">5.

Final Judgments and <em>Decrees\u2014Decree Removing Guardian and Confirming Commissioner\u2019s Report Stating Guardian\u2019s Account\u2014Case at </em>Bar.\u2014In the instant case a decree was held to be final where it not only confirmed the commissioner\u2019s report stating the account of a guardian, but went further and itself disposed of the whole subject in controversy in the cause so far as defendants (appellees) were concerned, and gave against the defendants all the relief that was contemplated by the suit. Nothing remained to be done in the cause in order to obtain such relief. The decree was amply sufficient therefor. All that remained to be done was to carry the decree into execution, and in the instant case no ' further decree or order of court in the cause was needed even for that purpose.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b557-7\">7. <em>Equity\u2014Rehearing\u2014Bill of Review\u2014Section 3151 of the Code of </em>1901.\u2014In a suit for the removal of a guardian and the settlement of his accounts, a final decree can be reheard after the term at which it is entered only upon motion under section 3451 of the Code of 1904, where the decree was on a bill taken for confessed, or on a bill of review. But as the practice in Virginia is liberal, touching mere forms of pleading, the court will regard petitions of a guardian and his surety, praying that such decree be reheard, vacated and set aside, as bills of review.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b557-9\">8. Bill of <em>Review\u2014Motion to Reheat v.nder Section 3151 of the Code of </em>1901\u2014Grounds.\u2014There are but two classes of grounds on which a final decree in a suit for the removal of a guardian and the settlement of his accounts may be reheard upon a bill of reviewoor a proceeding by motion under section 3451 of the Code of 1904, namely, because of error apparent on the face of the record, or because of newly discovered evidence which could not by the use of due diligence have been discovered or used before the decree was rendered.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b557-11\">9. Bill of <em>Review\u2014Motion to Rehear under Section 3151 of the Code of </em>1901\u2014Grounds.\u2014The instant case was a bill of review to set aside a final decree removing a guardian and confirming a commissioner\u2019s report stating his accounts for the alleged omission of the commissioner to allow the guardian certain items of credit, which items are alleged to have existed prior to the taking and stating of such account, which the guardian neglected to assert in any way before the commissioner or before the court prior to the decree, although the guardian was a party defendant to the suit and had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>been brought before the court by personal service of process, and had been personally served with notice of the taking of the account.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b558-5\"><em>Held: </em>It being apparent that the right of the guardian to any and all of such claims of credit was dependent upon extrinsic evidence, that the errors alleged in the bill of review as grounds for the rehearing were not errors in law apparent on the face of the decree.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b558-6\">10. Bill of Review as Answer.\u2014After a final decree in a suit . to obtain the removal of a guardian and the settlement of his accounts, the guardian filed a petition \u25a0. for rehearing (regarded by the court as a bill of review) on the ground that the commissioner in taking his account failed to allow him certain credits dependent upon extrinsic evidence.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b558-9\"><em>Held: </em>That the bill of review of the guardian was in truth a belated answer sought to be filed after a final decree, and that this could not be done even under the liberal practice permitted by section 3275 of the Code of 1904.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b558-10\">11. Pinal Judgments and <em>Decrees\u2014Decree Pro Confesso\u2014Reversal or </em>Amendment.\u2014A final decree removing a guardian and confirming a report of commissioner stating his accounts was entered on a bill taken for confessed, so that section 3451 of the Code of 1904 was applicable thereto, such statute authorized the court below to set it aside only for error for which the Supreme Court of Appeals on appeal might reverse it, or to amend it only to the extent that data might appear in the record for safely correcting it. But the Supreme Court of Appeals cannot on appeal reverse a decree for extrinsic matter which does not appear in the record prior to or at the time of the entry of the decree, where such matter is not claimed to have been after-discovered evidence. Hence neither the court below nor the Supreme Court of Appeals is given any statutory authority to reverse or amend such decree.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b558-12\">12. Pinal Judgments and <em>Decrees\u2014Bill of Review\u2014Grounds for </em>Rehearing.\u2014In Virginia, as elsewhere, the general rule that a final decree cannot be reheard except upon the two grounds of (1) error apparent on the face of the record, or (2) after-discovered evidence, has not been modified.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b558-14\">13. Bill of <em>Review\u2014Guardian and Surety\u2014Nbtice of Taking of </em>Account.\u2014A final decree having been entered against a guardian, and his surety, removing the guardian and confirming the report of a commissioner stating the guardian\u2019s account and requiring the guardian to pay over the amounts found due, and the commissioner\u2019s report not having been excepted to prior to the decree by the surety, a party de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>fendant personally before the court, the surety could not bring the cause again before the court by bill of review, on the ground that it had no notice of the taking of' the account.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b559-5\">14. Bill of <em>Review\u2014Notice of Taking of </em>Account.\u2014Want of notice of the time and place of a commissioner taking an account is not sufficient reason for a bill of review or' petition for rehearing, such objection not having been taken, as it ought to have been before the decree was rendered.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b559-7\">15. <em>Process\u2014Service of Process\u2014Notice of Subsequent Proceedings \u2014Notice of Taking of </em>Account.\u2014Notice to parties that they have been sued and to bring them before the court stands upon a very different footing from notice of the time and place of taking an account ordered by the court in a pending cause. The parties, having been sued and served with process bringing them before the court, are presumed to know the subsequent proceedings in the suit which are taken in court.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b559-9\">16. Bill of <em>Review\u2014Guardian\u2019s Accounts\u2014Failure to adopt Rest </em>Day.\u2014It is not ground for a bill of review by the suxetjy of a guardian for error on the face of the record that a commissioner\u2019s report, confirmed by final decree stating the accounts of the guardian, failed to adopt one rest day and mixed principal and interest, where the account as stated was more favorable to the guardian, and hence more favorable also to the surety, than if it had been correctly stated.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b559-11\">17. Accounts and <em>Accounting\u2014Interest\u2014Compound Interest.^</em>In accordance with the law governing the settlement of guardianship accounts on each annual rest day and on tile date the guardianship ceases, all undisbursed interest with which the guardian is chargeable is transferred to the principal column of the account, and the balance in his hands thus ascertained is treated as being principal, and interest-bearing from such times, and to that extent a guardian is chargeable with compound interest. Section 2606 of the Code of 1904.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b559-13\">18.

But in stating the account of a guardian after the terminal tion of the wardship there should be no subsequent rest day, or bringing of interest into the principal column, again compounding the interest. The balance found in the guardian\u2019s hands at the termination of the wardship, interest as well as principal, being all treated as principal, bears interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>from that date, but none of the interest accruing after such date bears any interest; the account being stated after that date \u201con the ordinary principles of debtor and creditor as to interest.\u201d</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-5\">Appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court of Campbell county.

Gills, as their next friend.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-8\">The father of the infants was killed in a dynamite explosion in West Virginia, on May 12, 1911, where he was then at work as a partner in a firm of railroad contractors. His wife, the said mother, and the infant children were living with him at such place of work at the time. The wife was a native of West Virginia and had relatives in that State. The decedent was a native of Virginia and was a son of John W.

There was a qualification upon his estate, and pending the distribution of the estate by the administrator and the building of a dwelling house on a lot which the widow purchased near the home of the said John W. Gills, the widow and children remained in the home of John W. Gills from May 13 to July 20, 1911.

About a month thereafter, to-wit, on May 12, 1912, the said John W. Gills, qualified as such guardian, with the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, one of the appellees, as surety on the guardianship bond, which was in the penalty of $7,000,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-6\">The said mother consented to such qualification and at his earnest request and solicitation, and upon the express promise on his part that he would charge no commission or other compensation for his services, wrote the court nominating such guardian and moved the court to make such appointment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-7\">On June 4, 1913, the said guardian collected of the administrator of the deceased father of said infants, $4,-415.98, and on August 19, 1913, collected from such administrator $26.13, the residue of the shares of such infants in the net balance of the personal estate of such decedent, making a total of $4,642.11, estate of the infants which came into the hands of such guardian.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-8\">After the receipt of said estate the guardian in 1913 paid for the support and maintenance of said infants only the aggregate of $55.00, in three payments, to the mother; in 1914 only the aggregate of $80.00, in five payments, to .same; and in 1915, prior to the time the suit was brought, only the aggregate of $40.00, in two payments, to same; altogether aggregating only the sum of $175 thus paid from the income from said $4,642.11 of estate, for the support and maintenance of the infants for a period of over two years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b561-9\">- Such payments to the mother were insufficient for the support and maintenance of the infants and she had to use for that purpose and her own support all that was left to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>her of her own distributive share of said estate after buying said lot and building said dwelling, being some $600, but nothing more could be gotten from the guardian for the support and maintenance of the infants prior to \u2022 the institution of the suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-4\">On June 26, 1915, the guardian paid to the mother $10 and on July 26, 1915, $25, making up the aggregate of $210 paid her by him for the purposes aforesaid in 1913, 1914 and 1915.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-5\">The guardian settled no account of his transaction prior to the institution of the suit, although after the expiration' of a year from his qualification he was frequently requested to do so by the commissioner of accounts at the instance of the said mother and at the instance of said surety on the guardianship bond, and he at no time gave any reasonable excuse for such default.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-6\">The objects of the suit, in so far as the appellees, the said guardian and surety company, are concerned, were, as disclosed by the bill, to obtain the following relief :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-7\">(a) A settlement of the accounts of the guardian before a commissioner of court in .which no commissions should be allowed him for two reasons alleged in the bill\u2014first, because of the agreement aforesaid of the guardian not to charge any commissions, and, secondly, because he had forfeited all commissions by his failure to settle his accounts as required by law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-8\">(b) The payment by the guardian of certain sums by. direction of the court for the support and maintenance of the infants pending the suit and to reimburse the mother for sums already paid out by her for that purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-9\">(c) The removal of the guardian.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-10\">(d) A judgment by decree of court requiring the guardian and the surety aforesaid to pay over to the successor of such guardian all sums due by the latter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-11\">Both the guardian and surety company were made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>the bill parties defendant to the suit and were personally served with process and thus brought before the court as such parties. Neither of them made any defense until the petitions hereinafter mentioned were filed. The bill was regularly taken for confessed as to both such defendants; and at the September term, 1915, a decree was entered directing the guardian to forthwith pay to said mother the sum of $100 on account of the support and maintenance of the infants and thereafter the sum of $25 per month on the first day of each and every month to the mother for the same purposes; and it was further ordered that the guardian settle an account of his transactions before a commissioner named, who was appointed for the purpose, and such commissioner was directed to examine, state and settle such account and report the same to the court, along with any other accounts, reports or matters deemed pertinent by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-5\">On October 6, 1915, the commissioner appointed for the purpose, as aforesaid, proceeded to execute said decree of reference. With respect to notice of such proceeding the commissioner states in his report that \u201cin pursuance of the annexed notice of the time and place for taking said accounts, he proceeded to execute said decree.\u201d And in a succeeding paragraph of the' report he says: \u201cYour commissioner had an extract of said decree served on said John W. Gills, which required him to make settlement of his account as guardian before your commissioner, but he failed to appear or make any settlement whatever.\u201d The commissioner returned annexed to his report two copies of notices of the proceeding before him, both in the following form: There was the title of the cause set out as \u201cMary E.

Gills and other above named parties,\u201d followed by the usual form of commissioner\u2019s notice in such case. There is no return or other endorsement on the two notices showing any service or acknowledgment of service of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-5\">Neither the guardian nor surety appeared before the commissioner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-6\">The commissioner took the deposition of said widow and mother and filed his report in which he stated an account of the transactions of the guardian. To this report there was no exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-7\">In the statement of this account no fixed annual rest day is taken. The account is stated with four different rest days, to-wit, January 1, 1914, October 2, 1914, and July 26, 1915, and November 1, 1915, the date the wardship terminated, as of which dates the interest with which the guardian is charged for the preceding periods (beginning with interest on the $4,615.98, the first receipts of the guardian, from 30 days after such sum came into his hands) is brought into the principal column, the aggregates of dis-bursements made by him during such preceding periods, respectively, are deducted and the interest computed on the respective balances to the next succeeding rest day, thus compounding the interest from such rest days prior to November 1, 1915, and bringing down the balance in the hands of the guardian of principal and interest as of the last named date. No credit is allowed the guardian in such statement of account except for the payments to the mother aforesaid, which aggregated $210, as aforesaid, and were less than the interest with which the guardian was charged as of each of said rest days. The aggregate of interest with which the guardian is charged in his account is $632.64. The disbursements aforesaid of $210 being deducted from this left $422.64 (but stated in the account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>to be $422.58), balance of interest, and the $4,642.11 of the principal received by him as aforesaid, or $5,064.75 (but stated in the account as $5,064.69), as the total amount of principal and interest found in the hands of the guardian as of November 1, 1915, to which date the balance due by the guardian is brought down as afoi*esaid, of which one-third, or $1,688.23, belonged to each of said infants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-4\">Had this same account been stated with May 12 or June 4 as the rest day, and had been otherwise stated strictly according to law in the usual method of statement of a guardianship account, the result would have been that a somewhat greater amount would have been found to have been in the hands of the guardian as of November 1, 1915, the date of the termination of the wardship, than the $5,064.69 as shown by such account as it was reported \u2014the report making in such balance a difference in favor of the guardian as compared with the results of correct statements of the same account with either of such annual rest days.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-5\">Thereupon the following decree was entered:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-6\"><em>Decree, November Term, </em>1915.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-7\">\u201cThis cause which was regularly matured at rules on process duly and legally served, came on this day to be heard on the bill of complaints taken for confessed, the exhibits filed with said bill, and the report of Commissioner F.

Those questions which, in view of the conclusions we have reached thereon, dispose of the case will be passed upon in their order as stated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">1. Was the decree of November term, 1915, which appears in the statement preceding this opinion, an interlocutory or a final decree?</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\"><bracketnum>[1-4]</bracketnum> As laid down in that excellent work, Hogg\u2019s Equity Procedure, Vol. 1, section 556, \u201cThere are two kinds of hearings in a court of equity: (1) Preliminary or interlocutory, and (2) final hearings. At a preliminary hearing'the court decides those questions and passes upon those matters which are material in determining the subsequent or further steps to be taken in the cause * * * There may be several preliminary hearings in a cause, but in the very nature of things, there can be but one final hearing, at which the cause is absolutely disposed of by the entry of a final decree upon the merits of the suit.\u201d Again, <em>Idem, </em>sec. 567: \u201c* * * probably no better\u201d (criterion) \u201ccan be found\u201d (of when a. decree is final and when interlocutory) \u201cthan that given by Baldwin J., in <em>Cocke </em>v. <em>Gilpin, </em>1 Rob. (40 Va.) 20, 26-27, in which it is said that <em>\u2018a </em>decree is final when it either refuses or grants the relief sought by the party complaining;\u2019 or it is interlocutory \u2018when the further action of the court is necessary to afford the complete relief contemplated by the court.\u2019 \u201d Again, <em>Idem, </em>section 209: \u201cA final decree is defined to be one which disposes of the whole subject and gives all the relief that was contemplated by the suit, so that nothing remains to be done in the cause, or which adjudicates all the matters in controversy between the parties, although much may remain to be done before the decree can be carried completely into execution.\u201d Again, <em>Idem, </em>section 569: \u201cWhile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>a decree cannot be in part final, and in part interlocutory, in the same cause, for or against the same parties who remain in court, in Virginia it has often been decided that a decree may be final as to one party and not as to another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The above statements of the law are sustained by numerous Virginia decisions which are cited by the learned author to support them. See also to same effect, <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Merritt, </em>125 Va. 162, 99 S. E. 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\"><bracketnum>[5, 6]</bracketnum> It is true that the application of the general principles thus laid down to particular decrees is not always free from difficulty; but we encounter no difficulty whatever in reaching the conclusion that upon the application of such principles to the decree in question it must be regarded as a final decree. It is such a decree not because it confirms the commissioner\u2019s report therein mehtioned, for the confirmation of a commissioner\u2019s report is in itself a preliminary or interlocutory matter, a mere basis for final decretal action. If such final decretal action had been postponed to some other time the decree would not have been final although it confirmed the commissioner\u2019s report. But the decree under consideration not only confirmed the report and thus established the basis for a final decree, but it went further and itself thereupon disposed \u201cof the whole subject\u201d in controversy in the cause so far as the appellees were concerned and gave against the appellees \u201call the relief that was contemplated by the suit,\u201d as clearly appears from a comparison of the decree with the objects of the suit \u2014the relief thereby sought against appellees\u2014set forth in the statement preceding this opinion. \u201cNothing remained to be done in the cause\u201d in order to obtain such relief. The decree was amply sufficient therefor. All that remained to be done was to carry the decree into execution and in the case before us no further decree or order of court in the cause was needed even for that purpose. The decree was therefore unquestionably a final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number><bracketnum>[7]</bracketnum> 2. Should the petitions filed in the cause by the appellees, as set forth in the statement preceding this opinion, be regarded as petitions for rehearing or as bills of review ?</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">It is well settled that if a rehearing of the final decree of November term, 1915, could have been properly granted upon such petitions, it must have been on regarding the petitions as bills of review, since in a suit of the character of that before us a final decree can be reheard after the terms at which it is entered only upon motion under section 3451 of the Code, where the decree as in this case was on a bill taken for confessed (which procedure was not followed), or upon a bill of review. Our practice is rightly liberal as touching mere forms of pleading, however, and we have no difficulty in regarding the petitions as bills of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">3. Are the errors alleged in the bill of review of the appellee guardian as grounds for the rehearing of said decree errors in law apparent on the face of such decree\u2014 that is, are they errors in law that appear upon the face of the proceedings when the whole record is read along with such decree?</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\"><bracketnum>[8]</bracketnum> We state this question thus as it is settled, and, of course, well understood, that there are but two classes of grounds on which a final decree in a suit such as that before us may be reheard upon a bill of review (and the same is true of a proceeding by motion under section 3451 of the Code), and they are (1) because of error apparent on the face of the record (Hogg\u2019s Eq. Proc., sec. 211); or (2) because of newly discovered evidence which could not by the use of due diligence have been discovered or used before the decree was rendered. (1 Barton\u2019s Chy. Pr., p. 332; 1 Hogg\u2019s Eq. Proc., sec. 208; 2 Pollard\u2019s Code, sec. 3451. and cases cited). And, as appears from the statement preceding this opinion, the bills of review of the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>pellees do not seek a rehearing of said decree on the second ground just mentioned.,</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\"><bracketnum>[9]</bracketnum> As appears, from the statement preceding this opinion, the errors alleged in the bill of review of the guardian all consist merely of the alleged omission of the commissioner taking and stating the account of the transactions of the guardian to allow the latter certain items of credit, which items are alleged to have existed prior to the taking and stating of such account, which the guardian neglected to assert in any way before the commissioner or before the court prior to said decree of November term, 1915, although the guardian was a party defendant to the suit and had been brought before the court as such by personal service of process and had in addition been personally served with notice of the taking of said account by the commissioner and with an extract of that portion of the decree which required him to settle his accounts before the Commissioner. And it is apparent that the right of the guardian to any and all of such claims of credit is dependent upon extrinsic evidence. Even his claim to commissions was, as a matter of law, dependent upon his being able to give a reasonable excuse for his failure to settle his accounts as required by law. 2 Pollard\u2019s Code, 1904, sec. 2679, and cases cited. And in view of the allegations of the bill and that it was taken for confessed, as the record stood at the time of the taking of said account and the entry of the decree under consideration, the fact that such excuse did not exist was concluded against the guardian. And there being no extrinsic evidence before the commissioner to show that the disbursements had been in fact made which constituted the other alleged omitted <em>credits, </em>or that, if made, they constituted proper charges against the estate of the infants, it is plain that none of the errors alleged in the bill of review of the guardian constituted' error in law apparent on the face of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>We can. perceive no reason why the final decree aforesaid was not conclusive against the guardian. He was given his day in court to make all the defenses he had. He made none until after such decree had been entered and the term of court at which such decree was pronounced had ended. It is apparent from the record that his claim to commissions and for board and clothing of the infants and the other claims of credit aforesaid other than for the clerk\u2019s fee and taxes, were after-thoughts\u2014were charges which the guardian did not intend to make at the time such services were rendered and disbursements were made which were rendered or made by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\"><bracketnum>[10-11]</bracketnum> The bill of review of the guardian is in truth a belated answer sought to be filed after a final decree. That cannot be done even under the. liberal practice permitted by our statute (sec. 3275 of the Code) on the subject. A contrary rule, which would permit causes to be reopened after final decree, by the injection therein of new and previously unthought of claims, or even of other claims originally just and which might have been maintained if earlier presented, but which through neglect of the claimant were not brought forward at the proper time, would be far-reaching in its evil results. Such procedure, unless authorized by statute, cannot be approved by us. There is no such statute. Although th\u00e9 decree under consideration was entered on a bill taken for confessed so that section 3451 of the Code is applicable thereto, such statute authorized the court below to set it aside only for error for which this court, on appeal, might reverse it, or to amend it only to the extent that data might appear in the record for safely correcting it. <em>Shipman </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>91 Va. 473, 22 S. E. 458. This court cannot on appeal reverse a decree for extrinsic matter which does not appear in the record prior to or at the time of the entry of the decree, where such matter is not claimed to have been after-discovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>evidence. And at such time no data' appears as having been in the record in the case before us by which the decree in question, if erroneous, could have \u25a0 been safely amended. Hence neither the court below nor this court is given any statutory authority to reverse or amend such decree. Courts are provided for the purpose of putting an end, and a speedy end, to controversies, and not as a forum for endless litigation. Without .valid excuse .no party who has had his day in court can reopen the hearing after final decision of extrinsic matters in controversy between the same parties on the mere ground that he wishes to interpose other defenses which he neglected to interpose before such decision was made. It is seldom that such defenses have any real merit, and where it chances that they have any validity, it is better that they should be lost by the negligent litigant than that the vitally important rule that there must be an end of litigation should be set at naught.</p>\n<p id=\"AVN\">4. But it is argued for appellees, under the authority of <em>Nelson\u2019s Adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Kownslar\u2019s Ex\u2019r, etc., </em>79 Va. 468; <em>Wooding </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>76 Va. 614; <em>Newberry </em>v. <em>Stuart, </em>86 Va. 976, 11 S. E. 880; <em>Daily\u2019s Ex\u2019r </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>80 Va. 512, and <em>Kendrick v</em>. <em>Whitney, </em>28 Gratt. (69 Va.) 646, that in Virginia at least the general rule, that a final decree cannot be reheard except upon the two grounds above mentioned (of error apparent on the face of the record or of after-discovered evidence), has been modified; and they invoke the following statement in the opinion of Judge Staples in <em>Wooding </em>v. <em>Bradley, supra, </em>76 Va. 614, as applicable to final as well as to interlocutory decrees, because, as it is argued, the court in the last named case, and in all of the cases cited in the present paragraph, was- dealing with final decrees. We shall now consider the question thus raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The statement in the opinion of Judge Staples, men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>tioned, is as follows: \u201cThere is no rule of law or practice which forbids a court, so long as it retains a cause under its consideration, from receiving and entertaining an exception to a commissioner\u2019s report, even after the same has been confirmed, if it be clearly shown that the report, if carried out, would be productive of injustice and wrong.\u201d (See p. 616 of the opinion.)</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">An examination of the authorities referred to discloses the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\"><em>Wooding </em>v. <em>Bradley </em>was a creditor\u2019s suit having for its object the sale of the land of a decedent debtor\u2019s estate to satisfy the debts. The decree in question (of October, 1874) confirmed the commissioner\u2019s report of the Terry debt, among other debts, and appointed commissioners to sell the land to pay the debts reported. This manifestly was not a final but an interlocutory decree confirming a commissioner\u2019s report. Such a decree is appealable under the statute in Virginia because it is one \u201cadjudicating the principles of a cause\u201d (sec. 3454 of the Code), but it is nevertheless but an interlocutory decree, and the same court which entered it has the power to rehear and to correct any error in it at any time before final decree and thus remove the cause for appeal. 1 Hogg\u2019s Eq. Proc. sec. 568. A decree of sale is not a final but an interlocutory decree. <em>Dellinger </em>v. <em>Foltz, </em>93 Va. at p. 733, 25 S. E. 998, and cases cited. It is true that in August, 1876, and January, 1877, Terry was paid the amount of his debt as reported by said commissioner\u2019s report. But when the decree in question was asked to be reheard there were funds which arose from the sale of the land still in the hands of a commissioner of sale and under the control of the court of sufficient amount to pay the balance which was in fact still justly due and unpaid on the Terry debt. The payment and satisfaction of the whole of such debt was a part of the relief that was contemplated by and was one of the objects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>of the suit. In the very opinion of Judge Staples, from which the quotation above is taken, it is said: \u201cThat no final decree had been rendered 'at the time the petition was presented, is too clear to admit of discussion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\"><em>Nelson\u2019s Adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Kownslar\u2019s Executrix, </em>79 Va. 468, was also a creditor\u2019s suit for the sale of land of a deceased debtor\u2019s estate to satisfy the debts. The decree which the court said was open to attack by petition to rehear (the decree of March, 1875), merely confirmed a commissioner\u2019s report which ascertained the commuted value of and allowed the widow a certain credit for her dower in so much of the land as had been sold and had been purchased by her, and appointed commissioners to assign dower in kind in so much of the land as had not been sold, and allowed the widow to then elect to claim dower. Manifestly this was in truth merely an interlocutory decree, as the court expressly held it to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\"><em>Newberry </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>86 Va, 967, 11 S. E. 880, was a suit to enforce a contract for the sale of land. The ascertainment of the balance of purchase money which was unpaid was a matter purely preliminary to a final decree. The Holbrook report in question contained a statement of the amount of certain debts which the purchaser claimed <em>tof </em>have paid and to be entitled to set up as credits on his purchase money obligation. The decree in question confirmed that report. But that report itself purported to be only \u201ca partial report,\u201d and there were other proceedings which the court in its opinion said indicated that it was subsequently so regarded and not as even a determination at that time of that matter, and the court held that the decree in question was merely an interlocutory decree confirming a commissioner\u2019s report. The court said, in part, on this subject: \u201c* * * it is well settled that whether an interlocutory decree confirming a commissioner\u2019s report shall be modified or wholly set aside, or not, is generally a matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>resting in the sound discretion of the chancellor, to be exercised according to the particular circumstances of each case. <em>Kendrick </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>28 Gratt. (69 Va.) 646; <em>Fultz </em>v. <em>Brightwell, </em>77 Va. 742; 1 Bart. Chy. Pr. 339. * * * Here there was no absolute adjudication of the appellee\u2019s claims until\u201d (the subsequent decree which modified the decree above mentioned by allowing a larger credit to the purchaser) .</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\"><em>Daily\u2019s Executors </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>80 Va. 512, was a creditor\u2019s suit for the sale of lands of a deceased debtor to satisfy the debts. The decree in question involved merely a controversy between certain parties claiming as assignees of a part of one of the lien debts reported in the cause. The fund from the sale of the land was under the control of the court at the time such decree was entered, the lien of the debts being treated as transferred from the land to the fund. The assignor was not a party to the cause at the time the decree was entered on the petition of one of the rival claimants, nor was the other rival claimant then a party to the cause so far as appears from the report of the case. Later the assignor and such other rival claimant filed their petition asking that the decree aforesaid be set aside in favor of the latter as holding under a prior assignment, which was done. Manifestly there Avas no binding adjudication of the rights of the claimant under the prior assignment made by the decree drawn in question. Moreover, it was plainly merely an interlocutory decree so long as the fund still remained under the control of the court, as the court held.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\"><em>Kendrick </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>28 Gratt. (69 Va.) 646, the remaining authority relied on by appellees, as aforesaid, was a judgment creditor\u2019s suit for the sale of land of the judgment debtor to satisfy the lien of the judgments. The descree in question merely provided that the plaintiffs recover of the judgment debtor the amount of their judgments; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>that a certain time be given the debtor to pay the same, and that in default thereof a commissioner, who was appointed for the purpose, should sell the land or so much thereof as might be necessary to satisfy the judgments, on a credit of six, twelve and eighteen months. And the commissioner was directed to report his proceedings to the court. The court held that the decree was erroneous because it decreed the sale of the land before taking an account of the liens thereon and settling priorities of the different creditors; but that the decree was an interlocutory and not a final decree and could be reheard at any time by the court which entered it prior to a final decree. Plainly such was the character of that decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\"><bracketnum>[12]</bracketnum> Our conclusion, therefore, upon the question under consideration is that in Virginia, as elsewhere, the general rule that a final decree cannot be reheard except upon the two grounds of (1) error apparent on the face of the record, or (\u00a3) after-discovered evidence, has not been modified; and that such rule is applicable to the decree in question of November term, 1915, in so far as the guardian appellee is concerned, and that' such decree was final and conclusively binding upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">We come now to the consideration of the questions raised by the bill of review filed by the appellee surety company as set forth in the statement preceding this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">What is said above disposes of all of the questions thus raised except two, which will be disposed of in their order as stated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\"><bracketnum>[13]</bracketnum> 5. The .commissioner\u2019s report not having been excepted to prior to the decree aforesaid of November term, 1915, by the surety company, a party defendant personally before the court, could the surety company bring the cause again before the court by bill of review, on the ground that it had no notice of the taking of the account?</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">This question must be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>The facts appearing from the record with respect to the commissioner\u2019s notice appear from the statement preceding this opinion. The notice was expressly addressed to the surety company, as well as to all of the other parties to the suit. The report is that the commissioner proceeded to execute the decree of reference \u201cin pursuance of the annexed notice of the time and place for taking said accounts.\u201d While not expressly so stated, the inference is that the commissioner reports that he gave notice to all of the parties, including the surety company, before proceeding to execute the decree of reference. The express statement in the report, with respect to the guardian, is not an express statement that notice was served on him of the time and place of taking the account, but that the commissioner \u201chad an extract of said decree served on (him) which required him to make settlement of his accounts as guardian,\u201d etc., \u201cbut he failed to appear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">However, if it were otherwise and the commissioner\u2019s report were considered as showing on its face that no notice was given the surety company of the proceedings before the commissioner, that, in our opinion, would not alter the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In <em>White </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>2 Munf. (16 Va.) 285, the report of the commissioners was silent as to notice, the cause was regularly heard on the report, to which there was no exception, and the decree in question was entered confirming the report and dismissing the bill. The decree was objected to on appeal for errors alleged as apparent on the face of the report, consisting of failure to charge certain interest and for its failure to show that notice of the proceedings before the commissioners was given to the plaintiffs. Counsel for defendants took the position as to the notice that there could be no different rule \u201cas to reports of commissioners from that which prevails with respect to depositions. If the exception to a deposition for want of notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>be not taken before the hearing, it may be read.\u201d The following is the reported opinion of this court delivered by Judge Roane: \u201cThis court, while it is hot disposed to deny that reports, which are erroneous upon the face of them, may be objected to at the hearing or expected to in the appellate court, although the same were not specially excepted to by the parties prior to the decree made in the cause, is, on the other hand, of opinion that without such exceptions, reports shall not be impeached on grounds, or in relation to subjects, which may be affected by extraneous testimony; of which nature is the report in this cause, so far as relates to interest claimed against the appellant; and that the report, on which the decree of the county court is founded, not being objected to, is conclusive between the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">In <em>Winston </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>2 Munf. (16 Va.) 305, the report of the commissioner merely stated, concerning the time of the execution of the decree of reference, that he \u201cappointed that day for the defendants to render the account,\u201d and that they \u201cfailing to attend\u201d he proceeded, etc. Counsel for the defendants admitted that \u201cwant of notice is an extrinsic objection, but\u201d (claimed that it was) \u201csufficiently established by Winston\u2019s affidavit to the truth of the bill of review.\u201d Counsel for plaintiff took the position that the phrases of the report above quoted \u201csufficiently imply\u201d that the defendants \u201cmust have had notice. And, if they had not, they should have made the objections before the decree was rendered * * *\u201d The opinion of this court, per <em>curiam,, </em>so far as material, is as follows: \u201cThe court is * * * of opinion that * * * the allegations of the appellant that the report of the commissioner was made without due notice to him of the time and place of taking the same * * * are (not) of a character to justify a bill of review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\"><bracketnum>[14]</bracketnum> See also <em>Shenandoah Bank </em>v. <em>Shirley, </em>26 W. Va. at p. 569, for the holding that, \u201cWant of notice of the time and place of a commissioner\u2019s taking an account is not suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>ficient reason for a bill of review or petition for rehearing; such objection not having been taken, as it ought to have been, before a decree was rendered.\u201d To the same effect, see <em>Livesay </em>v. <em>Feamster, </em>21 W. Va. at p. 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\"><bracketnum>[15]</bracketnum> And on principle, as pointed out in <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Salem Land Co., </em>94 Va. at p. 40, 26 S. E. 591, notice to parties that they have been sued and to bring them before the court stands upon a very different footing from notice of the time and place of taking an account ordered by the court in a pending cause. The parties having been sued and served with process bringing them before the court are presumed to know the subsequent proceedings in the suit which are taken in court. <em>Idem, </em>and Morrison\u2019s Notes oil Eq. Proc., p. 110. In the instant case the surety company is presumed to have known of the decree of reference, and when the cause came on to be heard upon the first report of the commissioner aforesaid the surety company must be regarded as having been before the court and if.it had any objection to the report on the ground of lack of notice of the time and place of the taking of the account, it had then, and indeed all during the remainder of that term of court, its day in court to make objection, to the report on that ground. Failing to make such objection until after the final decree was entered and the court had adjourned, the objection asserted for the first time by its bill of review came too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\"><bracketnum>[16]</bracketnum> 6. Does the manner in which the account of the guardian was stated in the commissioner\u2019s report which was confirmed by the final decree aforesaid, in its lack of adoption of one rest day and its mixture of principal and interest, of which complaint is made in the bill of review of the surety company, constitute error on the face of the record for which such bill of review would lie?</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">As appears from the statement preceding this opinion, the account, as stated in the commissioners report, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>more favorable to the guardian and hence more favorable also to the surety than if it had been correctly stated. Hence, there was no error in this of which the surety company could complain, and the question last stated must be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">There remains but one question for our consideration, and that is this:</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">7. Was it error in the court below to decree that the guardian should pay interest from November 1, 1915\u2014the date on which he was removed as guardian\u2014on the balance in his hands as of that date, since such balance consisted of interest as well as principal, and' the effect of the decree was to require him to pay interest from such time on such interest, as well as on the principal sum in his hands as of such date?</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\"><bracketnum>[17, 18]</bracketnum> We are of opinion that there was no error in the decree in this particular. In accordance with the law governing-the settlement of guardianship accounts, on each annual rest day and on the date the guardianship ceases, all undisbursed interest with which the guardian is chargeable is transferred to the principal column of the account, and the balance in his hands thus ascertained is treated as being principal, and interest-bearing from such times, and to that extent a guardian is chargeable with compound interest. Sec. 2606 of the Code. From the last day of the guardianship account, therefore, the guardian is chargeable with interest on the balance in his hands, both of principal and interest, as of such date. But in stating the account of a guardian after the termination of the wardship there should be no subsequent rest day, or bringing of interest into the principal column, again compounding the interest. The balance found in the guardian\u2019s hands at the termination of the wardship, interest as well as principal, being all treated as principal, bears interest from that date, but none of the interest accruing after such - date bears any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>interest, the account being stated after that date \u201con the ordinary principles of debtor and creditor as to interest * * *\u00bb i Min. Inst. (3d ed.) 497, and cases cited. In the instant case the decree in question was . strictly in accordance with the rule just stated. It requires the guardian to pay interest only on the balance found in his hands at the termination of the wardship, and does not hold him liable for any interest on such interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The case of <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Cunningham,, </em>4 Gratt. (45 Va.) 43-46, is relied on for the appellees as containing a contrary holding, but an examination of that case discloses that it is not in conflict, but wholly in accord, with what is said above with regard to the correct rule on the subject. What that case condemned was a revision of the decree there in question which added the interest which had accrued on the balance in the guardian\u2019s hands, from the termination of the wardship in February, 1833, to November 1, 1842, to the sum for which the guardian was liable as principal, and required the guardian to pay from the latter date interest on such aggregate, the result of which was to hold him liable for interest on interest which accrued after the termination of the wardship. That result was what was held to constitute the error in the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we are of opinion that the decrees entered by the court at its January term, 1916, and November term, 1917, were erroneous, in so far as they granted a rehearing of and were in conflict with the provisions of the decree of the November term, 1915, aforesaid. In all other respects the decrees of said January, 1916, and November, 1917, terms of court and the allowance of the $2,800 of loans above mentioned as a credit on the decree against the guardian, entered at the November term, 1915, will be allowed to stand, and the cause will be remanded to the court below for further proceedings to be had therein not in conflict with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
