The prior motion, which was predicated upon defendant\u2019s claim that he had been terminated from his place of employment, was denied on the documentary submissions without a statement of reasons. The judge who decided the original motion was then transferred. Defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration was heard by another judge who had recently been assigned to the Family Part. In denying defendant\u2019s application for reconsideration, the judge noted that the original motion was not accompanied by an updated case information statement. Although defendant had corrected that omission in his motion for reconsideration, the judge found no basis to modify the order previously entered. In a brief oral opinion, the Family Part made no specific findings, but instead denied defendant\u2019s motion \u201cfor whatever reasons [the judge who decided the original application] may have expressed.\u201d We reverse and remand the matter to the Family Part judge who decided the original motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The salient facts can be succinctly stated. The parties were divorced on April 28, 1980. Plaintiff was granted custody of the parties\u2019 two children and defendant was ordered to pay alimony and child support. In addition, defendant was directed to maintain health and medical insurance for the benefit of the children. Over the years, defendant\u2019s salary as a computer consultant increased. In various post-divorce judgment orders, the Family Part terminated defendant\u2019s alimony obligation, but increased child support. On April 9, 1991, the Family Part ordered defendant to pay $432 per week for child support. At the time, defendant was earning $116,000 gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">On June 28, 1991, defendant moved to reduce child support on the basis that he had been terminated from his employment approximately one month earlier. In his supporting affidavit, defendant asserted that he was unable to find a job and that his sole source of income was unemployment compensation. He also contended that his medical and health insurance for the children had been terminated when he was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>On August 28, 1991, the Family Part entered an order denying defendant\u2019s motion and directing him to pay all arrears within 90 days. The court ordered plaintiff to attempt to obtain medical and health insurance from her employer and directed defendant to reimburse her if she were successful. In the event plaintiff could not obtain \u201cthe same coverage,\u201d defendant was ordered to reinstate his insurance at his own expense. As we noted previously, defendant\u2019s motion was decided on the papers and no statement of reasons was provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Defendant filed a timely motion for reconsideration returnable on September 27, 1991. In his supporting affidavit, defendant related that he had obtained employment as an independent computer consultant on July 31, 1991. He was to be paid $375 per day until April 1992, at which time his employment relationship was to be reviewed. Defendant anticipated working 44 weeks a year, allocating four weeks for vacation, two weeks for unpaid holidays and two weeks of sick time. He estimated that he would have a gross income of $82,500, $33,500 less than his previous salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Defendant\u2019s motion was assigned to a judge recently transferred to the Family Part. The judge observed that he was in an \u201cawkward position,\u201d because he had not decided the original motion. While noting that \u201cthere was [not] enough information\u201d before the judge who had decided the motion to reduce and that no findings had been made, the court refused to modify the prior order, citing \u201cwhatever reasons ... may have been expressed\u201d previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">It is against this factual backdrop that we consider defendant\u2019s arguments that (1) the motion for reconsideration should have been assigned to the judge who decided the original application, and (2) neither judge provided findings of fact and legal conclusions sufficient to support the result reached. We agree with both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">Initially, the transfer of the judge who had decided the motion to reduce child support should not have interfered with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>what was required for a fair and just resolution of the question of changed circumstances raised by the application for reconsideration. The motion for reconsideration should have been assigned to the judge who decided the original application. <em>R. </em>l:6-2(d) was recently amended to provide that \u201cinsofar as is practicable,\u201d all subsequent motions should \u201cbe heard by the same judge who heard the first motion in the cause.\u201d This provision was intended \u201cto avoid the potential for inconsistent results, and to afford the parties the advantages of a single judge\u2019s familiarity with the matter.\u201d Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment on <em>R. </em>1:6-2 (1993). Although the amendment was not in effect when defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration was decided, its mandate is a matter of common sense and was foreshadowed by our opinion in <em>Salch v. Salch, </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>441, 444, 573 A.2d 520 (App.Div.1990). There, we said that \u201call matrimonial counsel fee motions should be directed to the judge who has had responsibility for the case____\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">This principle applies with equal force her\u00e9, where the judge who decided the motion to reduce had great exposure to the underlying issues and the newly assigned Family Part judge was a stranger to the case. The rule has particular applicability because the original order denying the motion to reduce was not accompanied by a statement of reasons. This is not to suggest that regardless of his or her status a judge is wedded forever to any case in which he or she has had the slightest involvement. The principle we adopted in <em>Salch v. Salch </em>\u201cis a rule of reason.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444, 573 A.2d 520. In the context of the facts here, the policy concerns we have identified strongly militated in favor of assigning the motion for reconsideration to the judge who decided the original application.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">That leads us to defendant\u2019s second argument. The judge who decided the motion to reduce made no findings of fact or legal conclusions, as required by <em>R. </em>l:6-2(f). Moreover, the cryptic and enigmatic findings of the judge who decided the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>motion for reconsideration were clearly inadequate. It bears repeating that an articulation of reasons is essential to the fair resolution of a case. The failure to perform this duty \u201cconstitutes a disservice to the litigants, the attorneys and the appellate court.\u201d <em>Curtis v. Finneran, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>563, 569-70, 417 <em>A.</em>2d 15 (1980). Although the information before us is perhaps amenable to the conclusion that defendant is presently able to satisfy his support obligation without modification, the documentary submissions do not indicate whether his current employment is permanent. We stress that no findings were made on this and other relevant issues. <em>See Lepis v. Lepis, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>139, 151, 416 <em>A.2d </em>45 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">We thus find it necessary to reverse the order denying reconsideration and remand for further proceedings before the judge who denied the motion for a reduction. The parties are directed to provide the Family Part judge with updated information concerning the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The order appealed from is reversed and the master is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
