The Board affirmed Situngkir\u2019s removal order because it found that he was ineligible for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection. On appeal, Situngkir contends that he is eligible for asylum and withholding of removal because he demonstrated past persecution by showing that demonstrators killed his wife. The government counters by claiming that Situngkir failed to cite the record, filed his asylum application late, and has not shown that the alleged persecution was \u201con account of\u2019 his political views.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">We strike Situngkir\u2019s brief because he completely failed to cite the record. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A) (demanding that appellant provide \u201ccitations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies\u201d). Furthermore, having independently reviewed the record, we dismiss Situngkir\u2019s asylum claim and deny his withholding of removal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-13\">I. ASYLUM</p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">Where, as here, the Board adopts the immigration judge\u2019s reasoning, we review the immigration judge\u2019s decision as if it were the Board\u2019s. <em>See Alaelua v. INS, </em>45 F.3d 1379, 1382 (9th Cir.1995). We lack jurisdiction over Situngkir\u2019s asylum claim because he did not file his application within one year of entering the United States. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a). Furthermore, as the immigration judge found, Situngkir has not shown any cause for his delay. <em>See Molino-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002) (noting that the court lacked jurisdiction over the Board\u2019s determination that no extraordinary circumstances justified the untimely filing). Therefore, we lack jurisdiction over his asylum claim. <em>See Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 815 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-15\">II. WITHHOLDING OF REMOVAL<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-16\">On appeal, Situngkir presents one claim of past persecution \u2014 the killing of his wife by Muslim demonstrators in part because he was a member of the Golkar party. Situngkir\u2019s claim is unavailing because there is substantial evidence that his wife\u2019s tragic death resulted from random violence, not Situngkir\u2019s political views. Therefore, the immigration judge properly found that Situngkir had not met his burden of proving that it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he would be persecuted on account of his political views if he were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>returned to Indonesia. <em>Al-Harbi v. INS, </em>242 F.3d 882, 888 (9th Cir.2001) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">PETITION DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b675-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b675-17\">. On appeal, Situngkir does not revive his CAT claim, and in any event, the record provides no significant evidence of torture.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
