Before us are (1) his attorney\u2019s August 11, 2004 motion to withdraw and March 11, 2005 amended brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), contending that there are no non-frivolous issues for appeal; (2) the Government\u2019s October 5, 2004 brief in support of the motion to withdraw, asserting that no non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>frivolous grounds for appeal exist; (3) Campbell\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief dated November 7, 2004, arguing that he has indeed presented non-frivolous issues; and (4) Campbell\u2019s <em>pro se </em>letter brief dated December 6, 2004, responding to the Government\u2019s December 3, 2004 supplemental brief and again asserting that he has presented non-frivolous claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth below, we grant the motion to withdraw and affirm Campbell\u2019s conviction and sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), if counsel \u201cfinds [a] case to be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious examination\u201d of the case, s/he must advise the Court of this finding and request permission to withdraw from the case. <em>Id. </em>at 744. This request must be accompanied by \u201ca brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal,\u201d <em>id., </em>\u201cexplain to the court why the issues are frivolous,\u201d <em>United States v. Marvin, </em>211 F.3d 778, 781 (3d Cir.2000), and in so doing demonstrate that s/he has \u201cthoroughly scoured the record in search of appealable issues,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 780. A copy of counsel\u2019s brief must be furnished to the appellant, who must be given time to raise non-frivolous arguments in a <em>pro se </em>brief. <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744; Third Circuit LAR 109.2(a) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">We \u201cconfine our scrutiny to those portions of the record identified by an adequate <em>Anders </em>brief ... [and] those issues raised in Appellant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief.\u201d <em>United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 301 (3d Cir.2001). We do not \u201ccomb the record ... for possible nonfrivolous issues that both the lawyer and his client may have overlooked,\u201d as \u201c[our] duty is merely to determine whether counsel is correct in believing those grounds [raised are] frivolous.\u201d <em>United States v. Wagner, </em>103 F.3d 551, 552-53 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">We grant counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>motion to withdraw if \u201ca full examination of all of the proceedings,\u201d <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744, shows \u201cthat the attorney has provided the client with a diligent and thorough search of the record for any arguable claim,\u201d <em>McCoy v. Court of Appeals of Wisconsin, </em>486 U.S. 429, 442, 108 S.Ct. 1895, 100 L.Ed.2d 440 (1988), and we conclude \u201cthat the appeal lacks any basis in law or fact,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 438 n. 10. \u201cThe Court\u2019s inquiry ... is thus twofold: (1) whether counsel adequately fulfilled the rule\u2019s requirements; and (2) whether an independent review of the record presents any nonfrivolous issues.\u201d <em>Youla, </em>241 F.3d at 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">As we write solely for the parties, we need not detail the facts of this case. Most of Campbell\u2019s arguments were advanced in post-trial motions before the District Court and roundly rejected in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>well-reasoned memorandum after an evi-dentiary hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth by the District Court, the Government and Campbell\u2019s counsel, we conclude that Campbell\u2019s challenge to the District Court\u2019s disposition of these contentions lacks merit. We similarly agree that Campbell\u2019s grounds for challenging the District Court\u2019s denial of his pre-trial suppression motion are frivolous, as we can conceive of no reason to disturb that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Putting aside Campbell\u2019s attempts to reassert arguments that were flatly rejected by the District Court for good reason, we are left only with his general, vague objections to his conviction and sentence. We are satisfied that Campbell\u2019s counsel has attempted to extract meritorious grounds for appeal without success. Our independent review of the record for non-frivolous contentions was similarly fruitless.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">We thus grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and affirm Campbell\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b898-7\">. Because Campbell has had ample notice and time to present a <em>pro se </em>brief in support of his appeal \u2014 and, indeed, has done so twice \u2014 we hereby deny his April 4, 2005 motion \u201cRequesting That Counsel\u2019s Amended Brief Be Disregarded, For Failing to Comply With His Obligations Under <em>Anders v. California; </em>Which Clearly States That Appellant Is To Be Given Time To Respond.\u201d Counsel\u2019s amended brief raises no new issues; it addresses the lack of non-frivolous grounds for appeal, a subject that was considered at length in both the Government\u2019s and Campbell\u2019s multiple briefs. We see no need for or potential benefit from additional briefing in this case, and we are satisfied that Campbell has had an adequate opportunity to be heard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b898-14\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. Our Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b899-9\">. Specifically, Campbell argues that the District Court erred by: 1) denying his post-trial, <em>pro se </em>\"Motion to Dismiss Indictment for Violation of Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act;\u201d 2) denying his post-trial claim of an alleged violation of the Speedy Trial Act; 3) denying his motion for a new trial and its numerous claimed grounds for finding his trial counsel ineffective; and 4) imposing sentence on him.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
