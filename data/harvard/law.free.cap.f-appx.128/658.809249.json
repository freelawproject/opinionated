We have partial jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Where, as here, the BIA affirms without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir.2003). We dismiss in part, grant in part, and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">We are without jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination that Barutyan\u2019s asylum application was untimely filed and that he failed to demonstrate extraordinary circumstances to excuse the untimeliness. <em>See Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002) (order) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">We review for substantial evidence the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal and CAT relief. <em>See Lanza v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 917, 933, 936 (9th Cir.2004). Substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination because the IJ did not specifically or cogently refer to non-credible aspects of Barutyan\u2019s demeanor, <em>see Arulampalam v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 679, 686 (9th Cir.2003), and because the discrepancies between Ba-rutyan\u2019s application and his testimony were minor, <em>see Manimbao v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 655, 660 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">The IJ also improperly relied on conjecture and speculation when he concluded that Barutyan\u2019s asylum claim was fraudulent, and he must have come to the United States for economic reasons, because he filed his asylum application only after spending time in the United States and trying to determine whether he and his family would be safe here. <em>See Shah v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1062, 1071 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-14\">Despite Barutyan\u2019s reasonable explanation that he lacked the money to retain an attorney, the IJ incorrectly drew a negative inference from the fact that Barutyan was assisted by an attorney when he filed for an extension of his nonimmigrant visa, but not when he later filed for asylum. <em>See Salaam v. INS, </em>229 F.3d 1234, 1238 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that the IJ\u2019s reasons for doubting credibility must be substantial and bear a legitimate nexus to the adverse credibility finding).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-15\">Finally, Barutyan\u2019s failure to provide additional corroborating evidence should not have undermined his claim of religious persecution given that Barutyan provided letters from his wife and his pastor in Armenia to support his claim and also testified that his house was broken into and all documents he had collected to substantiate his religious persecution were stolen. <em>See Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1227 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that where some corroborative evidence is provided, failure to provide more should not be held against applicant); <em>see also Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 611, 620 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that adverse credibility finding is inappropriate where there is a plausible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>explanation for lack of material corroboration).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">We remand to the BIA for further proceedings to determine whether, accepting Barutyan\u2019s testimony as credible, he has met the criteria for withholding of removal. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Barutyan\u2019s CAT claim fails because, even assuming credibility, he has not shown it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he will be tortured if returned to Armenia. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2); <em>see also Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; GRANTED in part; DENIED in part; and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b685-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
