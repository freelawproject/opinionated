PIERRE N. LEVAL, Hon. CHESTER J. STRAUB, and Hon. SONIA SOTOMAYOR, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Plaintiff-appellant Broward Title Company (\u201cBroward\u201d) appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Sey-bert, J.), affirming an order of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of New York (Eisenberg, B.J.) holding that defendants-appellees Matrix Capital Bank (\u201cMatrix\u201d) and HSA Residential Mortgage Services of Texas, Inc. (\u201cRMST\u201d) were the holders in due course of certain notes, dismissing plaintiff-appellant Broward\u2019s equitable claims and denying Broward\u2019s motion for a conditional award of attorneys\u2019 fees. We do not address the district court\u2019s analysis of whether the mortgage notes in question were negotiable instruments or whether Matrix and RMST were holders in due course of the contested instruments but affirm the district court\u2019s judgment that Broward is not entitled under equity to the sale proceeds of the mortgage notes. We assume familiarity by the parties with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Broward argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that RMST and Matrix\u2019s awareness of potential malfeasance by Island Mortgage prior to the transactions at issue in this case requires this Court to grant Broward equitable relief. Under equitable principles, \u201cwhere one of two innocent persons must suffer by the acts of a third, he who has enabled such third person to occasion the loss must sustain it.\u201d <em>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Generate v. Fed. Ins. Co., </em>856 F.2d 461, 466 (2d Cir.1988) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>United Serv. Corp. v. Vi-An Constr. Corp., </em>77 So .2d 800, 804 (Fla.1955) (\u201cThe rule is firmly settled that where one of two innocent parties must suffer a loss, the loss must fall on the one whose negligence or conduct contribute the greater to the loss.\u201d). <em>See also Nat\u2019l Safe Deposit, Sav., &amp; Trust Co. v. Hibbs, </em>229 U.S. 391, 395-97, 33 S.Ct. 818, 57 L.Ed. 1241 (1913). Even though RMST and Matrix sent money to Island Mortgage\u2019s affiliate, Action Abstract, prior to receiving the mortgage notes, they did not cause Broward\u2019s loss because their contracts were structured such that RMST and Matrix were not to send money directly to Broward but only to an intermediary which was to forward the money to Broward. The defendants were thus not responsible for Broward\u2019s failure to receive funds. Rather, Bro-ward\u2019s decision to draw funds from its escrow account instead of waiting for cleared funds from Island Mortgage triggered its financial loss. Had Broward instead waited for the checks to clear before disbursing money, or required payment by a certified of cashier\u2019s check, it would not have suffered this harm. Thus, as between two innocent parties, Broward \u201cenabled [Island Mortgage] to occasion the loss\u201d and its claim of equitable relief cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">For the reasons discussed, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
