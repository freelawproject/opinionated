The BIA dismissed her appeal, adopting and affirming the decision of the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), with two \u201ccorrections.\u201d For the reasons discussed below, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">We write exclusively for the benefit of the parties and will only recount those matters relevant to the issues before us. Oktavia is a native and citizen of Indonesia who entered the United States on or about December 7, 1999 as a non-immigrant visitor with authority to remain until June 6, 2000. On April 16, 2001, the then-immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) executed a Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) charging Oktavia as an alien who remained in the United States for a time longer than permitted under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B). At a hearing before the IJ, Oktavia admitted the factual allegations contained in the NTA and conceded removability. The IJ designated Indonesia as the country to which she would be removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">Meanwhile, on February 14, 2001, Okta-via had applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). During the hearing before the IJ, Oktavia testified that she is an Indonesian of Chinese heritage and is a Buddhist.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She testified that living in Indonesia was difficult. As a child, she was mistreated by other students because she was ethnic Chinese and Buddhist. Some Indonesian children would ask her and other ethnic Chinese students for money because the Indonesian children did not like them. Additionally, she claimed that sometimes Indonesian teachers would ask questions but not let the ethnic Chinese students answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">This alleged mistreatment extended beyond her childhood. Oktavia testified that, as an adult, she was violently attacked on three occasions. In December of 1995, Indonesian men approached her car, which was stopped at a red light. The men threatened her with a knife, broke her car windows, stole property inside her car, and cut her arm with the knife. The men also told her that she should go back to her own country. When the light turned green, Oktavia sped away. She did not report this crime to the police. Three years later, Oktavia was dragged from her car during a riot. She fled the scene, but the rioters chased after her, raped her, and burned her car. She passed out and awoke in a hospital, but, again, did not report the incident to the police. A third attack occurred three months later. Okta-via and her fiancee were riding together on a motorcycle. Four men approached the couple and kicked her fiancee off the motorcycle. He fell to the ground, hit his head on the pavement, and was rendered unconscious. Oktavia took him to the hospital and reported the assault to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-12\">The IJ considered Oktavia\u2019s testimony, the affidavits, and the State Department\u2019s 2000 \u201cCountry Report on Human Rights Practices: Indonesia\u201d which concludes, <em>inter alia, </em>that: the Indonesian government \u201cembraces\u201d Buddhism; the Indonesian Constitution provides for freedom of religion; rape is a punishable offense; and Indonesia promotes racial and ethnic tolerance. The Report did observe that resentment of Sino-Indonesian prosperity led to attacks and riots in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-13\">The IJ rejected Oktavia\u2019s claims. The IJ denied asylum, finding the application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>untimely because it was filed more than a year after Oktavia\u2019s arrival and that exceptional circumstances did not exist to excuse a late filing. The IJ also denied the withholding of removal and CAT claims because he did not believe that Oktavia\u2019s mistreatment rose to the level of persecution. In addition, the IJ found \u201ca total lack of credibility\u201d in her testimony and that of her husband and found that \u201cthey have intentionally and deliberately attempted to deceive this Court by giving false testimony, trying to mislead this Court, and attempting to have the Court grant them benefits under the Act based on their perjured testimony.\u201d Op. at 12-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">The BIA dismissed the appeal. Oktavia did not appeal the denial of the CAT claim to the BIA, nor does she raise it now. She does, however, seek review of the final order of the BIA as to asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">We have jurisdiction to review a final order of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). In cases in which the Board merely adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 271 (3d Cir.2002). Our scope of review is extremely narrow: we will affirm any finding of fact supported by substantial evidence. <em>Abdille v. Ashcroft, </em>242 F.3d 477, 483-484 (3d Cir.2001) (citations omitted). This means that we must uphold the IJ\u2019s factual findings if they are \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Furthermore, we are bound by the findings of fact unless a reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary. <em>Abdille, </em>242 F.3d at 484 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">Oktavia raises two main issues on appeal. First, she argues that the IJ erred in not granting her asylum or withholding of removal. Second, she argues that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was based on speculation and conjecture.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">A. <em>Asylum Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1), the Attorney General may grant asylum to an alien who is a \u201crefugee\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). Generally speaking, to qualify as a refugee, an applicant must show that he or she is unable or unwilling to return to his or her country because of persecution or a well founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>Yan Lan Wu v. Ashcroft, </em>393 F.3d 418, 423 (3d Cir.2005) (citations omitted). In addition, to qualify for asylum, an alien must \u201cdemonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). This provision, however, does not apply if the applicant can show \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d that justify the delay in filing the application. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D); <em>Tarrawally v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir.2003). Section 1158(a)(3) provides that federal courts do not have jurisdiction to review the determination of the Attorney General under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B) and (D), the IJ denied Oktavia\u2019s application for asylum as untimely. The IJ explained that the application was filed more than one year after her arrival and found that no exceptional circumstances existed to excuse the delayed fil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>ing. We lack jurisdiction to review this determination. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Tarrawally, </em>338 F.3d at 185-186.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">B. <em>Withholding of Removal Claim</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">The Attorney General may not remove an alien to a particular country if \u201cthe alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A); <em>Tarrawally, </em>338 F.3d at 186. An applicant bears the burden of establishing \u201cthat his life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of deportation.\u201d <em>Tarrawally, </em>338 F.3d at 186 (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). Thus, to secure a withholding under the INA, the applicant must show that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he will be subject to future persecution. <em>See 8 </em>C. F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2). That persecution must be on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">Oktavia\u2019s brief merely cites general legal propositions and fails to specifically identify any evidence the IJ overlooked in reaching his decision or explain how her life or freedom would be threatened were she to return to Indonesia. That aside, our independent review of the record satisfies us that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">As noted above, Oktavia\u2019s testimony before the IJ essentially described three isolated violent incidents over a period of three years, and recounted mistreatment she suffered as a child at school. These events do not, however, rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Lie v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 530, 535-36 (3d Cir.2005) (\u201ctwo isolated criminal acts, perpetrated by unknown assailants, which resulted only in the theft of some personal property and a minor injury, is not sufficiently severe to be considered persecution.\u201d) (citing <em>Gormley v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1172, 1177 (9th Cir.2004)). Persecution, after all, is an extreme concept that \u201cdoes not encompass all treatment that our society regards as unfair, unjust, or even unlawful or unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Fatin v. INS, </em>12 F.3d 1233, 1240 &amp; n. 10 (3d Cir.1993) (observing that \u201c[i]f persecution were defined that expansively, a significant percentage of the world\u2019s population would qualify for asylum in this country\u201d). Because Oktavia did not establish that she had suffered persecution or would be subject to persecution in Indonesia, she was not entitled to withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-12\">C. <em>Adverse Credibility Determination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b878-13\">Oktavia argues that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination rested on a \u201cspeculative conclusion that the difference between Petitioner\u2019s affidavit and testimony suggests incredibility.\u201d Pet. Brief at 3. Oktavia then observes, correctly, that speculation and conjecture do not form a valid basis for making an adverse credibility determination. <em>See Gao, </em>299 F.3d at 272. But observations are not enough. Oktavia must show that the evidence of credibility is so strongly in her favor that, in a civil trial, she would be entitled to judgment on the credibility issue as a matter of law. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (holding that credibility determinations can be reversed only where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>petitioner\u2019s evidence \u201ccompels\u201d a reasonable factfinder to find in his favor).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">For one thing, Oktavia does not tell us which of the various credibility determinations rests on speculation or conjecture. For another, it is clear that some of her testimony regarding her assaults is contradictory, essential aspects of her testimony regarding her rape and the burning of her car are not supported by her affidavit, and some of her testimony conflicts with her husband\u2019s testimony. A reasonable fact-finder would surely not be compelled to find in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">The petition for review will be denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-9\">. In her brief to us, Oktavia states that she is a Christian. Pet. Brief at 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b878-9\">. During the IJ\u2019s discussion of Oktavia\u2019s withholding of removal claim, he used the terms \"asylum\u201d and \"withholding of removal\u201d interchangeably. Because the IJ had already dismissed the asylum claim, we will assume that he was then intending only to analyze the withholding of removal claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
