Bauer appeals the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel\u2019s (\u201cBAP\u201d) decision denying Bauer a discharge of all scheduled debt pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(a)(3) and (5), and valuing Bauer\u2019s debt to Plaintiff-Appellee Linda J. Miller at $62,780.00. For the reasons set forth in the BAP\u2019s opinion, the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision to deny a discharge was proper. For the reasons set forth in the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s opinion, the challenged debt valuation was proper. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-19\">The Bankruptcy Court concluded both that Bauer\u2019s debt to Miller was nondischargeable pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a), and that Bauer should be denied a discharge of all scheduled debt pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(a). The BAP, however, properly determined \u00a7 523(a) to be inapplicable in this case. We also agree with the BAP\u2019s reasoning concerning Miller\u2019s \u00a7 727(a) claim. Bauer argues that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s analysis on this issue was incorrect because it employed a fraud rationale, and because it placed too onerous a burden of production on Bauer. However, the Bankruptcy Court properly held that Bauer failed to explain satisfactorily the depletion of settlement funds pursuant to \u00a7 727(a)(5), and that she failed to preserve information pursuant to \u00a7 727(a)(3). The Bankruptcy Court did not err in requiring Bauer to supply documentation or corroborating testimony as part of providing a \u201csatisfactory explanation\u201d of expenditures under \u00a7 727(a)(5). The Bankruptcy Court found Bauer\u2019s testimony to be \u201cextremely vague\u201d on some matters and, given Bauer\u2019s considerable business sophistication and familiarity with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>the dispute over the settlement funds, it was reasonable to question Bauer\u2019s failure to substantiate major expenditures. <em>See Strzesynski v. Devaul (In re Devaul), </em>318 B.R. 824, 840 (Bankr.N.D.Ohio 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Further, we affirm the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s valuation of Bauer\u2019s debt to Miller at $62,780.00. It does appear that the BAP was incorrect in finding that a state court judgment in Miller\u2019s favor in that amount was final, and in finding that the Bankruptcy Court therefore did not have jurisdiction to review the amount. The Bankruptcy Court had properly exercised jurisdiction over this question. The Bankruptcy Court correctly concluded that, because Bauer\u2019s legal malpractice claim against Miller was unlikely to succeed, the amount of damages reflected in the state court jury verdict should stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
