To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-16\">To the extent Valdivia challenges the BIA\u2019s December 5, 2002 decision, we lack jurisdiction to review his contentions as Valdivia did not file a petition for review within 30 days of the BIA\u2019s decision and his motion to reconsider did not toll the filing deadline. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1258 (9th Cir.1996); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-17\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Valdivia\u2019s motion to reconsider as Valdivia did not establish that there were errors of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s December 5, 2002 decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. 1003.2(b)(1) (stating that a motion to reconsider \u201cshall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b591-14\"> ThiS disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
