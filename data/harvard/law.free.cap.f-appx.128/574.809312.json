We affirm in part, and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-18\">(1) DSHS asserts that this case has become moot because the Medicaid waiver program it refers to no longer exists, and four new Medicaid waiver programs have taken its place. By the same token, says DSHS, complaints about the four new programs are not ripe. We disagree on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-19\">The long and the short of it is that Boyle attacks problems that are endemic to the programs, old and new. Thus, this is not a case of complaining about an action that has already been completed,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or of the total repeal of a statute or withdrawal of a rule that was allegedly improper,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or a case where we cannot affect the litigants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, it is one where the problems can be reerudescent, even if they have been voluntarily ameliorated for a time,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the program differences are not significant as far as the current complaints are concerned.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For much the same reasons, the issues were, and remain, ripe.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It cannot be said that no effective declaratory or injunctive relief is now possible. <em>See Church of Scientology v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 9, 12-13, 113 S.Ct. 447, 449-50, 121 L.Ed.2d 313 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">(2) The district court determined that Burford<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> abstention applies to the claims in this case. We review that contention de novo <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and we disagree. <em>Bur-ford </em>abstention is \u201can extraordinary and narrow exception to the duty of the District Court to adjudicate a controversy properly before it.\u201d <em>City of Tucson, </em>284 F.3d at 1133 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, we deal with the administration of a federal program, and cannot say that any <em>Burford </em>considerations militate in favor of deferring to the State. <em>See United States v. Morros, </em>268 F.3d 695, 705 (9th Cir.2001); see <em>also City of Tucson, </em>284 F.3d at 1133.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">(3) The district court also determined that Boyle must exhaust state administrative remedies before he can maintain this action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u25a0 1983. Again, we beg to differ. In the absence of a statutory provision to the contrary, it is not necessary to exhaust administrative remedies before commencing a \u00a7 1983 action. <em>See Wilder v. Va. Hosp. Ass\u2019n, </em>496 U.S. 498, 523, 110 S.Ct. 2510, 2524-25, 110 L.Ed.2d 455 (1990); <em>Patsy v. Bd. of Regents, </em>457 U.S. 496, 516, 102 S.Ct. 2557, 2568, 73 L.Ed.2d 172 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-14\">We are aware that the district court has discretion to require administrative exhaustion in a proper case,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but that discretion is not unbounded,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and application of the appropriate balancing test<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> satisfies us that this was not a proper case.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-15\">(4) The district court denied certification of a class. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a). We will reverse a denial of class certification only if we find an abuse of discretion. <em>See Smith, </em>233 F.3d at 1193. We are not able to say that the decision was outside the broad range that is encompassed by the abuse of discretion standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-16\">Appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss is DENIED. AFFIRMED as to denial of class certification. REVERSED and REMANDED as to abstention and failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>exhaust. The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b601-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-12\">. <em>See Seven Words LLC v.
