Wyatt argues there was insufficient evidence to support a three-level enhancement imposed pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(5)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Wyatt further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>asserts the enhancement was imposed based on facts found by a preponderance of the evidence, thus violating <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Wyatt\u2019s Presentence Investigation Report (PSI) calculated a base offense level of 26, with a three-level specific offense characteristic increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(5)(B), giving an adjusted offense level of 29. The PSI further recommended a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a), and a one-level reduction for assisting authorities, pursuant to \u00a7 3E1.1(b). Thus, Wyatt\u2019s total recommended offense level was 26. Based on various prior convictions, the PSI calculated a criminal history category of III, which with an offense level of 26 resulted in an imprisonment range of 78 to 97 months. However, the statutory mandatory minimum for Wyatt\u2019s crime is 120 months, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Wyatt\u2019s ultimate sentence of 120 months was not determined based upon an application of the federal sentencing guidelines, but was based upon the mandatory minimum sentence set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a). Even though the district court held the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(5)(B) enhancement applied, the enhancement is moot given the mandatory minimum sentence. Thus, if any error exists in the imposition of the enhancement, that error is harmless. Additionally, Wyatt\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>argument is without merit, as his ultimate sentence was based on the statutory mandatory minimum sentence, rather than the federal sentencing guidelines. Neither <em>Blakely </em>or <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), affect Wyatt\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Vieth, </em>397 F.3d 615, 620 (8th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-10\">.
