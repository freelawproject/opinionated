Morgan\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>raising a claim that Morgan\u2019s original sentence violated <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), but concluding that this court has no jurisdiction to review the amended sentence and the <em>Blakely </em>claim was waived by failure to appeal the original sentence. Morgan has filed a pro se supplemental brief challenging the extent of the reduction in sentence, which he submits would have been larger if not for the ineffective assistance of his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The extent of a departure under Rule 35(b) is not appealable, unless the sentence was imposed in violation of the law. <em>United States v. Pridgen, </em>64 F.3d 147, 149-50 (4th Cir.1995). Because the extent of departure is left to the court\u2019s discretion under Rule 35(b), Morgan\u2019s sentence did not violate the law. Moreover, since ineffective assistance of counsel is not conclusive on the record, such a claim is not cognizable on direct appeal and should, instead, be brought in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) proceeding. <em>United States v. James, </em>337 F.3d 387, 391 (4th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1134, 124 S.Ct. 1111, 157 L.Ed.2d 939 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Moreover, any challenge to Morgan\u2019s initial sentence was waived by Morgan\u2019s failure to appeal that sentence. <em>See United States v. Abdenbi, </em>361 F.3d 1282, 1289 (10th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 197, 160 L.Ed.2d 107 (2004). Morgan cannot resurrect a voluntarily forfeited direct appeal simply because the district court subsequently re-sentenced him pursuant to a Rule 35(b) proceeding. Regarding his amended sentence, the resentencing was not based on the sentencing guidelines, and the court did not act under the false impression that a reduction in sentence or the extent thereof was mandated. Thus, we find that Morgan\u2019s amended sentence does not implicate <em>Blakely.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We thus affirm Morgan\u2019s amended sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
