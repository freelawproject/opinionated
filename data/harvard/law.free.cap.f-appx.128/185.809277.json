Baker\u2019s complaint alleged that the defendants violated his rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) by (1) withholding approximately $25,000 from his award of retroactive Social Security benefits to repay the Monroe County Department of Social Services for payments made on Baker\u2019s behalf from 1997 to 2003, and (2) failing to pay his utility bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">Reviewing the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of Baker\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo, see Digitel, Inc. v. MCI Worldcom, Inc., </em>239 F.3d 187, 190 (2d Cir.2001), we conclude that dismissal of Baker\u2019s complaint was proper. The ADA provides, in relevant part, that \u201cno qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132. While Baker asserted in his complaint that his claims were brought pursuant to the ADA, nowhere in his complaint did Baker allege that the acts by the defendants were based on his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-13\">Although a <em>pro se </em>plaintiff should generally be afforded an opportunity to amend his complaint prior to its dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, the district court did not err in failing to grant Baker leave to amend his complaint in this case. <em>See Cuoco v. Moritsugu, </em>222 F.3d 99, 112 (2d Cir.2000). Granting Baker leave to amend would have been futile. There is no indication that the defendants did not pay Baker\u2019s utility bill because he was disabled or that they withheld monies from his benefits award due to his disability. Thus, even if granted leave to amend, Baker could not succeed in alleging a viable ADA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
