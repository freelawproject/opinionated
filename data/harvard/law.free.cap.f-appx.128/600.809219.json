Weissleader alleged fraud and conspiracy among defendants during the course of workers\u2019 compensation proceedings that took place between 1980 and 1982. We have jurisdiction under 28 U. S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, <em>Botsford v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Montana, Inc., </em>314 F.3d 390, 392 (9th Cir.2002), and denial of leave to amend, <em>Schmier v. U.S. Ct. of Appeals for the Ninth Cir., </em>279 F.3d 817, 824 (9th Cir. 2002). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-15\">The district court properly dismissed Weissleader\u2019s action for failure to state a claim and lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b). Weissleader\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim failed because she did not allege facts showing that any defendant was a person acting under color of state law. <em>See Hale v. State of Ariz., </em>993 F.2d 1387, 1398 (9th Cir.1993) (en banc). Her 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3) claim failed because she did not allege facts showing class-based invidious discrimination. <em>See Griffin v. Breckenridge, </em>403 U.S. 88, 102-03, 91 S.Ct. 1790, 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971). Her unlawful employment practice claim failed because she did not allege facts showing discrimination on the basis of her \u201crace, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2. Because these claims failed, Weissleader\u2019s reliance on other related federal statutes was unavailing. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981a, 1986; <em>Karim-Panahi v. Los Angeles Police Dep\u2019t, </em>839 F.2d 621, 626 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-16\">The district court properly denied leave to amend because Weissleader had previously amended and further amendment would be futile. <em>See Schmier, </em>279 F.3d at 824. Weissleader contends that the district court failed to consider her objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation prior to dismissing her action. This contention fails because the district court\u2019s order specifically states that it reviewed her objections prior to dismissal. Weissleader also contends that the district court impermissibly reviewed only the first amended complaint. This contention fails because \u201c[i]t is the law of this circuit that a plaintiff waives all claims alleged in a dismissed complaint which are not realleged in an amended complaint.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number><em>Forsyth v. Humana, Inc., </em>114 F.3d 1467, 1474 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Weissleader contends that the district court improperly held her to a strict standard of legal technicality and failed to appoint counsel sua sponte. This contention fails because the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations applied a liberal pro se standard and Weissleader made no showing that she was incompetent or that she requested counsel. Further, she had no right to effective assistance of counsel. <em>See Nicholson v. Rushen, </em>767 F.2d 1426, 1427 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Weissleader\u2019s remaining contentions also lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b627-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
