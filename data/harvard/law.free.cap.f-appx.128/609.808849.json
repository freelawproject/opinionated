Burgess appeals pro se the district court\u2019s dismissal of his civil rights action alleging that defendants violated federal and state law in the course of challenging Burgess\u2019 ownership of a house in state probate and federal bankruptcy proceedings. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Kougasian v. TMSL, Inc., </em>359 F.3d 1136, 1139 (9th Cir.2004) (dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction); <em>Vestar Dev. II, LLC v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., </em>249 F.3d 958, 960 (9th Cir.2001) (dismissal for failure to state a claim). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-16\">Contrary to Burgess\u2019 contention, the district court was not precluded from applying the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine to his civil rights action because it was not a bankruptcy appeal stemming from a \u201ccore\u201d function of Chapter 11. <em>See Gruntz v. County of Los Angeles, </em>202 F.3d 1074, 1082-83 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-17\">The district court properly determined that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine barred Burgess\u2019 claim that the State of California and its court system failed to enforce provisions of state probate law that would have changed the outcome of his probate court proceedings. <em>See Noel v. Hall, </em>341 F.3d 1148, 1163 (9th Cir.2003) (indicating that a federal claim directly challenging a state court\u2019s decision and seeking relief from the state court\u2019s judgment is barred by <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>because it constitutes a forbidden de facto appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-18\">The district court properly refused to exercise jurisdiction over Burgess\u2019 claim that the house was ordered attached without proper notice or hearing, that the house was exempt from probate proceedings because it was Burgess\u2019 \u201chomestead\u201d under California law, that American Contracts Indemnity Company should not have issued a \u201cconservator bond\u201d after the probate court appointed a conservator, and that state probate proceedings were tainted by racial animus. <em>See Bianchi v. Ryla-ardsdam, </em>334 F.3d 895, 901 fn. 4 (9th Cir.2003)(indicating that federal claims are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with a de facto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>forbidden appeal where they seek to disrupt or undo a state court judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Burgess\u2019 remaining federal claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 and 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(h) were properly dismissed because his complaint contained no allegations to support them. <em>See New Alaska Dev. Corp. v. Guetschow, </em>869 F.2d 1298, 1305 n. 10 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The district court permissibly dismissed Burgess\u2019 pendant state law claims without prejudice. <em>See Skysign Int'l, Inc. v. City and County of Honolulu, </em>276 F.3d 1109, 1118 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Burgess\u2019 remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">All pending motions are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b636-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
