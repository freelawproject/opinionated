In that regard, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in declining to entertain plaintiffs belated assertions of a right to nominal damages or equitable relief; thus, there was no relief available to plaintiff, and the district court did not err in granting judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">With respect to plaintiffs associational ADA claim based on an alleged hostile work environment, we can assume arguen-do that a hostile environment could constitute an associational ADA claim, because in this case we conclude that the district court did not err in determining that plaintiff failed to establish a hostile work environment that was sufficiently severe or persuasive to alter the terms and conditions of plaintiffs employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">Other arguments asserted on appeal are rejected without need for further discussion. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
