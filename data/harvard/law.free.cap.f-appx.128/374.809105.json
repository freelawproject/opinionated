We do not consider Hunter\u2019s argument that the district court erred in striking his opposition to the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion from the record. We assume for purposes of this appeal that Hunter\u2019s opposition was considered by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">After conducting a de novo review of the record, we conclude that there was probable cause to arrest Hunter. <em>Cousin v. Small, </em>325 F.3d 627, 637 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Sorenson v. Ferrie, </em>134 F.3d 325, 328 (5th Cir.1998); <em>see also </em>La.Rev.Stat. ann. \u00a7\u00a7 14:24 (West 1997), 14:134 (West 2004), 40:979 (West 2001). Because Hunter concedes he did not immediately report the incident at the bus station and given the facts surrounding his other meetings with the confidential informant, he has not shown that his phone call to Lieutenant Fried negated Detective Rowland\u2019s conclusion that there was probable cause to arrest him for being a principal to a drug deal and for malfeasance in office.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-16\">The fact that Hunter did not follow the confidential informant to the informant\u2019s place of business after the informant picked up the package at the bus station was apparent from Detective Rowland\u2019s affidavit in support of the state warrant. In addition, contrary to Hunter\u2019s argument, our determination on direct appeal that the evidence did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Hunter was guilty of attempted possession with intent to distribute cocaine did not equate to a determination that there was no probable cause for an arrest on such a charge. <em>See United States v. Hunter, </em>No. 99-30091 (5th Cir. Dec. 13, 1999). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Hunter\u2019s false arrest and false imprisonment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-17\">We have held that a claim of malicious prosecution standing alone does not violate the United States Constitution. <em>Castellano v. Fragozo, </em>352 F.3d 939, 945 (5th Cir.2003) (en banc). The district court\u2019s dismissal of Hunter\u2019s malicious prosecution claim is therefore also affirmed. Hunter\u2019s conspiracy claim fails because he has not shown an actual violation of his rights or an agreement by the defendants to commit an illegal act. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number><em>Arsenaux v. Roberts, </em>726 F.2d 1022, 1024 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b401-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
