We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">In 1994, Henry pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute cocaine and use of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 924(c). He was originally sentenced to 384 months\u2019 imprisonment and a $35,000 fine in 1994. At that time, the sentencing judge did not specify when the fine was due. In 1997, following a renewed guilty plea to the possession, an amended judgment was entered sentencing Henry to 230 months\u2019 imprisonment and a $35,000 fine due \u201cin full immediately.\u201d In 1999, the judgment was again amended to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment with a $35,000 fine due \u201cin full immediately.\u201d In 2003, Henry entered the Inmate Financial Responsibility Program (\u201cIFRP\u201d). 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 545.10 and 545.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-13\">Henry filed the instant \u00a7 2241 habeas petition in which he claimed that the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) impermissibly set his schedule of payment for his fine in violation of the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act of 1996 (\u201cMVRA\u201d). He further argued that such action was an improper delegation of judicial authority over scheduling payments in violation of <em>United States v. Coates, </em>178 F.3d 681, 683 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-15\">The District Court first concluded that, because Henry was convicted and sentenced in 1994, the MVRA does not apply to him. <em>See Coates, </em>178 F.3d at 683. Instead, the District Court found that the Victim and Witness Protection Act governed Henry\u2019s payment of fines. <em>See United States v. Holmes, </em>193 F.3d 200, 205 (3d Cir.1999). The District Court, therefore, concluded that, to the extent that Henry asserted a claim on an alleged violation of the MVRA, his claim was meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-16\">With regard to Henry\u2019s claim of improper delegation, the District Court acknowledged that under <em>Coates, </em>a sentencing court may not delegate the scheduling of restitution to the BOP. The District Court, however, went on to conclude that the sentencing court\u2019s order that Henry\u2019s fine was due \u201cin full immediately\u201d was not an improper delegation of judicial authority. <em>See McGhee v. Clark, </em>166 F.3d 884, 886 (7th Cir.1999). The District Court further noted that such an order does not preclude the BOP from ensuring that Henry proceed with payment of his fine through the IFRP. Based on this reasoning, the District Court denied Henry\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-17\">Henry appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review is plenary. <em>See Bakhtriger v. Elwood, </em>360 F.3d 414, 417 (3d Cir.2004). We agree with the District Court\u2019s disposition of Henry\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. For essentially the reasons given by the District Court, as summarized above, we will affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
