We note merely that the underlying dispute involves the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>alleged breach of a $4 million unsecured revolving line of credit and cash management facility and a $2 million secured equipment line of credit extended by Manufacturers &amp; Traders Trust Company (\u201cM&amp;T\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to CCI Construction Company (\u201cCCI\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">CCI initiated this lender liability action against M&amp;T after successfully completing a Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The District Court entered summary judgment in favor of M&amp;T on the basis of the Court\u2019s conclusion that because CCI failed to disclose (or pursue) M&amp;T\u2019s alleged liability during the course of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, it was equitably estopped from pursuing the claim after the bankruptcy. We review the District Court\u2019s conclusion <em>de novo, Saldana v. Kmart Corp., </em>260 F.3d 228, 231 (3d Cir.2001), and for the reasons stated below affirm its judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">As the District Court concluded, this case is controlled by <em>Oneida Motor Freight, Inc. v. United Jersey Bank, </em>848 F.2d 414 (3d Cir.1988).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There we held that \u201c[i]n order to preserve the requisite reliability of disclosure statements [in bankruptcy proceedings] and to provide assurances to creditors regarding the finality of plans [of reorganization] which they have voted to approve, ... under the facts ... presented] Oneida\u2019s failure to announce [its] claim against a creditor [during its bankruptcy proceedings] precluded it from litigating the cause of action. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 418. The undisputed (or undisputable) facts before us render this case factually indistinguishable from <em>Oneida </em>in any material way. Thus we reach the same result \u2014 CCI\u2019s actions make it equitably estopped from litigating lender liability claims against M&amp;T.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">There is no dispute that CCI failed to disclose its potential claim against M&amp;T during its bankruptcy case notwithstanding that it was well aware of the significant likelihood that it would pursue such a claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Oneida </em>and subsequent precedent leave no doubt of CCI\u2019s obligation to make such a disclosure. M&amp;T negotiated several aspects of the bankruptcy case proceedings, ultimately compromising in many (if not most) instances and voting to confirm CCI\u2019s reorganization plan under the assumption that confirmation would yield a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>final peace. M&amp;T took steps to validate this assumption; the record demonstrates that it successfully sought clarification of certain ambiguous provisions in the plan that could have been construed to preserve claims against it. M&amp;T voted in favor of the plan only after that clarification was secured.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">On the basis of these facts, there can be no dispute that <em>Oneida </em>controls. For the reasons described in the District Court\u2019s thorough opinion, <em>Oneida </em>demands the conclusion that CCI is equitably estopped from pursuing its claim against M&amp;T. We thus affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of M&amp;T.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-6\">. M&amp;T succeeded the interest of Allfirst Bank in the CCI loans through a 2003 merger.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b300-7\">. The District Court exercised subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. We review its final order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b300-8\">. Oneida Motor Freight, Inc., a Chapter 11 debtor, had a pre-petition banking and lending relationship with United Jersey Bank, a secured creditor. After United Jersey stopped honoring Oneida's checks, Oneida filed for bankruptcy. United Jersey participated in the bankruptcy case and did not object to the plan of reorganization proposed by Oneida. The Bankruptcy Court confirmed Oneida's plan of reorganization, which did not contain any reference to a claim by Oneida against United Jersey. Approximately seven months after Oneida\u2019s plan was confirmed, Oneida filed an action against United Jersey alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that United Jersey\u2019s pre-petition conduct constituted a breach of contract. We held that Oneida was equitably estopped from pursuing this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b300-13\">. Robert Chernicoff, CCI\u2019s bankruptcy counsel (and not with the firm that is CCI\u2019s counsel on appeal), admitted that he was aware of the facts underlaying CCI's potential lender liability claim against Allfirst <em>before </em>he filed the bankruptcy petition. When asked why CCI did not disclose the lender liability claim during bankruptcy, he erroneously stated: \"My understanding of the law is that ... its <em>[sic] </em>not necessary to be done.\u201d <em>Oneida </em>makes clear that this type of disclosure is indeed necessary. <em>Oneida, </em>848 F.2d at 417 (describing debtors\u2019 \"express obligation of candid disclosure\u201d as \"a critical step in the reorganization [process]\u201d that is arguably \"the pivotal concept in reorganization procedure under the Code\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
