The questions thus become whether the existence of material issues of fact precluded the entry of summary judgment or, alternatively, whether (assuming no genuine dispute as to the material facts) the summary judgment resulted from the court\u2019s misapplication of the rules of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">In its order of December 9, 2004, the court summarily disposed of three claims: malicious prosecution, false imprisonment, and false arrest. The material facts on which those claims are based are settled; therefore, the court committed no error in concluding that the case presented no issues of material fact. Nor did the court err in applying the law to those facts. We agree with the court for the reasons it gave for denying appellant\u2019s claims that appellant\u2019s claims are meritless. We also agree that the court, in its order of January 5, 2005, properly denied appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
