The Clerk of Court entered a default judgment on October 31, 2003 due to Dolly\u2019s failure to appear or to serve any paper in the action. The district court granted Patco\u2019s Motion for Default Judgment and Final Judgment was entered against Dolly in the amount of $232,318.20. The district court denied Dolly\u2019s Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment. Dolly brings this appeal arguing that its Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment should be entered because its failure to reply to the Third-Party Complaint was due to excusable neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-14\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to set aside a default judgment for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Gibbs v. Air Canada, </em>810 F.2d 1529, 1537 (11th Cir. 1987). To prevail on its Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment under Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b), Dolly must show (1) a meritorious defense, (2) lack of prejudice to the non-defaulting party, and (3) a good reason for failing to reply to the complaint. <em>In re Worldwide Web Sys., Inc. v. Feltman, </em>328 F.3d 1291, 1295 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cOn motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a party\u2019s legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding ... mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect....\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-15\">In support of its motion, Dolly argues that it had established adequate procedural safeguards to ensure that any service of process would be appropriately handled by its insurance company. Dolly further contends that the employee who was usually in charge of this process had recently been deployed to Iraq and the new secretary mistakenly or inadvertently violated Dolly\u2019s procedures by creating a litigation file and including the Complaint in that file rather than forwarding it on to Dolly\u2019s insurance company and that this constitutes excusable neglect. This procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>proved to be inadequate as Dolly did not respond to the complaint or anything else that was filed in this case for over six months. The district court determined, and we agree, that Dolly did not have an adequate procedure for following up with its insurance company to inquire as to whether a complaint had been received and was being pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Our Circuit precedent indicates that \u201c[d]efault that is caused by the movant\u2019s failure to establish minimum procedural safeguards for determining that action in response to a [complaint] is being taken does not constitute default through excusable neglect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Davis v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>532 F.2d 489, 490 (5th Cir. 1976)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Under our precedent, Dolly\u2019s failure to respond to the Third-Party Complaint because of a lack of minimum procedural safeguards for responding to complaints in a legal action does not constitute excusable neglect. Finding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Dolly\u2019s Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment, we affirm the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-9\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
