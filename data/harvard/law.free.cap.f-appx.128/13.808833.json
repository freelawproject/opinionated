We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1244 (9th Cir.2000), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Accepting Singh\u2019s testimony as credible, the record does not compel the conclusion that Singh established asylum eligibility because he failed to present \u201ccredible, direct and specific evidence\u201d that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution based on his arrests by Punjabi and Calcutta authorities. <em>See Molina-Morales v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 1048, 1051 (9th Cir.2001). Because Singh failed to prove eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Singh also failed to establish eligibility for CAT relief because he did not show it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if returned to India. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2); <em>Singh v.
