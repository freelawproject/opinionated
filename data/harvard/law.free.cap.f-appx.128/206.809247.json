We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history. As a preliminary matter, we note that this Court has jurisdiction over only the November 2003 BIA decision denying Lin\u2019s September 2003 motion to reconsider his motion to reconsider and reopen his immigration proceedings. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(1) (1994) (repealed 1996). Because Lin failed to file timely petitions for review of the BIA decisions affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s order of removal and denying Lin\u2019s motion to reopen his immigration proceedings, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review those decisions. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>Malvoisin v. INS, </em>268 F.3d 74, 75 (2d Cir.2001) (citing <em>Zaluski v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 72, 73 (2d Cir.1994) <em>(per curiam)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-17\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider or reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Brice v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>806 F.2d 415, 419 (2d Cir.1986). A motion to reconsider \u201crequest[s] that the Board re-examine its decision in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or perhaps an argument or aspect of the case which was overlooked.\u201d <em>Matter of Cerna, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 399, 402 n. 2 (BIA 1991) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, a motion to reconsider must specify errors of fact or law in the challenged BIA decision, and must be supported by pertinent authority. <em>See Zhao v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 90 (2d Cir.2001). As the BIA correctly found, Lin\u2019s motion to reconsider failed to identify any legal or factual defect requiring the BIA to reconsider its decision. The petition for review is accordingly DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
