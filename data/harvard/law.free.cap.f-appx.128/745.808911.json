We granted a certificate of appealability on the following issue: \u201cWhether the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 938 (11th Cir.1992) (en banc), by failing to address appellant\u2019s claims that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>his trial counsel was ineffective for not objecting to the testimony from Deputy Mark Mitchell concerning a traffic stop?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Holstick argues that the district court violated <em>Clisby </em>by not addressing his claim, among the many others, that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the testimony of the arresting officer about the traffic stop leading to Holstick\u2019s arrest. In <em>Clisby, </em>we used our supervisory authority to require the district courts of this Circuit to resolve all of a habeas petitioner\u2019s claims for relief at one time, regardless of whether the habeas petition is granted or denied. <em>Id. </em>at 935-36. We also held that where a district court does not address all of the habeas petitioner\u2019s claims for relief, we \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The government admits that the magistrate judge did not address Holstick\u2019s claim that his counsel was ineffective for not objecting to the arresting officer\u2019s testimony. But, the government contends, citing our decision in <em>Broadwater v. United States, </em>292 F.3d 1302, 1303-04 (11th Cir.2002), that the district court is permitted to summarily dismiss a habeas petitioner\u2019s claim for relief so long as there is a sufficient basis in the record for an appellate court to review the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Here, however, the government concedes that the magistrate judge did not address, summarily or otherwise, Hol-stick\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Our own review of the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation confirms that this specific ineffective assistance of counsel claim went unresolved. <em>Broadwater, </em>therefore, does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Accordingly, we find that the district court violated the <em>Clisby </em>rule. We VACATE the district court\u2019s order denying Holstick\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
