The court imposed a sentence of 51 months imprisonment (it is unclear from the present record whether a term of supervised release was also imposed). In calculating Betancourt-Saldarriage\u2019s good time credits under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624 the Bureau of Prisons applied 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 523.20 and determined his release date to be February 16, 2005. Arguing that the regulation contradicts the plain meaning of the statute, Betancourt-Saldarriage filed a habeas corpus petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in which he claims that his release date should instead be January 20, 2005. In the alternative, he argues that even if the statute were ambiguous, he should benefit from the \u201crule of lenity.\u201d The District Court disagreed and denied the petition. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We note that Betancourt-Saldarriage was released from prison on February 16, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-23\">The outcome of the appeal is controlled by our recent decision in <em>O\u2019Donald v. Johns, </em>402 F.3d 172 (3d Cir.2005). There, the appellant presented an argument essentially the same as that advanced by Betancourt-Saldarriage here. We rejected it, finding that section 3624(b) is ambiguous but agreeing with the Second, Seventh and Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that the BOP\u2019s interpretation of section 3624(b) is reasonable. We declined to apply the \u201crule of lenity\u201d because the ambiguity in the statute had been otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>resolved. In light of <em>O\u2019Donald, </em>we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-19\">. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.
