Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906-07 (5th Cir.2002) (quotation omitted). We review for substantial evidence the determination that an alien is not entitled to withholding of removal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>do not substitute our judgment of the witness\u2019 credibility for that of the BIA or IJ. <em>See id. </em>at 905-06; <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Momin contends the BIA erred by affirming the IJ\u2019s determinations that he had not shown it was more likely than not he would be subjected to persecution or targeted for torture because of his religion (Muslim) if he returned to India. The record does not compel a finding that Mo-min met his burden to show he was entitled to withholding of removal under either the INA or the CAT. <em>See Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 139-40 (5th Cir.2004). Mo-min has failed to show the BIA\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\n<em>DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b433-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
