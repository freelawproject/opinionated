Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 888 (9th Cir.2003). Accordingly, we dismiss the petition insofar as it seeks review of that finding and the concomitant denial of cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-16\">We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 over Avila\u2019s claim that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen because of ineffective assistance of counsel. We review the BIA\u2019s ruling on a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Lin v. Ashcroft, </em>377 F.3d 1014, 1023 (9th Cir.2004). We review the BIA\u2019s findings of fact regarding counsel\u2019s performance for substantial evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 1024.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-17\">Avila and his counsel failed to present certain testimony and evidence at his removal hearing that could have been helpful to his claim. Avila blames his former attorney for that failure and submitted an affidavit to the BIA implying that she had inadequately prepared for the removal hearing. The attorney submitted a significantly more detailed affidavit in response, describing her representation of Avila and stating that Avila himself was responsible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>for his lack of preparation and unwillingness to provide necessary documentation. Thus, the key dispute is about whose account is accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The BIA\u2019s decision addressed that question, stating that \u201c[biased on our review of the record, including former counsel\u2019s affidavit, we find that the respondent has not established that the deficiencies in the record were due to the representation he received from counsel.\u201d Nor was there any error by the BIA in failing to mention Avila\u2019s own affidavit. The BIA is not required to mention every piece of evidence it considers. It simply must \u201cindicate with specificity that it heard and considered petitioner\u2019s claims.\u201d <em>Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d <em>855, 858 </em>(9th Cir. 2004). The BIA did that here, and accordingly we deny the petition as to the denial of the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b682-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b683-7\">GOODWIN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ahi-dedup-0\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">\u201c[T]he BIA must indicate with specificity that it heard and considered petitioner\u2019s claims\u201d in the ineffective assistance context. <em>Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 855, 858 (9th Cir.2004) (internal quotations omitted) (quoting <em>Arrozal v. INS, </em>159 F.3d 429, 433 (9th Cir.1998)). The denial of a motion to reopen should be remanded if the BIA has not considered the relevant factors and articulated the corresponding reasoning. <em>See, e.g., Virk v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1055, 1060 (9th Cir.2002) (remanding where BIA did not consider factors in petitioner\u2019s favor, and where it considered an irrelevant factor); <em>Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, </em>282 F.3d 1218, 1227 (9th Cir.2002) (rejecting the BIA\u2019s \u201ccursory recitation and generalized analysis of the equities in favor of petitioners\u2019 claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">The BIA did not discuss the conflict between Avila-Carrasco\u2019s version of his representation \u2014 in particular, the evidence-gathering process \u2014 and the recollection of his former counsel. It merely recited that Avila\u2019s former counsel was not responsible for the deficiencies, apparently relying on her self-serving \u201cdetailed affidavit\u201d saying as much, and failed to mention that a contrary detailed declaration was submitted by Avila. Much less did the BIA\u2019s decision evaluate the content of Avila\u2019s declaration, compare its content to Dixon\u2019s, or make a credibility finding with regard to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">Moreover, the BIA misapplied the general rule that for a motion to reopen to succeed, the new evidence presented must have been unavailable at the time of the original hearing. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c). The BIA\u2019s application of this rule in an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is a category mistake because the proffered evidence described counsel\u2019s performance, not the evidence that counsel failed to present. This very confusion was rejected by this court in <em>Maravilla. </em>381 F.3d at 858. It is impossible to discern the extent of the contamination worked by this legal error.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">The BIA\u2019s disposition of Avila\u2019s ineffective assistance claim exhibits the precise features this court deemed unacceptable in <em>Virk: </em>\u201cIn addition to failing to consider the relevant positive factors, the BIA improperly considered a plainly irrelevant factor.\u201d 295 F.3d at 1060. The record shows that Avila\u2019s lawyer did little of substance to earn the $3000 she apparently collected from him, and that Avila\u2019s case was promising on the underlying merits. Under these circumstances, a remand to the BIA for a proper consideration of all the factors relevant to Avila\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is appropriate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
