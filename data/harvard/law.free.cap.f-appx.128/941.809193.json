Magill, Senior Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b968-11\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"Af8\">RENDELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b968-12\">Defendant Leroy Turner pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute cocaine, and, on July 7, 1999, was sentenced by the District Court to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. The sentence was the maximum of the appliea-ble 151-188 month range based on a total offense level of 29 (Turner\u2019s plea stipulated to a base offense level of 34; he received a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility and a two-level reduction for minor participation) and Criminal History Category VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-16\">On appeal, Turner argues that Amendment 640 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which took effect on November 1, 2002 and capped the base offense level of minor participant drug offenders at 30, should apply to him. Turner urges that Amendment 640 is a clarifying, as opposed to substantive, amendment, and thus should apply retroactively; therefore, he requests that his sentence be vacated and the case remanded for new sentencing that reflects the change effected by Amendment 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-18\">Turner also challenges his sentence under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Having concluded that the sentencing issues Appellant raises are best determined by the District Court in the first instance, we will vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Before doing so, however, we will address the guideline issue raised by Turner so as to provide guidance to the District Court on remand as to its proper application.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-21\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and review the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Butch, </em>256 F.3d 171, 177 (3d Cir.2001).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b968-22\">It is an established principle that a post-sentencing amendment to a sentencing guideline or its comments should be given effect if it \u201cclarifies\u201d the guideline or com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>ment in place at the time of sentencing. Where, however, the amendment effects a substantive change in the law, the defendant does not reap the benefit of the new provision. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.11(b)(2) (1998); <em>United States v. Marmolejos, </em>140 F.3d 488, 491 (3d Cir.1998) (citing <em>Isabel v. United States, </em>980 F.2d 60, 62 (1st Cir.1992) (holding that this is the rule in \u201cvirtually all circuits\u201d). The government contends that Amendment 640 is substantive, not clarifying, and that, accordingly, it should not apply retroactively; thus, it argues, Appellant\u2019s sentence appropriately reflects the applicable guidelines. The government notes that Amendment 640 is not listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) (Nov.2002) among the more than twenty amendments deemed to have retroactive effect, but also concedes that its absence from the list is not dispositive \u2014 a sentencing court may still reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment to give effect to later changes if it first considers the relevant sentencing factors, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and additionally concludes that such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See also Marmolejos, </em>140 F.3d at 491 (\u2018Yet the law is clear that \u2018courts can give retroactive effect to a clarifying (as opposed to substantive) amendment regardless of whether it is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Capers, </em>61 F.3d 1100, 1109 (4th Cir.1995))).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">In <em>Marmolejos </em>we held an amendment stating that sentences would be calculated with reference to the amount of drugs actually delivered \u2014 rather than by reference to the weight of the drug sale he had negotiated \u2014 to be clarifying and to lend resolve to an ambiguity. Here, however, Amendment 640 is not consistent with the guideline commentary in effect at the time of Turner\u2019s sentencing. <em>See United States v. Bertoli, </em>40 F.3d 1384, 1405 (3d Cir.1994) (explaining that courts must look to see \u201cwhether, as a matter of construction, the guideline and commentary in effect at that time is really consistent with the amended manual\u201d). Before Amendment 640, the base offense level for an offender like Turner was that \u201cspecified in the Drug Quantity Table\u201d whereas after adoption of Amendment 640, the base offense level was that \u201cspecified in the Drug Quantity Table ... except that if the defendant receives an adjustment [for mitigating role], the base offense level under this subsection should not be more than 30.\u201d Though this amendment clearly responds to concerns over the harshness of drug sentencing for those who play minimal roles, it does not \u201cfill a void\u201d or \u201cresolve an ambiguity\u201d; rather, it adds a substantive component. Therefore, we conclude Amendment 640 of the guidelines is substantive and not to be given retroactive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">In light of the foregoing we will vacate and remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker </em>and this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b968-14\">.
