Vora appeals the September 22, 2004 order of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania dismissing pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) her \u201cPetition for Removal\u201d for lack of jurisdiction. Vora also appeals the October 27, November 17, and December 17, 2004 orders denying her motions to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-19\">In 2000, Chandan Vora filed a motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and a \u201cPetition for Removal,\u201d of a Pennsylvania municipal court criminal complaint charging Vora with obstruction of the administrative law and disorderly conduct arising out of Vor\u00e1\u2019s interference with Public Works\u2019 employees\u2019 attempt to clean .up her property pursuant to a state court order. On September 22, 2004, the District Court dismissed the removal petition, concluding that the \u201cPetition for Removal\u201d sought to attack a state court criminal proceeding over which the District Court had no jurisdiction and that the pleadings failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. On October 13, 2004, Vora moved to vacate the dismissal of her removal action, claiming that the ordinances that formed the basis for charges ag\u00e1inst her were unconstitutional, and that city officials violated her civil rights. By order entered Oetob\u00e9r 27, 2004, the District Court treated the motion as a reconsideration motion and denied it for the same reasons set forth in its original dismissal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>order. Dr. Vora filed a timely .motion to vacate the October 2004 order on November 8, 2004, which the District Court denied on November 17, 2004 on the same grounds it had denied her reconsideration motion. Vora filed her third motion to vacate on November 29, 2004, which the District Court denied on December 17, 2004. Vora filed a notice of appeal on December 16, 2004.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">First, Vora\u2019s notice of appeal from the order dismissing the petition for removal is clearly untimely under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), as it was filed almost 2 months too late. The time-period prescribed for filing a notice of appeal is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director of Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978). In a civil case in which the United States is not a party, a notice of appeal must be filed within thirty (30) days of the date of entry of the final judgment or order appealed. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). On September 22, 2004, the District Court granted <em>in forma pauperis </em>and dismissed the Vora\u2019s removal petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for lack of jurisdiction. Appellant\u2019s motions to vacate did not toll the appeals period because both were filed more than ten<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> days after entry of the dismissal order. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4). Thus, Appellant had until October 26, 2004, to file a timely notice of appeal. Appellant did not file a notice of appeal until December 16, 2004, more than thirty days after entry of judgment. Accordingly, given the absence of a timely filed notice of appeal, the appeal of the District Court\u2019s September 22, 2004 order is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. Vora\u2019s appeal of the denial of the motions to vacate is timely, however, and thus, we have jurisdiction to consider the appeal of these orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">Vora was granted leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>and the appeal is now before the Court for determination pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), the Court must dismiss an appeal if it (i) is frivolous or malicious, (ii) fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or (iii) seeks monetary damages from a defendant with immunity. An action or appeal can be frivolous for either legal or factual reasons. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">After reviewing Vora\u2019s District Court pleadings and notice of appeal, we conclude that the District Court correctly denied all of the motions to vacate. Having found no legal merit to this cause, we will dismiss the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b933-6\">. We construe the notice of appeal as appealing from the District Court dismissal order and from the orders denying Vora\u2019s motions to vacate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
