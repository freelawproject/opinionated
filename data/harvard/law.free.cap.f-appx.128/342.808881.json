Parties are accorded sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal when the United States is a party, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229. 80 S.Ct. 282. 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)). The district court\u2019s order was entered on its docket on April 20, 2004. We conclude from the record that the notice of appeal was filed, at the earliest, on July 26, 2004, over one month late. Because Leon-Boza failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny Leon-Boza\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
