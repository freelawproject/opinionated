We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">To establish a claim of a hostile work environment, Kwarteng must show: (1) the harassment was unwelcome; (2) he was harassed because of a protected reason (here, national origin); (3) the harassment was sufficiently pervasive to alter his terms and conditions of employment and created an abusive working environment; and (4) some basis exists for imposing liability on the employer. <em>Causey v. Balog, </em>162 F.3d 795, 801 (4th Cir.1998) (regarding racial harassment); <em>Hartsell v. Duplex Prods., Inc., </em>123 F.3d 766, 772 (4th Cir.1997) (regarding sexual harassment). In order to find the third element, the court must consider the \u201cfrequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee\u2019s work performance.\u201d <em>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 23, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993). We find that Kwarteng fails to provide factual evidence in support of this claim. We likewise conclude that Kwarteng fa iled to adequately support his allegations of constitutional deprivations, or his claims based on state law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">Kwarteng also challenges the district court\u2019s grant of qualified immunity to the individual Defendants. Under the doctrine of qualified immunity, \u201cgovernment officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982) (citations omitted). Although Kwarteng asserts that the district court erred when it \u201cassumed\u201d that Defendants\u2019 disciplinary activities were discretionary functions, we do not agree that the district court misapplied the qualified immunity doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">Finally, Kwarteng challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his motion for sanctions against the Defendants. Rule 11(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure expressly states that sanctions do not apply \u201cto disclosures and discovery re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>quests, responses, objections, and motions that are subject to the provisions of Rules 26 through 37.\u201d Moreover, Kwarteng has made no showing that Defendants\u2019 affidavits contain statements, claims, or defenses that are frivolous or were presented for any improper purpose. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(b)(1) &amp; (2). Thus, we find that the district court properly dismissed Kwar-teng\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b328-7\">. In his informal brief, Kwarteng asserts that the district court failed to discuss his Title VII claims based on national origin and retaliation. In its November 16, 2003 memorandum, the district court rejected these claims as time-barred pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b328-8\">. The district court also properly determined that Kwarteng\u2019s state and federal claims of unequal pay were time-barred. See Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, \u00a7 9A(a) (1957) (stating that \u201c[a] complaint must be filed within six months from the date of occurrence alleged to be a violation of this article\u201d); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255(a) (2000) (stating that an action must be brought within two years of the alleged violation).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b329-17\">. Kwarteng also challenges the district court's denial of his sur-reply. Such allegation is unclear, as the district court granted Kwar-teng\u2019s motion to file a sur-reply on June 22, 2004, and denied Defendants' motion to strike Kwarteng\u2019s sur-reply in its November 16, 2004 memorandum. Moreover, Kwarteng has failed to provide any factual support for his allegations that the district court failed to consider all of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
