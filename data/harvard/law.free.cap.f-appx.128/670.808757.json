We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review credibility findings under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard. <em>See Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1149 (9th Cir.1999). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determinations, including the inconsistencies within Singh\u2019s testimony regarding his religious or political affiliations, the alleged acts of torture, and his subsequent medical treatment. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1139, 1143 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Singh-Kaur, </em>183 F.3d at 1151-52. Singh has not shown that the documentary evidence compelled a contrary conclusion in order to overcome the special deference accorded to credibility determinations. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">Because Singh did not testify credibly, he did not establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See Mejia-Paiz v. INS, </em>111 F.3d 720, 723-24 (9th Cir.1997). It follows that he failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">Because Singh failed to credibly demonstrate that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if he returned to India, the IJ properly denied his CAT claim. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156-57 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b697-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
