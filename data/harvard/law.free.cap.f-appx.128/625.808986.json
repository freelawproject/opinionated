Campbell, convicted of second-degree robbery and resisting arrest, contends he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel did not investigate two witnesses who, according to Campbell, would have provided Campbell an alibi for the evening the crimes occurred. The district court denied the petition. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AVz\">The parties are familiar with the facts and we do not recite them except as necessary for our disposition. Campbell contends his trial attorney (appointed after Campbell\u2019s first attorney withdrew due to a conflict of interest) provided ineffective assistance by failing to investigate whether Sherrie Fluker or Antoinette Davis could have provided Campbell with an alibi. Campbell presents an investigation report recounting an interview between Fluker and an investigator for Campbell\u2019s first attorney. The report shows that Fluker was uncertain when she had last seen Campbell. Fluker remembered last seeing Campbell on a Tuesday or Wednesday; the crime was committed on Monday, July 15, 1996. The report also shows Fluker did not know where Davis (Fluker\u2019s niece) was or where the investigator could find her. Campbell presented no evidence Fluker or Davis would have provided an alibi for Campbell for the night in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>At trial, Campbell\u2019s trial counsel presented a defense theory that Campbell was merely trying to collect a disputed debt and did not commit a robbery. Considering Fluker would have been at most an extremely weak alibi witness, and Davis\u2019s whereabouts were unknown, the trial counsel\u2019s decision not to further investigate Fluker or Davis was a reasonable strategic choice, well within the objectively reasonable standard of representation set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Campbell also fails to establish his trial counsel\u2019s decision not to further investigate the alibi witnesses resulted in prejudice. <em>See id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"At6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b652-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
