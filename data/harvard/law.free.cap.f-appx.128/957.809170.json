For the reasons that follow, we conclude that Penn National Insurance Company is hable under its business auto coverage policy for the first $1 million in damages arising from the accident, and that Continental Casualty Company is lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>ble under its business auto coverage policy for the remaining $1.5 million. Accordingly, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">The parties stipulated to the following facts. On August 1, 1997, David Breu, an employee of Allied Steel Corporation, was working a second job as a delivery man for a Pizza Hut located in North Charleston, South Carolina. With Allied Steel\u2019s permission, Breu was using a car owned by Allied Steel to perform his delivery route. While delivering pizzas that evening, Breu ran a red light and struck the car of Russell Bernard, a North Charleston police officer who was off duty at the time. The accident injured Bernard.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">On January 28, 1999, Bernard and his wife Sharon brought companion suits against Pizza Hut and Breu. Breu sued for his injuries and Sharon Breu sued for loss of consortium. Allied Steel was not a party to either action. In February of 2001, Continental (which insured Pizza Hut and various other Pepsico, Inc. subsidiaries in 49 states), on behalf Pizza Hut only, and Penn (which insured Allied Steel), on behalf of Breu only, settled with the Ber-nards for $2.5 million. Of this sum, Continental paid $1.75 million and Penn paid $750,000, though both insurers reserved the right to contest this distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">On March 20, 2001, Continental filed a declaratory judgment action against Penn in South Carolina state court seeking to determine each party\u2019s rights under the three pohcies in effect at the time of the accident: Penn\u2019s business auto coverage policy, which provided Allied Steel with up to $1 million in liability insurance; Continental\u2019s business auto coverage policy, which provided Pizza Hut with up to $5 million in liability insurance; and Penn\u2019s umbrella pohcy, which provided Allied Steel with additional insurance of up to $1 million. Penn subsequently removed the case to federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-12\">After a bench trial, the district court ruled that: (1) Penn is primarily hable under its business auto coverage pohcy for the first $1 million in damages arising out of the accident as well as for Breu\u2019s defense costs; (2) Penn is hable under its umbrella pohcy for the next $1 million in damages arising out of the accident; and (3) even though Breu was insured under Continental\u2019s pohcy at the time of the accident, the vehicle he was driving was not covered and, therefore, Continental provided \u201cno hability coverage for the accident and was under no duty to defend Mr. Breu as a result thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Penn timely appealed. We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <em>Williams v. Sandman, </em>187 F.3d 379, 381 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-14\">Before addressing the substantive questions involved, we briefly describe how the three insurance pohcies at issue function.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-15\">The business auto coverage pohcies function identically. Each contains a \u201cDeclarations\u201d page that indicates a \u201chability\u201d code number. This code number corresponds to a description provided in Section I, \u201cCovered Autos.\u201d Thus, in this case, both pohcies provide liability coverage for \u201cany \u2018auto.\u2019\u201d Each pohcy also contains a \u201cDefinitions\u201d section \u2014 Section V in both pohcies \u2014 that defines various relevant terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>In addition, both business auto coverage policies define \u2014 in Section II, \u201cLiability Coverage\u201d \u2014 what \u201ccoverage\u201d is and \u201cwho is an insured.\u201d With respect to \u201ccoverage,\u201d both policies state: \u201cWe will pay all sums an \u2018insured\u2019 legally must pay as damages because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance applies, caused by an \u2018accident\u2019 and resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of a covered \u2018auto.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">Each policy also includes \u2014 in Section IV, \u201cBusiness Auto Conditions\u201d \u2014 an \u201cother insurance\u201d clause, which determines the conditions under which the policy will be considered \u201cprimary\u201d or \u201cexcess.\u201d Penn\u2019s and Continental\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses are identical. They provide in relevant part: \u201cFor any covered \u2018auto\u2019 you, own, this Coverage Form provides primary insurance. For any covered \u2018auto\u2019 you don\u2019t own, the insurance provided by this Coverage Form is excess over any other collectible insurance.\u201d Relevant to this case, Continental\u2019s policy also includes several \u201cEndorsements\u201d that amend the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">Penn\u2019s umbrella policy differs in substance from the business auto coverage policies in that it provides coverage only when the applicable underlying limit \u2014 in this case, Penn\u2019s business auto coverage policy\u2019s $1 million limit \u2014 is- insufficient to cover resulting damages, and it provides coverage only for those damages in excess of that underlying limit. The umbrella policy operates similarly to the other policies, however, in that it contains a \u201ccoverage\u201d section, a section defining \u201cwho is an insured,\u201d an \u201cother insurance\u201d clause, and a \u201cdefinitions\u201d section.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">The first substantive question we consider is whether the district court correctly concluded that Continental provided \u201cno liability coverage\u201d in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">Under South Carolina law, insurance policies are subject to the general rules of contract construction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-9\">A court must give policy language its plain, ordinary, and popular meaning. An insurer\u2019s obligation under a policy of insurance is defined by the terms of the policy and cannot be enlarged by judicial construction. However, where present, ambiguous or conflicting terms in an insurance policy must be construed liberally in favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b986-10\"><em>Sunex Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>185 F.Supp.2d 614, 617 (D.S.C.2001) (citations omitted); <em>accord Poston v. Nat\u2019l Fidelity Life Ins. Co., </em>303 S.C. 182, 399 S.E.2d 770, 772 (1990) (\u201cWhere language used in an insurance contract is ambiguous, or where it is capable of two reasonable interpretations, that construction which is most favorable to the insured will be adopted.\u201d (internal quotations marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-11\">The district court noted that Continental\u2019s policy \u201clisted a number of vehicles as \u2018covered auto,\u2019 but the vehicle being operated by Mr. Breu on August 1, 1997 was not listed.\u201d The court also noted that \u201c[njowhere in [Continental\u2019s] policy is \u2018covered automobile\u2019 defined so as to include one not owned by an employee but being operated by an employee about the business of Pizza Hut.\u201d On the basis of these facts, the court concluded that \u201c[t]he vehicle that Mr. Breu was driving at the time of the accident was not a covered vehicle under [Continental\u2019s] policy,\u201d and, as a result, Continental \u201cprovided no liability coverage for the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b986-12\">Though we accept the facts noted by the district court, we cannot accept its ultimate conclusion. First, the plain language of Continental\u2019s business auto coverage policy strongly indicates that both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>Breu and the vehicle he was driving were covered under that policy. It is undisputed that Breu was \u201can insured\u201d under the policy. Endorsement 8 amended the definition of \u201cwho is an insured\u201d to include \u201cany employee ... while acting \u2018within the scope of [his] duties\u2019 to [Pizza Hut],\u201d and Endorsement 19 provides that \u201c[a]ny employee of [Pizza Hut] is an \u2018insured\u2019 while using a covered \u2018auto\u2019 [Pizza- Hut] do[esn\u2019t] own, hire or borrow in [its] business or [its] personal affairs.\u201d Neither the district court nor Continental points to any language in Continental\u2019s policy providing that in order for an \u201cinsured\u201d to be entitled to liability coverage, his specific vehicle must be listed in the policy. Indeed, given that Continental\u2019s policy covers Pizza Hut and various other subsidiaries of Pepsico, Inc. in 49 states, such a requirement would likely preclude coverage in many otherwise deserving cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Furthermore, nowhere in Continental\u2019s policy is \u201ccovered auto\u201d defined so as to <em>exclude </em>a vehicle not owned by a Pizza Hut employee that is used in the scope of that employee\u2019s employment. In fact, to the contrary, Continental\u2019s policy, like Penn\u2019s, explicitly states that <em>\u201cany </em>\u2018auto\u201d \u2019 is a \u201ccovered auto\u201d for purposes of liability insurance. Absent any contrary . indication, \u201cany\u201d auto must include Breu\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">Nevertheless, Continental contends that Endorsement 20 narrows the scope of \u201ccovered autos\u201d so as to exclude from coverage any non-employee-owned vehicles. <em>See </em>Brief of Appellee at 20. Endorsement 20, styled a \u201c[d]eseription of \u2018Auto[,]\u201d \u2019 provides: \u201cAny employee owned vehicle <em>only </em>while the employee is working on the clock for Pizza Hut, Inc. and operating such vehicle on behalf of Pizza Hut, Inc.\u201d The Endorsement further states: \u201cAny \u2018auto\u2019 described in the Schedule will be considered a covered \u2018auto\u2019 [Pizza Hut] own[s] and not a covered \u2018auto\u2019 [Pizza Hut] hire[s],, borrow[s] or lease[s] under the coverage for which it is a covered \u2018auto.\u201d \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b987-9\">Continental\u2019s reading of Endorsement 20 is at odds with the text\u2019s plain language. Endorsement 20 does not purport to limit the definition of \u201cauto\u201d provided in Section V, i.e., \u201ca land motor vehicle, trailer or semitrailer designed for travel on public roads.\u201d Rather, as the policy specifically states, Endorsement 20 merely clarifies that when a Pizza Hut employee is using his own vehicle in the course of his employment, that vehicle \u201cwill be considered a covered \u2018auto\u2019 [Pizza Hut] own[s] and not a covered \u2018auto\u2019 [Pizza Hut] hire[s], borrow[s] or lease[s]....\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In other words, Endorsement 20 seeks only to clarify that, for liability purposes, an employee who uses his own vehicle on the job will be treated identically to an employee who uses a vehicle owned by Pizza Hut. In short, contrary to Continental\u2019s contention, Endorsement 20 does not, under any reasonable interpretation, make \u201cclear\u201d that for' coverage to extend to an employee, \u201cthe vehicle must be \u2018employee owned[.]\u201d \u2019 <em>See </em>Brief of Appellee at 20. And, even if Endorsement 20 were capable of \u201ctwo reasonable interpretations,\u201d which it is not, we would be required to adopt the construction \u201cmost favorable to the insured.\u201d <em>See Poston, </em>899 S.E.2d at 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-10\">Thus, under the -plain language of Continental\u2019s policy, and because we must resolve any ambiguity in favor Breu, we conclude that Continental provided liability coverage to Breu.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">Concluding as we have that Continental\u2019s policy provides liability coverage, we must now decide which of the two business auto coverage policies provides primary coverage. Penn argues, largely on the basis of parol evidence, that Continental provides \u201csole primary coverage,\u201d and, in the alternative, that Penn and Continental provide \u201cco-primary coverage.\u201d Brief of Appellant at 21, 28. Because the clear language of the policies requires the conclusion that Penn\u2019s coverage is primary, these arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">It is hornbook law that when the terms of a written instrument are unambiguous, parol evidence is inadmissible. <em>E.g., Proffitt v. Sitton, </em>244 S.C. 206, 136 S.E.2d 257, 259 (1964). In this case, the policies are clear and unambiguous as to which one is primary and which one is excess. Both policies contain an identical \u201cother insurance\u201d clause, which provides: \u201cFor any covered \u2018auto\u2019 you own, this Coverage Form provides primary insurance. For any covered \u2018auto\u2019 you don\u2019t own, the insurance provided by this Coverage Form is excess over any other collectible insurance.\u201d It is undisputed that Allied Steel owned the vehicle Breu was driving at the time of the accident and that Breu was driving it with Allied Steel\u2019s permission. It is therefore clear that Penn is the primary insurer. This conclusion is bolstered by the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d in South Carolina that \u201cwhen two policies extend coverage to the operation of a vehicle, the policy insuring the liability of the owner of a described vehicle has the first and primary obligation.\u201d <em>N.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>304 S.C. 110, 403 S.E.2d 151, 152 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">Attempting to escape the reality of its primary obligation, Penn points to South Carolina's \u201ctotal policy insuring intent\u201d rule. That rule provides that in some cases, when two policies both contain \u201cexcess\u201d clauses, those clauses \u201cshould cancel each other out,\u201d and the court should determine, through analysis of several factors, the \u201ctotal policy insuring intent.\u201d <em>S.C. Ins. Co. v. Fidelity and Guaranty Ins. Underwriters, Inc., </em>327 S.C. 207, 489 S.E.2d 200, 204 (1997). Penn then relies on parol evidence tending to show that Pizza Hut\u2019s intent was to provide primary car insurance to its delivery men. <em>See </em>Brief of Appellant at 16-21, 23, 26-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">The fatal flaw in this argument is that the \u201ctotal policy insuring intent\u201d rule only applies when \u201cit is impossible to give effect to both \u2018excess\u2019 clauses\u201d because they contradict each other, <em>Fidelity, </em>489 S.E.2d at 205, which, as explained above, is not the case here. <em>See S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. S.E.C.U.R.E. Underwriters Risk Retention Group, </em>353 S.C. 249, 578 S.E.2d 8, 11 (2003) (holding that where two \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses \u201care not mutually repugnant, it [is] unnecessary to apply the \u2018total policy insuring intent\u2019 rule to allocate priority between the two carriers\u201d). Thus, because the plain language of the policies dictates that Penn is the primary insurer, we conclude, notwithstanding any parol evidence, that Penn is liable for the first $1 million in damages arising from the accident between Breu and Bernard.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">The question remains whether Continental\u2019s policy or Penn\u2019s umbrella policy is next in line.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-11\">Penn\u2019s umbrella policy provides: \u201cWe will pay on behalf of the insured the \u2018ultimate net loss\u2019 in excess of the \u2018applicable underlying limit\u2019 which the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of\u2019 bodily and other injury \u201cto which this insurance applies.... \u201d Quali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>fying this grant of coverage is the umbrella policy\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d clause, which provides: \u201cIf other insurance applies to claims covered by this pohcy, the insurance under this policy is excess and we will not make any payments until the other insurance has been used up. This will not be true, however, if the other insurance is specifically written to be excess over this policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">Penn does not dispute that, but for Continental\u2019s policy and its umbrella policy\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d clause, its umbrella policy would provide coverage after exhaustion of primary insurance. Indeed, the umbrella pohcy clearly indicates that Penn\u2019s primary policy is the applicable underlying pohcy, and (according to Penn) the umbrella pohcy specifically lists Breu\u2019s vehicle. Thus, if Continental provided no liability coverage in this case and the umbrella policy\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d clause did not apply, Penn would be liable under its umbrella pohcy for $1 million in excess damages \u2014 that is, the \u201cultimate net loss\u201d up to its pohcy limit, which is $1 million, in excess of the \u201capplicable underlying limit,\u201d which is also $1 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">It is a general principle of insurance law, however, that \u201cumbrella policies are regarded as excess over and above any type of primary coverage, excess provisions arising in regular policies in any manner, or any escape clauses\u201d because \u201cumbrella pohcies are not an attempt by a primary insurer to limit a portion of its risk by labeling it \u2018excess\u2019 nor a device to escape responsibility.\u201d 15 Lee R. Russ &amp; Thomas F. Segalla, <em>Couch on Insurance 3d </em>\u00a7 220:41, at 220-51 (1999). Moreover, we have adopted a similar approach, i.e., that, absent a contrary state rule, \u201cwhere purported conflicts exist between an umbrella pohcy and an essentially primary pohcy made excess by a non-ownership clause\u201d\u2014 precisely the case here \u2014 \u201cthe umbrella policy need not contribute until after the primary and ordinary excess coverages are exhausted.\u201d <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Am. Hardware Mut. Ins. Co., </em>865 F.2d 592, 594 (4th Cir.1989).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b989-12\">Of course, our <em>Allstate </em>rule would not apply in the face of contrary state law. But South Carolina, which has noted that umbrella pohcies are \u201cfundamentally different\u201d from primary pohcies, <em>Todd v. Federated Mut. Ins. Co., </em>305 S.C. 395, 409 S.E.2d 361, 365 (1991), has never recognized a different rale. And, given that the <em>Allstate </em>rule is in hne with the \u2018overwhelming weight of authority,\u2019 <em>Allstate, </em>865 F.2d at 595, it seems unlikely that South Carolina courts would adopt a contrary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-13\">Continental argues that the <em>Allstate </em>rule \u201cdoes not apply here since the unrefuted language of the Umbrella Pohcy provides coverage for the Allied-owned vehicle.\u201d Brief of Appellee at 19. But, as in <em>Allstate, </em>the issue is not whether the umbrella pohcy would provide coverage if it were the only pohcy available; it is instead whether \u201cthe primary and ordinary excess coverages [have been] exhausted.\u201d <em>Allstate, </em>865 F.2d at 594. Furthermore, the <em>Allstate </em>rale works no injustice in this case. Breu\u2019s accident occurred during the course of his employment for Pizza Hut, so there is nothing inequitable about Pizza Hut\u2019s insurer bearing a portion of the liability for resulting damages. <em>Cf. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Employers Liability Assurance Corp., </em>445 F.2d 1278, 1283-84 (5th Cir. 1971) (weighing five considerations in holding that primary insurance limits must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>exhausted before umbrella policy kicks in \u2014 relied upon by Fourth Circuit in <em>Allstate, </em>865 F.2d at 594).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Penn is primarily liable for the first $1 million in damages arising from the accident between Breu and Bernard and that Continental is liable for the remaining $1.5 million in damages.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART; AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b985-9\">. Although defense costs were at issue below, Penn has not raised any issue as to them on appeal, and we therefore do not consider defense costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b987-7\">. As this case demonstrates, the distinction between a \"covered 'auto' [Pizza Hut] own[s]\u201d and a \"covered 'auto' [Pizza Hut] do[esn\u2019t] own\u201d is significant under the \"other insurance\u201d clauses of both Continental's and Penn\u2019s policies for determining which policy provides primary coverage. See <em>infra </em>Part IV.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b989-7\">. Although Continental states that its policy was \"specifically written\u201d to be excess over Penn\u2019s umbrella policy, Brief of Appellee at 18, it points to no policy language other than the generic \"other insurance\u201d clause to support this contention; we therefore find it unpersuasive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b990-17\">. Since Continental's policy limit is high enough to cover the $1.5 million in remaining damages, Penn bears no liability under its umbrella policy. However, since Continental paid $1.75 million toward the settlement, and Penn paid $750,000, Penn remains liable to Continental in the amount of $250,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
