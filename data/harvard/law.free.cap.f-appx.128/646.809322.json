We are compelled to reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-22\">Zheng sought asylum and withholding of deportation on the grounds that he had been persecuted on account of his religion by the Chinese Communist government and feared such persecution in the future. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-24\">The transcripts of the merits hearings make it clear that the IJ\u2019s decision was influenced by what she perceived to be Zheng\u2019s lack of knowledge of the basic tenets of Christianity. The IJ\u2019s conclusion is not supported by the record. Over the course of the merits hearings, Zheng testified about the creation story, the four Gospels, the story of the crucifixion, the resurrection, and Jesus\u2019 healing of the sick. The IJ erred when she failed to credit the extent to which Zheng demonstrated knowledge of Christian teachings. Although the IJ stated that she based her denial of Zheng\u2019s application solely on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>inconsistent testimony, the record demonstrates that she impermissibly relied on what she perceived to be Zheng\u2019s lack of knowledge of the basic tenets of Christianity. This improper reliance pervades the record and her analysis. Her findings were not based on substantial evidence. The inconsistencies in Zheng\u2019s testimony upon which the IJ expressly rested her adverse credibility finding are either minor or not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir.2002); <em>see also 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">The petition is GRANTED; the case is REMANDED. We request that it be assigned to a different Immigration Judge. <em>Arulampalam v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 679, 689 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b673-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
