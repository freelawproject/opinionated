Simmons challenges the calculation of his good conduct time (\u201cGCT\u201d) by the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d). Because we conclude that the District Court\u2019s order is correct in light of our recent opinion in <em>O\u2019Donald v. Johns, </em>402 F.3d 172 (3d Cir.2005), we will summarily affirm. Simmons\u2019 motion for appointment of counsel on appeal is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-26\">Simmons is currently incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fair-ton, New Jersey, serving a sentence of 322 months for conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute over fifty grams of cocaine. Simmons has been in custody since May 17, 1990. Simmons is scheduled for release on April 4, 2013. The BOP calculated the date pursuant to its reading of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b). After exhausting administrative remedies, Simmons filed a petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 on November 23, 2004, claiming specifically that the BOP misinterprets \u00a7 3624(b), depriving him of 390 days of GCT. He claims that he is entitled by statute to receive 54 days of GCT for each year of his imposed sentence, rather than the BOP\u2019s interpretation that he receives credit only for time actually served. By order entered December 16, 2004, the District Court held that \u00a7 3624(b) is not ambiguous, and the BOP\u2019s interpretation is correct. Simmons presents no other claims. Simmons then filed this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>We recently decided this precise issue. In <em>O\u2019Donald, </em>we held that although \u00a7 3624(b) is ambiguous, the BOP\u2019s interpretation is reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 174. Here, the District Court incorrectly concluded that \u00a7 3624(b) is unambiguous. However, as we stated in <em>O\u2019Donald, </em>under <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), we defer to the BOP\u2019s interpretation. <em>O\u2019Donald, </em>at 174. Thus, Simmons\u2019 claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">In short, because of our recent opinion in <em>O\u2019Donald v. Johns, </em>the District Court properly rejected Simmons\u2019 challenge to the BOP\u2019s calculation of his GCT. Accordingly, we will affirm the District 'Court\u2019s order denying his habeas corpus petition. Simmons\u2019 request for appointment of counsel on appeal is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b929-27\">. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a). We exercise plenary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its findings of fact. <em>See Ruggiano v. Reish, </em>307 F.3d 121, 126 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
