In his habeas petition, Gallo challenges the calculation of his good conduct time (\u201cGCT\u201d) by the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d). Because we conclude that the District Court\u2019s decision is correct in light of our recent opinion in <em>O\u2019Donald v. Johns, </em>402 F.3d 172 (3d Cir.2005), we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Gallo is currently incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution-Schuylkill in Minersville, Pennsylvania, serving a federal sentence of 180 months imposed in 1997. According to the BOP, Gallo is eligible under the applicable statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b), to earn up to 683 days of GCT. The BOP\u2019s calculation of GCT is based on the time Gallo will actually serve in prison, not on the entire 180-month sentence imposed. The BOP projects Gallo\u2019s release date as October 16, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">After administratively challenging the BOP\u2019s calculation of his GCT, Gallo filed a \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition in the District Court. In his habeas petition, Gallo argues that the BOP\u2019s calculation of his GCT deprives him of the amount to which he is entitled by statute. Gallo asserts that \u00a7 3624(b) allows him to earn up to 54 days per year based on the term of sentence imposed, not 54 days per year based on time actually served as the BOP\u2019s calculation provides. Relying on the opinions of several other courts, the District Court rejected Gallo\u2019s position and denied his habeas petition. Gallo appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">We will affirm the District Court\u2019s order. Since Gallo filed his notice of appeal, we resolved the issue in <em>O\u2019Donald v. Johns, </em>402 F.3d 172 (3d Cir.2005). In <em>O\u2019Donald, </em>we held that the meaning of \u00a7 3624(b) is ambiguous and thus deferred to the BOP\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the statute. <em>See O\u2019Donald, </em>402 F.3d at 174. Gallo\u2019s challenge, identical to the one raised and rejected in <em>O\u2019Donald, </em>is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">In short, we conclude that Gallo\u2019s appeal is controlled by <em>O\u2019Donald, </em>which constitutes subsequent precedent warranting summary action. <em>See </em>Third Circuit L.A.R. 27.4, I.O.P. 10.6. Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order denying Gallo\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b931-8\">. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a). We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its findings of fact. <em>See Ruggiano v. Reish, </em>307 F.3d 121, 126 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
