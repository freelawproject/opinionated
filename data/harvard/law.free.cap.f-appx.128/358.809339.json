For the following reasons, we reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-18\">Walter Breg\u00f3n, an Hispanic male, worked from 1997 until March 20, 2001 as a Sales Consultant at Houston Auto Imports Greenway, Ltd. (HAIG).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Breg\u00f3n was sin effective if abrupt salesman, garnering the Mercedes Benz USA Star Achiever Award in 2000 for his \u201csignificant role in making [his] dealership successful.\u201d In November 2000, as Breg\u00f3n began to agitate for a managerial position at the Dealership, he contemporaneously began to receive disciplinary warnings about his behavior. On March 13, 2001, he filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) for discriminatory failure to promote. One week later, he was fired. He amended his complaint to include retaliatory discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Breg\u00f3n filed suit in district court alleging discriminatory failure to promote, discriminatory/retaliatory termination under the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (\u201cTCHRA\u201d), Tex. Lab.Code Ann. \u00a7 21.001 <em>et seq., </em>and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent hiring, retention and supervision under state law. Defendants moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The district court, adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s findings and recommendations, concluded that Breg\u00f3n failed to provide competent summary judgment evidence that he was directly employed by defendants AutoNation USA Corporation, AutoNation USA, AutoNation, Inc., and AutoNation, Inc., formerly known as Mercedes Benz of Houston-Greenway. Those entities were dismissed from the suit, leaving only HAIG. The district court\u2019s order also dismissed all of the state law claims. Breg\u00f3n does not raise these issues on appeal, and these matters therefore are not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The district court also dismissed Bre-gon\u2019s discriminatory failure to promote and the discriminatory/retaliatory termination claims. The district court concluded that Breg\u00f3n failed to satisfy the third prong of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting requirement for discriminatory failure to promote, failed to make a <em>prima facie </em>case for discriminatory termination, and failed to make a <em>prima facie </em>case for retaliatory termination. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). For the reasons contained in Part III, those decisions are reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">The district court denied Bregon\u2019s motions to compel based on the reasons set forth in its conclusions regarding the discrimination and retaliation claims. To the extent that the denials of the motions rely on the reasoning now reversed, those denials are vacated. We remand those motions with instructions to reconsider in a manner consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">This Court reviews a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Price v. Fed. Express Corp., </em>283 F.3d 715, 719 (5th Cir.2002). Summary judgment must be granted if \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>see also Price, </em>283 F.3d at 719. \u201cOn a motion for summary judgment, a court must review the facts in the light most favorable to the non-mov-ant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">The analysis of Title VII claims under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-12\">First, the plaintiff must establish a <em>pri-ma facie </em>case of discrimination.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-13\">The burden the[n] shift[s] to respondent to produe[e] evidence that the plaintiff was rejected, or someone else was preferred, for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason----[Finally] the plaintiff ... must be afforded the opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-16\"><em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 142-43, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Claims of discrimination under the TCHRA are evaluated under the same burden shifting analysis as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Title VII claims. <em>Shackelford v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, L.L.P., </em>190 F.3d 398, 404 n. 2 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\n<em>A. Discriminatory Failure to Promote</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The district court determined that Breg\u00f3n met his <em>prima facie </em>case for discriminatory failure to promote. HAIG responded with testimony from the dealership\u2019s general manager, Mike Sullivan, that he believed Breg\u00f3n to be unqualified for the position because he \u201chad a temperament problem\u201d and \u201cexploded at other employees.\u201d For the final prong of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting test, Breg\u00f3n must show that the employer\u2019s reason is pretext either by offering evidence that would disprove the reason <em>or </em>demonstrate ulterior motive. <em>Reeves, </em>530 U.S. at 147-48, 120 S.Ct. 2097. The district court concluded that \u201cthere is no evidence that Sullivan denied Plaintiff a promotion because of his national origin, which is the only issue before the court.\u201d In fact, Breg\u00f3n offered testimony from another of his supervisors, Matt Burkholder, that Breg\u00f3n had a good relationship with Burkholder, his colleagues, and the customers. This evidence contradicts defendant\u2019s stated reason that Breg\u00f3n was unqualified. Further, Breg\u00f3n provided evidence that other minorities had complained about promotion discrimination. Therefore, we conclude that Breg\u00f3n had presented sufficient evidence to find that HAIG\u2019s asserted justification is false, which may permit a trier of fact to conclude that HAIG unlawfully discriminated. <em>See id. </em>at 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">\n<em>B. Discriminatory Termination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">The district court concluded that Breg\u00f3n failed to make a <em>prima facie </em>case that he was fired because of race discrimination. Breg\u00f3n must demonstrate that he (1) is a member of a protected class, (2) he was qualified for the position, (3) he was discharged, and (4) his employer filled the position with a person who is not a member of the protected class, or in a disparate treatment case, was treated less favorably than a similarly situated employee of another race. <em>See, e.g., Okoye v. Univ. of Tex. Houston Health Sci. Ctr., </em>245 F.3d 507, 512-13 (5th Cir.2001). We conclude that Breg\u00f3n has made a <em>prima facie </em>case and has provided evidence that, when \u201ctaken as a whole[,] (1) creates a fact issue as to whether each of the employer\u2019s stated reasons was what actually motivated the employer and (2) creates a reasonable inference that [race] was a determinative factor in the actions of which plaintiff complains.\u201d <em>Rhodes v. Guiberson Oil Tools, </em>75 F.3d 989, 994 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc). The district court dismissed this claim in error and Breg\u00f3n should be allowed to present his discriminatory termination claim to the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">\n<em>C. Retaliatory Termination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">The district court concluded that Breg\u00f3n had not made a <em>prima facie </em>case for retaliatory termination. Specifically, it found that he failed to show that \u201cthere was a causal connection between the participation in the protected activity ... and the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Webb v. Cardiothoracic Surgery Assocs., P.A, </em>139 F.3d 532, 540 (5th Cir.1998). However, Breg\u00f3n was fired only a week after he filed his complaint and he offered evidence that people at work were likely aware of his complaint. This Court has held that the combination of temporal proximity and possibility of knowledge of the complaint is sufficient to satisfy a defendant\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>burden for a retaliation claim. <em>See, e.g., Evans v. Houston, </em>246 F.3d 344, 354 (5th Cir.2001) (finding a <em>prima facie </em>case when plaintiff was fired five days after complaint filed); <em>Swanson v. Gen. Servs. Admin., </em>110 F.3d 1180, 1188 (5th Cir.1997) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>(one day); <em>see also Handzlik v. United States, </em>93 Fed. Appx. 15, 19 (5th Cir.2004) (unpublished) (two months). Breg\u00f3n satisfied this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE, VACATE and REMAND the grant of summary judgment on the issues of discriminatory failure to promote and discriminatory and retaliatory discharge under the TCHRA and Title VII. We VACATE the denial of Bregon\u2019s motions to compel, with instructions to reconsider them in a manner consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b385-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b385-12\">. Breg\u00f3n first was employed with Mercedes Benz of Houston-Greenway, which was owned by Park Place Motor Cars of Houston, Ltd. In 1999, that dealership was purchased by Houston Auto Imports Greenway, Ltd., a subsidiary of AutoNation. Breg\u00f3n concedes that he has no complaint against any of the Park Place defendants and has indicated he will dismiss them from his complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
