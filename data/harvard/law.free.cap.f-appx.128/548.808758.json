As a result of this conviction, the Department of Homeland Security commenced removal proceedings against Gill for having committed an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under the Immigration and Nationality Act. After a hearing, an immigration judge concluded that the government failed to establish removability because, in his view, residential entry is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and therefore not an aggravated felony. The Board of Immigration Appeals, however, reversed and ordered removal, determining that the offense is indeed a crime of violence. Gill filed a timely petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-14\">Gill argues that the Board erred in finding removability. Aliens may be deported under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) if they are convicted of an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d which includes any crime of violence for which the term of imprisonment is one year, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). A \u201ccrime of violence\u201d includes an offense that \u201cby its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used....\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b). Because Gill received more than one year in jail, the only issue is whether the residential entry offense, Ind.Code \u00a7 35-43-2-1.5, by its nature involves a substantial risk of physical force. Gill says no, but that runs smack dab into <em>United States v. Gardner, </em>397 F.3d 1021 (7th Cir.2005). There, we concluded that the Indiana residential entry offense, which criminalizes knowingly or intentionally breaking and entering a dwelling, is a crime of violence because unauthorized entry into a residence presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to an occupant. 397 F.3d at 1024. This is true regardless of the defendant\u2019s intent in being there, as he will often encounter resistance from occupants or structural barriers in entering another\u2019s dwelling unlawfully. <em>Id. </em>at 1023.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-16\">At oral argument, defense counsel argued that <em>Gardner </em>is distinguishable and wrongly decided. In his view, <em>Gardner </em>is distinguishable because it did not involve \u00a7 16(b), but instead whether residential entry is a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a) of the federal sentencing guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, cmt. n. 1 (2004) (cross-referencing the definition contained in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)). But the definitions of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in \u00a7 16(b) and \u00a7 4B1.2(a) are essentially the same, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>the former involving \u201cphysical force\u201d and the latter \u201cphysical injury.\u201d Indeed, the <em>Gardner </em>court relied on cases that interpreted \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 16(b) in concluding that residential entry qualified under \u00a7 4B1.2(a). <em>See </em>397 F.3d at 1023-24 (citing <em>United States v. Venegas-Ornelas, </em>348 F.3d 1273, 1278 (10th Cir.2003), and <em>United States v. Delgado-Enriquez, </em>188 F.3d 592, 595 (5th Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><em>Gardner </em>is not distinguishable, but is it wrong? We cannot say that it is, though we can certainly imagine scenarios where a defendant can be guilty of residential entry without a hint of violence. Think, for example, of a persistent salesman who gets one foot in the door before he is nonviolently rebuffed. But that is far from what transpired here- \u2014 Gill broke into a home and beat up its occupant. Thus, we decline, given the facts of this case, to take a fresh look at <em>Gardner, </em>a decision announced just 2 months ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Gill\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
