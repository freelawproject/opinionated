We have jurisdiction under former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). <em>Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997). We review for substantial evidence and will reverse the IJ\u2019s determination only if the evidence compels such a result. <em>Ochave v. INS, </em>254 F.3d 859, 861-62 (9th Cir.2001). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-19\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that even if Marroquin-Alegria\u2019s testimony is taken as true, she faded to establish that she suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>See id. </em>at 865-66. The guerillas\u2019 initial interest in Marroquin-Alegria was due to the medical assistance she could provide to wounded members of the guerilla group. Although she testified she was blamed for the deaths of two guerillas, the evidence does not compel the conclusion that the beatings and threats she received occurred as a result of an imputed political opinion. <em>See id. </em>at 866-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Because Marroquin-Alegria failed to demonstrate that she is eligible for asylum, it follows that she did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See de Leon-Barrios v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 391, 394 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">Pursuant to <em>Elian v. Ashcroft, </em>370 F.3d 897 (9th Cir.2004) (order), Marroquin-Al-egria\u2019s voluntary departure period will begin to run upon issuance of this court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b33-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
