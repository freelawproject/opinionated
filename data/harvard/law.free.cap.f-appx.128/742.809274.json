No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996), govern this petition. We deny the petition and affirm the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-16\">\u201cThe BIA\u2019s factual determination that [an alien] is removable and not entitled to asylum must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. Office of the U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cThus, a denial of asylum may be reversed <em>only </em>if the evidence presented by the applicant is so powerful that a reasonable factfinder would <em>have </em>to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution exists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1323-24 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-17\">Clerge argues first that the BIA erred in reversing the IJ\u2019s determination that the charge of removability, brought under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii), was not supported because the evidence failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>show that Clerge had the intent to misrepresent himself to be a United States citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision that Clerge was inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii). Section 1182(a) (6) (C) (ii) (I) states that an alien is inadmissible when he \u201cfalsely represents, or has falsely represented, himself or herself to be a citizen of the United States for any purpose or benefit under this chapter ... or any other Federal or State law.\u201d Here, the evidence shows that Clerge initially submitted a fraudulent U.S. passport to an immigration inspector and indicated that he was a U.S. citizen on his customs declaration. But Clerge did not admit to his improprieties until after his entry attempt failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Clerge argues next that he is entitled to asylum because his credible testimony shows a well-founded fear of persecution based on his participation in Zafe Elev Lekol (ZEL), a student group in which he was active in 2000. This group, although not political, took a stance against Lavalasse, the party in power in Haiti at that time, based on a belief that elections, in 2000 were fraudulent. According to Clerge, two weeks after the December 2000 election, an armed group of proLavalasse militiamen, the \u201cChimere\u201d, fired upon the door\u2019to a ZEL meeting at which protests were being planned. The Chimere members stormed the room and beat several ZEL members; Clerge escaped and went into hiding. Clerge said that Chimere members went to his parents\u2019 home and threatened to harm his parents if they did not disclose Clerge\u2019s location.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">An alien may obtain asylum if he is a \u201crefugee\u201d: a person unwilling to return to his country of nationality \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), 1158(a)(1), (b)(1). To establish asylum eligibility, Clerge must show (1) past persecution (in this case on account of membership in a particular social group or political opinion), or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that his membership in the ZEL or his political opinion will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b)(1). A showing of past persecution creates a presumption of a \u201cwell founded fear\u201d of persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">But \u201c[a]n applicant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution if the applicant could avoid persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant\u2019s country of nationality ... if under all the circumstances it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(ii). And under the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the applicable statutes and regulations, an asylum applicant must show that he \u201cfacets] a threat of persecution country-wide.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. Office of U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1325 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Clerge failed to demonstrate asylum eligibility. Clerge submitted the statement of a fellow ZEL member, Frantz Saint Fleur, who had attended the December 2000 meeting with Clerge and who since had been hiding in another town. Clerge admitted that he was able to remain safely in Haiti for approximately one month after the incident; he also admitted that he would be able to live safely in the area of Haiti to which Saint Fleur had fled. And Clerge concedes that the Lavalasse party currently is not in power in Haiti. Clerge has not undermined facts supporting the BIA\u2019s determination that he could avoid persecution by relocating to another part of Haiti. <em>See Mazariegos, </em>241 F.3d at 1327-28 (upholding denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>asylum relief where facts supported BIA determination that applicant did not face \u201ca threat of persecution country-wide\u201d). We affirm the BIA\u2019s decision denying asylum relief and denying withholding of removal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b769-10\">. Clerge offers no substantive argument on the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"Aga\">This issue is abandoned. <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1286 n. 3 (llth Cir.2003) (deeming an issue waived where a party fails to include argument and only makes a passing reference to the order appealed from).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b771-17\">. Substantial evidence supports the BIA's determination that Clerge did not establish asylum eligibility: he offers no reason why he has met the higher standard for showing that the BIA's denial of withholding of removal was in error. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1292-93 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
