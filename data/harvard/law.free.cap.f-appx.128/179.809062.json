The Honorable Michael B. Mukasey, Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b206-17\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b206-18\">UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the District Court sentencing Doe to ten years\u2019 imprisonment be VACATED and REMANDED for resentencing by a district judge who has not previously dealt with this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-19\">Familiarity by the parties is assumed as to the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues. After review of the district court judgment of conviction, we now VACATE and REMAND.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-20\">Doe was convicted of two counts of making false statements on passport applications, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1542. The Presentence Report (PSR) recommended a term of six to twelve months of imprisonment. At the time of sentencing Doe had already been incarcerated for approximately eighteen months. Thus, the PSR recommended that Doe be sentenced to \u201ctime served\u201d and be released. Because Doe refused to divulge his true name, the district court upwardly departed to the statutory maximum of ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-21\">Under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its interpretation of 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>\u00a7 3742(e), we review sentencing for reasonableness. In light of the crime charged, the sentencing range recommended, Doe\u2019s lack of any provable criminal history,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the district court\u2019s inadequate balancing of these factors against the perceived threat posed by Doe, the ten year sentence was unreasonable. While vexing and, as the Government has argued, potentially obstructive of the administrative processes for enforcement of our immigration laws, we find that Doe\u2019s refusal to divulge his identity does not justify the sentence imposed upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">As to Doe\u2019s Fifth Amendment argument, we note that Doe did not raise a Fifth Amendment argument below. Indeed, Doe\u2019s counsel stated at Sentencing that, \u201cI don\u2019t think it unreasonable that the Court demand a person\u2019s identity so the Court can be in an adequate position to sentence them.\u201d Sentencing Transcript at 11. Accordingly, we review Doe\u2019s Fifth Amendment argument for plain error. The only fear of prosecution that Doe identified is deportation, which does not constitute criminal prosecution, and thus does not implicate the Fifth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Balsys, </em>524 U.S. 666, 671, 118 S.Ct. 2218, 141 L.Ed.2d 575 (1998). Moreover, Fifth Amendment jurisprudence regarding the right to withhold one\u2019s name is far from clear when applied to Doe\u2019s situation, rendering Doe unable to clear the hurdle presented by plain error review. <em>See, e.g., Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada, Humboldt County, </em>542 U.S. 177, 124 S.Ct. 2451, 2460-61, 159 L.Ed.2d 292 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court is hereby VACATED AND REMANDED for resentencing in accordance with this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b207-7\">. We note that while Doe has not divulged his name, his fingerprints have been checked by federal, New York State, and Jamaican authorities, all of whom indicate that Doe has no criminal history based on those fingerprint checks.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
