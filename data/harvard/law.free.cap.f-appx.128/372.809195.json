Before granting the award of attorney\u2019s fees, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Chief Joe Stewart, Lieutenant Jimmy Fried, Detective Mike Rowland, and Detective Michael Calloway and dismissed Hunter\u2019s claims of false arrest, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution against the defendants in their individual capacities. Pursuant to our judgment of this same date in <em>Hunter v. City of Monroe, </em>No. 04-30362, we affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and the dismissal of the aforementioned claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-16\">Before granting the defendants\u2019s summary judgment motion, the district court dismissed Hunter\u2019s claims of discrimination, retaliation, and negligence because they were prescribed, and it dismissed his claims against the City of Monroe and the remaining defendants in their official capacities for failure to state a claim. As Hunter does not address these claims in his appeal from the award of attorney\u2019s fees, he has not shown, at least with respect to the portion of fees relevant to those claims, that the district court\u2019s award was an abuse of discretion. Moreover, as he does not address the district court\u2019s finding that he made false allegations in his complaint, any argument with respect to that finding has been waived. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-17\">A district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Walker v. City of Bogalusa, </em>168 F.3d 237, 239 (5th Cir.1999); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. The court should award fees to a prevailing defendant only when the action was \u201cfrivolous, irresponsible, or without foundation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-18\">Hunter has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in granting attorney\u2019s fees with respect to those claims that were the subject of the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion. As the district court noted, his complaint contained false allegations and none of his remaining allegations demonstrated that probable cause was lacking for his arrest. Although we did conclude that Hunter\u2019s actions were too equivocal to support a conviction, our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>conclusion did not equate to a finding that there was no probable cause for Hunter\u2019s arrest. <em>See United States v. Hunter, </em>No. 99-30091, 1999 WL 1328065 (5th Cir. Dec. 13, 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">With respect to his malicious prosecution and conspiracy claims, Hunter did not state a prime facie case for either of those claims. <em>See Walker, </em>168 F.3d at 240. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees in favor of the defendants is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
