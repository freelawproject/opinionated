Admin. Office of the U.S. Courts, </em>No. AT-0752-03-0934-I-1 (M.S.P.B. July 12, 2004) (\u201cFinal Decision\u201d). Because the Board correctly concluded that Johnson did not come within any of the categories covered by the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511, we <em>affirm </em>the Board\u2019s dismissal of her appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-22\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b166-23\">Johnson began her employment at the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit as a Court Secretary. She was subsequently promoted to the position of Human Resources Coordinator in the Staff Attorneys\u2019 Office. On June 20, 2003, Johnson was notified of the termination of her position effective June 27, 2003. She filed an appeal of her termination with the Board. Shortly thereafter, she informed the Board that she wished to withdraw the appeal. Her appeal was dismissed on October 9, 2003. <em>See Johnson v. Admin. Office of the U.S. Courts, </em>No. AT-0752-03-0934-I-1 (M.S.P.B. October 9, 2003) (\u201cInitial Decision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>On November 6, 2003, Johnson filed a petition for review of the Initial Decision stating that she wished to reopen her case. The Board denied Johnson\u2019s petition for review, vacated the Initial Decision, and dismissed her appeal for lack of jurisdiction in its Final Decision. The Board noted that its jurisdiction was limited to \u201cemployees\u201d as defined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1) and that Johnson, as an employee of the Judicial Branch of the government, did not meet the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d under that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c), this court must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless it is: (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>Chase-Baker v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>198 F.3d 843, 845 (Fed.Cir.1999). Whether the Board has jurisdiction over an appeal is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. Hayes v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>390 F.3d 1373, 1376 (Fed.Cir.2004). The petitioner bears the burden of establishing reversible error in reviewing a decision of an administrative agency such as the Board. <em>Harris v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>142 F.3d 1463, 1467 (Fed.Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">The burden of establishing jurisdiction is placed by regulation on the appellant. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.56(a)(2)\u00a9 (2003); <em>McCormick v. Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, </em>307 F.3d 1339, 1340 (Fed.Cir.2002). The Board\u2019s jurisdiction is strictly limited to that provided by statute, rule, or regulation. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a) (2000); <em>Forest v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>47 F.3d 409, 410 (Fed.Cir. 1995). The Board has jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513 to hear appeals from removals. The Board\u2019s jurisdiction, however, is limited, and \u201cwith respect to adverse actions under section 7513, that jurisdiction only encompasses appeals by \u2018employees\u2019 as defined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1).\u201d <em>Hartman v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>77 F.3d 1378, 1380 (Fed.Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">The Board correctly identified three ways to meet the statutory definition of \u201cemployee\u201d as set forth in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1). Section 7511(a)(1) defines an employee, in relevant part, as: (1) an individual in the competitive service who has fulfilled the requisite length of service; (2) a preference eligible individual in the excepted service who has completed one year of current continuous service in the same or similar position in an Executive agency, the United States Postal Service, or the Postal Rate Commission; and (3) a non-preference individual in the excepted service who has completed two years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to two years or less. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(l)(A)-(C) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-14\">Johnson contends that the Board erred in defining and interpreting \u201ccompetitive service.\u201d We find no error in the Board\u2019s interpretation of \u201ccompetitive service.\u201d The term \u201ccompetitive service\u201d is defined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2102 as consisting of, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ccivil service positions not in the executive branch which are specifically included in the competitive service by statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2102(a)(2). The Petitioner has not cited and we have not found any statute that places her position in the competitive service.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Johnson also contends that the Board erred in interpreting \u201cexcepted service.\u201d Subject to a few exceptions not relevant here, the \u201cexcepted service\u201d consists of all civil service positions in an Executive agency. An Executive agency is defined as an \u201cExecutive department, a Government corporation, and an independent establishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 105. The Board correctly concluded, and Johnson does not dispute, that she was an employee of the Judicial Branch, and not an employee of an Executive agency of the federal government. Accordingly, we agree with the Board that Johnson does not meet the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Johnson finally contends that, because she alleged that her removal was based on discrimination, her case is a \u201cmixed case\u201d within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702. For the purpose of determining the Board\u2019s jurisdiction, the discrimination claims must be made with respect to a personnel action that is otherwise appealable to the Board. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7702(a); <em>Hartman, </em>77 F.3d at 1381. Since the Board lacks jurisdiction over personnel actions affecting employees of the Judicial Branch, the Board lacks jurisdiction to hear Johnson\u2019s discrimination claims as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Accordingly, the Board did not err as a matter of law in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to consider Johnson\u2019s petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
