Casey, <em>Judge) </em>granting the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendants-Appellees 772 Park Avenue Corp. and Brown Harris Stevens, and dismissing Aksamit\u2019s claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621 <em>et seq., </em>and the New York State Human Rights Law, N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7\u00a7 290 <em>et seq. </em>We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and determining whether the district court properly concluded that there were no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See, e.g., Miller v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, L.L.P., </em>321 F.3d 292, 300 (2d Cir.2003). In determining whether there are genuine issues of material fact, we are \u201crequired to resolve all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.\u201d <em>Terry v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 128, 137 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-14\">The District Court properly held that, even assuming Aksamit had satisfied the <em>de minimis </em>burden of establishing a <em>pri-ma facie </em>case of age discrimination, Ak-samit failed to offer evidence from which a rational factfinder could infer that Defendants\u2019 reasons for his discharge (excessive absences and poor work performance) were pretextual and that the real reason for his termination was age discrimination. Accordingly, summary judgment was properly awarded in favor of Defendants on Aksamit\u2019s ADEA and New York Human Rights Law claims, and Aksamit\u2019s complaint was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-15\">We have considered all of Plaintiff-Appellant\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
