Haynie appeals the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board dismissing his claim that he was improperly removed from employment by the Department of Veterans Affairs for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Haynie v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>CH315H040152-I-1, 96 M.S.P.R. 536, 2004 WL 1487363 (MSPB Jun. 24, 2004). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">We must affirm the board\u2019s decision to dismiss Haynie\u2019s appeal unless he establishes that the decision is: (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000). \u201cThe jurisdiction of the board is not plenary. Rather, it is limited to those matters specifically entrusted to it by statute or regulation.\u201d <em>Serrao v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>95 F.3d 1569, 1573 (Fed.Cir.1996); <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a). A petitioner has the burden of establishing board jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence and we review the board\u2019s decision <em>de novo. See Serrao, </em>95 F.3d at 1573.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">We agree with the board that it lacked jurisdiction to hear Haynie\u2019s appeal because he was a probationary employee. The board\u2019s jurisdiction to hear an employee\u2019s appeal of a removal is circumscribed by statute. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7511-7514, 4301-4305. Excluded from its jurisdiction are appeals concerning \u201cthe reduction in grade or removal of an employee ... who is serving a probationary or trial period....\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4303(f)(2). Haynie\u2019s allegations of discrimination must also be dismissed because he failed to establish board jurisdiction over his probationary termination. <em>See Synan v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>765 F.2d 1099, 1100-01 (Fed.Cir.1985).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
