To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Where, as here, the BIA affirms without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir.2003). We review the IJ\u2019s decision for substantial evidence. <em>Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 998 (9th Cir.2003). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-13\">Even if Gramajo could establish past persecution based on the beatings and threats to which he was subjected by the Guatemalan military, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that Gramajo no longer has a well-founded fear of future persecution by the Guatemalan authorities. <em>See id. </em>at 997; <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-14\">By failing to qualify for asylum, Gramajo necessarily failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Gonzalez-Hernandez, </em>336 F.3d at 1001 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-15\">The record also does not compel a finding that Gramajo is eligible for CAT relief because he did not show that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he would be tortured upon return, or that the torture would be inflicted \u201c \u2018at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1282 (9th Cir.2001) (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1) (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-16\">We are without jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination that Gramajo failed to establish that he ever registered for ABC benefits and was therefore not eligible for NACARA relief. <em>See </em>\u00a7 309(c)(5)(C)(ii) of IIRIRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-17\">Gramajo\u2019s streamlining challenge is foreclosed by <em>Garcia-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 1066, 1078 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-18\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741, 750 (9th Cir.2004), petitioner\u2019s motion for stay of removal included a timely re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>quest for stay of voluntary departure. Because the stay of removal was continued based on the government\u2019s filing of a notice of non-opposition, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, nunc pro tunc, as of the filing of the motion for stay of removal and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part, DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b43-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
