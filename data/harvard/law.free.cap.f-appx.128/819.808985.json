Hall, United States District Judge for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b845-21\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b845-22\">UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the District Court be and it hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-23\">Defendant-Appellant Aaron J. Celis, II (\u201cCelis\u201d) appeals from a judgment of conviction for making a false statement in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a)(2). On appeal, Celis contends that there was insufficient evidence to prove two of the elements of \u00a7 1001(a)(2): 1) that Celis\u2019s statement was false; and 2) that Celis\u2019s statement was material. We assume that the parties are familiar with the facts, the procedural history, and the scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-24\">A defendant challenging a conviction on sufficiency grounds \u201cbears a heavy burden.\u201d <em>United States v. Masotto, </em>73 F.3d 1233, 1241 (2d Cir.1996). The court must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>consider the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the government, crediting every inference that the jury might have drawn in favor of the government. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>335 F.3d 170, 180 (2d Cir.2003). Only where no rational trier of fact could have found that the defendant\u2019s guilt was established beyond a reasonable doubt will a defendant be able to prevail on a sufficiency challenge. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Payton, </em>159 F.3d 49, 55-56 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Celis cannot meet this standard. Viewed favorably to the government, the evidence introduced at trial proved: 1) that Celis has two felony convictions; 2) that Celis wrote \u201cN/A\u201d in response to a criminal history question on a security clearance form; 3) that Celis certified that his responses on the security clearance form were \u201ccorrect [and] without consequential omissions\u201d; and 4) that Celis would not have been granted security clearance, had he reported his convictions. This evidence was adequate to prove both the falsity of Celis\u2019s statement, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Mattox, </em>689 F.2d 531, 532-33 (5th Cir.1982), and the materiality of that statement. <em>See United States v. Whab, </em>355 F.3d 155, 163 (2d Cir.2004) (a false statement is material within the meaning of \u00a7 1001 if \u201cit has a \u2018natural tendency to influence, or is capable of influencing, the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed.\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 16, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">We have considered all of Celis\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
