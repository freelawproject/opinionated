RApp. P. 34(a); 10th Cir. R. 34.1.9. The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-25\">This is a <em>pro se </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 prisoner appeal. Defendant pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute fifty kilograms or more of marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C). He was sentenced to thirty-three months\u2019 incarceration followed by a three-year term of supervised release. Defendant did not appeal his conviction or sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-26\">In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Defendant claimed that his counsel was ineffective because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>failed to inform Defendant that his sentence could be increased because of his prior convictions. A claim for ineffective assistance of counsel requires Defendant to show that (1) his attorney\u2019s \u201cperformance was deficient ... [in that he] made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). A court need not address both prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test \u201cif [Defendant] fails to make a sufficient showing of one.\u201d <em>Cooks v. Ward, </em>165 F.3d 1283, 1292-93 (10th Cir.1998). The district court denied Defendant\u2019s motion holding that he failed to demonstrate prejudice as a result of his attorney\u2019s allegedly deficient performance. In addition, the district court denied Defendant\u2019s request for a certificate of ap-pealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Defendant has renewed his request for a certificate of appealability with this court. In order for us to grant this request, Defendant must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). To do so, he must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the [motion] should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Defendant\u2019s argument on appeal is exactly the same as that raised in the district court \u2014 that his attorney was constitutionally infirm because he failed to advise Defendant that his prior convictions could increase his sentence. The district court, relying on <em>Laycock v. New Mexico, </em>880 F.2d 1184, 1187 (10th Cir.1989), concluded that Defendant failed to establish prejudice because his allegations did not demonstrate a reasonable probability that he would have not pleaded guilty and insisted on going to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">We have carefully reviewed the briefs, the district court\u2019s disposition, the record on appeal, and the relevant law. For substantially the same reasons as articulated by the district court, we agree that Defendant\u2019s allegations do not establish \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s [alleged] errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>haycock, </em>880 F.2d at 1187. The <em>Slack v. McDaniel </em>standard has not been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">We DENY Defendant\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b751-17\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
