In his habeas petition, Ogrod challenges the calculation of his good conduct time (\u201cGCT\u201d) by the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d). For the following reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-27\">Ogrod is currently incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fort Dix, New Jersey, serving a federal sentence of 70 months for conspiracy to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>tribute a controlled substance. According to the BOP, Ogrod is eligible under the applicable statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b), to earn up to 274 days of GCT. The BOP\u2019s calculation is based on the time Ogrod will actually serve in prison, not on the 70 months of sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">After administratively challenging the BOP\u2019s calculation of his GCT, Ogrod filed a \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition in the District Court. In his habeas petition, Og-rod argues that the BOP\u2019s calculation of his GCT deprives him of the amount to which he is entitled by statute. Ogrod asserts that \u00a7 3624(b) allows him to earn up to 54 days per year based on the term of sentence imposed, not 54 days per year based on time actually served as the BOP\u2019s calculation provides. The District Court rejected Ogrod\u2019s position and dismissed his habeas petition, and subsequently denied his timely motion for reconsideration. Og-rod appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">We will affirm the District Court\u2019s order. While Ogrod\u2019s appeal was pending, we resolved the issue in <em>O\u2019Donald v. Johns, </em>402 F.3d 172 (3d Cir.2005). In <em>O\u2019Donald, </em>we held that the meaning of \u00a7 3624(b) is ambiguous and thus deferred to the BOP\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the statute. <em>See O\u2019Donald, </em>402 F.3d 172, 474. Ogrod\u2019s challenge, identical to the one raised and rejected in <em>O\u2019Donald, </em>is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">In short, for the reasons described in <em>O\u2019Donald, </em>the District Court properly rejected Ogrod\u2019s challenge to the BOP\u2019s calculation of his GCT. Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order dismissing his habeas corpus petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-9\">. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a). We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its findings of fact. <em>See Ruggiano v. Reish, </em>307 F.3d 121, 126 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
