The crux of McAllister\u2019s Complaint is that the defendants violated his federal constitutional rights through various actions taken and orders entered in a child-custody litigation between McAl-lister and his ex-wife. McAllister sought damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Defendant Bufalini filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (6). By Order entered July 1, 2004, the District Court granted Bufalini\u2019s motion, and also dismissed the claims as to the remaining defendants <em>sua sponte. </em>The District Court concluded that abstention was warranted under <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1977), insofar as the child-custody litigation remained on-going. The District Court concluded, moreover, that it lacked jurisdiction pursuant to the <em>Rooker-Feld-man </em>doctrine, as the issues presented are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state court adjudication.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finally, the District Court determined that even if it had jurisdiction, the defendants are entitled to a finding of absolute judicial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">McAllister timely filed this appeal. We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because we find no error in the dismissal under <em>Rooker-Feldman, </em>we do not reach the District Court\u2019s alternative rulings. Our review of a dismissal for want of jurisdiction under <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>is plenary. <em>Gulla v. North Strabane Tp., </em>146 F.3d 168, 171 (3d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">\u201c[T]he fundamental principle of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine [is] that a federal district court may not sit as an appellate court to adjudicate appeals of state court proceedings.\u201d <em>Port Auth. Police Benevolent Assoc., Inc. v. Port Auth. of N.Y. and N.J. Police Dep\u2019t, </em>973 F.2d 169, 179 (3d Cir.1992). Here, although couched as an action against the named defendants for damages, McAllister plainly seeks to void or overturn adverse rulings entered in the child-custody litigation by the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas. The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine \u201cprohibits District Courts from adjudicating actions in which the relief requested requires determining whether the state court\u2019s decision is wrong or voiding the state court\u2019s ruling.\u201d <em>Desi\u2019s Pizza, Inc. v. City of Wilkes-Barre, </em>321 F.3d 411, 419 (3d Cir.2003). Stated another way, <em>\u201cRooker-Feldman </em>does not allow a plaintiff to seek relief that, if granted, would prevent a state court from enforcing its orders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-11\">The relief McAllister seeks can only be predicated upon a finding that the state court has made incorrect factual and legal determinations in entering its orders. Indeed, McAllister\u2019s sole focus on this appeal is to challenge orders entered by the state court and to question that court\u2019s jurisdiction. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 2-4. As such, the District Court properly declined to exercise jurisdiction over McAllister\u2019s Complaint. Finally, we note that because <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>concerns a federal court\u2019s power to hear a case, the District Court properly raise the issue on its own motion. <em>See, e.g., Johnson v. City of Shorewood, Minnesota, </em>360 F.3d 810, 818 (8th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-12\">For these reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b928-7\">. <em>See District of Columbia Court of Appeals v.
