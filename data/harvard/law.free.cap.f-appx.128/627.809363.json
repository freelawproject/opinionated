Cruz contends that the district court erred in imposing consecutive sentences because the terms of supervised release, on which the sentence is based, were ordered to run concurrently. In addition, Cruz maintains that the district court cannot sentence him to more than twenty-four months in prison following revocation of his supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8583(e)(3) (providing a maximum prison term of two years where the district court revokes and terminates supervised release for a Class C or D felony). We review <em>de novo </em>the legality of a guideline sentence. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>176 F.3d 1175, 1176 (9th Cir. 1999). For the reasons stated below, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">A district court may impose consecutive sentences after the revocation of supervised release, even if the terms of supervised release were originally ordered to run concurrently. <em>See id. </em>at 1177; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584 (affording a district court discretion to impose consecutive sentences). Section 5G1.2(d) allows district courts to \u201cstack\u201d (or run consecutively) sentences where the maximum statutory sentence for one count is less than the total punishment allowed by the offense level. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 5G1.2(d); <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558, 570 (9th Cir.2002). In this case, the total punishment allowed by Cruz\u2019s offense level was thirty to thirty-seven months. Thus, the district court was permitted to stack one twenty-four month sentence with the other twenty-four month sentence (discounted to twelve months) to achieve a thirty-six month sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">Further, because Cruz\u2019s sentence is not a correction or modification of an \u201carithmetical, technical, or other clear error,\u201d it does not violate Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b653-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
