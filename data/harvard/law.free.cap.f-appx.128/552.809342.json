While Smith was on supervised release he was charged with violating its conditions by committing another crime, possessing and using a controlled substance, unlawfully using a controlled substance, and failing to report to the probation officer or to participate in treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-19\">Shurn moved to dismiss the violation charges, citing <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and arguing that his supervised release term was an integral part of an unconstitutional guideline sentencing system. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied the motion to dismiss at the revocation hearing. It observed that the sentencing guidelines relating to supervised release are only advisory and found that Shurn had violated the conditions of his supervised release. The evidence showed that Shurn had \u201creturned to his old ways\u201d said the court, and he had not complied with even the basic conditions of his supervised release. The district court revoked his release and sentenced him to 24 months after stating that a sentence at the low end of the advisory range of 18 to 24 months would be inappropriate. Shurn appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-20\">Shurn cites <em>Blakely </em>to support his argument that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated because his revocation sentence was based upon facts that were not found by a jury and not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. He also contends that his sentence is unreasonable because the court applied the federal sentencing guidelines without considering the factors set out at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) as required by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The government responds that there is no Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial in a supervised release revocation proceeding and contends that neither <em>Blakely </em>nor <em>Booker </em>impact Shurn\u2019s revocation sentence. Chapter 7 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual merely con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>tains advisory and nonbinding policy statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">The Supreme Court has never recognized a Sixth Amendment right to have a jury determine the facts relevant to the revocation of supervised release. <em>See Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 480, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972) (revocation of parole is not part of criminal prosecution). Moreover, Chapter 7 has always been considered advisory, long before <em>Booker </em>made the entire guidelines advisory. <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>400 F.3d 591, 592-93 (8th Cir.2005) (finding no error in district court\u2019s consultation of guidelines in determining revocation sentence); <em>see United States v. Cotton, </em>399 F.3d 913, 916 (8th Cir.2005) (policy statements regarding revocation of supervised release are not binding on the court). The district court observed that the guidelines were advisory and considered the facts and circumstances of the case, and we conclude that the sentence imposed was not unreasonable. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-16\">.
