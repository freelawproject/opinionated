In 1995, Newsome was convicted in the United States District Court for the District of West Virginia of possession with intent to distribute and the distribution of cocaine base. In 1996, the Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>Circuit affirmed the judgment of conviction. Newsome moved in the United States District Court for the District of West Virginia for collateral relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">In 2002, while incarcerated at the Ray Brook Federal Correctional Institution, Newsome applied to the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York for collateral relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 on the grounds that his sentence was unconstitutional under <em>Ap-prendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The district court dismissed the petition. New-some appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2241 petition <em>de novo. Maldonado v. Scully, </em>86 F.3d 32, 35 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The district court properly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain the petition because Newsome was not challenging the execution of his sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Cephas v. Nash, </em>328 F.3d 98, 103 (2d Cir.2003); <em>Jiminian v. Nash, </em>245 F.3d 144, 146 (2d Cir.2001). While a prisoner may challenge the validity of his sentence or conviction under section 2241 in cases where section 2255 provides an \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d remedy, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Jiminian, </em>245 F.3d at 146, section 2255 is not \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d here.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">\u201c[Section] 2255 may be inadequate or ineffective in circumstances in which \u2018the petitioner cannot, for whatever reason, utilize \u00a7 2255, and in which the failure to allow for collateral review would raise serious constitutional questions.\u2019\u201d <em>Jiminian, </em>245 F.3d at 147 (quoting <em>Triestman v. United States, </em>124 F.3d 361, 377 (2d Cir. 1997)). Although section 2255 is not available to Newsome because he previously filed a section 2255 petition and his claims do not satisfy AEDPA\u2019s gate-keeping requirements for second or successive section 2255 petitions, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Jiminian, </em>245 F.3d at 146-47, we have previously held \u201cthat no \u2018serious constitutional question\u2019 is raised by confining [petitioner]^ <em>Apprendi </em>challenge to a section 2255 motion with its attendant gatekeeping provisions rather than permitting him to bring it as a section 2241 petition free of such limitations.\u201d <em>Love v. Menifee, </em>333 F.3d 69, 73 (2d Cir.2003); <em>see also Jimini-an, </em>245 F.3d at 147. Accordingly, petitioner cannot avail himself of section 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">Newsome also asserted a claim of actual innocence based on the court\u2019s finding the quantity of the drugs at issue. Newsome claimed that the court thereby constructively amended the indictment. Newsome claims that he is innocent of the resulting amended charge. Newsome does not assert that he was innocent of the crime as it was actually charged. His claim that the judge impermissibly made factual findings goes to the validity of his sentence, and does not provide a basis for challenging his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
