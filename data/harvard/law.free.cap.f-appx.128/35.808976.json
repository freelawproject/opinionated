He contends that the use of his 1986 felony convictions to enhance his current sentence violated his right to due process because the prior convictions were the result of an unknowing and involuntary guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">In <em>Lackawanna County v. Coss, </em>532 U.S. 394, 121 S.Ct. 1567, 149 L.Ed.2d 608 (2001), the Supreme Court addressed this issue and specifically held that once a prior state conviction is no longer open to direct or collateral attack in its own right, a defendant \u201cmay not challenge the enhanced sentence through a petition under \u00a7 2254 on the ground that the prior conviction was unconstitutionally obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 404,121 S.Ct. 1567. The Court held that with the exception of convictions obtained in violation of the right to counsel, a defendant has no right to bring such a challenge. <em>Id.; see Daniels v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 374, 376, 121 S.Ct. 1578, 149 L.Ed.2d 590 (2001); <em>Custis v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 485, 487, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">McGowan\u2019s argument that his counsel performance was \u201cthe equivalent of having no attorney at all\u201d is unavailing. There is no dispute that McGowan was represented in the prior proceeding. McGowan\u2019s attempt to characterize his claim to fit within this exception cannot hide the fact that this is a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See, e.g., Lackawanna County, </em>532 U.S. at 404, 121 S.Ct. 1567 (recognizing that \u201cfailure to appoint counsel ... will generally appear from the judgment roll itself, or from an accompanying minute order\u201d (quoting <em>Custis, </em>511 U.S. at 496, 114 S.Ct. 1732 (internal quotations omitted))).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">McGowan\u2019s argument that he falls under a \u201cfaultless exception\u201d is similarly unavailing. In both <em>Daniels </em>and <em>Lackawanna County, </em>Justice O\u2019Connor, writing for a plurality of the Court, recognized that \u201cthere may be rare cases in which no channel of review was actually available to a defendant with respect to a prior conviction, due to no fault of his own.\u201d <em>Daniels, </em>532 U.S. at 383, 121 S.Ct. 1578; <em>see Lackawanna County, </em>532 U.S. at 405, 121 S.Ct. 1567. Even if we were to recognize a faultless exception, however, McGowan would not qualify. In both cases, Justice O\u2019Connor discussed the two situations where she envisioned the exception applying: (1) where a state court, without justification, refuses to rule on a constitutional claim that has been properly presented; and (2) where after the time for direct or collateral review has expired, a defendant may obtain compelling evidence that he is actually innocent of the crime for which he was convicted, and which he could not have uncovered in a timely manner. <em>Id. </em>McGowan\u2019s claim fits into neither of these situations. The state court did not refuse to rule on a constitutional claim properly presented, and McGowan makes no claim that he is actually innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b61-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
