Pursuant to Rule 25(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Attorney General Gonzales was substituted for former Attorney General John Ashcroft as defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b838-4\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">On May 10, 2001, Immigration Judge (IJ) Paul A. De Fonzo held a hearing on Petitioner Ard\u00edan Urita\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of deportation, relief under the Convention Against Torture, and voluntary departure. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s ruling on September 6, 2002. Urita petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Urita argues that the BIA\u2019s streamlined review procedures violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This argument is squarely foreclosed by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Yu Sheng Zhang v. DOJ, </em>362 F.3d 155 (2d Cir.2004) (per curiam). In his statement of issues, Urita also states that the streamlined procedures violate the Equal Protection Clause. As an initial matter, Urita does not mention equal protection in the argument section of his brief. He therefore has waived this argument on appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 28; <em>Frank v. United States, </em>78 F.3d 815, 833-34 (2d Cir.1996). Second, this argument has no merit. The affirmance without opinion procedure applies to all applicants equally. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(a)(7) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">In addition, Urita argues that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence. Urita has waived this argument by not complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28. Under the rule, the appellant\u2019s argument may not be a \u201cdoctrinal recapitulation masquerading as a legal argument.\u201d <em>Sioson v. Knights of Columbus, </em>303 F.3d 458, 460 (2d Cir.2002) (per curiam). Rather, the argument section must advance the appellant\u2019s \u201ccontentions by connecting law to facts.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Frank, </em>78 F.3d at 833. Urita discusses his substantial evidence claim in two places in his argument section. First, he presents a paragraph discussing the law regarding the substantial evidence standard. Second, Urita addresses his substantial evidence claim in two pages at the end of his argument. He does not cite to the record at any point during this discussion, and merely asserts his own conclusions about the evidence. Because he did not \u201cconnect! ] law to facts,\u201d <em>Sioson, </em>303 F.3d at 460, Urita has failed to put forth an argument on his substantial evidence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">In any event, Urita\u2019s substantial evidence argument has no merit. In making an adverse credibility determination, the IJ carefully considered the discrepancies in the evidence before him and Urita\u2019s proffered reasons for those discrepancies. The IJ found that, taking into account Urita\u2019s explanations for the inconsistencies, Urita was not believable. We review this determination to ensure that it is based \u201cupon neither a misstatement of the facts in the record nor bald speculation or caprice.\u201d <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004). We may not hypothesize excuses for the inconsistencies, as long as the IJ\u2019s findings were rational. <em>Id. </em>Upon review of the record, we find no fault with the IJ\u2019s determination that the many inconsistencies between Urita\u2019s testimony and written application and his failure to provide available corroborating evidence rendered him not credible. Nor do we fault the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Urita\u2019s explanation for these discrepancies was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
