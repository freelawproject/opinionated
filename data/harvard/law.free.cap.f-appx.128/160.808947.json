Hart (\u201cHart\u201d) appeals from a judgment entered after a jury verdict denying him relief under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a), for his sexual harassment claim, alleging various trial errors. Hart also appeals from the prior dismissal of his other claims. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-14\">Hart, who was represented by counsel at trial, did not object to the alleged trial errors. Accordingly, our review is only for plain error. <em>Microfinan-cial, Inc. v. Premier Holidays Intl, Inc., </em>385 F.3d 72, 81 (1st Cir.2004). Hart first argues that the court erred by allowing defendant Verizon Communications, Inc. (\u201cVerizon\u201d) to introduce evidence of Hart\u2019s conviction for operating a motor vehicle under the influence (\u201cOUI\u201d). In response to Hart\u2019s pre-trial motion to preclude use of this conviction, the court had initially limited Verizon\u2019s cross-examination to the facts of his OUI arrest and prohibited Verizon from eliciting the fact of his conviction. In response to questions about his arrest, however, Hart volunteered that a juror had told him \u201cYou have grounds for a mistrial.\u201d Hart later said that the arrest was upsetting but the trial \u201cwas vindication for me after what happened.\u201d The court then permitted Verizon to inquire into the result of that trial, without objection from Hart\u2019s counsel. Because Hart opened the door to the actual result of his OUI trial, the court did not err in allowing the inquiry into his conviction. <em>See, e.g., Beck v. Haik, </em>377 F.3d 624, 642 (6th Cir. 2004) (holding that testimony of drowning victim\u2019s mother that victim \u201cwasn\u2019t convicted\u201d when asked on cross-examination in civil rights action whether he had ever gotten into trouble opened door to question regarding whether victim had ever gone to prison). Hart also argues that the court erred by allowing evidence of a prior conviction for contempt. Verizon, however, never offered evidence of that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-17\">Hart next argues that the court erred by excluding the testimony and/or affidavits of certain present and former Verizon employees. Hart never called any of them as witnesses or sought to intro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>duce any of their affidavits. Accordingly, there was no error. <em>See, e.g., Andrews v. Bechtel Power Corp., </em>780 F.2d 124, 140 (1st Cir.1985) (noting that claim of error cannot be predicated upon evidence which is never actually offered to court).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Hart further argues that the court erred in allowing an improper comment by the court\u2019s clerk. There is no record of this comment in the trial transcript. Nor did Hart ever bring it to the district court\u2019s attention. Thus, the court could not have erred in failing to address an allegation articulated for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Hart also argues that the court violated his due process rights by dismissing his other claims prior to trial without holding a hearing, despite his request for oral argument. Hart contends that he should have been afforded a hearing because he was proceeding <em>pro se </em>at the time. <em>A pro se </em>plaintiff is not automatically entitled to a hearing. Here, Hart presented his position in writing in his opposition to defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, and, more importantly, has not pointed to any relevant factual question or legal theory that he was precluded from bringing to the court\u2019s attention by lack of a hearing. Thus, this claim has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\"> We add a few comments. Hart\u2019s brief makes vague, fragmentary and passing references to some other claims. We need not consider them. <em>See United States v. Zannino, </em>895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (noting that issues raised in perfunctory manner are deemed waived). Also, Hart attaches to his brief a court order dismissing a second action against Verizon. This action was filed while the present case against Verizon was pending and dismissed on <em>res judicata </em>grounds after final judgment had entered in this ease. Hart appealed from the dismissal of the second action, but the appeal was dismissed after he failed to file an opening brief. While Hart appears to be seeking a second bite at the apple, that second action is not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Hart\u2019s motion for oral argument is <em>denied.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">The judgment of the district court is summarily <em>affirmed. See </em>Loe. R. 27(c).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-15\">. We do not address defendants\u2019 separate contention that Hart\u2019s appeal fails because of his brief's flagrant failure to comply with the procedural requirements of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. A <em>pro se </em>party is not insulated from complying with those rules. <em>Ahmed v. Rosenblatt, </em>118 F.3d 886, 890 (1st Cir. 1997). Because Hart\u2019s appeal lacks substantive merit, we elect to proceed on that basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
