He argues that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his complaint with prejudice as his original complaint was not deficient and complied with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the general rules of pleading. We need not decide the issue, however, because the district court determined in the alternative that Fields\u2019s complaint should be dismissed as his claims were barred by <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 648, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997). Because Fields\u2019s claims would necessarily imply the invalidity of the prison disciplinary action if successful, the district court did not err in determining that the claims were barred by <em>Edwards. </em>Therefore, the court AFFIRMS the district court\u2019s judgment on this ground. <em>See Esteves v. Brock, </em>106 F.3d 674, 676 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Sojourner T v. Edwards, </em>974 F.2d 27, 30 (5th Cir.1992). The district court, however, should have dismissed Fields\u2019s complaint without prejudice to his right to refile the complaint in the future if his disciplinary case is reversed or declared invalid. <em>See Clarke v. Stalder, </em>154 F.3d 186, 189 (5th Cir.1998) (en banc). As a result, the court MODIFIES the district court\u2019s judgment to reflect that the dismissal is without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
