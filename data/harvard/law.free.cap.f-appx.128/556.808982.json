At sentencing Taylor objected to the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> enhancement of Taylor\u2019s offense level based on a finding that Taylor had engaged in a \u201cpattern of activity\u201d involving sexual conduct with minors. The district court overruled the objection and sentenced Taylor to 188 months imprisonment and three years supervised release. On appeal, Taylor argues the district court erred, in violation of <em>Blakely, </em>by enhancing his offense level based <em>on </em>a finding that he had engaged in a pattern of activity. We find no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b583-20\">The government charged Taylor in a two-count indictment with sexually exploiting a minor. Count I charged that between March 1, 2003 and April 15, 2003 Taylor videotaped three minors as they engaged in sexual activity. Count II alleged that on another occasion during this same period, Taylor videotaped himself and one of the three minors engaging in sexual activity. In each instance, Taylor used a camcorder that traveled in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-21\">Taylor pled guilty to the charges pursuant to a plea agreement. In the plea agreement, Taylor agreed not to appeal the sentence if it was consistent with the plea agreement. The presentence investigation report recommended an enhancement to Taylor\u2019s offense level, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Taylor engaged in a \u201cpattern of activity\u201d involving sexual conduct with minors. Taylor objected to the presentence investigation report\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">At sentencing, the district court overruled Taylor\u2019s objection, enhanced his offense level based on the finding that he engaged in a \u201cpattern of activity\u201d involving sexual conduct with minors, and sentenced him to concurrent sentences of 188 months imprisonment on both counts, to be followed by three years supervised release. Taylor filed a timely notice of appeal. The government filed a motion to dismiss the appeal. This court ordered the motion would be taken with the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">We reject the motion to dismiss, notwithstanding the waiver of Taylor\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim, as we can review the sentence for unreasonableness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (Breyer, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">Here, the statutory maximum for each of Taylor\u2019s charged counts is twenty years (the statutory minimum for each count is ten years). The district court sentenced Taylor to fifteen years and eight months for each count and ordered the sentences to be served concurrently. The district court did not exceed the statutory maximum, and the district court sentenced Taylor to the middle of the enhanced guideline range. In addition, Taylor admitted to all of the facts that the district court used to enhance Taylor\u2019s offense level. We conclude that Taylor\u2019s sentence was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b584-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-14\">. The Honorable Rodney W. Sippel, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b584-10\">. We do not dismiss the appeal based on Taylor\u2019s appeal waiver in the plea agreement, because we may address whether Taylor\u2019s sentence was unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Killgo, </em>397 F.3d 628, 630 n. 4 (8th Cir. 2005) (stating \u201d[w]hile Killgo\u2019s appeal waiver is sufficient to bar his Sixth Amendment claim, we recognize that it did not waive the application of a constitutional standard of review on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
