Kimble seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing some Defendants in his civil action based upon the Rooker-Feldman<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> doctrine and res judica-ta and transferring the remaining claims to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We dismiss in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-26\">Kimble challenges the district court\u2019s decision to transfer some claims to a district court outside this circuit. This court may exercise jurisdiction only over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The transfer order Kimble seeks to appeal is neither a final order nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order. <em>See In re Carefirst of Md., Inc., </em>305 F.3d 253, 256, 262 (4th Cir.2002). Accordingly, we dismiss this portion of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">Kimble also asserts that the district court erred in dismissing some Defendants pursuant to the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. We agree. After the district court issued its decision, the Supreme Court held that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine does not deprive a federal district court of subject matter jurisdiction over a suit involving issues similar to those raised in pending state court litigation. <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus., Corp., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (No. 03-1696). In light of <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. </em>and the fact that foreclosure proceedings against Kimble are pending in the state courts of Pennsylvania, we vacate this portion of the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1011-15\">. <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals v.

Because Kimble has not challenged in his informal brief the disposition of his claims based upon res judicata, he has waived appellate review of that issue. 4th Cir.
