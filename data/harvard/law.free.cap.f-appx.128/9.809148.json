We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we review the IJ\u2019s order as the final agency determination. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir.2003). We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir.2002), and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-20\">Although Arzumanyan failed to address the adverse credibility determination in his opening brief, we nevertheless reach the issue \u201cbecause the government briefed it, and thus suffers no prejudice from [Arzu-manyan\u2019s] failure to raise the issue.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number><em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1152, 1157 n. 3 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination because Arzumanyan\u2019s testimony regarding whether a controversial film produced by Arzumanyan was indeed broadcast on national television was materially inconsistent with his asylum application, <em>see Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1151-52 (9th Cir.1999), and his testimony concerning his alleged second detention was internally inconsistent, see id. Moreover, substantial evidence supports the adverse credibility finding based on the implausibility of Arzumanyan\u2019s testimony, see <em>id. </em>at 1152-53, and a key omission in his application regarding an alleged second encounter with government officials, <em>see Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004) (affirming adverse credibility determination based, in part, on key omissions from asylum applications).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Because Arzumanyan failed to prove eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Arzumanyan also failed to establish eligibility for CAT relief because he did not show it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if he returned to Armenia. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2); <em>Farah, </em>348 F.3d at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b36-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
