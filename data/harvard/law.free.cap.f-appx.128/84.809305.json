KELLY, JR., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b110-38\">Yoni Orlando Rios-Romero, a federal inmate appearing pro se, seeks to appeal from the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>motion to vacate, set aside or correct his sentence. Because we determine that Mr. Rios-Romero has not made a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000), we deny a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The parties are familiar with the facts, and we need not restate them here. Mr. Rios-Romero claims that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to certain convictions used to calculate his criminal history category. We do not think that the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Rios-Romero had not met his burden of demonstrating deficient performance or prejudice is reasonably debatable. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). One challenged conviction was in fact not used to calculate his criminal history, and the other was apparently valid, notwithstanding Mr. Rios-Romero\u2019s mere assertion that it had been dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">We DENY a COA and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
