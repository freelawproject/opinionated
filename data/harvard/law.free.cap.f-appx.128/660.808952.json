We have jurisdiction under former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). <em>See Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997). We review the denial of a motion to reconsider or reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-24\">The BIA properly denied Buckley\u2019s motion to reconsider its decision denying his motion to reopen due to ineffective assistance of counsel, because Buckley failed to show the BIA erred in concluding that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s conduct. <em>See id. </em>at 901-03. Buckley has failed to challenge any other aspect of the BIA\u2019s June 18, 2003 decision, and therefore has waived the issues. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir.1996). Furthermore, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of his request to reopen his deportation proceedings <em>sua sponte. See Abassi v. INS, </em>305 F.3d 1028, 1032 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">To the extent Buckley challenges the BIA\u2019s denial of his first motion to reopen or the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial of suspension of deportation, we dismiss the petition because Buckley did not timely seek review of those decisions. <em>See Martinez-Serrano, </em>94 F.3d at 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b686-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
