Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Serv., </em>SF07520105471-3 (MSPB Mar. 11, 2004). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-21\">An administrative judge affirmed Stephens\u2019 removal in an initial decision that, if not appealed to the full board, would have become the final decision of the board on April 3, 2003. Stephens requested and received four extensions of this filing deadline. On May 19, 2003, the new filing deadline, Stephens requested a fifth extension. The board refused and Stephens\u2019 petition was deemed untimely. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(e)(1), Stephens request<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>ed that the board waive the filing deadline. In support of her request, she claimed that several family emergencies, as well as the complexity of the charges against her, prevented her from timely filing. In response, the board held that Stephens\u2019 family difficulties, while burdensome, did not justify waiving the deadline. The board also noted that Stephens should have addressed the agency\u2019s charges against her in the initial appeal, not in the petition seeking review before the full board. We cannot say that the board abused its discretion, or that its decision was otherwise arbitrary or not in accordance with law. <em>See Phillips v. United States Postal Serv., </em>695 F.2d 1389, 1390 (Fed.Cir.1982).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
