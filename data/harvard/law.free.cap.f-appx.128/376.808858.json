(\u201cKossman\u201d) sued De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>fendant-Appellee City of Houston (\u201cthe City\u201d) under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983. Kossman alleged that the City\u2019s \u201cuse of race and gender quotas in public contracting is an unconstitutional use of government power.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Kossman filed its first motion for a temporary restraining order (\u201cTRO\u201d) and preliminary injunction in October 1997. In September 1999, Kossman filed a supplement to its first motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction, subsequently filing three further motions seeking a TRO and preliminary injunction in, respectively, February 2000, July 2000, and October 2000. The district court summarily denied each of these motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">In June 2002, Kossman filed a \u201cRenewed Motion for Summary Judgment and Preliminary Injunction\u201d (\u201cRenewed Motion\u201d), in which it asked the district court to enjoin the City\u2019s \u201cillegal contracting preferences based on race, ethnicity, and sex.\u201d The Renewed Motion lists the City\u2019s responses to Kossman\u2019s requests for admission and federal court cases that have held similar city quotas unconstitutional; however, it fails to mention the legal requirements for a preliminary injunction. Neither does the Renewed Motion contain a legal argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">In December 2003, Kossman filed a \u201cFourth Supplement to Motion for Summary Judgment,\u201d in which it described the Supreme Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Gratz v. Bol-linger</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Grutter v. Bollinger</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and asked for \u201can immediate order striking\u201d the City\u2019s quota system.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court summarily denied Kossman\u2019s Renewed Motion and the fourth supplement to its summary judgment motion in a single sentence. It is from this denial that Kossman appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-15\">The first \u2014 and last \u2014 issue in this appeal is whether we have appellate jurisdiction. The City asserts that we lack appellate jurisdiction because Kossman\u2019s appeal is untimely. Specifically, the City argues that, because Kossman\u2019s Renewed Motion seeks the same relief on the same facts as its four previous motions, Kossman had to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of its first motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction to have been timely. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-16\">Although the denial of a request for a preliminary injunction is immediately ap-pealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rule 4(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure requires that \u201cthe notice of appeal ... be filed ... within 30 days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cAn appeal from an order denying a successive motion for a preliminary injunction, where the motion is simply the same as the earlier motion, is untimely under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1) unless the notice of appeal was filed within thirty days of the original denial.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Koss-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>man\u2019s Renewed Motion is dearly a successive motion that presents the same factual and legal bases as its previous motions. Accordingly, because the district court denied Kossman\u2019s first motion for a TRO and a preliminary injunction on October 21, 1997, Kossman only had until November 21, 1997 to appeal that denial, which it failed to do. The instant appeal is thus untimely, and, absent some applicable exception, we lack appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Kossman points out \u2014 correctly \u2014 that there \u201cis an exception to the general rule against appealing from a successive motion if there are changed circumstances, new evidence, or a change in the law.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Koss-man argues that this exception applies because it \u201cappealed the denial of its Motion for Summary Judgment and Preliminary Injunction filed <em>after </em>the release on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gratz </em>... and <em>Grutter,\u201d </em>which \u201cclarified the standard for what constitutes a compelling interest sufficient to justify the use of racial classifications by the government....\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We conclude that this exception does not apply to the instant situation. As counsel for Koss-man admitted at oral argument \u2014 and in its brief \u2014 the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Gratz </em>and <em>Grutter </em>opinions are no more than a clarification of existing law, which was either known to or determinable by Kossman when it filed its first motion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As such, the <em>Gratz </em>and <em>Grutter </em>opinions do not constitute a change in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Neither do we conclude that the City\u2019s responses to Kossman\u2019s requests for admission worked a change in the facts or circumstances of the case. Were we to hold that discovery responses effect a change in facts or circumstances, a party could file a successive motion each time it received a discovery response, thereby frustrating \u201cthe policy of Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, which requires in the interests of efficiency and finality that a timely appeal be filed.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The factual and legal bases on which Koss-man grounded its Renewed Motion are indistinguishable from those offered in its first motion. Accordingly, the exception does not apply. Kossman\u2019s appeal is untimely, and we lack appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">DISMISSED FOR LACK OF APPELLATE JURISDICTION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b402-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
