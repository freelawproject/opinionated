Holderfield petitions for review of the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board dismissing her Individual Right of Action (\u201cIRA\u201d) appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Holderfield v. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, </em>No. AT-1221-01-0306-M-1, 96 M.S.P.R. 274, 2004 WL 1152819 (M.S.P.B. May 14, 2004) <em>(\u201cHolderfield III\u201d). </em>We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Betty J. Holderfield is a revenue agent at the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s (\u201cIRS\u2019s\u201d) Dalton, Georgia facility. On January 18, 2001, Holderfield filed an IRA appeal at the Board alleging that a variety of adverse personnel actions were taken in retaliation for her disclosure of favoritism by her former supervisor, Susan A. Chambers, to Chambers\u2019s IRS subordinate and live-in companion Mary Sexton. On October 18, 1999, prior to the appeal to the Board, Holderfield also filed the first of three grievances alleging that Chambers had acted unlawfully in, <em>inter alia, </em>failing to promote her and giving her unfair performance appraisals. All three grievances were settled on July 13, 2000, with Holder-field achieving, among other things, removal of all performance appraisals by Chambers from her employee file, restoration of ratings given by her former supervisor, and a temporary promotion that could later be made permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">The Administrative Judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) of the Board dismissed Holderfield\u2019s whistleblower IRA for lack of jurisdiction on the ground of failure to demonstrate that the agency had taken any retaliatory \u201cpersonnel actions\u201d against her pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a)(2). <em>Holderfield v. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, </em>No. AT-1221-01-0306W-1, slip op. at 2, 7 (M.S.P.B. Feb. 16, 2001). The Board denied Holderfield\u2019s petition for review of the AJ\u2019s decision rendering that decision final. <em>Holderfield v. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, </em>No. AT-1221-01-0306-W-1, 92 M.S.P.R. 227, 2002 WL 1377912 (M.S.P.B. June 21, 2002) <em>(\u201cHolderfield I\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">Holderfield appealed from the Board\u2019s decision in <em>Holderfield I </em>to this court. <em>Holderfield v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>326 F.3d 1207 (Fed.Cir.2003) <em>(\u201cHolderfield II\u201d). </em>In <em>Holderfield II, </em>we reviewed the AJ\u2019s analysis concerning whether the agency had taken retaliatory \u201cpersonnel actions\u201d against Holderfield. Although we agreed with the AJ that two of Holder-field\u2019s allegations had been resolved in the prior grievance procedure, we also noted that the AJ failed to consider whether the remaining allegations constituted \u201cpersonnel actions\u201d under \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A)(xi) relating to a \u201csignificant change in ... working conditions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1209-10. Accordingly, we vacated in part, affirmed in part, and remanded the case to the Board with instructions to determine whether Holderfield\u2019s allegations of personnel action amounted to a \u201csignificant\u201d change as required by \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A)(xi). <em>Id. </em>We also instructed the Board to consider whether the allegations are precluded from being the basis of an IRA by election of a grievance procedure. <em>Id. </em>at 1209.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>On remand, the AJ ordered the parties to specifically reference documents in the record relating to personnel actions constituting a \u201csignificant change in ... working conditions\u201d under section 2302(a)(2)(A)(xi) that were not addressed in the prior grievance procedure. <em>Holderfield v. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, </em>No. AT-1221-01-0306-M-1, slip op. at 7-8 (M.S.P.B. Sept. 5, 2003) <em>(\u201cRemand Decision\u201d). </em>Holderfield identified eight allegedly adverse personnel actions. <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 9. The AJ, however, concluded that each of Holderfield\u2019s allegations was deficient in: (1) alleging a personnel action that had already been resolved in the grievance procedure; (2) occurring after the IRA appeal was filed at the Board, and thus, Holderfield had not exhausted her remedy before the Office of Special Counsel; or (3) being too vague. <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 9-12. After making these findings, the AJ again dismissed Holder-field\u2019s claim for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Holderfield petitioned the full Board for review of the Remand Decision. Concluding that there was no new, previously unavailable evidence and that the AJ made no error in law or regulation that affected the outcome of the appeal, the Board denied Holderfield\u2019s petition, rendering the Remand Decision final. <em>Holderfield III, </em>slip op. at 1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Holderfield timely appealed to this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Congress has expressly limited the scope of our review in an appeal from the Board. Specifically, we must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless we find it to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000); <em>Ellison v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>7 F.3d 1031, 1034 (Fed.Cir.1993). \u201cUnder the substantial evidence standard of review, a court will not overturn an agency decision if it is supported by \u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jacobs v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>35 F.3d 1543, 1546 (Fed.Cir. 1994) (quoting <em>Consol. Edison Co. of N.Y. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 299, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)). Moreover, the Supreme Court has explained that \u201cthe possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s findings from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Consolo v. Fed. Mar. Comm\u2019n, </em>383 U.S. 607, 620, 86 S.Ct. 1018, 16 L.Ed.2d 131 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">As set forth in <em>Yunus v. Department of Veterans Affairs, </em>242 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed.Cir.2001), the Board has jurisdiction over a whistleblower IRA if the appellant makes non-frivolous allegations that (1) she made a protected disclosure and (2) based on the disclosure, the agency took or failed to take a personnel action as defined by \u00a7 2302(a). However, under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7121(g)(2)-(3), Holderfield may not elect more than one of the following remedies for a claim relating to reprisal for making Whistleblowing Protection Act (\u201cWPA\u201d) disclosures:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-11\">(A) An appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under section 7701.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-12\">(B) A negotiated grievance procedure under this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-13\">(C) Procedures for seeking corrective action under subchapters II and III of chapter 12.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-14\">In response to the AJ\u2019s order to specifically reference incidents in the record sat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>isfying the second prong of the jurisdictional analysis, Holderfield cited, <em>inter alia, </em>numerous instances of verbal abuse by Chambers over the telephone and at a WOW work site. We agree, however, with the Board that Holderfield\u2019s allegations of \u201cpersonnel actions\u201d are precluded from consideration in this appeal because of Holderfield\u2019s prior election of the grievance procedure. In the grievance procedure, Holderfield complained of numerous incidents of verbal abuse by Chambers, in addition to other incidents of rude and embarrassing behavior. The agency, in turn, offered, and Holderfield accepted, a settlement agreement that resolved the aforementioned complaints. Holderfield cannot now reassert the same alleged \u201cpersonnel actions\u201d to establish jurisdiction for a whistleblower IRA based on the same operative facts to obtain further relief. We also find that the Board did not err in disregarding two of Holderfield\u2019s allegations of \u201cpersonnel actions\u201d for referencing events that took place after the IRA appeal was filed at the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">On appeal, Holderfield argues mainly that her current IRA claim and her prior grievance proceeding are not completely overlapping. Specifically, she argues that while the grievance proceeding addressed retaliatory acts in the form of unfair performance appraisals, that proceeding did not address her claims of sexual harassment and discrimination. Aside from failing to explain how the claims of sexual harassment and discrimination are related to Holderfield\u2019s WPA claim, that argument does not address the AJ\u2019s finding that all of Holderfield\u2019s allegations of \u201cpersonnel actions\u201d under \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A)(xi) were resolved in the grievance proceeding. In fact, Holderfield does not dispute any of the AJ\u2019s findings in her appeal to this court. Holderfield also argues that the alleged sexual harassment and discrimination constituted a significant change in the work conditions according to \u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A)(xi). Holderfield fails to explain, however, and we cannot discern from the record, how the harassment and discrimination were based on Holderfield\u2019s WPA disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">We have considered Holderfield\u2019s remaining arguments and find them unconvincing. Accordingly, we affirm the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
