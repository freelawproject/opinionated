We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand to the District Court so that it may decide whether Plaintiffs are entitled to injunc-tive, declaratory, or other appropriate relief with respect to the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d) claims that the District Court found moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-16\">The District Court held that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims under the IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400 <em>et seq., </em>are moot because B.M. graduated from high school in 1996.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Joint Appendix (\u201cA\u201d) 41; 47-48. Citing <em>Board of Education of Oak Park v. Nathan R., </em>199 F.3d 377 (7th Cir.2000), the District Court reasoned that, since B.M. is \u201cnot seeking compensatory education or other ongoing relief,\u201d there is no live controversy to adjudicate. <em>See </em>A48. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-17\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-18\"><em>Nathan R </em>cannot control the outcome of this case for two reasons. First, unlike the Third Circuit, the Seventh Circuit forecloses the compensatory and punitive damages sought here. It limits money awards under the IDEA to reimbursements of the cost of obtaining educational services that the school districts should have provided under the IDEA. <em>See Sch. Comm. v. Dep\u2019t </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number><em>of Educ., </em>471 U.S. 359, 369-70, 105 S.Ct. 1996, 85 L.Ed.2d 385 (1985) (authorizing reimbursement and prospective injunctive relief under the IDEA\u2019S predecessor); <em>Charlie F. v. Board of Educ., </em>98 F.3d 989 (7th Cir.1996) (\u201cwe conclude that damages are not \u2018relief that is available under\u2019 the IDEA\u201d); <em>Weyrick v. New Albany-Floyd County Consol. Sch. Corp., </em>2004 WL 3059793 at *6-8 (S.D.Ind.2004) (\u201cTo the extent plaintiffs seek \u2018monetary damages\u2019 ... or \u2018punitive damages\u2019 ..., as opposed to reimbursement or compensatory services, they seek relief that is not available under the IDEA.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">In this Circuit, a broader array of remedies is available for 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suits seeking redress of IDEA violations. Although we have \u201cnot settled whether damages are recoverable in an action arising solely under IDEA,\u201d <em>Bucks County Dep\u2019t of Mental Health </em>/ <em>Mental Retardation v. Pennsylvania, </em>379 F.3d 61, 68 n. 5 (3d Cir.2004) (citations omitted), we have held that \u201cin a \u00a7 1983 action to enforce IDEA, ... compensatory damages are available to remedy IDEA violations.\u201d <em>W.B. v. Ma-tulo, </em>67 F.3d 484, 494 (3d Cir.1995) (citation omitted). <em>See also Ridgewood Bd. of Educ. v. N.E., </em>172 F.3d 238, 252 (3d Cir. 1999). We found \u201cthat the traditional presumption in favor of all appropriate relief is not rebutted as to \u00a7 1983 actions to enforce IDEA,\u201d and suggested that \u201ceom-pensatory damages for generalized pain and suffering\u201d may be available in certain \u00a7 1983-based IDEA claims. <em>Matula, </em>67 F.3d at 495. Thus, so long as the relief B.M. seeks is deemed \u201cappropriate\u201d in this case, it is awardable under <em>Matula.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">Second, beyond this legal difference between our Circuit and the Seventh, the specific remedies sought in each ease differ as well. Nathan R.\u2019s case was moot because he requested only special education services, which were to be provided while he was in high school. <em>See id. </em>at 378. Once he graduated, his need for these services disappeared, and \u201cno action [the Seventh Circuit] could take would affect his or the School\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381. In contrast, B.M. seeks a full panoply of remedies, including declaratory and injunctive relief and compensatory and punitive damages. Remedies of this sort do not expire upon graduation. For example, if B.M. could demonstrate that the Defendants caused him quantifiable harm through violations of the IDEA, he could recover compensatory damages. Plaintiffs may also merit further injunctive relief if they can prove (as they insisted at oral argument) that copies of B.M.\u2019s records remain outstanding. In short, unlike in <em>Nathan R., </em>the District Court can still take actions that will affect Plaintiffs\u2019 and Defendants\u2019 rights, so the case is not moot.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Although we hold that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are not moot, we need not remand all of them. In particular, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are insufficient to state a claim for damages under the IDEA because they fail to allege any identifiable injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Other circuits have established that only those procedural violations of the IDEA which result in loss of educational opportunity or seriously deprive parents of their participation rights are actionable. For example, in <em>W.G. v. Board of Trustees, </em>960 F.2d 1479 (9th Cir.1992), the Ninth Circuit rejected the notion that procedural flaws \u201cautomatically require a finding of a denial of a [free and appropriate public education under the IDEA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1484. Instead, the Court held that only \u201cprocedural inadequacies that result in the loss of educational opportunity or seriously infringe the parents\u2019 opportunity to participate in the IEP formulation process clearly result in the denial of a [free and appropriate public education].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Similarly, the First Circuit observed that \u201cprocedural flaws do not necessarily render an [Individualized Education Plan (\u201cIEP\u201d) ] legally defective\u201d and held that \u201c[b]efore an IEP is set aside, there must be some rational basis to believe that procedural inadequacies compromised the pupil\u2019s right to an appropriate education, seriously hampered the parents\u2019 opportunity to participate in the formulation process, or caused a deprivation of education benefits.\u201d <em>Roland M. v. Concord Sch. Comm., </em>910 F.2d 983, 994 (1st Cir.1990) (en banc) (citations omitted). Consistent with those holdings, the Sixth Circuit rejected an IDEA claim for technical noncompliance with procedural requirements where the alleged violations did not result in \u201csubstantive deprivation,\u201d <em>see Thomas v. Cincinnati Bd. of Educ., </em>918 F.2d 618, 625 (6th Cir.1990), and the Fourth Circuit refused to award compensatory educational services where procedural faults committed by Board did not cause the child to lose any educational opportunity, <em>see Burke County Bd. of Educ. v. Denton, </em>895 F.2d 973, 982 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">A plaintiff bears the burden of establishing the harm caused by the claimed procedural shortcomings, and Plaintiffs here clearly have not met that burden. Their primary contentions relating to harms are that B.M.: (1) was deprived of an \u201cappropriate education\u201d under the IDEA during his sophomore year and the first part of his senior year; (2) was subject to constant harassment at school; (3) was unable to transfer because any new school would require his tainted records; and (4) faced obstacles to his post-secondary education. But Plaintiffs\u2019 bare allegations notwithstanding, the District Court found that they were \u201cunable to produce any evidence to convince this Court that B.M. was excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subject to discrimination at school.\u201d A50. It follows that B.M. suffered no educational loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">The record is also adequate to show \u2014 based on undisputed facts \u2014 that the parents actively participated in the development of B.M.\u2019s IEP at multiple stages. <em>See Target Range, </em>960 F.2d at 1484 (identifying loss of opportunity for parental participation as an alternative type of educational injury under IDEA); <em>Roland, </em>910 F.2d at 994. B.M.\u2019s parents\u2019 claim that they were deprived of the opportunity to participate in particular isolat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>ed decisions is insignificant in light of their extensive influence over every step of B.M.\u2019s education at Livingston.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Finally, though Plaintiffs did successfully remove certain reports from B.M.\u2019s records, and while other reports were prepared that should not have been, the damages arising from those reports and their brief and limited use are purely speculative. <em>See Taylor Milk Co. v. Int\u2019l Bro. of Teamsters, </em>248 F.3d 239, 247 (3d Cir.2001). Because there are no facts on record that suggest B.M.\u2019s educational interests were prejudiced by his school\u2019s various procedural errors, no damages are available to petitioners on their IDEA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">The absence of injury similarly precludes any damages award with respect to Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claims based on alleged IDEA violations. For the same reasons that Plaintiffs cannot show that B.M. suffered a loss of educational opportunity or that his parents suffered a loss of participation in developing B.M.\u2019s educational program, it cannot be said that petitioners suffered anything more than de minimis injury. Accordingly, no damages are available to petitioners based on their \u00a7 1983 claims. <em>See Suppan v. Dadonna, </em>203 F.3d 228, 235 (3d Cir.2000) (stating that to be actionable a Section 1983 tort requires more than de minimis injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">Plaintiffs appeal the District Court\u2019s rulings in favor of the Defendants on several additional claims. They include: 1) summary judgment for Defendant Riegel on Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cbrownie incident\u201d claim; 2) summary judgment for the Defendants on Plaintiffs\u2019 substantive Due Process claims; 3) the District Court\u2019s order appointing Edelstein as custodian; and 4) its denial of certain discovery requests.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-13\">Plaintiffs contest the District Court\u2019s holding that Defendant Riegel did not violate their rights during the so-called \u201cbrownie incident.\u201d They argue that Riegel\u2019s actions offended the First Amendment because they constituted retaliation against B.M. and his parents for filing a legal complaint in this case. We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs. <em>Fogarty v. Boles, </em>121 F.3d 886, 887 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-14\">On September 15, 1995, B.M.\u2019s Child Study Team (\u201cCST\u201d) held.an open house. The CST members stayed in one room, called a \u201cresource room,\u201d and teachers stopped in during their free periods to discuss the CST\u2019s students and their Individualized Education Plans. The room had a table full of refreshments. As he usually did, B.M. entered the room that morning and dropped off his belongings. He asked a teacher in the room if he could take an item from the refreshment table. She said yes, but he did not take anything at that time. Around lunchtime, B.M. returned and took a brownie from the refreshment table. Carol Riegel jumped up and grabbed B.M.\u2019s arm with one hand, using the other to pry the brownie from B.M.\u2019s hand and set it back on the table. After the incident, B.M. cursed and left the room. He sustained no physical injuries, and did not visit the school nurse. A1303-04. He later explained that he was angry not because of the event itself, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>because he could not retaliate without suffering severe consequences. A1B06-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">In a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit for retaliation under the First Amendment, a plaintiff must show: (1) that he was engaged in protected activity; (2) that the government responded with retaliation; and (3) that the protected activity was the cause of the retaliation. <em>Estate of Smith v. Marasco, </em>318 F.3d 497, 512 (3d Cir.2003). Defendants object on each element, but their causation argument is most persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Summary judgment was proper because Plaintiffs failed to raise a genuine issue as to whether there is a causal connection between B.M.\u2019s lawsuit and the brownie incident. <em>See Robinson v. Pittsburgh, </em>120 F.3d 1286, 1302 n. 16 (1997). Riegel appears to have taken the brownie from B.M.\u2019s hand because she thought he was breaking the rules, not because \u201cshe was furious that this litigation had achieved-what she had lobbied against when she conspired with Christiano and Simon to make sure that her report would continue to be available for use in planning B.M.\u2019s education.\u201d Plaintiffs Brief at 54. The three-month gap between the filing of a complaint and the incident is not so close as to be unusually suggestive of retaliatory motive, especially since such an obvious and unimpeached non-retaliatory motive exists. <em>Krouse v. Am. Sterilizer Co., </em>126 F.3d 494, 504 (3d Cir.1997) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">Plaintiffs also claim that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment for the Defendants on their substantive Due Process claims. First, Plaintiffs allege a violation of their constitutional right to privacy when C.M.\u2019s and R.M.\u2019s addresses, ages, occupations, and educational histories were included on B.M.\u2019s school records, which were disseminated to various parties related to the ongoing litigation. Citing <em>Nixon v. Adm\u2019r of GSA, </em>they claim that \u201c[i]f a plaintiff has a reasonable expectation of privacy, the Constitution protects against the disclosure of this information.\u201d 433 U.S. 425, 458, 97 S.Ct. 2777, 53 L.Ed.2d 867 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">All of the cases Plaintiffs cite are inap-posite. <em>Nixon, </em>for example, held that the former President\u2019s right to privacy was not violated by a statute that required preservation of certain Presidential materials. To the extent that this case is relevant, it actually cuts against Plaintiffs, because it allowed archivists to screen the Presidential materials to separate and give back those materials that were entirely private. <em>See id. </em>at 455-65, 97 S.Ct. 2777. Another case cited by Plaintiffs, <em>Whalen v. Roe, </em>429 U.S. 589, 97 S.Ct. 869, 51 L.Ed.2d 64 (1977), also militates against their position. <em>Whalen </em>sustained the constitutionality of a New York statute requiring a database containing the name, address, and age of every person who obtained prescription drugs for which there were both lawful and unlawful markets. Although the database could be accessed by certain health department and investigatory personnel, the Court found that it did not amount to \u201can invasion of any right or liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605, 97 S.Ct. 869. No case cited by the Plaintiffs even approaches the proposition that the Constitution is offended by disclosure of parents\u2019 occupations or educational histories to court reporters, insurers, attorneys, and expert witnesses during the course of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">Moreover, the IDEA, which Plaintiffs claim \u201cprovide[s] a basis for an expectation of privacy in school records,\u201d does not require that this kind of parental information should be kept confidential in this context. Indeed, it specifically exempts from its confidentiality requirements \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>student\u2019s name, address, telephone listing, date and place of birth, major field of study, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, and the most recent previous educational agency or institution attended by the student.\u201d <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1417(c) (directing the Secretary of Education to comply with 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g); 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(A)(5)(A) (defining \u201cdirectory information\u201d exempt from confidentiality requirements). Nowhere does the IDEA state that parental \u201cdirectory information\u201d should be confidential. In fact, the only parental information the IDEA protects is financial records. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1232g(a)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Plaintiffs also challenge disclosure of B.M.\u2019s school records, including his psychological reports, to the Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (\u201cOCR\u201d), defendants\u2019 insurance carrier, prospective counsel, defendants\u2019 expert, and the psychiatrist (Martin Mayer) engaged to evaluate B.M. For the following reasons, we believe these disclosures did not breach the confidentiality of B.M.\u2019s records and did not violate his right to privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">C.M. filed a complaint with the OCR in 1993 alleging that the school district discriminates on the basis of disability. Defendant Merachnik disclosed B.M.\u2019s records to the OCR only after it requested them in a letter citing federal regulations requiring that the OCR be provided with all pertinent documents. <em>See </em>Defendants\u2019 Supplemental Appendix (\u201cDA\u201d) at 88-90; <em>see also </em>34 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.6(c); 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.61. Disclosures to the OCR were thus clearly authorized under 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(b)(3), which provides that FER-PA\u2019s confidentiality provisions, incorporated by IDEA, do not preclude access to student records necessary to enforce federal law. <em>See also </em>34 C.F.R. \u00a7 99.31(l)(3)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">Second, Petitioners challenge disclosures to Livingston\u2019s insurer. But the insurance carrier was entitled to legal documents, including attachments, pursuant to the terms of its insurance agreement with Livingston. <em>See </em>DA3. And it is well-established that insured parties stand in a special relationship with their insurers, who as real parties of interest, are entitled to access documents on which their liability may turn. <em>See Gray v. Comm. Union Ins. Co., </em>191 N.J.Super. 590, 468 A.2d 721, 725 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Third, Petitioners claim that defendant John Christiano improperly provided confidential documents to an attorney from whom he sought possible legal representation. But Christiano did not have to wait until he formally engaged an attorney before he shared documents critical to his case; otherwise, neither he nor the lawyer could make an informed decision regarding representation. <em>See In re Bevill, Bresler &amp; Schulman Asset Manag. Corp., </em>805 F.2d 120, 124 n. 1 (3d Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">Fourth, Petitioners challenge Livingston\u2019s disclosure of B.M.\u2019s records to its expert. However, because experts function as agents of counsel and are themselves bound by a duty not to disseminate confidential documents they receive in that capacity, disclosure to experts does not constitute a breach of confidentiality or privacy. <em>See State v. Davis, </em>116 N.J. 341, 561 A.2d 1082, 1092 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">Finally, disclosures to Dr. Mayer were permissible because IDEA specifically provides that \u201cindividuals who have knowledge or special expertise\u201d and certain \u201cqualified professionals\u201d may participate in the evaluation of disabled children. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(d)(1)(B); 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(c)(1). It is implausible that Congress intended to restrict those individuals\u2019 access to children\u2019s school reports. Corol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>lary New Jersey state regulations similarly contemplate access by professionals involved in developing a disabled child\u2019s IEP. <em>See </em>N.J.A.C. 6A:14-2.3(i)(l)(vi). Accordingly, defendants\u2019 disclosures to Mayer were not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">In sum, though his parents have defended the confidentiality of B.M.\u2019s records with the avowed purpose of protecting his post-secondary educational opportunities, no confidential records were released to any individual or entity that could jeopardize B.M.\u2019s educational or other interests. All those given access were entitled to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 second substantive Due Process claim \u2014 that they lost the right to educate their child as they saw fit \u2014 merits little discussion. Contrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 assertions, the violations alleged in this case do not implicate the right to send one\u2019s child to a competent nonpublic school, <em>see Pierce v. Soc\u2019y of Sisters, </em>268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925), the right to study a foreign language, <em>see Meyer v. Nebraska, </em>262 U.S. 390, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923), or a patient\u2019s right to refuse unwanted medical treatment. <em>See White v. Napoleon, </em>897 F.2d 103, 114 (3d Cir.1990). Because Plaintiffs have not offered a single precedent in support of their argument, the District Court properly found that they did not raise an issue of material fact as to whether they were denied the right to educate their child as they see fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">Plaintiffs next argue that the District Court\u2019s Order aimed at preserving the confidentiality of B.M.\u2019s records constituted an abuse of discretion. The Court ordered that Stephen Edelstein, counsel for defendants,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-13\">collect all of B.M.\u2019s school records ... [and] hold these records in his office in a locked and secure location which is accessible only to him, until the termination of this matter or the further Order of this Court, at which time the records and any copies thereof shall be disposed of in accordance with this Court\u2019s Order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-14\">A36. It further required Edelstein to obtain any of B.M.\u2019s records that were in the possession of insurance carriers. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-15\">Plaintiffs argue that this ruling was an abuse of discretion because it was both too broad and too narrow. First, they fault the District Court for requiring Edelstein to \u201cdestroy all of B.M.\u2019s pupil records at the end of this case.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief at 59. But the Order does not mandate destruction. It merely states that B.M.\u2019s records should be collected in one location until the end of litigation, pending further direction from the Court. Second, Plaintiffs argue that \u201c[t]he Court should only have ordered the challenged records to be expunged and the remainder of his records returned to his school district.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This request is puzzling, since B.M.\u2019s school district was dissolved in 1997. Even if the records could be returned to the defunct district, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated why they should be able to redact records merely because they have challenged them, before any court has determined that they are legally flawed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The District Court\u2019s Order was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-16\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-17\">In an October 4, 1999 Order, a Magistrate Judge in this case refused to allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>Plaintiffs to subject certain Defendants to additional interrogatories and depositions well after the original discovery deadline had passed. The Judge did permit three interrogatories which he felt were representative of the rest. DA115. He authorized future discovery if the fruits of the three interrogatories justified it. <em>Id. </em>Far from being an abuse of discretion, this ruling sensibly balanced the competing interests of justice and efficiency in light of the protracted discovery that had already taken place in this case. <em>See Lloyd v. Hovensa, LLC., </em>369 F.3d 263, 274-75 (3d Cir.2004); <em>Brumfield v.

The District Court\u2019s holding with respect to those claims is vacated, and the matter is remanded for further consideration. The District Court should also review the need for additional discovery in light of this opinion.</p>\n<author id=\"b912-6\">STAPLETON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">I am able to join most,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but not all, of the Court\u2019s opinion. I would remand with instructions that the District Court should promptly try plaintiffs\u2019 First Cause of Action and determine whether they are entitled to declaratory, injunctive, or damage relief, together with attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, on that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">This controversy originated over twelve years ago, and this suit will soon have its tenth anniversary. It appears to me that in part because of the adversarial stance of the parties over all of those years and the efforts of the plaintiffs to convert a relatively straightforward claim into a <em>cause celebre, </em>the parties and the District Court have lost sight of plaintiffs\u2019 original and primary claim. Because that claim may have merit, may entitle plaintiffs to important relief, and, yet, has never been adjudicated, I would remand and direct that expedited attention be given to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">Section 1414(b)(3)(B) of the IDEA provides that \u201c[e]ach local educational agency shall ensure that ... any standardized tests that are given to the child ... have been validated for the specific purpose for which they are used.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(b)(3)(B). Section 1415(b) gives a parent a right to \u201cprior notice\u201d whenever the agency proposes to initiate or change the evaluation of the child, which under \u00a7 1415(c) must include a description of each evaluation procedure or test. Section 1415(b)(6) provides that parents must be able to file a formal complaint \u201cwith respect to any matter relating to the ... evaluation of the child,\u201d which necessarily includes the right to complain about not receiving appropriate notice or the giving of a test that was not validated. If the parent is not satisfied with the response to the complaint, access to an administrative process is provided, <em>see </em>\u00a7 1415(f) and (g). And finally, under \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A), \u201cany party aggrieved by the findings and decision [in the administrative process] shall have the right to bring a civil action with respect to the complaint\u201d in a state or federal District court, and the court is to grant \u201csuch relief as [it] determines to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>appropriate.\u201d While it must give \u201cdue weight\u201d to the administrators\u2019 proceedings, it must accept additional evidence and make an independent decision based on \u201cthe preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">In this case, B.M.\u2019s parents filed a complaint with the school about invalid and unreliable testing and lack of proper parental notice that, along with other procedural violations of IDEA, allegedly produced an evaluation of B.M. which was inaccurate, misleading and damaging to him. They sought expungement of that evaluation, which was denied by the defendants. They proceeded through the administrative process and were ultimately denied relief. The parents then filed this suit in the District Court asking it, <em>inter alia, </em>expunge the harmful record.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cFirst Cause of Action\u201d asks the District Court to review the administrative proceedings and grant the appropriate relief there denied. It spells out the various procedural violations of the IDEA that had produced the allegedly misleading evaluation of B.M. and then alleges as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-7\">84. B.M. is expected to enter college under admission procedures developed for special education students. The procedures typically require submission of a school psychologist\u2019s report, as indicated in written material provided to the student by his guidance counselor at GL, Mrs. Menk, and as corroborated in other sources.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-8\">85. If the Board is not enjoined from disclosing the challenged records in B.M.\u2019s file to potential post-secondary education programs in which B.M. seeks to enroll, he will be effectively foreclosed from applying to those programs. B.M. will be irreparably damaged by his inability to pursue post-secondary education and the concomitant emotional distress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-9\">86. As a result of the district\u2019s failure to follow state and federal regulations regarding evaluations, C.M. and R.M. cannot agree to any further evaluations by the district and are forced to incur expenses in having the psychological and educational evaluations required for college admissions to programs for the learning disabled done privately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-10\">87. B.M.\u2019s educational records must be maintained after graduation so that he can document his need for accommodations in post-secondary education and the work pl\u00e1ce under \u00a7 504. Because the records sought to be expunged provide harmful and inaccurate information, B.M. will be irreparably harmed by them disclosure to post-secondary programs and employees if the Board is not enjoined from disclosing the challenged records to said programs and employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-11\">88. The evaluations written by Ms. Riegel and Dr. Mayer which were relied upon by the CST caused the CST to provide an improper program for B.M. As a result of this improper program the parents were forced to challenge the IEP developed by the CST resulting in legal and expert fees. Plaintiffs have been harmed, because they have not received reimbursement of attorney\u2019s fees and related costs for over a year since these costs have been expended. Plaintiffs seek unreimbursed fees and costs, including pre\u2014 and post-judgment interest if accrued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">A985-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">This Count asks the District Court to declare that \u201cif the defendant Board is not enjoined from disclosing the challenged records to post-secondary programs in which B.M. intends to enroll or [to] potential employers, B.M. will suffer irreparable harm.\u201d A.988. In addition to compensatory and punitive damages, Count One asks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>the District Court to enter an injunction (a) \u201c[directing the ... Board to expunge the [challenged] records,\u201d (b) \u201c[d]irecting that no party communicate information relating to the challenged material including the release of any document which references the challenged reports,\u201d and (c) \u201c[d]irecting that any document which incorporates any portion of the expunged record be retrievedA.988.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">In an opinion dated December 19, 2002, the District Court, while acknowledging that the IDEA \u201cclearly grants parents specific procedural rights which they may enforce in administrative proceedings as well as in federal court,\u201d A.47, dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 First Cause of Action as moot, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-5\">There is no live case or controversy before the Court. B.M. has graduated from high school. B.M. did not suffer any harm as a result of any of Defendants\u2019 alleged violations, and is not seeking compensatory education or other ongoing relief. The Court recognizes that Plaintiffs are concerned about the dissemination of an allegedly flawed evaluation, but the Court remedied this issue at oral argument with an order that all copies of B.M.\u2019s evaluation that had been disseminated were to be collected and retained in one central location and no further dissemination should occur. There is no potential harm to Plaintiffs from the dissemination of the evaluation as all copies have been contained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">A.48.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">The order referred to by the District Court, entered on December 17, 2002, directed that efforts be made to trace and retrieve any of B.M.\u2019s records no longer held by the school and ordered that B.M.\u2019s records be held by defense counsel \u201cin his office in a locked and secure location which is only accessible to him, until the termination of this matter or the further Order of this Court, at which time the records and any copies thereof shall be disposed of in accordance with this Court\u2019s Order ...\u201d A.36.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The District Court terminated this case by dismissing the last of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims on January 13, 2004. It gave no instructions with respect to the expungement or disposition of the challenged documents. Nor does anyone claim that it has done so since.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">In addition to dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 First Cause of Action as moot, the District Court\u2019s December 19, 2002, opinion disposed of all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims with the exception of the claims included in its \u201cFourth Cause of Action.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These claims were based on \u00a7 1983 and alleged constitutional violations. <em>See </em>A.52-53. Following a motion for clarification of its order implementing the December 19, 2002, opinion, the District Court entered an order providing in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>ORDERED that the remaining claims against Defendants are as follows: (1) U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims against Defendant Union County School District and Defendants Merachnik, Christiano, Hani-gan, Imbriaco, Mayer and Riegel in their official capacities, but not as to punitive damages; (2) a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim against Defendant Riegel in her individual capacity; (3) Defendant Laurie Neurodevelopmental remains in the case to the extent that LNI might be liable to Plaintiffs for attorneys\u2019 fees if the Court were to find that attorneys\u2019 fees should be awarded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">A. 63-64. Given the text of the December 19, 2002, opinion, this order can only be read as preserving only Count Four \u00a7 1983 constitutional claims. <em>See </em>fn.2, <em>supra. </em>It necessarily follows that plaintiffs\u2019 First Cause of Action and the IDEA violations there alleged were not before the Court at the time of the subsequent trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This means that plaintiffs have never been called upon to come forth with their evidence supporting liability and relief on their First Cause of Action.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">The Court today expressly and correctly holds that plaintiffs\u2019 First Cause of Action is not moot and that plaintiffs may be entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief on that claim. Moreover, I am confident that my colleagues would find the plaintiffs entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees and costs should they be successful in obtaining such relief. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B). The Court\u2019s opinion further acknowledges that \u201cwe have held that in a \u00a7 1983 action to enforce IDEA, ... compensatory damages are available to remedy IDEA violations\u201d so long as that remedy is \u201cappropriate\u201d within the meaning of the Act. Op. at 880 (quoting from <em>W.B. v. Matula, </em>67 F.3d 484 (3d Cir.1995)). Surprisingly, however, they preclude any damage recovery here. The IDEA violations at issue in <em>Matulo </em>when it found compensatory damages \u201cappropriate\u201d were procedural ones indistinguishable from those here alleged,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>am at a loss to understand why my colleagues have ruled out the possibility of a damage recovery in this matter.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> If it is true, for example, that B.M.\u2019s parents have had to pay for valid evaluations of B.M. which the school was required by the IDEA to provide in order to permit an assessment of his special needs, I would hold that a compensatory damage remedy was appropriate. Such harm would, in my judgment, be neither \u201cpurely speculative\u201d nor \u201cde minimis.\u201d Op. at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">I would not rule out the possibility that when the facts are fully developed one or more of the individual defendants will be entitled to qualified immunity. However, plaintiffs allege violations of statutory and regulatory procedural requirements that are mandatory, \u201cclear and specific.\u201d <em>P.N. v. Greco, </em>282 F.Supp.2d. 221, 240 (D.N.J. 2003) (finding immunity unavailable where \u201cclear and specific\u201d mandates of IDEA were alleged). Accordingly, a disposition at this time of plaintiffs\u2019 First Cause of Action against the individual defendants in their individual capacity on qualified immunity grounds would be premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">I would remand for a prompt trial of plaintiffs\u2019 First Cause of Action, asking the District Court to reevaluate the need for further discovery in light of this Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b905-12\">. The District Court also held that Plaintiffs' claims under the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (\u201cFERPA\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g(a)(2), are moot. Plaintiffs only mention this statute once in their 80-page brief, and they offer no legal arguments as to why the District Court's holding was erroneous. We therefore deem the issue waived. <em>See Laborer\u2019s Int\u2019l Union v. Foster Wheeler Corp., </em>26 F.3d 375, 398 (3d Cir.1994) (finding an issue waived because \u201cpassing reference to an issue ... will not suffice to bring that issue before this court\u201d) (citations and quotations omitted). Even if it were not waived, Plaintiffs have no private right of action under the FERPA itself or via 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, </em>536 U.S. 273, 122 S.Ct. 2268, 153 L.Ed.2d 309 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b906-6\">. According to <em>Matula, </em>even punitive damages may be available. <em>See </em>67 F.3d at 495 (citing <em>Woods v. N.J. Dep't of Educ., </em>796 F.Supp. 767 (D.NJ.1992) with approval for the proposition that \"compensatory and punitive damages are available in [a] \u00a7 1983 action for IDEA violations\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b906-7\">. Two further points warrant mentioning. First, it is unclear whether the District Court's remark, \"It should be noted that this Court gives little weight or credibility to the testimony of the Plaintiffs,\u201d was addressed to this claim. <em>See </em>A76. If it was, such credibility determinations alone are insufficient to satisfy the requirements of Rule 52(c), under which the District Court purported to act. <em>See Newark Branch NAACP v. City of Bayonne, </em>134 F.3d 113 (3d Cir.1998) (holding that the district court must make findings of fact adequate to understand the basis for the court\u2019s decision under Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">Second, to the extent, if any, that the Court's disposition of this claim rests on collateral estoppel, <em>see </em>A77, a decision of the Office of Administrative Law is not binding because the erroneous decision of the District Court on mootness rendered that decision un-reviewable. <em>See, e.g., J.S.K. </em>v. <em>Hendry County Sch. Bd., </em>941 F.2d 1563, 1569 (11th Cir.1991) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>(holding that judicially unreviewed state administrative hearings have no preclusive effect in federal court); <em>Drinker v. Colonial Sch. Dist., </em>888 F.Supp. 674, 680 (E.D.Pa.1995), <em>aff d on other grounds, </em>78 F.3d 859 (3d Cir. 1996) (unreviewed state administrative law IDEA proceedings do not have a preclusive effect upon the federal court system).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b908-8\">. The District Court also granted summary judgment for Defendants on claims under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794. Plaintiffs did not raise this issue in their brief, so we do not address it on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b911-9\">. As explained above in Part I, Plaintiffs will have an opportunity on remand to show that redaction or expungement of certain records is \"appropriate relief\u201d under the IDEA and \u00a7 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b912-9\">. In particular, I agree that we should affirm the District Court\u2019s resolution of all of plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims, their privacy claims based on statutory grounds, and their claims arising out of the alleged disclosure of B.M.\u2019s records to attorneys, insurers, experts and Dr. Mayer. I also agree that the District Court erred in dismissing plaintiffs' First and Fifth Causes of Action as moot and in giving collateral effect to an administrative determination that was not subject to judicial review because of that mootness ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b914-6\">. Like my colleagues, I find no abuse of discretion in the entry of this order. It was a reasonable temporary measure, but it did not adjudicate plaintiffs\u2019 First Cause of Action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b914-7\">. In the December 19, 2002, opinion, summary judgment was granted to the defendants on Count Two, a claim under \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, because \u201d[p]laintiffs are unable to produce any evidence to convince this Court that B.M. was excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subject to discrimination at school....\u201d A.50. Summary judgment was also granted on Count Three based on the doctrine of law of the case. With respect to Count Four, plaintiffs' First Amendment claim was found to be \"completely without merit,\u201d as was their Due Process claim based on the \"Brownie\u201d incident. A. 52-53. Count Five, a parallel to Count One based on state law, was dismissed as moot. Thus, the only claims surviving were Count Four \u00a7 1983 claims based on alleged constitutional violations. A.52-53.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b915-6\">. In its opinion following trial, the District Court stressed that it had previously \"dismissed all of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims pursuant to the IDEA and the Rehabilitation Act\u201d and, accordingly, \"Plaintiffs [had] no means by which to overturn the Office of Administrative Law decision.\u201d A.77. The District Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion with respect to the claims that were tried was: \"In order to establish a claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must establish that [his] constitutional rights have been violated, which Plaintiffs utterly fail to do.\u201d A.78.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b915-7\">. C.M. was asked at trial what \"harm\u201d had resulted from the report containing the allegedly false evaluation of B.M. In response, she testified about the pre-litigation \"out of pocket\u201d expenses she and her husband had incurred in attempting to get the defendant to expunge the misleading and harmful report, mentioning in addition to attorneys' fees \"costs for transcripts\u201d of the administrative hearing, \"library copying costs,\u201d the \"cost for obtaining the records from the Office of Civil Rights.\u201d She also spoke of the cost of consultations with Dr. Schneider, an expert. It is unclear whether Dr. Schneider was engaged as a witness or to provide the accurate psychological and educational evaluations required for college admission. which should have been provided by the school. More important, C.M. testified, was the fact that because of concern about the education B.M. was getting, B.M. and his parents attempted to have B.M. moved to a different school but were unsuccessful in doing so because any new school would insist on receiving the file including the misleading report before accepting a student like B.M. with special needs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b915-11\">. The <em>Matula </em>court described the plaintiffs\u2019 IDEA allegations as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-12\">Specifically, plaintiffs allege that defendants violated IDEA <em>by (1) </em>failing to inform them of their statutory rights; (2) failing to refer E.J. for evaluation from September 1991 until February 1992; (3) failing to advise W.B. in writing of its refusal; to evaluate EJ. prior to February 1992; (4) conducting only a limited evaluation of E.J. in April 1992; (5) refusing to develop an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>IEP until April 1993, in the wrongful belief that E.J.\u2019s academic performance disqualified him for IDEA services; (6) withholding from W.B. evaluation results indicating E.J. may be neurologically impaired; and (7) conditioning the commencement if occupational therapy for E.J. on settlement of W.B.\u2019s due process petitions and refusing to provide those services until January 1993.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfXV\"><em>Matula, </em>67 F.3d at 500.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b916-8\">.

This was the court's disposition of the FERPA claim that constituted plaintiffs\u2019 Second Cause of Action, which is not before us. FERPA requires such a showing.
