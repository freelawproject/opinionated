Gonzales is substituted for his predecessor, John Ashcroft, as Attorney General of the United States, pursuant to Fed.

The IJ offered specific, cogent reasons for his adverse credibility determination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Among them were that (1) there was a disparity between Davinder Singh\u2019s age on his asylum application and his identity document from the Election Commission for India; (2) he claimed that he was a member of the Mehta-Chawala faction of the All-India Sikh Student Federation, a faction the State Department Report calls \u201cviolence prone,\u201d yet testified that the group was mostly peaceful and that he did not engage in violent activities; (3) he testified that he does not believe in voting yet possessed a voting card; (4) he submitted a letter purporting to show his membership in the Student Federation but the letterhead misspelled \u201cFederation\u201d as \u201cFedration\u201d; and (5) he claimed to be an active member of a political organization but did not know the basic structure of the Indian government.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-15\">Every one of these reasons for doubting Davinder Singh\u2019s credibility might be subject to an innocent explanation, such as that he obtained the voting card just in case Sikh militant policy toward voting changed or the Indian political situation changed; or \u201cFederation\u201d might have been misspelled not because the letter was forged on a wordprocessor by someone not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>very familiar with the Student Federation, but rather because it was typeset with cold type and after an error was made it was not worth throwing away all the stationary that left out the letter \u201ce.\u201d But, it is not the IJ\u2019s burden to support his decision by showing that Davinder Singh was false to a certainty, or beyond a reasonable doubt. Rather, it was Davinder Singh\u2019s burden to establish his entitlement to asylum, and we do not have authority to overturn the IJ\u2019s decision unless \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude the contrary.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While we are not convinced that the grounds cited by the IJ compel the conclusion that Davinder Singh was incredible, that is not the relevant question under the applicable standard of review. Because a contrary result is not compelled by the record as a whole, we decline to disturb the IJ\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Petition for review DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b668-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-11\">. <em>Falcon Carriche v.
