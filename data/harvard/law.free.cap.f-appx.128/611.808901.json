We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Reviewing the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo, see Luong v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., </em>368 F.3d 1109, 1111 n. 2 (9th Cir.2004), we conclude that Goldstein\u2019s FTCA claim was precluded by the comprehensive remedial scheme governing Department of Veterans Affairs (\u2018VA\u201d) employees. <em>See Bush v. Lucas, </em>462 U.S. 367, 368, 103 S.Ct. 2404, 76 L.Ed.2d 648 (1983) (holding that where \u201cclaims arise out of an employment relationship that is governed by comprehensive procedural and substantive provisions giving meaningful remedies against the United States, ... it would be inappropriate ... to supplement that regulatory scheme with a new judicial remedy\u201d); <em>Berry v. Hollander, </em>925 F.2d 311, 315-16 (9th Cir.1991) (concluding that a VA doctor\u2019s claim that he was ousted from his job in violation of the First and Fifth Amendments was precluded by the statutory scheme covering VA employees, including the protections provided by the Department of Medicine and Surgery\u2019s rules governing grievances and terminations, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Federal Employees Compensation Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-12\">Goldstein argues that his FTCA claim is not precluded because he was not afforded the procedural protections of the statutory scheme for VA employees under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7461-7464. However, these protections do not apply to Goldstein because he was a probationary employee. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7403(b)(2) (providing that probationary employees\u2019 records shall be reviewed from time to time and if deemed not fully qualified and satisfactory, they shall be separated from the service); Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Admin. Supp. MP-5, Part II, Ch. 4, \u00a7 4.09 (providing that probationary employees are subject to \u201csummary board reviews\u201d); <em>see also Gior-dano v. Roudebush, </em>617 F.2d 511, 517 (8th Cir.1980) (\u201c[T]he limited Board review of a probationary physician\u2019s professional competency is the only procedure available to him.... Congress intended the tenured employee to be given greater rights than a probationary employee.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-13\">Further, the district court did not err in denying Goldstein leave to amend his complaint to state a claim under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702, because this claim is barred by the statute of limitations. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a) (providing that \u201cevery civil action commenced against the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action first accrues\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b638-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-16\">. Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we do not recite them here except as necessary to explain our disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b639-18\">. Because the district court correctly held that Goldstein\u2019s FTCA claim is precluded by the statutory scheme for VA employees, we need not address the government's additional argument that Goldstein\u2019s claim is barred by collateral estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
