Model M877 .357 caliber magnum revolver, serial number F478902; one Heritage Manufacturing .22 caliber revolver, serial number HR63242; one J.C. Higgins model 20 12 gauge shotgun, with no serial number; one Taurus model 669 .357 caliber revolver, serial number ND929237; and 127 rounds of CCI .22 caliber long rifle ammunition, in and affecting commerce, having been previously convicted of Smuggling Contraband into a Prison in El Paso County, Colorado District Court, case number 90CR01, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-16\">All in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 922(g)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-17\">On July 18, 2003, the defendant filed a motion to suppress \u201call evidence and statements obtained in connection with his arrest on May 21, 2003, and all evidence and statements deriving directly therefrom, on the grounds that such evidence and statements were obtained in violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Fourth and Fifth Amendments.\u201d The motion was prolix, consisting of some 13 pages. In short, counsel sought to suppress evidence obtained in a search of defendant\u2019s truck, in a search of a \u201cblack briefcase\u201d found on the seat of the truck, and the evidence later obtained in a search of the defendant\u2019s home, as well as various \u201cstatements\u201d made by him in connection with those searches. The government filed a response to that motion. At an evidentiary hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress held on August 19, 2003, two officers of the Elbert County Sheriffs office testified. The defendant did not testify. The district court held that the search of the truck was a valid \u201cinventory search\u201d of a vehicle which was about to be impounded, and also that the search was incident to a lawful arrest. The search of defendant\u2019s \u201cblack briefcase\u201d was pursuant to a search warrant, and the district court held that the search of the truck being valid, the search of the \u201cblack briefcase\u201d was not \u201ctainted.\u201d As to the search of defendant\u2019s house, it was conceded by the government that the evidence obtained in that search should be suppressed, since it was a warrantless search and made <em>after </em>the defendant had requested to see a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Background facts as developed at the evidentiary hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress will hopefully put the present case in focus. The defendant, in his own name, owned farmland in Elbert County, Colorado. One Curtis Ashcraft leased property from defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s estate immediately adjacent thereto. And therein lies our problem. Ashcraft and the defendant did not \u201cget along,\u201d and the former obtained a restraining order which ordered the defendant to \u201cstay off\u2019 Ash-craft\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">On May 21, 2003, two officers of the Elbert County Sheriffs office received a dispatch order regarding an on-going \u201ctrespass\u201d on Ashcraft\u2019s leased premises. The officers proceeded to Ashcraft\u2019s property and were met by Ashcraft, who told the officers that the defendant was \u201con his property, filling water in his truck\u201d and that the defendant had previously been \u201clegally restrained from being on his property.\u201d The officers then proceeded to the location given by Ashcraft, where they found the defendant a few hundred feet from his pick-up truck. Upon arriving at the site, Deputy Hartman got out of his vehicle and asked the defendant \u201cwho he was,\u201d to which the defendant replied, \u201cYou know who I am.\u201d Hartman explained to the defendant that he was on a call regarding a possible violation of a restraining order, to which the defendant stated that the property belonged to him and that the restraining order had expired. He also said that his lawyer had advised him that he was allowed to go onto the property and get water for the newly planted trees on his property adjacent to Ashcraft\u2019s premises. Officer Hartman informed the defendant that because of defendant\u2019s pri- or threats against law enforcement officers, he would be handcuffed for \u201cofficer safety,\u201d at the same time telling the defendant that he was <em>not </em>under arrest. In the search of defendant\u2019s person for possible weapons, the officers removed from defendant\u2019s pockets a small knife, several knife attachments, a multi-purpose tool, and the keys to defendant\u2019s truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Hartman next called the dispatcher to find out if the restraining order was still in effect. After about ten minutes, Hartman was informed that the restraining order was still in effect. At that point, Hartman \u201carrested\u201d the defendant for violation of a restraining order, and decided to impound defendant\u2019s truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">After his arrest, defendant, who was handcuffed, was placed in the rear seat of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>the patrol car, which was then driven over to the defendant\u2019s truck. At that time the defendant expressed concern about his dog, which had been running loose. The defendant asked Officer Hartman, and his fellow officer, Nail, to enter the passenger compartment of his truck and get a leash for the dog and to put some \u201cgloves and some fertilizer pellets inside the compartment where they would not get wet.\u201d In compliance with defendant\u2019s instructions, Officer Hartman unlocked the driver\u2019s door, placed the gloves and fertilizer pellets on the dashboard and looked for the dog leash where the defendant had said it would be found: \u201cunder the stuff on the passenger side of the seat.\u201d In looking for the leash, Hartman moved a \u201cblack briefcase\u201d that was \u201claying right in the center of the seat behind the gearshift.\u201d In so doing, he bumped the briefcase against the gearshift and heard from within the briefcase a \u201cdistinct sound \u2014 a certain rattle of boxed ammunition.\u201d Officer Hartman knew that in 1989 the defendant had been convicted of attempting to bring a gun into a detention facility and, thus being a felon, was prohibited from possessing firearms and ammunition. After Officer Hartman told Corporal Nail that he could not find any leash, Nail entered the truck cab from the passenger side, and located a leash \u201cunder a pile of items that were all located on the passenger seat.\u201d The dog was caught, put on the leash, and later taken to an animal shelter. Nail also heard ammunition rattling from within the \u201cblack briefcase,\u201d and the two officers agreed that the locked briefcase could not be opened without a search warrant. When questioned about the \u201cblack briefcase,\u201d defendant said he didn\u2019t know anything about it, refused to consent to a search of it, and asked that he be permitted to call his lawyer. The next day the officers applied for a warrant to search the \u201cblack briefcase.\u201d A warrant issued and Corporal Nail forced open the briefcase and found inside a loaded .357 caliber Taurus handgun and nine boxes and a bag of loose .38 and .357 caliber ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">After questioning by federal law enforcement agents, defendant admitted that he had three guns in his residence and consented to a search of his residence, where the additional weapons identified in the indictment were found. The government conceded that the weapons found in the search of defendant\u2019s home should be suppressed, and they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">I. The Search of the Truck</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Defendant first argues that the district court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence found in the search of his truck. As indicated, the district court denied that motion, holding that though there was no warrant to search the truck, the search of the cab of the truck was a valid inventory search of a vehicle about to be lawfully impounded and was a search incident to arrest, and, in either instance, did not violate the \u201creasonableness\u201d requirement of the Fourth Amendment. Ours is a <em>de novo </em>review of whether the facts of a given case meet the Fourth Amendment requirement of reasonableness, and, in the course of our review, the evidence is considered in a light most favorable to the government and, in so doing, a district court\u2019s factual findings will not be disturbed unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Abdenbi, </em>361 F.3d 1282, 1287 (10th Cir., 2004) and <em>United States v. Le, </em>173 F.3d 1258, 1264 (10th Cir.1999). In our view the record supports the district court\u2019s holding that the search of the cab of the truck was a valid inventory search, and, or, a search incident to a lawful arrest. In connection with the former, <em>see, </em>for example, <em>United States v. Haro-Salcedo, </em>107 F.3d 769, 772 (10th Cir.1997). In connection with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>latter, <em>see Thornton v. United States, </em>541 U.S. 615, 124 S.Ct. 2127, 158 L.Ed.2d 905 (2004) and <em>New York v. Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 101 S.Ct. 2860, 69 L.Ed.2d 768 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Further, the record indicates that the defendant \u201crequested\u201d the officers to enter the truck and find a leash for his dog, which at that moment was \u201crunning wild.\u201d Retrieval of his dog was understandably important to the defendant and he asked, several times, the officers to search the truck\u2019s cab for a leash. In this setting, Officer Hartman opened the locked truck door on the driver\u2019s side and started looking for the leash, and a few moments later Officer Nail opened the door on the passenger side and found the leash. Under all these circumstances, the officers entered the truck\u2019s cab with not just defendant\u2019s consent, but his repeated requests to enter and find the dog\u2019s leash.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">II. Sentencing Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">As previously stated, three weapons, each of which was identified in the indictment, were found in a search of defendant\u2019s residence. The district court, with agreement from both the government and the defendant, suppressed the use of those weapons at trial. (We are not here concerned with the propriety of that ruling.) However, at sentencing, the district court increased defendant\u2019s offense level by two levels under U.S.S.G. 2K2.1(b)(1)(A). That guideline provision states that the base offense level for one convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) shall be raised by two levels if the offense involved three to seven firearms. Over defendant\u2019s objections, the district court raised defendant\u2019s base offense level by two levels based on the three firearms found in defendant\u2019s home which had previously been \u201csuppressed\u201d on the grounds that the search was itself unlawful. Counsel argues that it is inconsistent to suppress the use at trial of the three firearms found in defendant\u2019s home, and then turn around and, at sentencing, increase his base offense level because of the firearms found in a search of his home. Despite any facial appeal of this argument, in our view it is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Ryan, </em>236 F.3d 1268, 1272 (10th Cir.2001) where we spoke as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">Thus under the law of this circuit, as well as the law of other circuits to consider the issue, the district court did not err in using the evidence obtained during the illegal search and seizure of Ryan\u2019s vehicle on June 2, 1998, unless there is evidence that the officers\u2019 actions in violating Ryan\u2019s rights were done with the intent to secure an increased sentence. We conclude that there is no such evidence in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"av-dedup-0\">We are not persuaded by counsel\u2019s suggestion that the officers who searched defendant\u2019s home had an \u201cintent to secure an increased sentence\u201d by their search of defendant\u2019s home and the retrieval of three firearms. In the present case, as we said in <em>Ryan, </em>\u201cWe conclude that there is no such evidence in this case.\u201d In this general connection, we reiterate that Officers Hartman and Nail were the only witnesses at the hearing on the motion to suppress, and that is the only evidentiary motion in the present record.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">III. The U.S.S.G. are Unconstitutional</p>\n<p id=\"A3\">Counsel suggests that under the rationale of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the \u201centire federal sentencing guidelines scheme is unconstitutional.\u201d In so doing, counsel recognized that \u201cits [.Blakely\u2019s] import and ramification has yet to be determined, and that, accordingly, counsel raises this issue for the purpose of preserving it for further review.\u201d On the present record, as well as for other obvious reasons, we are disinclined to hold that, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>the basis of <em>Blakely, </em>the \u201centire federal sentencing guidelines scheme\u201d is unconstitutional. <em>United States v. Booker, Fanfan, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) does not compel such result.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b96-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
