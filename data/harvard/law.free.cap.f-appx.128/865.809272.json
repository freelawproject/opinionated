We affirm the conviction but vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-14\">I. Factual Background and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b892-15\">Because we write solely for the parties, we set forth only those facts relevant to this appeal. In December 2000 Agent Claude Thomas, an undercover narcotics investigator with the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General, began investigating Richard Rios, a Philadelphia cocaine dealer. Agent Thomas learned about Rios from an informant, Derrick Proctor, who was also Neely\u2019s brother-in-law. Proctor was unable to set up a meeting between Thomas and Rios. Thus, at Thomas\u2019s request, Proctor agreed to ask Neely for Rios\u2019s phone number. Thomas testified that he told Proctor to describe him to Neely as a record producer named Rock who was interested in purchasing large quantities of cocaine from Rios.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-16\">In mid-December 2000 Proctor called Neely and asked for Rios\u2019s phone number. Neely testified that Proctor told him that some people from the junior black mafia were trying to get into the drug business. Neely also stated that he did not want to give Proctor the number. According to Thomas, Proctor told him that Neely wanted to speak to him personally. Thomas subsequently called Neely on December 12, 2000. He testified that Neely told him he could supply the large quantities of cocaine and crack cocaine that he understood \u201cRock\u201d was looking for. Neely, on the other hand, testified that he told Thomas that he did not want to get involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-17\">Thomas recounted that he spoke with Neely multiple times the next day, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>Neely tried to arrange a cocaine deal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Eventually Neely told Thomas that the deal had fallen through. After this, Thomas made periodic attempts to call Neely and spoke with him a couple of times in an effort to build a friendly relationship with Neely. (These phone calls occurred at an apparently difficult time in Neely\u2019s life\u2014 when he had recently lost his job and had problems with his marriage.) Thomas stated that, when the two discussed drugs, Neely used \u201cstreet terminology for narcotics.\u201d Neely, however, did not offer to give Thomas Rios\u2019s phone number in the course of these conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">On January 14, 2001, Thomas spoke again with Neely, who told Thomas that he would communicate with his supplier and get back to Thomas about a potential drug transaction. Thomas testified that Neely called him later that day and told him that his supplier was ready to sell the narcotics and that the transaction would occur the following day. According to Thomas, Neely spoke with him several times the next day to confirm the transaction and inform him of the amount of cocaine that was available.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">That evening, Thomas met Neely, and Neely drove him to Rios\u2019s house. Neely remained inside Rios\u2019s house during the transaction. Thomas left the house to get money to pay for the drugs and gave an arrest signal to other agents stationed outside. Neely and Rios were then arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">A grand jury returned an eight-count indictment against Neely and Rios. Before his trial, Neely served notice of his intent to mount an entrapment defense. Rios pleaded guilty prior to trial and agreed to testify against Neely. Neely\u2019s first trial ended in a mistrial after the jury declared itself deadlocked.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">At Neely\u2019s second trial, Rios testified, <em>inter alia, </em>that he had previously sold Neely cocaine, including nine ounces of cocaine approximately two months prior to their arrests. Rios stated that Neely told him he intended to sell the nine ounces of cocaine for a profit. Rios also testified that, about one month before their arrests, Neely came to his house and purchased a kilogram of cocaine, also for resale.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">The jury, which had been instructed on Neely\u2019s entrapment defense, found him of violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and 860 and acquitted him of various other charges. Neely was sentenced to 78 months imprisonment and five years of supervised release. Neely now appeals from his conviction and sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-12\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b893-13\">Neely argues first that his conviction cannot stand because the Government\u2019s coercive conduct was so outrageous that it violated his due process rights. We have held that \u201cthe defense of outrageous government conduct is based on an alleged defect in the institution of the prosecution itself.\u201d <em>United States v. Pitt, </em>198 F.3d 751, 760 (3d Cir.1999). Therefore, this defense must be raised in a pre-trial motion \u201cunless the evidence supporting the claim of outrageous government conduct is not known to the defendant prior to trial.\u201d <em>Id; see also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3)(A) (stating that \u201ca motion alleging a defect in instituting the prosecution\u201d must be made before trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-14\">It is apparent from the record that Neely knew of the alleged \u201coutrageous conduct\u201d in this case \u2014 namely, Thomas\u2019s acts in speaking with him and inducing him to commit a crime during an apparent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>ly difficult time in Neely\u2019s life \u2014 before trial because he filed a pre-trial notice that he planned to mount an entrapment defense which would, of course, be based on that same conduct. In addition, Neely certainly would have known about the allegedly outrageous conduct before his second trial after hearing the evidence the Government presented at his first trial. Accordingly, Neely waived his outrageous government conduct defense by failing to raise it in a pre-trial motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(e) (providing that \u201c[a] party waives any Rule 12(b)(3) defense, objection, or request not raised by the deadline the court sets under Rule 12(c)\u201d for the filing of pre-trial motions); <em>cf. Pitt, </em>193 F.3d at 760 (holding that defendant had waived his outrageous government conduct defense when he failed to raise it prior to trial and had \u201cno good explanation\u201d for his failure to do so).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Second, Neely argues that the evidence presented by the Government at trial was insufficient to rebut his entrapment defense \u2014 specifically, that the Government\u2019s evidence to prove Neely\u2019s predisposition to commit the crimes with which he was charged beyond a reasonable doubt was lacking. Because Neely did not file a timely motion for judgment of acquittal, we review this argument under the plain error standard. <em>See United States v. Powell, </em>113 F.3d 464, 466-67 (3d Cir.1997). We must look at \u201cthe sufficiency of the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government ] and credit all reasonable inferences that support the verdict[ ].\u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>280 F.3d 318, 342 (3d Cir.2002). Put another way, we will sustain the verdict \u201cif any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">An entrapment defense has two elements. The defendant must prove; \u201c(1) government inducement of the crime, and (2) a lack of predisposition on the part of the defendant to engage in the criminal conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Wright, </em>921 F.2d 42, 44 (3d Cir.1990) (citing, <em>inter alia, Mathews v. United States, </em>485 U.S. 58, 63, 108 S.Ct. 883, 99 L.Ed.2d 54 (1988)). \u201cAfter the defendant has made this showing, ... the government then has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that it did not entrap the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">Neely asserts that the Government\u2019s evidence as to his predisposition to commit the drug offenses for which he was convicted was insufficient because the only evidence of predisposition put on by the Government at trial \u201cwas the uncorroborated testimony of ... Rios, a paid government informant and an admitted drug dealer.\u201d Br. at 13. The fact that Rios\u2019s testimony was uncorroborated does not, by itself, require us to overturn the conviction. <em>See Perez, </em>280 F.3d at 344 (stating that \u201cuncorroborated accomplice testimony may constitutionally provide the exclusive basis for a criminal conviction\u201d (internal quotation and citations omitted)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>Rios testified that Neely had twice bought cocaine from him with the intent to resell it before the events at issue in this case occurred. Rational jurors could have chosen to credit his testimony over Neely\u2019s, and it is not our role to disturb such credibility determinations. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>302 F.3d 139, 149-50 (3d Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1140, 123 S.Ct. 937, 154 L.Ed.2d 836 (2003). This is particularly true where, as here, the defendant had an opportunity to cross-examine the cooperating witness and elicit testimony regarding the witness\u2019s interaction and arrangements with the Government.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Perez, </em>280 F.3d at 344-45. Moreover, Thomas\u2019s testimony also indicated Neely\u2019s willingness to engage in the drug transaction at issue. <em>Cf. Gambino, </em>788 F.2d at 945 (stating that the Government may prove propensity by, among other things, showing that the defendant exhibited \u201ca willingness to commit the crime for which he is charged as evidenced by the accused\u2019s ready response to the inducement\u201d (internal quotation omitted)). In sum, looking at the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, it presented sufficient evidence as to Neely\u2019s predisposition to commit the crimes with which he was charged, thus defeating his entrapment defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">III. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Neely also challenges his sentence based on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Having determined that the sentencing issues Neely raises are best determined by the District Court in the first instance, our protocol is to vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\"><em>% </em>s;\u00ab %</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">Because Neely\u2019s arguments that his conviction should be overturned are unavailing, we affirm his conviction. His sentence, on the other hand, is vacated, and the case is remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b893-8\">. Neely, however, countered that he did not speak to Thomas again until Christmas Day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b893-15\">. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b894-5\">. In any event, we doubt the success of Neely\u2019s arguments on this issue. Among other things, <em>United States v. Twigg, </em>588 F.2d 373 (3d Cir.1978), the main case on which Neely relies, has been called into doubt. <em>Pitt, </em>193 F.3d at 761 n. 11; <em>see also United States v. Gambino, </em>788 F.2d 938, 945 n. 6 (3d Cir. 1986) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b894-6\">. Neely\u2019s reliance on <em>Hansford v. United States, </em>303 F.2d 219 (D.C.Cir. 1962), for the proposition that uncorroborated testimony regarding a defendant\u2019s prior bad acts should not be admitted to rebut an entrapment defense is misplaced. <em>Hansford </em>merely stands for the well-settled principle that the probative value of such testimony must be weighed against its prejudicial value; it does not hold that such testimony is always inadmissible. <em>Id. </em>at 225-26 (holding that the admission of the uncorroborated testimony of a police officer regarding an alleged prior offense was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>error because that testimony was highly prejudicial when, among other things, the officer was unable to produce any contemporaneous report of the prior incident). In addition, Neely is not challenging the admissibility of Rios\u2019s testimony. He is challenging its persuasiveness. Thus, <em>Hansford </em>is off point. Moreover, as the Government points out, the D.C. Circuit Court later noted that <em>Hansford </em>was \"expressly limited to its 'particular factual situation.' \u201d <em>United States v. Rippy, </em>606 F.2d 1150, 1155-56 n. 35 (D.C.Cir.1979) (holding that a government informant's testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s prior drug sales was probative of the defendant's inclination to sell drugs and that its admission was not error because, <em>inter alia, </em>the defendant put his state of mind at issue by raising an entrapment defense).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b895-21\">. On cross-examination, Neely\u2019s counsel obtained testimony from Rios regarding his drug dealing activities, his criminal history, and his plea agreement with the Government (App. at 250-60).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
