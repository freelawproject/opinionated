We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-15\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b426-16\">In May 2000, defendant-appellee Jeffery Overton applied for credit disability insurance under a policy (\u201cthe Policy\u201d) from American Bankers through its agent, Con-seco Finance Services Corporation (\u201cCon-seco\u201d), from whom Overton obtained a loan to refinance his home. The Policy\u2019s schedule states that the term of disability benefits is 12 months, with an effective date of May 8, 2000, and an expiration date of May 8, 2001.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-17\">Overton became physically disabled in August 2000, three months after the effective date of the Policy. He submitted a claim for disability benefits to American Bankers, which honored the claim. American Bankers disbursed disability benefits from August 11, 2000 to May 8, 2001, the expiration date of the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-18\">Before the Policy expired, Overton asked American Bankers for assurance that he would receive disability benefits for the entire 84 months. In February 2004, Overton wrote American Bankers, asserting a claim for an additional 75 months of disability benefits. He also threatened to sue American Bankers if it ignored the deadline in the letter or denied the claim. American Bankers informed Overton that his claim was under review. Overton responded by giving American Bankers a new deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>When Overton heard nothing from American Bankers by the new deadline, he sued American Bankers and Beverly Taylor in Mississippi state court on May 10, 2004. American Bankers was served with notice of Overton\u2019s suit the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Unbeknownst to Overton, American Bankers \u2014 in response to Overton\u2019s intent to sue \u2014 had filed a declaratory action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi on April 23, 2004. American Bankers\u2019s complaint sought a declaration of its rights and obligations pursuant to the Policy issued to Overton. Overton was not served with notice of American Bankers\u2019s federal lawsuit until May 19, 2004, nine days after Overton had filed the state court lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">In June, American Bankers timely removed Overton\u2019s state court suit to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, alleging diversity under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 and the fraudulent joinder of Taylor. Overton filed a motion to remand, which the Southern District granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">In the Northern District, Overton filed a motion to dismiss, transfer, or stay American Bankers\u2019s declaratory judgment action. In October, the Northern District granted Overton\u2019s motion to dismiss. The court found that dismissal of American Bankers\u2019s declaratory judgment action was proper because (1) Overton\u2019s pending state court action was most likely a nonremova-ble action presenting solely state law issues,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) the claims of the parties could be satisfactorily litigated in the pending action, and (3) piecemeal litigation would occur. American Bankers timely filed its notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a federal declaratory judgment action for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-14\">The Federal Declaratory Judgment Act provides that \u201c[i]n a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction ... any court of the United States ... <em>may </em>declare the rights and other legal realtions of any interested party seeking such declaration ____\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although the permissive \u201cmay\u201d in Section 2201(a) gives the district court broader discretion to decline to hear a declaratory judgment action than it has in other kinds of actions, the district court\u2019s discretion is not wholly unfettered.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To determine whether to decide or to dismiss a federal declaratory judgment action, a district court <em>\u201cmust </em>determine: (1) whether the declaratory action is justiciable; (2) whether the court has the authority to grant declaratory relief; <em>and </em>(3) whether to exercise its discretion to decide or dismiss the action.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We note at the outset the use of the conjunctive \u201cand,\u201d requiring the district court to consider all three factors. Here, the district court failed to consider whether American Banker\u2019s declaratory judgment action is justiciable and whether the court has the authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>grant relief.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Further, in <em>Trejo, </em>we outlined seven nonexclusive factors that a district court must consider when it exercises it discretion under <em>Orix\u2019s </em>factor (3) to dismiss a declaratory judgment action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">(1) whether there is a pending state action in which all of the matters in controversy may be fully litigated;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">(2) whether the plaintiff filed suit in anticipation of a lawsuit filed by the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">(3) whether the plaintiff engaged in forum shopping in bringing the suit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">(4) whether possible inequities in allowing the declaratory plaintiff to gain precedence in time or to change forums exist;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-9\">(5) whether the federal court is a convenient forum for the parties and witnesses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-10\">(6) whether retaining the lawsuit would serve the purposes of judicial economy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-11\">(7) whether the federal court is being called on to construe a state judicial decree involving the same parties and entered by the court before whom the parallel state suit between the same parties is pending.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">We have repeatedly held that these \u201cseven <em>Trejo </em>factors ... <em>must </em>be considered <em>on the record, </em>before a discretionary, nonmer-its dismissal of a declaratory judgment action occurs.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We have recognized that these seven factors \u201caddress three broad considerations \u2014 federalism, fairness/improper forum shopping, and efficiency.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When a district court fails to consider the seven <em>Trejo </em>factors <em>on the record, </em>we have consistently made clear that it abuses its discretion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-20\">Here, the district court dismissed American Bankers\u2019s declaratory judgment action because: (1) \u201cthe pending related action brought by [Overton] appears ... to be a nonremovable state court action presenting solely state law issues\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe claims of the parties can satisfactorily be adjudicated in the pending relation action; both parties in this action are parties in the relation action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-21\">We hold that the district court abused its discretion when it failed to consider the seven <em>Trejo </em>factors <em>on the record. </em>The district court\u2019s terse analysis considered only the first factor \u2014 whether there is a pending state action in which all of the matters in controversy may be fully litigated. Thus, it failed to consider on the record the other six <em>Trejo </em>factors. Indeed, the district court\u2019s heavy reliance on the presence of solely state law issues in dismissing American Bankers\u2019s action is contrary to our precedent. We have held more than once that when the declaratory judgment action is properly within the district court\u2019s jurisdiction \u2014 as it is here \u2014 a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>district court may not dismiss that action \u201c \u2018simply because it does not involve a question of federal law.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ao4\">Further, as noted above, the district court failed to determine whether American Bankers\u2019s declaratory judgment action presents a justiciable controversy and whether the court may properly grant relief here.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In light of the district court\u2019s failure to conduct the mandated analysis on the record when it determined whether to entertain American Bankers\u2019s action, we are forced to hold that the court abused its discretion. Accordingly, we reverse its dismissal of American Bankers\u2019s declaratory judgment action.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">We are aware that we are authorized to review the facts of this case in light of <em>Trejo </em>and its factors, but we decline to do so. Although American Bankers briefed the <em>Trejo </em>factors comprehensively, Over-ton merely provides us with conclusional allegations that bear on each factor at the end of his brief.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Overton\u2019s brief concentrates mainly \u2014 as does American Bankers\u2019s initial brief, to some extent \u2014 on the \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d rule. Overton argues that this rule should not apply here because American Bankers filed its suit in anticipation of Overton\u2019s state court suit and did so in bad faith. We find no indication from case law that the \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d rule plays a part in the circumstance that we face today \u2014 two actions pending, but one is in <em>state </em>court and the other in <em>federal </em>court. As American Bankers correctly points out in its reply brief, the \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d rule applies only when two similar actions are pending in two <em>federal </em>courts,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> which is not the case have here (especially now that the Southern District has remanded Overton\u2019s suit to state court).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">We vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of American Bankers\u2019s declaratory judgment action and remand this matter to the district court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion, <em>viz., </em>consideration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>the <em>Orix </em>and <em>Trejo </em>factors on the record to determine whether it should exercise its discretion to entertain American Bankers\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b426-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
