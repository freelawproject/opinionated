He first argues that the waiver-of-appeal provision in his plea agreement is unenforceable. Because the record reveals that the district court did not specifically advise Merrill that he had waived the right to appeal his sentence as part of his plea, Merrill is correct that the waiver-of-appeal provision in his plea agreement does not bar the instant appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(N); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 518 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-18\">Merrill next argues, for the first time on appeal, that the adjustments he received for being a career offender and for possessing a firearm under the Sentencing Guidelines violated his constitutional rights following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The argument is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number><em>filed, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, \u2014 S.Ct. -, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-, No. 04-9517 (U.S. Mar. <em>31, </em>2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">In light of <em>Booker, </em>the district court erred in computing Merrill\u2019s sentence based on judicially determined facts under a mandatory guidelines system, and that error was both plain and obvious. <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-521. Nevertheless, because Merrill has not demonstrated that the district court would have reached a different conclusion had it known that the Guidelines were advisory only, he has failed to demonstrate that the error affected his substantial rights.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 520-521. Accordingly, Merrill has failed to carry his burden of demonstrating plain error, and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b420-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b421-18\"> Merrill\u2019s argument that <em>Mares </em>was wrongly decided is unavailing. Absent era <em>banc </em>reconsideration or a superseding contrary decision of the Supreme Court, one panel may not overrule the decision of a prior panel. <em>United States v. Ruff, </em>984 F.2d 635, 640 (5th Cir. 1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
