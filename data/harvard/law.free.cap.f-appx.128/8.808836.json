To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). <em>Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1183 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc). We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Garcia v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1208, 1209 (9th Cir.2000). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">We are without jurisdiction to review Qamaruddin\u2019s contentions challenging the BIA\u2019s February 27, 2003 dismissal of his appeal, or the BIA\u2019s July 2, 2003 denial of his motion to reconsider because he did not file a timely petition for review from either order. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>315 F.3d 1186, 1188 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that time limit to file a petition for review is mandatory, jurisdictional, and cannot be tolled).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in its December 1, 2003 denial of Qamaruddin\u2019s motion to reopen to reapply for asylum based on changed country conditions in Pakistan. The periodical articles submitted by Qamaruddin constituted only general background material, were not probative of his claim, and, in any event, did not establish prima facie eligibility for relief. <em>See Konstantinova v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 528, 530 (9th Cir.1999) (upholding denial of motion to reopen where petitioner introduced evidence that was too general in nature to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b35-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
