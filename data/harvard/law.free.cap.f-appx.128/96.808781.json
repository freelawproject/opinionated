Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We previously affirmed Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>lant\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A)(viii), 846, and carrying a firearm during a drug trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i). <em>See United States v. Senn, </em>116 Fed.Appx. 247 (11th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court has vacated our prior decision and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of its decision in <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Nowhere in his initial brief did Appellant raise a constitutional challenge to his sentence or assert any error based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or its progeny. Although Appellant did request an opportunity to file a supplement brief addressing <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), his request was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Appellant\u2019s <em>Blakely/Booker </em>claim was not timely raised in this Court. As there is nothing in the Supreme Court remand suggesting that we treat this claim as timely, we deem Appellant\u2019s untimely <em>Blakely/Booker </em>claim abandoned. <em>See United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261, 1262-63 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Curtis, </em>380 F.3d 1308, 1311 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(Blakely </em>claim untimely when raised for the first time in a request to file supplemental briefing).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Accordingly, we reinstate our previous opinion in this ease and affirm Appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">OPINION REINSTATED; CONVICTION AND SENTENCE AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
