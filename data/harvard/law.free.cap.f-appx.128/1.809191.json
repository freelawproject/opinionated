We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a. We review the denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Celis-Castellano v. Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 888, 890 (9th Cir.2002). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-25\">The record indicates that petitioner signed the order to show cause in two places, affixed his fingerprint once to acknowledge that the order had been read to him in his native Spanish, and that a copy of the order, written in English and Span<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>ish, was given to him. The IJ committed no abuse of discretion in applying the \u201cpresumption of regularity\u201d to find that actual notice of the hearing had been effected. Petitioner failed to overcome this presumption with his self-serving affidavit that he did not understand the immigration officer\u2019s Spanish, does not remember actually receiving a copy of the notice, and did not realize that he was been placed in deportation proceedings. <em>See Red Top Mercury Mines, Inc. v. United States, </em>887 F.2d 198, 202-03 (9th Cir.1989) (upholding presumption that public officers have properly discharged their official duties).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">Petitioner\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b27-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
