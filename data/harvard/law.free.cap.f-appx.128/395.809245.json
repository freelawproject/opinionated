If his appellate brief is afforded liberal construction, Samuels contends that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his claims as frivolous. First, Samuels challenges the determination that his lost property claim was not cognizable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. For purposes of his claim that prison guards interfered with his attempts to obtain relief through the state administrative grievance process, Samuels raises an exhaustion argument, contending that the actions of the prison guards delayed his ability to pursue federal relief. Finally, Samuels argues, for the first time, that the prison guards acted with retaliatory intent. New allegations may not be raised and will not be addressed for the first time on appeal. <em>Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, we decline consideration of Samuels\u2019s retaliation argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-14\">As determined by the district court, Samuels\u2019s argument concerning the confiscation of his radio headphones fails because Louisiana provides a post-deprivation remedy for property loss. <em>See Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 541-44, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981); <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984); La. Civ.Code Ann. art 2315 (West 1997). Similarly, Samuels fails to show that the district court abused its discretion when rejecting his allegations of denied access to the state administrative grievance procedure. <em>See Newsome v. EEOC, </em>301 F.3d 227, 231 (5th Cir .2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-16\">Samuels\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; see <em>also Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Samuels is cautioned that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal count as two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>108 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Samuels is further cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b422-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
