In his habeas petition, Greene challenges the calculation of his good conduct time (\u201cGCT\u201d) by the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d). For the following reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-23\">Greene is currently incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution in Fair-ton, New Jersey, serving a sentence of 130 months imposed by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. According to the BOP, Greene is eligible under the applicable statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b), to earn up to 509 days of GCT, <em>i.e., </em>54 days of GCT per year of time he will actually serve. The BOP projects Greene\u2019s release date as October 26, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-24\">After administratively challenging the BOP\u2019s calculation of his GCT, Greene filed a \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition in the District Court. Greene argues that \u00a7 3624(b) allows him to earn up to 54 days per year based on the term of sentence imposed, not based on time actually served, and that the BOP\u2019s calculation deprives him of the amount to which he is entitled by statute. Citing opinions from several other courts, the District Court rejected Greene\u2019s position and dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>his habeas petition. Greene appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">We will affirm the District Court\u2019s order. As the Government explains in its brief, we recently resolved the issue in <em>O\u2019Donald v. Johns, </em>402 F.3d 172 (3d Cir. 2005). In <em>O\u2019Donald, </em>we held that the meaning of \u00a7 3624(b) is ambiguous and thus deferred to the BOP\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the statute. <em>See O\u2019Donald, </em>402 F.3d at 174. Greene\u2019s challenge, identical to the one raised and rejected in <em>O\u2019Donald, </em>is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">In short, for the reasons described in <em>O\u2019Donald, </em>the District Court properly rejected Greene\u2019s challenge to the BOP\u2019s calculation of his GCT. Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order dismissing his habeas corpus petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b961-16\">. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a). We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its findings of fact. <em>See Ruggiano v. Reish, </em>307 F.3d 121, 126 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
