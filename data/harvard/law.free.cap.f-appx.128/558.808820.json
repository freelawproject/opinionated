At the jury trial, Campbell moved for a mistrial based on a statement the government made during closing arguments. The district court denied the motion for a mistrial. The jury found Campbell guilty on five of the six counts, and guilty of a lesser included offense on the remaining count. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced Campbell to 364 months imprisonment. Campbell appeals, arguing the district court abused its discretion in failing to grant a mistrial and his sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-18\">Campbell argues the district court abused its discretion in failing to grant a mistrial based on a statement the government made during closing arguments. During closing arguments, the government stated \u201cJust as the burden is on the Government to prove that [the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt], the burden is on the defendant for his own actions.\u201d Campbell objected. The district court sustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard the statement. Campbell then moved for a mistrial, which the district court denied. Although the comment was improper, Campbell\u2019s argument fails because he cannot show the remarks prejudicially affected his substantial rights so as to deprive him of a fair trial. <em>See United States v. O\u2019Dell, </em>204 F.3d 829, 834 (8th Cir.2000) (noting that a mistrial may be granted for prosecutorial misconduct in closing arguments when (1) the remarks are in fact improper, and (2) the remarks prejudicially affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial). \u201cIn assessing the prejudicial impact of prosecutorial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>misconduct we consider: 1) the cumulative effect of the misconduct; 2) the strength of the properly admitted evidence; and 3) the curative actions taken by the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Wadlington, </em>233 F.3d 1067, 1077 (8th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Here, the district court instructed the jury to disregard the statement, the cumulative effect of the statement was minimal, and the properly admitted evidence was strong. We determine that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial. <em>See United States v. Cole, </em>380 F.3d 422, 426-27 (8th Cir.2004) (reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a mistrial for an abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Campbell also argues his mandatory minimum sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Under the circumstances of this case, Campbell\u2019s 364-month sentence is very harsh. We reject Campbell\u2019s argument, however, because his sentence, required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s five-year statutory minimum sentence for count two and twenty-five-year statutory minimum sentence for count six, does not violate the Eighth Amendment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c); <em>United States v. Farmer, </em>73 F.3d 836, 840 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>518 U.S. 1028, 116 S.Ct. 2570, 135 L.Ed.2d 1086 (1996); <em>see also Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>501 U.S. 957, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b585-16\">. The Honorable Stephen N.
