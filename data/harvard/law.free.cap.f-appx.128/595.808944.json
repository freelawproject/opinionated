We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review summary judgment de novo, <em>Bahrampour v. Lampert, </em>356 F.3d 969, 973 (9th Cir. 2004), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">Jackson contends that defendants violated equal protection guarantees by providing meat to Jewish inmates receiving a Kosher diet, but providing only a vegetarian Halal diet. This contention lacks merit because defendants offered evidence that the Kosher diet does not contain meat and Jackson failed to \u201cintroduce some significant probative evidence tending to support [his] complaint.\u201d <em>Bahrampour, </em>356 F.3d at 974 (internal quotation omitted). Jackson\u2019s other equal protection contentions lack merit because he failed to present evidence either of discriminatory intent, <em>see Washington v. Davis, </em>426 U.S. 229, 239-40, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976), or that \u201cdefendants burdened the practice of his religion, by preventing him from engaging in conduct mandated by his faith,\u201d <em>Freeman v. Arpaio, </em>125 F.3d 732, 736 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">Jackson contends that defendants violated his First Amendment rights by preparing and serving food with utensils that had previously been in contact with food items prohibited under Islamic law. This contention lacks merit because defendants offered evidence that the food preparation, service and washing procedures did not violate Islamic law, and Jackson failed to offer any evidence to the contrary. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-13\">Jackson contends that after he applied to receive a Halal diet the defendants retaliated against him by transferring him to another facility. This contention fails because Jackson carried the burden of proving that the retaliatory action had no legitimate penological interest, but he offered no evidence beyond circumstantial timing. <em>See Pratt v. Rowland, </em>65 F.3d 802, 806, 808 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-14\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Jackson\u2019s request to order scientific testing to determine if certain Kosher food items contained meat, because Jackson faded to offer any evidence that these items did contain meat. <em>See State of Cal. v. Camp</em>bell, 138 F.3d 772, 779 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-15\">Jackson\u2019s remaining contentions are also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b623-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
