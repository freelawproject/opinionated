We have jurisdiction to review the district court order pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291 (West 1993). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3145(c) (West 2000). Finding that the record supports detention pending trial, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">Under normal circumstances, we review a district court detention order for clear error. <em>See United States v. Clark, </em>865 F.2d 1433, 1437 (4th Cir.1989) (en banc); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>753 F.2d 329, 333 (4th Cir.1985). Here, however, the form used by the district court in reporting its reasons for ordering detention recited an incorrect legal standard. The Bail Reform Act requires that \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d support the district court conclusion that no conditions other than detention will reasonably assure the safety of any other person and the community. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3142(f)(2) (West 2000). But the form used by the district court here indicated that its findings were based only on the preponderance of the evidence. Accordingly, we do not afford the usual deference to the district court conclusion that releasing Simms would pose a threat to the community. <em>See Consolidation Coal Co. v. Local 1643, </em>48 F.3d 125, 128 (4th Cir.1995) (\u201c[T]he clearly erroneous rule does not protect findings made on the basis of the application of incorrect legal standards.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-13\">Nevertheless, based on the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3142(g) (West 2000) and our own review of the facts as found by the district court, we conclude that the detention order should be affirmed. The district court found that Simms has a substantial criminal history that includes convictions for violent crimes and a track record of retaliating against those who have reported him to authorities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3142(g)(3)(A). Simms also conceded that the weight of the Government\u2019s evidence against him in the instant case is considerable. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3142(g)(2). However, we instruct the district court to correct the error in the form it uses to report its findings in future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
