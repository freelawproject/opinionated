Reid, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Miami, FL, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b779-24\">Before CARNES, HULL and WILSON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b779-25\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b779-26\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(4)(A)(ii) requires district courts, before imposing sentence, to \u201caddress the defendant personally in order to permit the defendant to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence.\u201d Guillermo Galvez Carmona contends that the district court failed to comply with that Rule. Galvez now states that, at sentencing, he wanted the opportunity to explain that he committed his crime because he was under duress. Specifically, he says that Colombian guerillas forced him and his wife to travel to the United States with heroin in their luggage.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-27\">Because Galvez did not object at sentencing, our review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Quintana, </em>300 F.3d 1227, 1231-32 (11th Cir.2002). To satisfy the plain-error standard, we must find that (1) the district court committed error, (2) the error was plain or obvious, and (3) the error affected substantial rights. <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number><em>States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 730-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). If these three prongs are met, we may correct the error if it \u201cseriously affeet[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736, 113 S.Ct. at 1779 (internal quotations and citation omitted). Galvez\u2019s claim fails at the very first prong: there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">The sentencing hearing was brief. The government stated that there were no outstanding issues, reiterated that the safety valve applied and recommended that Gal-vez be sentenced at the low end of the applicable guidelines range. The following exchange then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-5\">THE COURT: Is there anything <em>from the defendant </em>or defense counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-6\">MR. NORRIS: Your Honor, just that produces a guidelines range.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-7\">THE COURT: 111 go over that.... [The court then set out the guidelines range.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-8\">Is there anything from the defense <em>or the defendant?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-9\">MR. NORRIS [defense counsel]: Nothing, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-10\">THE COURT: It is my intention to give the low end of the guideline range. You might be able to talk me out of it if you work real hard at it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-11\">THE DEFENDANT: I hope God hears you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-12\">THE COURT: I\u2019m sure he does. That is one thing I\u2019m confident of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-13\">MR. NORRIS: In that case, you Honor, we have nothing further.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-14\">THE COURT: You are certainly welcome to say something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-15\">Mr. NORRIS: With the Olympics going on, Judge, it is the appropriate time the wisdom of saying don\u2019t snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 4 \u2014 5 (emphasis added). The court then imposed a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range and declined to impose a fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-18\">Galvez was not denied the opportunity to alloeute. The court twice asked Galvez if he had anything to say and once engaged in a brief exchange with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
