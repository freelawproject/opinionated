At sentencing, the district court granted the Government\u2019s motion and imposed an upward departure and sentenced Bethea to five years\u2019 imprisonment, the statutory maximum for the offense. The court, after considering the guidelines and the factors under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2004), stated that even if the guidelines were not mandatory, it would impose the same sentence. On appeal, Bethea cites <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), for the proposition that the court erred in imposing a sentence under the sentencing guidelines. Bethea further argues the upward enhancement was improper. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Because the district court\u2019s alternate sentence was based upon the guidelines and the factors under \u00a7 3553(a) and was not greater than the statutory maximum, we find the upward departure and the five year sentence to be harmless error. We further find the sentence reasonable. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764-67 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
