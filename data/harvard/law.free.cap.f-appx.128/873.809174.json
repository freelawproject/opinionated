The BIA affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of Setiawan\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), and protection under the Convention Against Torture (the \u201cTorture Convention\u201d). Setiawan, a practicing Christian of Chinese descent, claims to have suffered past persecution and to fear future persecution because of his ethnicity and his religion. As we write for the parties only, we do not set out the facts. We conclude that the BIA\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence, and we deny Setiawan\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-12\">Because Setiawan does not raise any argument in his brief regarding the BIA\u2019s denial of protection under the Torture Convention beyond the conelusory statement that the BIA erred in denying protection, he has not preserved the issue for review. <em>Lie v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 530, 532, n. 1 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-15\">We will affirm the BIA\u2019s decision that Setiawan was not eligible for asylum if there is substantial evidence to support it. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). The administrative findings of fact supporting a final order of removal cannot be reversed unless the administrative record was such that \u201ca reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A)-(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-16\">An applicant for asylum bears the burden of establishing that he has suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a)-(b); <em>Abdille v. Ashcroft, </em>242 F.3d 477, 482 (3d Cir.2001). If an applicant cannot meet the standard for asylum, this Court may assume that the applicant cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal. <em>Lukwago v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 157, 182 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-17\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-18\">To qualify for withholding of removal, an alien must show that if he returned to his country, it is more likely than not that his life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Senathirajah v. INS, </em>157 F.3d 210, 215 (3d Cir.1998). If an alien is able to establish past persecution, then it is presumed that his life or freedom would be threatened were he to return to his country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(1)(i) (2004). \u201cIn order to establish eligibility for asylum on the basis of past persecution, an applicant must show (1) an inci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>dent, or incidents, that rise to the level of persecution; (2) that is on account of one of the statutorily-protected grounds; and (3) is committed by the government or forces the government is either unable or unwilling to control.\u201d <em>Abdulrahman v. Ashcroft, 330 F.3d 587, 592 (3d </em>Cir.2003) (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">\u201c \u2018[Persecution\u2019 is an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive.\u201d <em>Fatin v. INS, </em>12 F.3d 1233, 1243 (3d Cir. 1993); <em>accord Fisher v. INS, 79 </em>F.3d 955, 961 (9th Cir.1996) <em>(en </em>banc) (\u201cPersecution is an extreme concept, which ordinarily does not include \u2018[discrimination on the basis of race or religion, as morally reprehensible as it may be.\u2019 \u201d (alteration in original) (citation omitted)); <em>see also Nelson v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir.2000) (\u201cTo qualify as persecution, a person\u2019s experience must rise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Setiawan alleges that he and his family suffered several violent attacks by street thugs in Indonesia, but the BIA\u2019s conclusion that these attacks did not rise to the level of persecution is supported by substantial evidence. Victims of discrimination and random violence of the sort Setia-wan alleges are not victims of persecution as legally defined; the harm is not of a sufficient degree. Moreover, the alleged attack by the \u201csinging beggars\u201d or \u201croad singers\u201d does not constitute persecution because it was not on account of a protected ground. On Setiawan\u2019s own telling, the thugs were seeking money, not seeking to harm Setiawan on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. There is no evidence that the road singers targeted Setiawan and his family because they were Indonesians of Chinese descent, or because they were Christians, or because they were on their way to church.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">Finally, Setiawan offers no evidence in support of his claim that the State Department, major non-governmental organizations, and news agencies have reported \u201cserious and increasing attacks on Christians in Indonesia.\u201d The riots in May of 1998 and the events that Setiawan witnessed were terrible. But he offers no evidence that these events were the norm before or since, much less that attacks on Christians or persons of Chinese descent are increasing in frequency or severity. Nor does he offer evidence that the Indonesian government is unable or unwilling to stop such attacks. <em>See Abdulrahman, </em>330 F.3d at 592. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to compel the conclusion that there is a pattern or practice of persecuting persons similarly situated to Setiawan, and Setiawan cannot be relieved of the duty to demonstrate that he has been or would be individually targeted for persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(i)(A)-(B); <em>Abdille v. Ashcroft, </em>242 F.3d 477, 483-84 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">TV.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">As Setiawan failed to establish his eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the higher standard of eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Lukwago, </em>329 F.3d at 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">For the reasons given above, we deny Setiawan\u2019s petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
