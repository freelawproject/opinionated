We assume that the parties are familiar with the facts, the procedural history, and the scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-20\">The district court declined to equitably subrogate Neiman\u2019s interest in the proceeds of a sale of real property to that of a prior lienholder. Under New York law, \u201c \u2018[wjhere property of one person is used in discharging an obligation owed by another or a lien upon the property of another, under such circumstances that the other would be unjustly enriched by the retention of the benefit thus conferred, the former is entitled to be subrogated to the position of the obligee or lienholder.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bermuda Trust Co. v. Ameropan Oil Corp., </em>266 A.D.2d 251, 698 N.Y.S.2d 691, 692 (2d Dep\u2019t 1999) (quoting <em>King v. Pel-kofski </em>20 N.Y.2d 326, 333, 282 N.Y.S.2d 753, 229 N.E.2d 435 (1967)). Subrogation, however, \u201cis unavailable if payments are made voluntarily.\u201d <em>Bermuda Trust, </em>698 N.Y.S.2d at 692; <em>see also Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Ranger Ins. Co., </em>190 A.D.2d 395, 599 N.Y.S.2d 347, 348 (4th Dep\u2019t 1993) (\u201cIt is well settled that \u2018[a] mere volunteer or intermeddler will not be substituted in the place of a person whose rights he seeks to acquire, simply because he has paid a debt, or discharged an obligation, for which that person was responsible.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Koehler v. Hughes, </em>148 N.Y. 507, 511, 42 N.E. 1051 (1896)). Similarly, the district court may consider whether the potential subrogee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>acted negligently. <em>Roth v. Porush, </em>281 A.D.2d 612, 722 N.Y.S.2d 566, 568 (2d Dep\u2019t 2001) (equitable subrogation inapplicable where \u201c[t]he record indicates that there were facts which should have led the ... defendants and their title insurance company to conduct further inquiry\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">In declining Neiman\u2019s equitable subro-gation request, the district court found that Neiman was an ineligible volunteer and had negligently failed to perfect his lien. Under New York law, \u201cthe decision to apply equitable subrogation is committed to the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>United States v. Baran, </em>996 F.2d 25, 29 (2d Cir.1993). \u201cEither an error of law or a clear error of fact may constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Charette v. Town of Oyster Bay, </em>159 F.3d 749, 755 (2d Cir.1998). Nei-man points to no error of law that substantially influenced the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion. Moreover, the district court did not commit clear error in finding that Neiman was a volunteer and acted negligently.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
