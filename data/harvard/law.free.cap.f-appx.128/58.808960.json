R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-16\">Defendant seeks review of his sentence, imposed following his plea of guilty to a one-count information charging him with brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1)(A)(ii).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant challenges the district court\u2019s decision to depart upward from the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of eighty-four months, which is the sentence directed by \u00a7 2K2.4 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (USSG), and he challenges the degree of the district court\u2019s departure. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), we reverse and remand for imposition of a sentence of eighty-four months.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-17\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s First Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b85-18\">Defendant and two co-defendants were convicted for their roles in an armed robbery of a Sonic Restaurant in Wichita, Kansas. The district court initially imposed a sentence of 106 months on defendant, and he appealed. We concluded on appeal that, under the version of USSG <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>\u00a7 2K2.4 then in effect, the district court was authorized to impose a sentence above the statutory mandatory minimum. <em>United States v. Wheeler, </em>230 F.3d 1194, 1196-97 (10th Cir.2000) <em>(Wheeler I). </em>We further concluded, however, that the methodology the district court used to determine defendant\u2019s sentence was erroneous as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>at 1195-96. We therefore remanded the matter for resentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 1197.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s Second Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The district court resentenced defendant using the 2000 version of the Sentencing Guidelines, which amended USSG \u00a7 2K2.4 to provide that the guideline sentence for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) is the minimum term of imprisonment required by the statute. For defendant, that mandatory minimum is eighty-four months. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii). Application Note 1 to the amended guideline provides that a sentence above the minimum term of \u00a7 924(c) constitutes an upward departure. USSG \u00a7 2K2.4, cmt. n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">At the resentencing hearing, counsel for the government acknowledged that the new guideline sentence was the mandatory minimum of eighty-four months and specifically stated that the government was not asking for an upward departure. Counsel further stated that eighty-four months would be a \u201cfair sentence,\u201d that he did not see a ground for an upward departure, and that had he been seeking an upward departure, he would not have dismissed the other charges. R., Vol. Ill, doc. 94, at 11. Defense counsel also argued in favor of an eighty-four-month sentence. But the district court decided to depart upward once again, based on defendant\u2019s criminal history. This time, the district court imposed a sentence of ninety-two months. Defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Applying a unitary abuse of discretion standard of review on appeal, we concluded that a defendant\u2019s serious criminal history is a permissible ground for departure under \u00a7 2K2.4, but that the district court had not made adequate factual findings to support a departure here. <em>United States v. Wheeler, </em>28 Fed. Appx. 813, 815-16 (10th Cir. Nov.20, 2001) <em>{Wheeler II). </em>We held that the district court \u201cmust first determine what constitutes a guideline\u2019s heartland, and must then identify the factual basis for a conclusion that the instant case is atypical.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 815. We also held that the district court had not provided a sufficient explanation of its methodology for us to determine whether the degree of its departure was reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 816-17. We therefore remanded the case for resentencing once again.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">By way of instruction on remand, we advised the district court to take guidance from the application notes to \u00a7 2K2.4, including Application Note 3, which prohibits a court from applying Chapter 4 of the Guidelines \u2014 relating to criminal history and criminal livelihood \u2014 when sentencing a defendant under \u00a7 2K2.4. <em>Wheeler II, </em>28 Fed.Appx. at 816. Consistent with Application Note 1, which permits an upward departure to reflect the seriousness of a defendant\u2019s criminal history, we directed that \u201cthe district court may consider only the <em>seriousness </em>of Wheeler\u2019s criminal history and determine whether it takes him outside the heartland.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We advised the district court that it \u201cmust identify the specific details of [defendant\u2019s criminal] history that take [him] outside the heartland.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, we cautioned the district court that if it chose to depart upward again, \u201cit must support the degree of that departure with an appropriate and reviewable explanation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s Third Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">On remand, the government and defense counsel filed resentencing memoranda. In its memorandum, the government noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>that defendant had four prior juvenile adjudications, but no prior criminal convictions, and that the district court was not permitted to apply Chapter 4 <em>of the </em>Guidelines. Beyond that, the government merely repeated this court\u2019s admonition in <em>Wheeler II </em>that the district court must articulate its reasons for any upward departure. The government did not request an upward departure, nor did it argue that defendant\u2019s criminal history was so serious as to take him outside the heartland of \u00a7 2K2.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">For his part, defendant argued that the changes made to the Sentencing Guidelines since the initial sentencing had substantially altered the use of criminal history as a ground for imposing a sentence above the statutory minimum. Defendant noted that the heartland sentence under USSG \u00a7 2K2.4 is the mandatory minimum sentence, and that the only example Application Note 1 provides of a situation that might warrant departure due to a defendant\u2019s criminal history is when the defendant\u2019s criminal history would qualify him as a career offender were it not for the fact that the Chapter 4 guidelines do not apply to \u00a7 946(c) offenses. Defendant pointed out that even if the Chapter 4 guidelines applied to him, he would not qualify as a career offender, and he argued that his criminal history was not so serious as to take him outside the heartland.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">In its Memorandum and Order, the district court rejected defendant\u2019s arguments and again made an upward departure based on defendant\u2019s criminal history. The district court based its analysis on four factors outlined by this court in <em>United States v. Bartsma, </em>198 F.3d 1191, 1195 (10th Cir.1999). Those factors are: (1) whether the factual circumstances supporting a departure are permissible factors; (2) whether the factors remove the defendant from the guideline heartland, warranting a departure; (3) whether the record supports the factual basis underlying the departure; and (4) whether the degree of departure is reasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">The district court determined that the first factor was satisfied by this court\u2019s statement in <em>Wheeler II </em>that a defendant\u2019s serious criminal history is a permissible ground for departure under \u00a7 2K2.4. Moving on to the third factor, the court recited the facts of the present offense and those of a similar juvenile offense and determined that \u201cthe facts set forth in the pre-sentence report regarding defendant\u2019s juvenile record present a sufficient factual basis to support an upward departure based upon the seriousness of defendant\u2019s criminal history,\u201d R. Vol. I, doc. 104, at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">Returning to the second factor, the court did not first determine what constitutes the heartland under \u00a7 2K2.4, as we had directed it to do in <em>Wheeler II. </em>Rather, the court looked at the introductory comments to Chapter 4 concerning the relationship between a defendant\u2019s criminal history and the purposes of sentencing and the background commentary to USSG \u00a7 4A1.3 concerning departures based on the failure of the defendant\u2019s criminal history category to adequately reflect the seriousness of his criminal history or the likelihood of recidivism. Guided by these comments,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the court found that the \u201csimilarity\u201d and \u201crelative close proximity\u201d of the instant offense and a prior juvenile offense were \u201caccepted guideline factors which demonstrate a seri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>ous criminal history sufficient to remove defendant from the heartland sentence.\u201d R. Vol. I, doc. 104, at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Moving on to the fourth factor, the court stated it would determine the degree of departure by analogizing to the Sentencing Guidelines. The court explained its methodology as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">Under the guidelines, defendant\u2019s criminal history category is V and his offense level is 22. <em>Wheeler I </em>at 1196-97. This yields a guideline range of 77-96 months. The Circuit specifically found that \u201cIf the low end of the guidelines range is less than seven years and the high end is greater than seven years, Wheeler may be sentenced, in the district court\u2019s discretion, to a term of incarceration no less than seven years but no greater than the upper limit of the guidelines sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1196. This court\u2019s sentence of ninety-two months falls within the discretion permitted by the Circuit. Moreover, the departure falls in the middle of the guideline range determined in <em>Wheeler I, </em>which means that if this was a guideline case, the sentence would be essentially unreviewable and, by implication, reasonable. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and (e).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">R., Vol. I, doc. 104, at 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"A92\">Defendant appeals both the decision to depart upward and the degree of that departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">The law governing our standard of review changed recently due to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>Booker </em>excised from the Sentencing Reform Act provisions that made the Sentencing Guidelines mandatory and provisions that prescribed standards of review for guideline sentences. <em>Id. </em>at 764. Before it was excised, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) directed that when reviewing a sentence that departed from the guidelines, we should \u201cgive due deference to the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts\u201d except with respect to certain determinations, including whether the facts of the case justified a departure. That determination we were to review de novo. <em>Id. </em>After the Supreme Court excised \u00a7 3742(e), the Court held that appellate courts should now review sentences under a reasonableness standard. <em>Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 125 S.Ct. at 765-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-13\">\u201cAlthough the Guidelines are now advisory, district courts must still \u2018consult the Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u2019 Thus, appellate review continues to encompass review of the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Doe, </em>398 F.3d 1254, 1257 n. 5 (10th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 125 S.Ct. at 767). Our review of the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines leads us to conclude that it was legally erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-16\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b88-17\">As we held in <em>Wheeler II, </em>a district court may depart upward from the statutory minimum sentence prescribed in \u00a7 2K2.4 if the facts establish that the defendant\u2019s criminal history is sufficiently serious to justify a departure. The district court concluded that defendant\u2019s juvenile record was sufficiently serious to justify such a departure. Our own assessment of defendant\u2019s criminal history differs. In our judgment, defendant\u2019s criminal history is not substantially different from that of other defendants sentenced under \u00a7 2K2.4, and were we still operating under the de novo standard of review provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e), we would reverse on this basis alone. In addition, however, the district court erred as a matter of law in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>methodology it used <em>to arrive at </em>defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The district court reached a sentence of ninety-two months by calculating what defendant\u2019s criminal history category would have been if the Chapter 4 guidelines applied, and then combining that with defendant\u2019s offense level to derive what it called a \u201cguideline range\u201d of seventy-seven to ninety-six months. R. Vol. I, doc. 104, at 10. The court then considered our instructions in <em>Wheeler I </em>about how to determine when a sentence in excess of eighty-four months could be imposed under the old version of \u00a7 2K2.4, and concluded that a sentence of ninety-two months fell within the sentencing discretion permitted by <em>Wheeler I. </em>The district court further reasoned that a sentence of ninety-two months fell \u201cin the middle of the guideline range determined in <em>Wheeler I, </em>which means if this was a guideline case, the sentence would be essentially unreviewable and, by implication, reasonable.\u201d R. Vol. I, doc. 104, at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">There are several problems with the district court\u2019s methodology. First, the Guidelines expressly prohibit the district court from applying the Chapter 4 provisions to defendant, and \u201c[t]he sentence to which an offender would have been subject under a patently inapplicable guideline is of no relevance to determining the sentence which should have been imposed,\u201d <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>368 F.3d 1335, 1342 (11th Cir.2004). Second, the \u201cguideline range\u201d applicable to defendant\u2019s offense is not seventy-seven to ninety-six months, but eighty-four months;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> any higher sentence is an upward departure. The district court\u2019s reference to a different range and supposition that a sentence within that range would be essentially un-reviewable and thus reasonable, is legally erroneous. Third, the district court\u2019s reliance on language in <em>Wheeler I </em>about the appropriate method for calculating a sentence under \u00a7 2K2.4 is misplaced. <em>Wheeler I </em>involved an earlier version of \u00a7 2K2.4 that has no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">Because the district court\u2019s methodology was legally flawed, we must reverse the sentence it imposed. In the usual case, we would remand to the district court with directions to resentence defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">But this is not the usual case. The statutory minimum and guideline sentence in this case is eighty-four months, which is seven years. Defendant was first sentenced on March 14, 2000, and now five years later, he is still uncertain what sentence he is to serve. The government has never requested a sentence above eighty-four months \u2014 neither at the initial sentencing, nor at either of the two subsequent resentencings. To the contrary, the government has argued that a sentence of eighty-four months is fair and appropriate, and that there are not grounds for an upward departure. Defendant cannot receive a sentence below eighty-four months, because that is the statutory mandatory minimum. The district court has had three opportunities to sentence defendant and has yet to impose a sentence that is valid. Each time the district court has chosen to impose a sentence in excess of the statutory minimum, and each time it has failed to adequately justify its sentence. The district court began with a sentence of 106 months and has since lowered it to ninety-two months.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Based on the unusual circumstances of this case, we conclude it would not be appropriate to simply remand this case for yet more sentencing proceedings. Eighty-four months is the presumptive sentence under the Guidelines and the statute for the offense of conviction here, and that sentence is clearly proper in this case. We therefore REVERSE and REMAND to the district court with instructions to vacate defendant\u2019s current sentence and impose a sentence of eighty-four months.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b85-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-11\">. The original charges also included robbery (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951) and using a short-barreled shotgun during a crime of violence (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(B)\u00ae).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b85-19\">. Defendant has cited as supplemental authority the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>- U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) (invalidating state sentence above maximum of standard statutory range, based on sentencing judge\u2019s findings, as violative of defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to jury trial). In light of our disposition in this case, we need not consider the effect of <em>Blakely, </em>if any, on the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b87-7\">. Defendant argues on appeal that the district court\u2019s consideration of these policies expressed in Chapter 4 violated the prohibition contained in Application Note 3 to USSG \u00a7 2K2.4 against applying Chapter 4 to any offense sentence under USSG \u00a7 2K2.4. In light of our ultimate disposition here, we need not decide whether the district court's reliance on these general policies was error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b89-7\">. \"The term 'guideline range\u2019 includes a guideline range having the same upper and lower limits, such as the minimum mandatory sentence of [eighty-four] months for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).\u201d <em>Doe, </em>398 F.3d 1254, 1256 n. 2 (brackets, quotation, and citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
