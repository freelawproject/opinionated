R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-17\">Petitioner Juan M. Corona-Garda seeks review of an order removing him from the United States based on his state conviction for aiding and abetting the delivery of a controlled substance (methamphetamine), which the Immigration Judge (IJ) held warranted petitioner\u2019s removal both as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d and as a crime \u201crelating to a controlled substance\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) and (a)(2)(B)(i). The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) summarily affirmed, making the IJ\u2019s deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>sion the final agency determination for purposes of judicial review. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4). As explained below, petitioner has failed to negate the conditions warranting removal under \u00a7 1227(a)(2). Accordingly, we dismiss his petition for lack of jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Petitioner was indicted for aiding and abetting another defendant\u2019s delivery of methamphetamine in violation of Idaho Code \u00a7 37-2732(a)(1) (delivery of controlled substance) and \u00a7 18-204 (aiding and abetting). App. 201-02. He was adjudged \u201cguilty as charged\u201d on the basis of his plea, and given a sentence of three to six years\u2019 confinement, execution of which was suspended under Idaho Code \u00a7 19-2601(2) in favor of a six-year term of probation. App. 198-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The Department of Homeland Security took petitioner into custody in anticipation of removal proceedings under \u00a7 1227(a)(2), and transferred him to a facility in Colorado. Thereafter, petitioner moved for a transfer of venue to an immigration tribunal within the Ninth Circuit, insisting that his case ultimately be reviewed by (and under the precedent of) the circuit with jurisdiction over the state where the operative conviction had been obtained.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In particular, he sought the benefit of <em>Lujan-Armendariz v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 728 (9th Cir.2000), which ameliorated the immigration consequences of certain state drug offenses so as to replicate the effect of the Federal First Offender Act (FFOA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3607, placing certain deferred/expunged adjudications for first-time, simple-possession offenses outside the definition of \u201cconviction\u201d in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A), and, thus, outside the removal provisions in \u00a7 1227(a)(2). <em>See Lujan-Armendariz, </em>222 F.3d at 734-38, 742-43, 749-50 (reaffirming Ninth Circuit view after amendment of \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(A)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An IJ sitting in Denver denied petitioner\u2019s motion and found him removable under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) and (a)(2)(B)(i). The IJ held that the venue issue was legally inconsequential, since petitioner\u2019s crime would not have qualified as a simple possession offense for FFOA purposes in any event. Petitioner raised the same issue (among others) to the BIA, App. at 23, 77, which affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">The focus of petitioner\u2019s primary objection has shifted over time. He continues to insist that Ninth Circuit law would have favored his cause, but the precedent and point of law emphasized now are not <em>Lujan-Armendariz </em>and the extension of FFOA benefits to state offenders. Instead, petitioner relies heavily on <em>Cazarez-Gutierrez v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 905 (9th Cir.2004), which has nothing to do with the FFOA, but does hold that state drug possession offenses that would not be punishable as felonies under federal drug law should not be counted as aggravated felonies for immigration purposes simply be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>cause a state chooses to classify them as such. <em>Id. </em>at 909-10, 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">As the government has pointed out, one critical problem with the latter argument is that it relates only to the \u201caggravated felony\u201d conviction provision in \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d conviction provision remains a distinct basis sufficient in itself to support removability under \u00a7 1227(a) (2) (B) (i). An appellate challenge that extends to only one of two alternate bases for a disposition necessarily leaves that disposition standing, <em>see Berna v. Chater, </em>101 F.3d 631, 634 (10th Cir.1996), which in this case would preserve the negation of our jurisdiction under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">In contrast, petitioner\u2019s argument under <em>Lujan-Armendariz, </em>that the FFOA ex-pungement provision should be deemed to apply to first time state offenders who would have qualified under the FFOA had they been federally prosecuted, would undercut the existence of a <em>conviction </em>per se, thus negating either predicate under \u00a7 1227(a)(2). It is not clear whether petitioner intends to reassert this argument. He does not cite <em>Lugan-Armendariz </em>in his brief, though he does appear at one point to invoke the substance of its holding. <em>See </em>Op. Br. at 24 (noting \u201c[t]he very first state conviction for simple possession of a drug, whether felony or misdemeanor, in the Ninth Circuit, can be eliminated for immigration purposes by \u2018rehabilitative relief \u201d). Even if we deem this oblique reference sufficient to present the matter for review, however, we agree with the IJ that petitioner\u2019s conviction for aiding and abetting the <em>delivery </em>of methamphetamine could not in any event have qualified under the FFOA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">The FFOA \u201capplies exclusively to first-time drug offenders who are guilty only of simple possession\u201d as specified in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844. <em>Dillingham v. INS, </em>267 F.3d 996, 1005 (9th Cir.2001); <em>see Elkins v. Comfort, </em>392 F.3d 1159, 1160 (10th Cir. 2004). But delivery of a controlled substance, which is sufficient to qualify as distribution in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, <em>United States v. Wigley, </em>627 F.2d 224, 226 (10th Cir.1980), involves more than simple possession.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, this point is plainly reflected in the Idaho statute under which petitioner was convicted. <em>Compare </em>Idaho Code \u00a7 37-2732(a) (specifying offenses involving manufacture or delivery of, or possession with intent to manufacture or deliver, controlled substance) <em>with id. </em>\u00a7 37-2732(c) (specifying offenses involving only possession of controlled substance).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>In sum, petitioner has failed to advance a meritorious challenge to the validity of one of the grounds invoked for removal under \u00a7 1227(a)(2). Pursuant to \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), we lack jurisdiction to review the removal order any further. Finally, we note a recurrent theme in petitioner\u2019s brief to the effect that he pled guilty to the underlying state offense based on expectations about immigration consequences that, as we have seen, have not been borne out. Any repercussions with respect to his plea, however, are beyond the scope of our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The petition for review is DISMISSED. Petitioner\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b104-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-7\">. The limited nature of our review in connection with the jurisdictional bar in \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) is explained in <em>Cruz-Garza v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 1125, 1127 n. 2 (10th Cir. 2005), and cases discussed therein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b105-8\">. A petition for review of a removal order \"shall be filed in the court of appeals for the judicial circuit in which the immigration judge completed the proceedings,\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(2), and the law of that circuit properly governs the case, <em>Peters v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 302, 305 n. 2 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b105-12\">. The Third Circuit rejected the Ninth Circuit\u2019s equal protection rationale for extending FFOA benefits to state offenders in this way in <em>Acosta v. Ashcroft, </em>341 F.3d 218, 225-27 (3d Cir.2003), which we credited but did not expressly adopt in our rejection of a similar argument regarding an expunged foreign conviction in <em>Elkins v. Comfort, </em>392 F.3d 1159, 1162-64 (10th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b106-6\">. We properly look to the offense elements stated in the charging document in conjunction with the judgment of conviction in determining the nature of the offense. <em>Hernandez-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>343 F.3d 1075, 1076 (9th Cir.2003); <em>see also United States v. Venegas-Ornelas, </em>348 F.3d 1273, 1276 (10th Cir.2003), <em>cert. </em>denied,- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 494, 160 L.Ed.2d 370 (2004). Here, these show petitioner was charged with and convicted of aiding the delivery of a controlled substance, specified in the indictment as methamphetamine. It is not clear why, but petitioner\u2019s commitment order mistakenly refers to \u201cAid &amp; Abet Possession of A Controlled Substance With Intent to Deliver,\u201d App. at 203, but as possession with intent to deliver is not in any event simple possession, the difference is immaterial to our analysis. Petitioner's occasional reference in his brief to a charge of \u201cAiding and Abetting Possession,\u201d Op. Br. at 9, 13, is misleading, but, as he otherwise consistently refers to delivery, we assume this was inadvertent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b106-12\">. For immigration purposes, a conviction of aiding or abetting a crime under federal law is treated as a conviction of the substantive offense, because \u201cthe aiding and abetting statute [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2] does not define a separate offense but rather makes punishable as a principal one who aids or abets another in the commission of the substantive offense.\u201d <em>Lon-dono-Gomez v. INS, </em>699 F.2d 475, 476 (9th Cir. 1983) (distinguishing aiding/abetting from misprision). The state law under which petitioner was convicted likewise holds aiders/abettors to be principals guilty of the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>stantive offense and distinguishes them from mere accessories after the fact, <em>compare </em>Idaho Code \u00a7 18-204 and \u00a7 19-1430 <em>with id. </em>\u00a7 18-203 and \u00a7 18-205. Thus, petitioner\u2019s conclusory objection that the state record does not foreclose the possibility that his was merely \u201ca misprision of a felony type of accessory conviction\u201d that should not carry the consequences of a substantive drug offense, Op. Br. at 18, is plainly belied by the governing law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
