INTRODUCTION</p>\n<author id=\"b155-20\">RADER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b155-21\">In a final decision, the Merit Systems Protection (Board) affirmed a decision of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) ruling that Mr. Mouat\u2019s former spouse was entitled to twenty-eight percent of his monthly civil service retirement benefits. <em>Mouat v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>No. DA-0831-01-0256-1-4 (M.S.P.B. March 4, 2004) <em>(Final Order). </em>Because the Board and OPM calculated the correct percentage of Mr. Mouat\u2019s retirement benefits to which Mrs. Mouat is entitled, this court <em>affirms.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-23\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b155-24\">On December 16, 1985, a final dissolution of marriage (Decree) was entered in the District Court, Tarrant County, Texas, in regard to James W. Mouat and Jo Ann Mouat, who married on September 1,1964. The language of the Decree at issue states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ5\">7. The Court finds that JAMES W. MOUAT is a participant in a retirement program from The National Archives. The Court further finds that the community interest in the monthly retirement benefit is 50%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1H\">IT IS ORDERED AND DECREED that JO ANN MOUAT shall have judgment and recover of and from JAMES W. MOUAT 50% of all monthly retirement benefits payable if, as and when the retirement is received by JAMES W. MOUAT, valued as of the date of the [sic] this Decree. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED AND DECREED that JAMES W. MOUAT is designated a constructive trustee for receiving his retirement, and Petitioner is ORDERED AND DE<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>CREED to directly pay the benefit defined above to Respondent within three days after receipt by Petitioner. All payments made directly to JO ANN MOUAT by The National Archives shall be a credit against this obligation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Pet.App. Attach. C. OPM received a copy of the Decree on July 17, 1991. Mr. Mou-at retired after completing 441 months of Federal service, effective January 1, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">In a letter dated April 26, 2000, OPM informed Mr. Mouat of its intention to withhold twenty-eight percent of his retirement benefit based on the following calculation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">By court order your former spouse\u2019s marital share of your retirement benefit is 50% of 247 months of service during the marriage divided by 441 months of Federal service or 28.00% of retirement benefit. The marital share times gross annuity benefit of $4,814.00 provides for a $1,347.92 monthly payment to your former spouse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Pet.App. Attach. D. OPM did not cite a statute for authority for this calculation in the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Mr. Mouat timely contested the $1,347.92 per month figure, arguing that the wording of the Decree dictated that his former spouse receive \u201c$713.50 per month based upon the Movant\u2019s salary and the time of service as of December 16, 1985, that being the date on which the divorce decree was signed.\u201d Resp\u2019t Brief, at 2. Thus, Mr. Mouat asserts that his former spouse is entitled to fifty percent of his retirement benefits determined as if Mr. Mouat had retired on the date of the Decree, December 16, 1985. Mr. Mouat argues that, based on the language of the Decree, no part of the retirement benefits calculation should factor in post-divorce, pre-retirement accruals from the date of the divorce to the date of retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">On January 23, 2001, OPM rejected Mr. Mouat\u2019s appeal, concluding again that the Decree mandated that his former spouse receive twenty-eight percent of his total retirement benefits. Mr. Mouat then petitioned the Texas state court for an order clarifying the Decree. On August 27, 2001, Judge Harris of the Texas state court held a hearing on the matter and on December 18, 2001, signed an Order for Clarification and Enforcement, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-10\">IT IS ORDERED that the terms of the Agreed Final Decree of Divorce signed by this Court on December 16, 1985 are <em>dear and specific and are not ambiguous.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-11\">IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Movant\u2019s Motion for Clarification and Enforcement is DENIED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-12\"><em>Mouat v. Mouat, </em>No. 233-086246 (D.Tex. Dec. 18, 2001) (order denying clarification and enforcement) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">Mr. Mouat next timely appealed to the Board. In a March 5, 2001, letter to Judge Cornelius of the Board, Gregory Stewart of OPM stated the basis for OPM\u2019s calculation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-14\">In accordance with Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations Part 838, Subpart J, Appendix A, I, C, 3, OPM interpreted the language in the divorce decree awarding Mrs. Mouat 50% of all monthly retirement benefits payable if, as, and when the retirement is received by James W. Mouat, valued as of the date of the <em>[sic </em>] this Decree as awarding her 28% of appellant\u2019s Civil Service annuity. The calculation is based on the formula 50% of 247 months of Federal service for appellant as [of] the date of divorce divided by appellant\u2019s total Federal service, 36 years, 9 months (441 months). Accordingly, OPM has withheld 28% of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>appellant\u2019s annuity for payment to his former spouse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Pet.App. Attach. F. Several exchanges between Mr. Mouat and the Board followed. In an Initial Decision dated February 27, 2003, under Judge Cornelius, the Board affirmed OPM\u2019s determination that the Decree was a qualifying order under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 838.1003 and 838.1004. <em>Mouat v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>No. DA-0831-01-0256-1-4, slip op. at 5 (M.S.P.B. Feb.27, 2003) <em>(Initial </em>Decision). The Board agreed with OPM that the Decree \u201cimplied that such payments would be made by OPM directly to [Mrs. Mouat] as reflected by the language, \u2018All payments made directly to JO ANN MOUAT by The National Archives shall be a credit against his obligation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The Board noted that the Decree expressly awarded a payment, in the form of a percentage of Mr. Mouat\u2019s retirement account, to his former spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The Board also affirmed that Mrs. Mouat was to receive twenty-eight percent of Mr. Mouat\u2019s total retirement benefits, although the Board applied 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 838.621(c) to arrive at this percentage as opposed to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 838(J), App. A 1(C)(3) used by OPM.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">On March 4, 2001, the Board issued a Final Order, denying Mr. Mouat\u2019s petition for review and upholding the Initial Decision as final. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">This court affirms a decision of the Board unless it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, not in accordance with the law, or unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000); <em>Marino v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>243 F.3d 1375 (Fed.Cir.2001). Although the Board and the OPM applied the wrong regulation in calculating the portion of Mr. Mouat\u2019s retirement to which Mrs. Mouat\u2019s entitled, the Board and OPM nonetheless arrived at the correct percentage. Because the Board\u2019s error was harmless, this court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">Turning first to the question of whether the Decree was a \u201cqualifying court order\u201d, this court agrees with the Board. Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations stipulates protocols OPM must undertake in analyzing court orders. Subpart A of Chapter 1 sets forth an important division among the rest of the subparts: different subparts apply depending on <em>when OPM received </em>a court order. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 838.101(c); <em>see also Perry v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>243 F.3d 1337, 1343-1344 (Fed.Cir.2001) (\u201cThe 1992 amendments of [Title 5 of the C.F.R.] specify which portions apply retroactively and which prospectively.\u201d). This statute guides the analysis of the Board\u2019s decision in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-13\">(c)(1) Subparts A through I of this part apply only to court orders received by OPM on or after January 1,1993.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-14\">(2) Subpart J of this party applies only to court orders received by OPM before January 1,1993.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-15\">5 C.F.R. \u00a7 838.101. As noted in <em>Perry, </em>\u201c[T]he regulation states that Subpart J \u2018contains the rules applicable to court orders filed under procedures in effect prior to the implementation of this part. These rules continue to apply to court orders received by OPM before January 1, 1993.\u2019 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 838.102(a)(6).\u201d 243 F.3d at 1343. OPM received the Decree on December 17, 1991. Thus, Subpart J of \u00a7 838 (that is, \u00a7 838.1001-18 and Appendi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>ces A and B) govern the analysis of the Decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">According to \u00a7 838.1003, a court order must meet the requirements of \u00a7 838.1004 to be a \u201cqualifying court order.\u201d Section 838.1004 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">(a) A former spouse is entitled to a portion of an employee\u2019s retirement benefits only to the extent that the <em>division of retirement benefits is expressly provided </em>for by the court order. The order must divide employee benefits, award a payment from employee retirement benefits, or award a former spouse annuity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">(b) The court order must state the former spouse\u2019s share as a <em>fixed amount, a percentage or a fraction of an annuity, </em>or by a formula that does not contain any variables whose value is not readily ascertainable from the face of the order or normal OPM files.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">(c) (1) For purposes of payments from employee retirement benefits, OPM will <em>review court orders as a whole to determine whether the language of the order shows an intent by the court that the former spouse should receive a portion of the employee\u2019s benefit directly from the United States, </em>(i) Orders that direct or imply that OPM is to make payment of a portion of employee retirement benefits, or are neutral about the source of payment, will be honored unless the retiree can demonstrate the order is invalid in accordance with \u00a7 838.1009.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">(Emphasis added.) The Board correctly found that the Decree \u201cexpressly awarded a payment from employee retirement benefits to the appellant\u2019s former spouse and stated a percentage of the annuity to be awarded.\u201d <em>Initial Decision, </em>slip op. at 5. The Board also found that \u201c[although the order did not specifically direct OPM to make payments directly to the appellant\u2019s former spouse ... the order implied that such payments would be made by OPM directly to her as reflected by the language, \u2018All payments made directly to JO ANN MOUAT by The National Archives shall be a credit against this obligation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>This is reasonable reading of the Decree. Consequently, substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that the Decree meets the requirements of \u00a7 838.1004 and is a qualifying court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8345(j)(l), annuity payments otherwise payable to a retired employee \u201cshall be paid (in whole or in part) by the [OPM] to another person if and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of \u2014 (a) any court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation.\u201d Appendix A to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 838(J) sets forth \u201cguidelines explaining] the interpretation that [OPM] will place on terms and phrases frequently used in dividing benefits. These guidelines are intended not only for the use of the OPM, but also for the legal community as a whole, with the hope that ... the resulting orders will be more carefully drafted, using the proper language to accomplish the aims of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">The controlling language of the Decree is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-12\">7. IT IS ORDERED AND DECREED that JO ANN MOUAT shall have judgment and recover of and from JAMES W. MOUAT 50% of all monthly retirement benefits payable if, as and when the retirement is received by JAMES W. MO-UAT, valued as of the date of the [sic] this Decree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-13\">Pet.App. Attach. C. Because the Decree specifically awards to Mrs. Mouat fifty percent of the value of Mr. Mouat\u2019s retirement as of the date of the Decree, the proper calculation is set forth in 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 838(J), App. A 1(D) for \u201c[a]nnuity as of a date before retirement\u201d rather than 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 838(c). This regulation requires the OPM to award \u201ca portion of the annui<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>ty equal to the monthly annuity rate at the time of retirement times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months of \u2018creditable service\u2019 or service worked as of the date specified and the denominator of which is the number of months of \u2018creditable service\u2019 or service worked used in the retirement computation.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 838(J), App. A 1(D). Applying this regulation, Mrs. Mouat is entitled to a portion of Mr. Mouat\u2019s retirement benefits equal fifty percent times the 247 months of service divided by 441 months of service, or twenty-eight percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Because the Board\u2019s error was harmless in calculating the Mr. Mouat\u2019s entitlement to Mr. Mouat\u2019s retirement benefits, the Board\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b157-10\"> The Board\u2019s <em>Initial Decision </em>states that OPM calculated the 28 percent withholding pursuant to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 838.621(a), (c), slip op. at 3, but the letter from OPM to Mr. Mouat cites to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 838(c), App. A I(C)(3), Resp\u2019t App. at 19.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
