For the reasons that follow, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denials of Gar-ba\u2019s motions challenging his conviction. However, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-17\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. Our Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. As we write solely for the parties, we do not restate the facts underlying the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-19\">Garba argues that the District Court should have granted the motion to withdraw his guilty plea \u201cbecause (1) his plea was given under the mistaken belief that he would be able to contest the amount of cocaine involved at a hearing before the sentencing; (2) his plea was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment; and (3) the plea hearing conducted by the Court violated Rule 11 because Garba was not made aware that at trial the government would have to prove the quantity of cocaine involved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Garbo, </em>285 F.Supp.2d 504, 509 (D.N.J.2003). After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the District Court carefully considered each of these arguments at length, applying the framework we described in <em>United States v. Jones, </em>336 F.3d 245 (3d Cir.2003), and ultimately rejected them.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-20\">\u201c[T]here is no absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea,\u201d but rather \u201cacceptance of the motion is within the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Gov\u2019t of V.I. v. Berry, </em>631 F.2d 214, 219 (3d Cir.1980). We are satisfied that the District Court properly exercised this discretion in a manner consistent with our Circuit\u2019s precedent. Its denial of Garba\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea was thorough, careful and well-reasoned. We therefore accept its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Having upheld the District Court\u2019s denial of Garba\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea, we can easily dispense with his Speedy Trial Act argument. His unconditional guilty plea (without reservation of the right to challenge the denial of his motion under the Act) operated as a waiver of all claims of pre-existing error (except those going to the Court\u2019s jurisdiction). As such, Garba has waived the right to invoke on appeal the denial of his Speedy Trial Act motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">Only Garba\u2019s challenge to his sentence under <em>Booker </em>remains. Having determined that the sentencing issues he raises are best determined by the District Court in the first instance, we vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
