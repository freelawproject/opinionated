Specifically, he argues that he was involved in delivering only 4.92 kilograms and had no knowledge that his co-defendants had negotiated a total of 15 kilograms of cocaine with an undercover agent. Mendez also contends that the district court\u2019s determination that he was responsible for an additional 10.08 kilograms of cocaine is unconstitutional under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), because he admitted to conspiring to possess with the intent to distribute only 4.92 kilograms of cocaine. Mendez further contends that the district court erred in denying him a minor role adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Mendez argues that he is entitled to appeal his <em>Blakely </em>claim, despite an appeal waiver, which excluded only an upward departure, because his <em>Blakely </em>claim \u201cinvolves an issue of constitutional dimension.\u201d Mendez further argues that he is entitled to appeal his sentence because the statutory waiver of appeal, which he executed in his plea agreement, was not done knowingly. He contends that his appeal waiver was unknowing and involuntary because he was in \u201ca lot of pain\u201d due to a recent surgery. He also argues that the district court made no inquiry into whether he understood that he was waiving his right to appeal any sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The record indicates that Mendez\u2019s waiver was knowing and voluntary. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 518 &amp; n. 2 (5th Cir.1999). The district court specifically advised Mendez that, pursuant to the plea agreement, he could appeal his sentence only if there was an upward departure. Mendez responded that he understood. Prior to accepting Mendez\u2019s guilty plea, the district court asked Mendez\u2019s counsel if he had any concerns regarding the competency of his client. Mendez and his attorney assured the district court that, despite his health, he was competent to enter his guilty plea and understood the consequences of his guilty plea, including the waiver-of-appeal provision. Because Mendez waived the right to appeal his sentence, we do not address his contentions regarding his sentence, including his <em>Blakely </em>claim. <em>See United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, -(5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Me-lancon, </em>972 F.2d 566, 567 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b423-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
