Because substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s removal decision and because the BIA correctly denied Hanna\u2019s motion to reopen, we deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b505-18\">Hanna, an Egyptian national, first arrived in the United States in 1982. Shortly after his arrival, Hanna married an American citizen, Elsie Rasnick. That marriage did not endure \u2014 the couple separated on their wedding day when Rasnick informed Hanna she was pregnant with another man\u2019s child. Importantly, Hanna and Rasnick never lived together.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-19\">Attempting to reap the benefit of his marriage to Rasnick, Hanna applied for adjustment of status, noting, untruthfully, on his application that he lived with Ras-nick. Rasnick later withdrew the visa petition supporting Hanna\u2019s application, prompting the INS eventually to deny the application. In the meantime, Hanna divorced Rasnick and returned to Egypt.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-20\">Hanna returned to the United States in 1987. On his 1987 immigrant visa application, Hanna answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question whether he was an alien who had \u201cprocure[d] or attempted] to procure a visa or other documentation by fraud or willful misrepresentation.\u201d The INS \u2014 presumably failing to discover Hanna\u2019s 1982 attempt to gain permanent status \u2014 granted him admission as the child of a lawful permanent alien resident, his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-21\">About ten years later, the INS, clued by facts unknown to us and irrelevant to our decision, discovered Hanna\u2019s 1982 application and therefore charged him with re-movability as an alien who \u201cby fraud or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>willfully misrepresenting a material fact, seeks to procure (or has sought to procure or has procured) a visa, other documentation, or admission into the United States or other benefit provided under this chapter.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i). <em>See also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(A). The IJ found Hanna removable for materially misrepresenting on his 1982 application that he lived with Rasnick, and the BIA dismissed Hanna\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Hanna then moved the BIA to reopen his case, alleging that his attorney had rendered ineffective assistance by failing to file for a waiver of removal. The BIA denied Hanna\u2019s motion to reopen, holding that even if Hanna were eligible for a waiver, Hanna lacked a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment given the discretionary nature of the waiver. In the absence of such an interest, Hanna had no constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel. Hanna petitions for review of both BIA decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">A. Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">This court reviews removal orders under the familiar substantial-evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (\u201cAdministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary....\u201d). Here, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Hanna willfully misrepresented a material fact when he sought to obtain status as a permanent resident. That is, Hanna claimed, under oath, that he lived with Rasnick when he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Whether a fact is material depends on \u201cwhether the misrepresentation or concealment was predictably capable of affecting, <em>i.e., </em>had a natural tendency to affect, the official decision.\u201d <em>Kungys v. United </em>States, 485 U.S. 759, 771, 108 S.Ct. 1537, 99 L.Ed.2d 839 (1988). As the immigration judge correctly noted, the fact that Hanna did not reside with his wife was material because \u201c[i]f the INS were aware that the parties did not reside together, it would result in an inquiry into the validity of this relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">Hanna, however, contends that because a friend filled out his 1982 application, he never knew its contents, and thus he did not <em>willfully </em>misrepresent any fact. But, assuming Hanna\u2019s story to be true \u2014 a generous assumption given the overwhelming evidence demonstrating the Hanna-Ras-nick marriage to be a sham \u2014 the law still charges Hanna with knowledge of the application\u2019s contents. Hanna signed, under oath, his 1982 adjustment-of-status application. His failure to apprise himself of the contents of this important document constituted deliberate avoidance \u2014 -an act the law generally does not recognize as a defense to misrepresentation. <em>See Bautis-ta v. Star Cruises, </em>396 F.3d 1289, 1301 (11th Cir.2005) (noting that one \u201cwho has executed a written contract and is ignorant of its contents cannot set up that ignorance to avoid the obligation\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>United States v. Puente, </em>982 F.2d 156, 159 (5th Cir.1993) (holding \u201ca defendant who deliberately avoids reading the form he is signing cannot avoid criminal sanctions for any false statements contained therein\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">B. Reopening</p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">In a separate reopening proceeding before the BIA, Hanna claimed he was denied effective assistance of counsel. Hanna argues that counsel\u2019s failure to seek a discretionary waiver of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(H) violated his Fifth Amendment right to counsel. We disagree, because Hanna possessed no constitution<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>ally protected liberty interest in receiving a <em>discretionary </em>waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">To prove an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, an alien must prove that but for his attorney\u2019s errors he \u201cwould have been <em>entitled </em>to continue residing in the United States.\u201d <em>Huicochea-Gomez v. INS, </em>287 F.3d 696, 699-700 (6th Cir.2001) (emphasis added). But no due process violation occurs when an attorney\u2019s errors cause an alien to be denied discretionary relief. <em>Id. </em>at 700 (\u201cThe failure to be granted discretionary relief does not amount to a deprivation of a liberty interest.\u201d) (citing <em>Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, </em>178 F.3d 1139, 1146 (11th Cir.1999)). And 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(H) \u2014 providing that removal of an alien found inadmissible for attempting to procure a visa or other documentation through fraud or material misrepresentation \u201cmay, in the discretion of the Attorney General, be waived\u201d \u2014 affords only discretionary relief. <em>See INS v. Yueh-Shaio Yang, </em>519 U.S. 26, 30, 117 S.Ct. 350,136 L.Ed.2d 288 (1996) (concluding that the nearly identical predecessor of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(H) imposed.no limitation on what the Attorney General could consider when deciding whether to grant discretionary relief). Thus, the failure of Hanna\u2019s attorney to file for a waiver of removal did not violate Hanna\u2019s due process rights, and the BIA did not err in denying Hanna\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Hanna, however, claims he is not contesting \u201cthe denial of a form of discretionary relief,\u201d but instead challenging \u201chis attorney\u2019s failure to file for such relief before the Immigration Court,\u201d which deprived him of even being considered for the waiver. But this distinction lacks constitutional significance. Without a cognizable liberty or property interest at stake, a due process violation cannot occur. <em>See Tefel v. Reno, </em>180 F.3d 1286, 1301 (11th Cir.1999) (\u201cThus, just as Plaintiffs enjoy no \u2018liberty or property\u2019 interest in their expectancy of receiving suspension of deportation, they enjoy no \u2018liberty or property\u2019 interest in being eligible to be considered for suspension.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we deny the petitions for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
