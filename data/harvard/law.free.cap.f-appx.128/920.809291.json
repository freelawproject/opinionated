Parsons Energy and Chemicals Group, Inc. (Parsons) appeals the decision of the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania declining to vacate an arbitration panel\u2019s award of a contractual incentive fee, as well as attorneys\u2019 and expert fees, to Williams Union Boiler (Williams), Parsons\u2019s subcontractor. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-13\">II. Facts and Procedure</p>\n<p id=\"aki-dedup-0\">A. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b947-14\">In 1997, Parsons entered a contract with Motiva Enterprises, LLC (Motiva) to build a gasification power system for a refinery in Delaware. In 1998, Parsons executed a fixed-price subcontract with Williams for construction and other services related to the gasification system. According to the subcontract, the parties shared equally the risk of delay \u2014 $100,000 per day in liquidated damages \u2014 in achieving the milestone dates laid out in the prime contract. A choice-of-law provision established that Delaware law controlled disputes arising under the subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-15\">In March 1999, the parties converted the subcontract to a cost-reimbursable format, with fixed incentive fees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The amended subcontract, retroactive to December 8, 1998, provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-16\">[a]ll disputes between Contractor and Subcontractor arising under the Subcontract which cannot be resolved amicably between the parties shall be referred to the upper management of Subcontractor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>and Contractor for resolution.... If resolution is not achieved through mediation, the parties agree to submit the dispute to final and binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association with proceedings conducted in the State of Delaware, USA or as otherwise agreed to by the Parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Rule 46 of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), which since has been renumbered, provides that an arbitrator\u2019s award may include \u201can award of attorneys\u2019 fees if all parties have requested such an award, or it is authorized by law or their arbitration agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">The amended subcontract also altered Williams\u2019s risk in the event of delay. The new risk terms were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-6\">2.3 LIQUIDATED DAMAGES (Schedule Incentive Fee) CONTRACTOR<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> agrees to pay a Schedule Incentive Fee as detailed in SECTION IV, unless CONTRACTOR fails to meet CONTRACTOR\u2019S Project schedule commitments associated with Liquidated Damage Dates, regardless of cause or fault including negligence on the part of any party or parties. In the event CONTRACTOR must pay any liquidated damages to COMPANY, CONTRACTOR and SUBCONTRACTOR expressly agree that the payment of the first $500,000 of any such liquidated damages shall be funded through SUBCONTRACTOR\u2019S forfeiture of its Schedule Incentive Fee for 100% of any and all such amounts paid to COMPANY. Thereafter, any additional amounts of Liquidated Damages paid by CONTRACTOR to COMPANY shall be funded on an equal basis with CONTRACTOR and SUBCONTRACTOR each contributing 50% of any and' all amounts on the following basis:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-10\">a) CONTRACTOR shall be responsible for the actual payment or allowance of credit to COMPANY for the full amount of the liquidated damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-11\">b) SUBCONTRACTOR\u2019S share of such liquidated damages shall be funded through SUBCONTRACTOR\u2019S forfeiture of its Schedule Incentive Fee to the full extent required to pay such Liquidated Damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-12\">c) SUBCONTRACTOR expressly agrees to waive any and all rights for claims to any Schedule Incentive Fee reduction imposed by CONTRACTOR to cover SUBCONTRACTOR\u2019S share of CONTRACTOR\u2019S payment of liquidated damages regardless of cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-13\">d) Both parties understand and agree that the Liquidated Damage risk to be imposed against SUBCONTRACTOR\u2019S potential Schedule Incentive Fee is for an amount of $100,000 per day for failure to achieve any of the discrete events indicated below.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-14\">e) The maximum amount that SUBCONTRACTOR shall be required to contribute toward payment of said Liquidated Damages shall not exceed its total forfeiture of the above mentioned Schedule Incentive Fee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-15\">In turn, Section IV referred to above provided</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-16\">B.4 SCHEDULE INCENTIVE FEE (maximum of $2,500,000)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-17\">CONTRACTOR shall pay SUBCONTRACTOR a Schedule Incentive Fee (SIF) based on the criteria outlined in Section O. If for any reason and without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>regard to fault by CONTRACTOR or others, CONTRACTOR has to pay Liquidated Damages to COMPANY, the amount of SUBCONTRACTOR\u2019S Schedule Incentive fee shall be reduced by 100% of the amount of such Liquidated Damage payments until such time as the total of $500,000 has been reduced and then SUBCONTRACTOR\u2019S Schedule Incentive Fee shall be reduced by 50% of any additional amount of any additional liquidated damage payments until such time as the total $2.5 million potential Schedule Incentive Fee has been reduced to $0.00. In no event will SUBCONTRACTOR\u2019S contribution to Liquidated Damages be other than the forfeiture of SUBCONTRACTOR\u2019S potential Schedule Incentive Fee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">In April 1999, Parsons and Williams accelerated their work in an attempt to achieve first feed of the gasifier by November 26,1999, a milestone established in the Prime Contract. At Parsons\u2019s request, Motiva agreed to adjust the Prime Contract to compensate for Parsons\u2019s increased costs caused by the acceleration. Under that adjustment, Motiva extended the gasifier first feed date from November 26, 1999 to January 17, 2000 and promised to pay Parsons a $3 million bonus in exchange for settling certain pending claims and accelerating efforts to meet the gasifier first feed date. For each day after January 17, 2000 that gasifier first feed was not achieved, Parsons would forfeit $100,000 of that bonus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-6\">Notwithstanding the provisions of Schedule \u201cC,\u201d paragraph 1, it is hereby agreed that in the event Gasifier First Feed is achieved in accordance with the Contract on or before January 17, 2000, COMPANY shall pay a performance bonus to CONTRACTOR in the amount of Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000.00). If Gasifier First Feed is not achieved by aforesaid completion date, then the performance bonus will be reduced at a rate of $100,000 per calendar day until the earlier of when Gasifier First Feed [is] achieved or February 16, 2000 when the bonus shall be reduced to $0 (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cBonus Forfeiture Period\u201d). Any such bonus forfeiture shall satisfy any and all CONTRACTOR\u2019S obligation to COMPANY for Liquidated Damages for the associated calendar days during such Bonus Forfeiture Period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">Parsons did not achieve gasifier first feed until April 21, 2000, more than 90 days after the January 17, 2000 milestone date and well outside the Bonus Forfeiture Period.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">When the gasifier was completed, Parsons and Motiva negotiated to resolve all outstanding disputes under the prime contract, including the amount of liquidated damages. The parties memorialized their settlement in several documents, including an agreement called Change Order 90. In relevant part, Change Order 90 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-10\"><em>LIQUIDATED DAMAGES </em>\u2014 Motiva and Parsons have agreed to a negotiated settlement for Parsons[\u2019s] aggregate liability to Motiva associated with Delay in Completion of the Schedule B-l milestone Event First Feed to the Gasifier. The agreed payment to be made by Parsons to Motiva is for 45 days of Liquidated Damages at the Contract rate of $100,000 per day for a total of <em>$4,500,000.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-12\"><em>BONUS PAYMENT </em>\u2014 As consideration for Parsonsf] considerable unplanned excess expense of overtime and shift pay etc. to try to achieve the Schedule B-l Liquidated Damage Date for First Feed to the Gasifier, Motiva agreed to Bonus Payment of <em>$3,000,000. </em>It was further agreed that if the date was not met, this Bonus would be used to pay Motiva for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>the first 30 days of actual Liquidated Damages to be paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">According to James Rogers, Parsons\u2019s contract administrator, pursuant to this language Motiva assessed Parsons $4.5 million in liquidated damages for 45 days of delay in completing the gasifier.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">Whether Parsons paid Motiva $4.5 million in liquidated damages is a central factual dispute in this appeal. William Hall, a senior executive at Parsons, testified that Motiva gave Parsons a 30-day extension in its schedule. Williams\u2019s expert, Bradley Hornburg, denied that Parsons paid $4.5 million in liquidated damages to Motiva.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">B. Arbitration Award</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">In February 2003, the arbitration panel awarded Williams $1.5 million on its claim for the Schedule Incentive Fee and allowed Williams\u2019s claim for recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees and expert fees and expenses. In July 2003, the panel issued a supplemental award specifying the amounts owed to Williams for attorneys\u2019 and expert fe\u00e9s.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">C. District Court Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">In August 2003, Parsons filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to vacate the arbitration panel\u2019s award and supplemental award. Parsons argued that the panel manifestly disregarded the law in awarding Williams attorneys\u2019 and expert fees, and that the panel acted irrationally in awarding Williams the $1.5 million schedule incentive fee in light of the \u201cundisputed\u201d factual record that Parsons paid Motiva $4.5 million in liquidated damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-11\">In March 2004, the District Court held a hearing on Parsons\u2019 complaint at which it ordered Williams to provide evidence and/or citations to testimony appearing in the arbitration record related to the schedule incentive fee and Williams\u2019s claim for attorneys\u2019 and expert fees. In response, Williams filed a 150-page memorandum that included the above-excerpted documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-13\">On March 29, 2004, the District Court issued a memorandum, order, and judgment in Williams\u2019s favor. The Court noted that arbitration awards may be vacated where arbitrators exceed their powers or act in manifest disregard of the law, but that such review is \u201cnarrow in the extreme.\u201d \u2018</p>\n<p id=\"b950-14\">First, Judge Green determined that the arbitrators had an evidentiary basis for awarding $1.5 million of the schedule incentive fee to Williams.. He noted that the panel \u201cextensively questioned\u201d Williams\u2019s expert witness, Bradley Hornburg, about the .contract, the liquidated damages provision of the subcontract, the actual liquidated damages incurred, and Parsons\u2019s forfeiture of its bonus to Motiva. Judge Green observed that Hornburg could not explain the 45 days of delay for which Parsons\u2019s claimed it was charged $100,000 per day by Motiva. Judge Green concluded that given \u201cthe consideration given by the Arbitration Panel to the interpretation of the Schedule Incentive Fee provision of the converted subcontract, and the questioning of the Defendant\u2019s expert witness, the record does not support a finding that [the] Arbitration Panel [acted ultra vires] or in manifest disregard of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b950-15\">Second, Judge Green ruled that the arbitrators did not manifestly disregard the law in awarding Williams attorneys\u2019 and expert fees because Delaware law was unsettled on that question. Judge Green acknowledged that the Delaware statute requiring arbitrators to award attorneys\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>and expert fees, 6 Del. C. \u00a7 3509,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> became effective after the commencement of arbitration proceedings. Nevertheless, because the Supreme Court of Delaware had not yet addressed whether the statute may be applied retroactively, Judge Green concluded that the arbitration panel did not exceed its authority or manifestly disregard the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Parsons timely appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"A6N\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">Review of arbitration awards under the FAA is \u201cextremely deferential.\u201d <em>Dluhos v. Strasberg, </em>321 F.3d 365, 370 (3d Cir.2003). Vacatur is appropriate only in \u201cexceedingly narrow\u201d circumstances, such as where arbitrators are partial or corrupt or manifestly disregard, rather than merely erroneously interpret, the law. <em>Id.; Local 863 Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of Am. v. Jersey Coast Egg Prod., </em>773 F.2d 530, 553 (3d Cir.1985) (stating that error of law is insufficient for vacatur). So long as an award \u201cdraws its essence\u201d from, <em>Local 863, </em>773 F.2d at 553, i.e., \u201carguably construe[s] or applie[s],\u201d the contract, the award must be upheld. <em>News Am. Pub. v. Newark Typographical Union, </em>918 F.2d 21, 24 (3d Cir. 1990). In other words, there must be \u201cabsolutely no support at all in the record justifying the arbitrator\u2019s determinations for a court to deny enforcement of the award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While \u201cthe courts are neither entitled nor encouraged simply to \u2018rubber stamp\u2019 the decisions of arbitrators,\u201d review of arbitration awards is \u201csingularly undemanding.\u201d <em>Matteson v. Ryder System Inc., </em>99 F.3d 108, 113 (3d Cir.1996) (Becker, J.).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-13\">1. <em>Schedule Incentive Fee</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-14\">The parties agree that to have awarded Williams $1.5 million of the Schedule Incentive Fee, the arbitrators had to conclude that Parsons paid Motiva $1.5 million in liquidated damages, not the full $4.5 million contemplated in Change Order # 90. The threshold question in this appeal, therefore, is whether there is any support at all in the record for that conclusion. <em>See News America, </em>918 F.2d at 24. If there is any such support, then the award must be affirmed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-15\">The record contains some evidence to support the arbitration award. Williams\u2019s expert, Hornburg, testified that \u201cParsons paid a million-and-a-half dollars in LDs [ (liquidated damages) ],\u201d i.e., not the $4.5 million it claimed to have paid. Additionally, Parsons\u2019s senior executive, William Hall, testified that Motiva granted Parsons a 30-day extension on its gasifier first feed date. Whether or not this Court would find such testimony relevant or credible, it cannot be said that there is \u201cabsolutely no support at all in the record justifying the arbitrator\u2019s determinations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the District Court correctly declined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>to vacate the award of $1.5 million of the Schedule Incentive Fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">2. <em>Attorneys \u2019 and Expert Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Both sides agree that if the arbitrators relied on \u00a7 3509 to award attorneys\u2019 and expert fees, they applied the statute retroactively. Parsons argues that the panel manifestly disregarded a leading Delaware case on retroactive application of statutory amendments, <em>Hubbard v. Hibbard Brown &amp; Co., </em>633 A.2d 345 (Del. 1993). Williams responds that until the Delaware Supreme Court specifically ruled on the retroactive application of \u00a7 3509, the arbitrators could not have manifestly disregarded the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Parsons asks this Court to read too much into <em>Hubbard, </em>which explained that \u201ca statutory amendment is remedial and may apply retroactively when it relates to practice, procedure or remedies and does not affect substantive or vested rights.\u201d 633 A.2d at 354. Because the rights at issue in <em>Hubbard </em>also were established by another statute, the court ruled that those rights were not substantive. <em>Id. Hubbard </em>thus suggests one approach to determining whether an amendment is remedial\u2014 whether another statute provides the same right. But <em>Hubbard </em>does not purport to establish the only approach to determining whether an amendment is remedial, and Parsons cites no cases holding that attorneys\u2019 and expert fees are a substantive right in Delaware. It is therefore plausible that the Delaware Supreme Court would determine that such fees are <em>not </em>a substantive right, and therefore \u00a7 3509 may be applied retroactively. At worst, the arbitrators wrongly applied <em>Hubbard, </em>but they did not manifestly disregard it.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">\u25a0 3. <em>Expert Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">Parsons\u2019s fallback position is that the arbitrators awarded excessive expert fees under Delaware law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Williams labels this argument \u201cconfusing\u201d and contends, in conclusory fashion, that Parsons cited cases that \u201chave no bearing on the issue before this Court.\u201d The District Court does not appear to have addressed this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">Parsons argues that the arbitrators manifestly disregarded <em>Stevenson v. Hen-ning, </em>268 A.2d 872 (Del.1970), and <em>Ny-gaard v. Lucchesi, </em>654 A.2d 410 (Del.Super.Ct.1994), both of which Parsons claims limit expert fees and expenses to the amount incurred for actual testimony. <em>Stevenson </em>interprets 10 Del. C. \u00a7 8906, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-12\">The fees for witnesses testifying as experts or in the capacity of professionals in cases in the Superior Court, the Court of Common Pleas and the Court of Chancery, within this State, shall be fixed by the court in its discretion, and such fees so fixed shall be taxed as part of the costs in each case and shall be collected and paid as other witness fees are now collected and paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b952-13\"><em>Id. Stevenson </em>explains that \u201c[wjitness fees allowed under \u00a7 8906 should be limited to time necessarily spent in attendance upon the court for the purpose of testifying. This does not include time spent in listening to other witnesses for \u2018orientation\u2019 or in consulting and advising with a party or counsel or other witnesses during the tri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>al.\u201d 268 A.2d at 874 (citing <em>State v. 0.0673 Acres of Land, </em>224 A.2d 598, 602 (Del. 1966)). <em>Nygaard </em>expresses the same principle positively, stating that \u201creimbursement for expert testimony [under 10 Del. C. \u00a7 8906] encompasses deposition testimony which is introduced into evidence as well as trial testimony.\u201d 654 A.2d at 413 (citing Super Ct. Civ. R. 54(h)).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">The question for this Court is whether the arbitrators manifestly disregarded <em>Stevenson, Nygaard </em>and \u00a7 8906 in awarding expert witness fees under \u00a7 3509 beyond those incurred for actual testimony. We hold that they did not. As <em>Stevenson </em>and <em>Nygaard </em>do not speak to \u00a7 3509, it is difficult to see how the arbitrators manifestly disregarded the law in awarding expert fees under that statute. Moreover, Parsons never explains why the established meaning of \u00a7 8906, Delaware\u2019s default rule for expert fees in litigation proceedings, controls the meaning of \u00a7 3509, Delaware\u2019s default rule for expert expenses in arbitration proceedings. And, indeed, the language of the two statutes is quite different. Section 8906 states that \u201cfees for witnesses testifying as experts ... shall be fixed by the court in its discretion.\u201d 10 Del. C. \u00a7 8906. In contrast, \u00a7 3509 requires an arbitrator to award to the substantially prevailing party its \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, arbitration costs and expenses for expert witnesses.\u201d 6 Del. C. \u00a7 3509. While Delaware courts appear not yet to have interpreted \u00a7 3509, a party\u2019s \u201cexpenses for expert witnesses\u201d seems broader than \u201cfees for witnesses testifying as experts,\u201d and arbitrators might interpret \u201creasonable\u201d as affording more leeway in awarding expert fees than fees \u201cfixed by the court in its discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">In light of the difference between \u00a7 8906 and \u00a7 3509, at worst the arbitrators erroneously interpreted \u00a7 3509 with their award of expert expenses. Accordingly, there is no ground for holding that the arbitrators manifestly disregarded the law. <em>See Dluhos, </em>321 F.3d at 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">Y. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b947-11\">. There appears to have been no choice-of-law provision in the amended subcontract. The conversion documents explain, however, that unless specifically modified, \"all terms and conditions of the original Subcontract shall remain in full force and effect.\u201d Apparently operating under this provision, the parties agree (as did the District Court) that Delaware law applies to the present dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b948-8\">. \"CONTRACTOR\" refers to Parsons; \"SUBCONTRACTOR\" refers to Williams; and \"COMPANY\u201d refers to Motiva.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b951-8\">. The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-9\">Absent any agreements to the contrary between the parties, the arbitrator in any arbitration proceeding arising under this chapter shall award to the substantially prevailing party its reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, arbitration costs, and expenses for expert witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-10\">6 Del. C. \u00a7 3509(b) (2005).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b951-16\">. While the Federal Arbitration Act\u2019s standards apply to this dispute, the FAA does not create federal question jurisdiction. <em>See Dlu-hos, </em>321 F.3d at 367 (citing <em>Roadway Package Sys. </em>v. <em>Kayser, </em>257 F.3d 287, 291 n. 1 (3d Cir.2001)). The District Court exercised diversity jurisdiction in this case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332; we exercise jurisdiction over the District Court\u2019s final order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b952-7\">. Parsons also argues that the arbitrators could not have awarded attorneys' fees under 6 Del. C. \u00a7 3506 because Parsons could not have been found to have acted in bad faith, which is required to award attorneys\u2019 fees under that statute. Because we conclude that \u00a7 3509, which requires the award of attorneys\u2019 and expert fees, arguably applied retroactively, we do not address whether the award of attorneys' fees could have been justified under \u00a7 3506.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
