Lellhame (\u201cLell-hame\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s decision affirming the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s (\u201cCommissioner\u201d) denial of disability benefits. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of the case, we will not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-15\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review a district court\u2019s decision to affirm a determination of the Social Security Administration <em>de novo. Harman v. </em>Apfel, 211 F.3d 1172, 1174 (9th Cir.2000). The court must review the record and affirm the Commissioner\u2019s determination if it is supported by \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d and based on correct legal standards. <em>Mayes v. Massanari, </em>276 F.3d 453, 458-59 (9th Cir.2001). We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-16\">The opinions of Dr. Lakshmi Neena Ma-direddi and Dr. Norman Wheeler are \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d supporting the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) determination that Lellhame is capable of performing \u201cmedium work.\u201d The ALJ failed, however, to apply and document the \u201cspecial technique\u201d for evaluating Lellhame\u2019s alleged depression. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520a (establishing procedure). Therefore, we remand on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-17\">The ALJ\u2019s determination that Lellhame is ineligible to receive disability benefits based on her ability to perform a \u201chand packager\u201d position also must be remanded. The ALJ properly refused to rely on the Medical-Vocational Guidelines and considered additional testimony from a vocational expert. <em>See Tackett v. Apfel, </em>180 F.3d 1094, 1101-02 (9th Cir.1999) (ALJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>may rely on guidelines alone only when they completely and accurately describe a claimant\u2019s limitations). Nonetheless, the ALJ\u2019s ultimate reliance on the vocational expert\u2019s testimony is flawed because the ALJ failed to \u201celicit a reasonable explanation\u201d for the apparent conflict between the vocational expert\u2019s testimony, the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, and Lell-hame\u2019s inability to read and limited understanding of English. Social Security Ruling (\u201cSSR\u201d) 00-4p. Although the vocational expert testified that Lellhame could work as a \u201chand packager,\u201d this position requires an individual to recognize the meaning of \u201c2,500 (two- or three-syllable) words\u201d and read \u201c95-120 words per minute.\u201d <em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles </em>920.587-018. Therefore, we remand Lellhame\u2019s claim to the Social Security Administration for reconsideration of her depression and limited literacy skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b645-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
