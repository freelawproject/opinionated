The action arose out of the circumstance that Winslow Township\u2019s police officers briefly detained appellants at a bank'in the township when the officers incorrectly believed that appellants might be involved in a robbery at the bank. The district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a) and 1367 and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">Appellants have'a heavy burden on this appeal as they lost this case at a jury trial. Though it is true that we exercise plenary review of an order denying a motion for a judgment as a matter of law, such a motion when made by a plaintiff \u201cshould be granted only if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant [the Township and its officers] and giving it the advantage of every fair and reasonable inference, there is insufficient evidence from which a jury reasonably could [not] find liability.\u201d <em>Lightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp., </em>4 F.3d 1153, 1166 (3d Cir. 1993). Moreover, our review of an order denying a motion for a new trial ordinarily is not plenary, and thus we can reverse the denial of the motion only if the district court abused its discretion in denying it. <em>Id. </em>at 1167.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-12\">The appellants state their contentions as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b886-13\">I. The district court for the District of New Jersey erred in failing to grant appellants\u2019 motion for directed verdict and/or new trial pursuant to Federal rules of Civil Procedure 50(b) and 59(a), because the jury\u2019s verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence; it was inconsistent with the facts and the law; there is no evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find that (A) appellees did not search and seize appellants, (B) that appellees had a reasonable suspicion to stop appellants, (C) appellees did not use excessive force, and (D) defense counsel\u2019s statements during closing arguments were blatantly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-14\">A. Motion for directed verdict pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b) is distinct from a motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-15\">B. A motion for directed verdict should be granted if there can be only one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict whereas whether a new trial is granted is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-16\">C. The jury\u2019s verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence; inconsistent with the facts and the law; there is no evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find that (A) appellees did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>not search and seize appellants, (B) that appellees had a reasonable suspicion to stop appellants, (C) appellees did not use excessive force, and (D) defense counsel\u2019s statements during closing arguments were blatantly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">1. There is no evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find that appel-lees did not search and [seize] appellants, and that [appellees] had reasonable suspicion to stop appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">2. There is no evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find that the appellees did not use excessive force against appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">3. Appellees lacked adequate training and supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">4. The statements of defense counsel during closing arguments were blatantly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">II. The district court for the District of New Jersey erred in failing to grant appellants\u2019 motion for directed verdict and/or sanctions against appellees pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 26(e) and 37(c)(1) when appellees and defense counsel withheld discoverable information.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">Appellants br. at iii-iv.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">We have reviewed this matter extensively and find no possible basis to disturb the verdict or the district court\u2019s subsequent disposition of the post-trial motions. Overall this case raised classic jury questions and thus the district court was correct to submit the matter to the jury. The jury found in favor of the appellees and the appellants are bound by the result. Finally, we see no basis to upset the district court\u2019s denial of relief to appellants predicated on appellees\u2019 alleged discovery and trial abuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">The orders of April 22, 2004, will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
