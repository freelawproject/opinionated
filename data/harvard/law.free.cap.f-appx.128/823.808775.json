The District Court sentenced defendant principally to a term of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, and defendant now challenges this sentence on three grounds. We assume that the parties are familiar with the facts, the procedural history, and the scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">First, defendant argues that, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), his sentence is constitutionally infirm. Second, defendant argues that the District Court erred by increasing defendant\u2019s offense level under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (the \u201cGuidelines\u201d) by 13 points, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(1)(N) (2000). Finally, defendant argues that the District Court erred by denying his application for a three-level decrease in the offense level under the Guidelines, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X1.1(b)(2) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">We are mindful that shortly before oral argument in this case the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), rendered the Guidelines advisory and non-binding. Defendant has informed this Court that he seeks a remand in light of the <em>Booker </em>decision and this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir.2005). Accordingly, this case is remanded so that the District Court may consider whether to resentence defendant, in conformity with the currently applicable statutory requirements explicated in the <em>Crosby </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">Any appeal taken from the District Court following this remand can be initiated only by filing a new notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 3, 4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-12\">As the District Court is required to take the Guidelines into account in deciding whether to resentence, we note that although we see no error in the Court\u2019s interpretation of Guidelines \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l)(N), its treatment of the \u00a7 2Xl.l(b)(2) issue may be problematic. The provision of \u00a7 2X1.1(b)(2) invoked by defendant states that the sentencing court is to \u201cdecrease by 3 levels\u201d the offense level applicable to a conspiracy (where not covered by a specific offense guideline), \u201cunless the defendant or a co-conspirator completed all the acts the conspirators believed necessary on their part for the successful completion of the substantive offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Xl.l(b)(2). Here, defendant requested an offense-level reduction pursuant to this provision on the basis that the coconspirators had not done all they believed necessary to complete the substantive offense because they had given the pictures to Gesser only for him to evaluate, not to buy or sell. <em>(See, e.g., </em>Sentencing Tr., Oct. 24, 2003, at 54.) In denying this request, the District Court did not make any formal findings, and its comments seem to indicate that it believed that defendant\u2019s argument was, instead, that the coconspirators\u2019 objective was unattainable simply because Gesser was an informant. <em>(See id. </em>at 57, 59-60.) As the Court indicated, that status is not a basis for a \u00a7 2Xl.l(b)(2) reduction. However, the Court should make a finding with respect to defendant\u2019s argument that the coconspirators had not done all they believed necessary to complete the substantive offense. If the Court accepts that argument, it should consider whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>to reduce defendant\u2019s sentence in accordance with \u00a7 2Xl.l(b)(2).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
