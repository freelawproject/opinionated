Hall, United States District Judge for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b847-12\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the District Court be and it hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-16\">Plaintiff-Appellant William Hollings (\u201cHollings\u201d) appeals from an August 22, 2003 order granting in part and denying in part Defendant-Appellee TransaetTools, Ine.\u2019s (\u201cTransaetTools\u2019s\u201d) motion to dismiss, and from a June 8, 2004 order awarding judgment to TransaetTools on the remainder of Hollings\u2019s claims. Holl-ings contends that triable issues of fact remained with respect to <em>all </em>of his claims, and that, as such, the district court erred in entering judgment in favor of Transaet-Tools. We assume that the parties are familiar with the facts, the procedural history, and the scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-17\">Hollings was employed by defendant TransaetTools between December 2000 and March 2003. In connection with Holl-ings\u2019s employment at TransaetTools, he was required to execute a non-compete agreement, which prohibited him from seeking employment with a competitor of TransaetTools for a period of one year following his departure from Transaet-Tools. Despite this non-compete agreement, in May 2003, Hollings \u2014 who believed that the non-compete agreement was unenforceable \u2014 accepted an offer of employment with Financial Fusion, a primary competitor of TransaetTools.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-18\">When Hollings informed TransaetTools of his new employment, TransaetTools sent Financial Fusion a letter, expressing concerns about Financial Fusion\u2019s decision to employ Hollings <em>(hereinafter </em>\u201cthe Tran-saetTools letter\u201d). Specifically, the letter indicated that \u201cTransaetTools has reason to believe that Mr. Hollings\u2019 performance of work for Financial Fusion will inevitably involve the disclosure and use of Transact-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>Tools\u2019 proprietary confidential and trade secret information in violation of his common-law and contractual obligations\u201d and that \u201cTransactTools takes these obligations very seriously and is prepared to take all necessary measures to protect itself from unfair competition.... \u201d The letter closed by seeking assurances: 1) that Hollings would not be working on Financial Fusion products which were competitive with TransaetTools\u2019s software products; and 2) that Hollings would not solicit TransaetTools\u2019s employees to work for Financial Fusion. Upon receipt of Transaet-Tools\u2019s letter, Financial Fusion terminated Hollings, effective immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">A few weeks later, Hollings filed this lawsuit against TransactTools, alleging: 1) that the TransactTools letter was defamatory; and 2) that TransactTools tortiously interfered with his employment with Financial Fusion. In addition, Hollings sought a declaratory judgment that his non-eompete agreement with Transact-Tools was unenforceable under New York law. The district court granted Transaet-Tools\u2019s motion to dismiss Hollings\u2019s defamation claim on August 22, 2003. On June 8, 2004, the district court granted summary judgment to TransactTools on Holl-ings\u2019s tortious interference claim. And\u2014 since the one year period of the non-compete agreement had since expired \u2014 the court also <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed Hollings\u2019s declaratory judgment claim as moot. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">We agree with the district court that the TransactTools letter was non-defamatory as a matter of law. <em>See Celle v. Filipino Reporter Enters. Inc., </em>209 F.3d 163, 177 (2d Cir.2000) (indicating that \u201c[wjhether particular words are defamatory presents a legal question to be resolved by the court[s] in the first instance\u201d (quoting <em>Aronson v. Wiersma, </em>65 N.Y.2d 592, 493 N.Y.S.2d 1006, 483 N.E.2d 1138, 1139 (1985))). Although Hollings argues that the letter can be read as suggesting that he \u201cwas a thief who stole information\u201d \u2014 or that he otherwise deliberately acted improperly in connection with his departure from Transact-Tools \u2014 the district court properly found otherwise. Read in context, the letter expresses, at most, TransaetTools\u2019s concern that Hollings\u2019s employment with Financial Fusion would inevitably result in the improper use of TransaetTools\u2019s proprietary information. And, this type of expression of concern is non-actionable under New York law. <em>See Flamm v. American Ass\u2019n of Univ. Women, </em>201 F.3d 144, 147-48 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">We also conclude that the district court properly awarded judgment to TransactTools on Hollings\u2019s tortious interference and declaratory judgment claims. Under New York law, Hollings was required to make a showing of malice, illegality, or other wrongdoing, in order to prevail on his tortious interference claim. <em>See Carvel Corp. v. Noonan, </em>3 N.Y.3d 182, 189-92, 785 N.Y.S.2d 359, 818 N.E.2d 1100 (2004); <em>Foster v. Churchill, </em>87 N.Y.2d 744, 750, 642 N.Y.S.2d 583, 665 N.E.2d 153 (1996). Hollings\u2019s evidence of any such malfeasance on the part of TransactTools was, however, too scant to create a genuine issue of fact for trial. <em>See Murray v. Xerox Corp., </em>811 F.2d 118, 121 (2d Cir. 1987) (in order to show a genuine issue of fact adequate to defeat summary judgment, a party \u201cmust do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts\u201d) (quoting <em>Matsushita Electrical Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986)). Similarly, Hollings\u2019s arguments for why \u2014 despite the expiration of the non-compete period \u2014 his request for declaratory judgment is not moot, are too speculative to require a re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>mand for further factual inquiry. <em>Cf. Spencer v. Kemna, </em>528 U.S. 1, 14-16, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998) (finding habeas petitioner\u2019s claim to be moot, and rejecting the petitioner\u2019s arguments for non-mootness as too speculative).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">We have considered all of Hollings\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
