The ALJ\u2019s determination that Brooks did not have a severe mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>impairment is supported by substantial evidence. The medical record did not indicate that Brooks\u2019 mental condition rose to the level of a severe impairment, and thus, there was no need for the ALJ to order further testing to determine Brooks\u2019 residual functional capacity in regards to her psychological problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">2. The ALJ determination regarding Brooks\u2019 residual functional capacity is was also supported by substantial evidence. In addition to Brooks\u2019 medical records, evidence of Brooks\u2019 daily activities, including cleaning, cooking, shopping, child care, and personal care, indicated that Brooks had the adequate residual functional capacity to perform at least sedentary work.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">3. Finally, the ALJ\u2019s opinion adequately considers all of the evidence and lays out the reasons for his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Therefore, the district court\u2019s decision is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b370-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
