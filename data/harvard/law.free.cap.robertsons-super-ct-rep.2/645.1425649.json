As this is the only important direction which is objected to by the plaintiffs, it is unnecessary to state the further provisions of the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The direction objected to does not constitute a trust to hold a portion of the funds to indemnify the assignee for such sums as he may be compelled to pay upon a contingent liability, and which, from the nature of the obligation, he may never be required to pay at all, but it is a direction to pay the rents as they shall become due ; for in no other way can the guarantor be fully protected and saved harmless, of and from the payment of such rents. It is, therefore, a trust to pay certain sums, not yet due, at certain fixed periods as they shall accrue ; to which, under numerous decisions, no valid objection can be made. It follows that the assignment must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The plaintiffs failed to show by their evidence, I think, that the furniture of the defendant Jacobson, alleged to be held by contract, comprised any articles other than those which were by law exempt from sales on execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The defendants must have judgment, dismissing the complaint with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
