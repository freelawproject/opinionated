Y.; one for $2000, the other for $3000, for the purpose of paying two notes of Cook, Evarts &amp; Co. for those amounts, falling due at the Park Bank. The drafts were accordingly collected by the Park Bank, but the notes were either paid by the makers or protested and returned. The proceeds of the drafts ($5000) were therefore credited by the Park Bank to the Weedsport' Bank. On the 2d of May, 1861, the Weedsport Bank, by its cashier, wrote to the Park Bank a letter or order of that date, the body of which was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-9\">\u201cPlease deliver to C. W. Kellogg, Escp or order,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-10\">.

W. Kellogg the two paid notes therein mentioned, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>placed to the credit of said 0. W. Kellogg the $5000, which were the aforesaid proceeds of the two drafts. Kellogg was then a dealer and depositor with the Park Bank, and so continued to be until the 6th of June, 1861, when his account was closed. Kellogg checked or drew against this credit, and against his deposits, so that on the 7th of May, 1861, the entire amount of all the $5000 was drawn out by and paid to him. On the 9th of May, 1861, the cashier of the Weedsport Bank wrote to the cashier of the Park Bank as follows : \u201c I have drawn on you this day for the amount of the drafts, $5000, in favor of E. J. Blake, Esq. cashier, which please honor, <em>unless you have already paid the amount on our order to O. W. </em>Kellogg.\u201d This letter was received by the Park Bank, on the 11th May, 1861. On the 15th May, 1861, the cashier of the Weedsport Bank wrote to the cashier of the Park Bank, thus: \u201c Please inform me whether you have paid our draft for $5000 to O. W. Kellogg, and oblige.\u201d The latter cashier, on the 17th May, 1861, answered thus : \u201c We gave credit, 4th inst. to O. W. Kellogg, $5000, upon your order, of course.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-5\">In March, 1863, this action was brought. The complaint alleged a demand for the money on the 18th May, 1861. At that time Kellogg had not only drawn out all of said $5000, but also all his other deposits, except $1716.64, as appeared by his account. On the 31st of May, when his book was balanced, he had a credit of $326.70, and this he drew out, so that his account was closed 6th June, 1861.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-6\">The defendants, for answer, set up that Kellogg was one of their depositors, and aver payment of the $5000 to the plaintiff, by the above credit to Kellogg, in account, on the 4th of May, <em>\u201c </em>and by paying out the said sum within a short time thereafter to the said Kellogg, upon his checks drawn upon the defendants therefor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-7\">The referee found, as conclusions of law, that the credit given by the defendants and the withdrawal of the amount by means of checks or notes charged as aforesaid, was a compliance with the order of the 2d day of May, 1861, and the same was delivery or payment of the proceeds of the drafts to said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Kellogg. He accordingly directed that the complaint should be dismissed with costs, and judgment having been entered accordingly, the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b428-4\"><em>B. W. Huntington, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b428-5\"><em>E. L. Fancher, </em>for the respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b428-6\">By the Court,</p>\n<author id=\"AAT\">Barbour, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A01\">The order of May 2d, 1861, is sufficient, it appears to me, to establish the fact that the \u00a75000 which is the subject matter of this controversy, was not then in the hands of the defendants as mere custodians of a fund belonging to the plaintiffs as owners, but that, on the contrary, such sum had been received by the defendants in the ordinary course of their banking business and passed to the plaintiffs\u2019 credit, prior to the transaction with Kellogg; for that order directs the delivery of the cash to the latter, \u201c <em>if the two drafts are to our credit,\u201d </em>and only in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">This view of the case is also sustained and strengthened by the plaintiffs\u2019 letters of the 9th and 15th of May, in which they speak of the delivery of cash contemplated in the order of May 2d, not as a mere handing over to Kellogg of \u00a75000, but as a payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">The question for consideration then is, whether the acceptance by the defendants of the order of May 2d, and their transfer of the credit from the plaintiffs\u2019 account to that of Kellogg, was an extinguishment of the debt as between the parties to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Kellogg was not the mere agent of the plaintiffs, even to receive the notes and the drafts; but, as to them, he was clothed with power to direct their delivery, by his indorsement, to such person as he should appoint. If he had, upon the face of the order of the 2d of May, been vested with like authority in respect to the money, it could hardly be claimed that the direction to <em>deliver </em>to Kellogg or to his order, the cash which the defendants owed to the plaintiffs, was not, substantially, a requisition to pay the debt to him or to his indorsee, whoever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>that might he ; and that the acceptance of the order and such a transfer of credits as was made by the defendants, would have operated as a payment of their indebtedness to the plaintiffs. The word <em>deliver, </em>in the case supposed, would be fully equivalent to the word <em>pay ; </em>and would, I think, have authorized the defendants to treat Kellogg, or his or any subsequent indorsee, as the person entitled to have payment of the debt. The intention of the drawer, in that case, to have the money paid to whomsoever should present the paper, would have been quite clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">I can perceive no substantial distinction between the case supposed and the facts as they existed. The order, as we have seen, did not direct the delivery of moneys belonging to the plaintiffs, and held by the defendants, but, in-effect, required the latter to pay over to Kellogg a sum which they had received in a certain transaction and passed to the credit of, and for which they then had stood indebted to, the plaintiffs. Kellogg was simply the payee of an order directing the payment of a debt; and so, manifestly, the plaintiffs themselves understood it. For in their letter of May 9th, they inform the defendants that they have <em>drawn </em>for the $5000 in favor of E. J. Blake, and request them to honor such draft, <em>\u201c </em>unless you have already <em>paid </em>the amount on our order to C. W. Kellogg and on the 15th they say, by their cashier\u2019s letter, \u201c Please inform me whether you have <em>paid </em>our <em>draft </em>for $5000 to C. W. Kellogg.\u201d The cognomen \u201cdraft,\u201d thus given to the order by the plaintiffs, coupled with the word <em>\u201cpaid,\u201d </em>instead of \u201c delivered,\u201d clearly shows, it appears to me, a design on their part to place Kellogg, by the order in question, precisely in the condition of a payee of a draft for money, and warranted the transaction had with him by the defendants in regard thereto ; and I am, therefore, of opinion that the acceptance of such order, and so far as the plaintiffs were concerned, its payment by a transfer of credits, was an extinguishment of the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The judgment should be arffirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
