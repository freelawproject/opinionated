A witness, who had known H. for four or five years, and pretty well for a year or two previous to certain transactions in question, had been in the habit of selling him goods on credit; had seen statements of H.\u2019s business, wherein the dividends and profits of him and his partner were some $4000 in six . months; knew what his credit was, at the time of a sale in question; and that it was good; being asked the question, \u201c Did you learn at that time what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>H. was reputed to be worth <em>V\u2019 Held </em>that the witness was competent to testify as to H.\u2019s responsibility and credit, and that an objection to such question was properly overruled.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b638-4\">2.

On the 25tli September, they sold their entire stock of goods to George V. House for $1000 in cash, and his nine notes' for $1022 each, payable in from six to fourteen months. On the 28th September, Peck &amp; Co. assigned those notes and other bills receivable to John Mack. The defendants, Peck &amp; Mack, who were witnesses, did not claim but that the sale was made with a view to the assignment. The plaintiffs proved that House had been discharged under the insolvent law two and a half years before the sale in question, and that, the notes he gave-were each protested as they fell due, and were now in suit. The counsel for <em>the </em>defendant Mack then interrogated him : <em>\u201c </em>Did you learn at that. time what Mr. House was reputed to be worth ?\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel objected to the question. The objection was overruled, and-the plaintiffs excepted. The defendant answered,. <em>\u201c </em>I understood he was worth $25,000 to $30,000.\u201d The plaintiffs then called John McKillip, the president of a commercial agency, who testified that it was his, business to receive and communicate intelligence as to the commercial responsibility of men. He was asked to communicate the result of his books, as to the responsibility of House in September, 1861. The question was objected to, and the objection sustained, and the plaintiffs excepted. The court found, as a fact, from the evidence of Mack, that House was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>possessed of means sufficient to carry this purchase into effect. At the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 testimony, the court found, as facts, that the sale and assignment were not fraudulent, and gave judgment for the defendants on the merits. The plaintiff. appealed to the general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b639-5\"><em>W. Watson, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b639-6\"><em>A. J.

But it is insisted that the court erred ih overruling the objection to the question, \u201c Did you learn at that time what Mr. House was reported to be worth ?\u201d The witness had known House for four or five years\u2014had known him pretty well- for a year or two previous to these transactions. House had been a customer of the witness, who had been in the habit of selling him goods on credit. The witness further stated that he had seen statements of House\u2019s business, and that the dividends and profits between, and by, House and his partner were some $4000 in six months \u2014drew that much money\u2014\u201c I knew what his credit was at the time of this sale; it was good.\u201d Then follows^\u2014after a few immaterial questions\u2014the one objected to. The ruling of the court Was unexceptionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">I think the witness had knowledge of the defendant\u2019s (House) pecuniary circumstances and facts connected with his business, growing out of the witness\u2019 commercial relation and acquaint<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>anee, to qualify him to sp\u00e9ak upon the question of House\u2019s responsibility and credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">The evidence of McKillip was properly excluded. He had .stated he did not know House ; had no knowledge personally of his responsibility ; knew nothing of his general reputation for pecuniary responsibility, either in Troy or New York, \u201cexcept from - my books and records- of my agency.\u201d After making these statements, this question was put by the plaintiff, (producing a paper,) \u201c I ask you whether this paper contains a 'correct result of your books, as to the standing of Mr. House?\u201d The answer to this question was properly excluded. The judgment in this case should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
