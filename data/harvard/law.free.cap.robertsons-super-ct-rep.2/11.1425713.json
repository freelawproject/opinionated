A certificate of transfer issued by the custom house authorities constitutes a delivery of goods in bond, from the importer to the purchaser ; Mr. Bullard did obtain such a certificate of transfer of these 393 bags sold to the plaintiffs ; he obtained this certificate the 7th of January, 1856 ; it was mailed the same day to the plaintiffs ; the plaintiffs or their assigns could not have obtained the 393 bags of saltpetre without this certificate of transfer. The plaintiffs paid for the saltpetre between the 22d December, 1855, and the 2d January, 1856. The plaintiffs could not deliver the saltpetre they purchased from Mr. Bullard until the 7th January, 1856.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-11\">\u2022 The plaintiffs, on the 12th January, 1856, made a formal tender, through their attorney at law, to the defendants, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>they replied: We cannot accept it, (393 hags of saltpetre,) as the contract calls for different things,\u201d or words to that effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-5\">The action coming on to be tried before a justice of this court and a jury, the defendants, upon the case being opened, moved to dismiss the complaint; the court overruled the motion, and to its decision in that behalf the counsel for the defendants duly excepted. The counsel for the defendants, upon the case being rested on behalf of the plaintiffs, renewed his motion to dismiss the complaint; the court overruled the motion, and to its decision in that behalf the counsel for the defendants duly excepted. After introducing some testimony, the defendants again moved to dismiss the complaint, which motion was denied by the court, and the defendants\u2019 counsel duly excepted. The defendants\u2019 counsel thereupon requested the court to instruct the jury to find a verdict for the defendants ; the court declined so to do, and the defendants\u2019 counsel excepted. Thereupon the court directed the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiffs for $4296.95, and \u201c directed the exceptions taken at \"the trial to be heard in the first instance at the general term, and judgment (in the meantime to be) suspended.\" To this direction the counsel for the defendants duly excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b23-6\"><em>R. W. Van Pelt, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-7\">I. The first exception of the defendants, on. the refusal of the court to .dismiss the complaint, is not well taken. The complaint does state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and it does allege a willingness, readiness, and ability on the part of the plaintiffs to perform their part of the said contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-8\">II. The testimony in reference to the plaintiffs\u2019 willingness to deliver the saltpetre from alongside the ship was proper, and the defendants\u2019 objection thereto was not well taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b23-9\">III. On the 26th December, two days after the saltpetre was fully discharged, it was worth trom 16 to 17 cts. per lb. which was the maximum price it had attained pending this whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>transaction, and being two cents per lb. more than the defend- . ants had contracted to give the plaintiffs for it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b24-5\">IV. The proposition that the plaintiffs were bound to deliver alongside the ship, and because they did not, that the defendants are discharged from the contract, is not sound. The contract was, that the cash was to be paid when the saltpetre <em>was-entered in bond. </em>Both parties contemplated the entering of saltpetre in bond, and therefore the contract was subordinate to the rules and regulations of the Custom House. But \u25a0 there was no law or regulation compelling saltpetre entered in bond to be sent to the public store. . And this lot might have been discharged alongside, only the quantity was so great it could not be weighed in <em>one </em>day, and it would have to lay on the wharf over night, which the Custom House officers would not permit. The plaintiffs also notified the defendants that there would be no additional charge to them for this. \u25a0 Delivery of the saltpetre according to <em>the exact </em>terms and in the <em>exact mode </em>stated in the agreement was not necessary.- A <em>substantial </em>performance was sufficient, provided no injury or inconvenience was occasioned thereby, and provided also that the exact mode of performance be not an essential consideration. <em>(Story on Sales, </em>\u00a7 251.) . The answer alleges that the plaintiffs were the'owners of 393 bags. The fact that the number of bags contracted to be sold was stated in the contract at 733, and the quantity actually delivered or tendered was 393 bags, does not excuse the defendants from taking the latter quantity, <em>because the contract was by. its very terms severable. </em>The consideration was capable of apportionment, and the exact quantity was not of the essence of the contract. The defendants were, therefore, bound to carry out the contract and take as many pounds at 15 cents per lb. as the plaintiffs <em>could </em>deliver. <em>(Story on Sales, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 240-242 ; <em>on Contracts, </em>\u00a7 16. <em>Havemeyer </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>35 <em>Barb. </em>515.) . The defendants having unreasonably refused to accept the saltpetre, the title to which had been properly passed to them, the plaintiffs had the right, and it was their duty, after allowing a reasonable time to elapse, to sell it at auction, and hold the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>ants responsible for the difference between the original price and the net sum. which it brought. <em>(Story on Sales, </em>\u00a7 402.)</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b25-5\"><em>James Eschwege, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-6\">I. The complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and should be dismissed on that ground.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-7\">1. The plaintiffs do not allege that they were ready and willing to perform the contract on their part, or that they tendered or demanded performance thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-8\">2. The complaint shows affirmatively that the plaintiffs were not ready to perform, and that they did not and could not tender performance of the contract on their part. The contract upon which this action is brought is executory; its conditions are mutual and dependent; the defendants are to pay for, the plaintiffs are to deliver 733 bags of crude saltpetre in bond, to arrive on board the ship <em>Arabella, token landed, and from alongside the ship, </em>in Boston. Neither party can recover, unless readiness and willingness to perform on his part, and tender, are alleged. <em>(Dunham </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>4 <em>Selden, </em>508. <em>Lester </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>1 <em>Kern. </em>453. 12 <em>Barb. </em>502. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Healey, </em>3 <em>Denio, </em>368. <em>West </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>1 <em>Duer, </em>277.) <em>(a.) </em>The contract requires the plaintiffs to deliver 733 bags ; the complaint alleges a tender of 393 bags only, and is fatally defective on that ground ; the contract is entire, and the defendants are not bound to receive a part of the whole quantity only. <em>(Russell </em>v. <em>Nicoll, </em>3 <em>Wend. </em>112. <em>Davenport </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>7 <em>Cowen, </em>231. <em>Champlin </em>v. <em>Rowley, </em>18 <em>Wend. </em>187. <em>Waddington </em>v. <em>Oliver, </em>5 <em>Bos. &amp; Pul. </em>61. <em>Paige </em>v. <em>Ott, </em>5 <em>Denio, </em>406. 2 <em>Pars, on Cont. </em>163, 170. <em>Oakley </em>v. <em>Morton, </em>1 <em>Kern. </em>25.) <em>(b.) </em>No allegation of a waiver on the part of the defendants as to quantity is contained in the complaint. <em>(Baldwin </em>v. <em>Munn, </em>2 <em>Wend. </em>399. <em>Oakley </em>v. <em>Morton, </em>1 <em>Kern, </em>25, 33.) (c.) The contract required the plaintiffs to deliver the saltpetre from alongside the vessel; the complaint does not allege readiness and willingness so to deliver, but the reverse ; the plaintiffs aver that by the laws and statutes, rules and regulations, &amp;c. they were <em>prevented </em>from delivering from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>alongside the vessel. The defendants were entitled to such delivery, which not having been tendered by the plaintiffs, they cannot recover ; the complaint is bad for not alleging such tender. (2 <em>Parsons on Cont. </em>184, 187, <em>et seq. </em>6 <em>Term Rep. </em>710. <em>Moakley </em>v. <em>Riggs, </em>19 <em>John. </em>71. <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>12 <em>Wend. 589.

The complaint should have been dismissed when the plaintiffs rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-6\">1. Because it appeared that the plaintiffs were not ready to deliver, and did not tender the <em>quantity </em>stipulated. <em>(Fischell </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>28 <em>Eng. Law &amp; Eq. Rep. </em>404, <em>cases cited supra under a.) </em>And evidence tending to establish a waiver on the part of the defendants does not cure this defect. <em>(Baldwin </em>v. <em>Munn, </em>2 <em>Wend. </em>399. <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Holmes, 5 Seld. </em>525.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-7\">2. Because it appeared that the plaintiffs were not ready to deliver, and did not tender <em>at the time </em>stipulated, namely, when landed. <em>(Friess </em>v. <em>Rider, </em>24 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>367. 2 <em>Story on Contracts, </em>\u00a7 970, <em>a; </em>\u00a7 971.) Delivery could only be tendered and consummated by the proper custom house certificate this was not in the possession of the plaintiffs before the 8th of January ; the saltpetre was landed on the 24th of December ; one half of the whole quantity had been delivered on the 20th of December to other purchasers, and between these dates saltpetre had depreciated in value 21/2 cents per pound the defendants had repeatedly demanded the custom house certificate. Time becomes material in an agreement where delay diminishes the value of the thing contracted for. <em>(Decamp </em>v. <em>Fear, 5 S. &amp; R. </em>323.) The plaintiffs could not tender what they did not possess.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-8\">3. Because it appeared that the plaintiffs were not ready to deliver, and did not tender <em>in the manner </em>stipulated, namely, from alongside the vessel. Ho law, statute, rule or regulation prevented the plaintiffs from delivering according to contract. Sudh delivery is a condition precedent, the defendants were entitled to, and did insist upon its performance, and without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>such condition would not have made the purchase. <em>(Cases cited supra under </em>c. <em>Worsley </em>v. Wood, 6 <em>Term Rep. </em>720. 2 <em>Story on Contracts, </em>543.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-5\">IV. The plaintiff's are not entitled to recover, even if the defendants were in default. On the 24th of December, when all the saltpetre was landed, and the plaintiffs were bound to deliver, and the defendants to receive, the market price was higher than the price stipulated in the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-6\">V. The learned judge, erred in directing the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff's, thus taking from the jury the question of fact whether the defendants did or did not demand from the plaintiffs the custom house certificate. The testimony on this question is conflicting. <em>(Purchase </em>v. <em>Mattison, </em>25 <em>How. Pr. Rep. </em>161. <em>Cobb </em>v. <em>Cornish, </em>16 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>602. <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>Beach, Id. </em>606.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b27-9\">VI. The complaint should be dismissed for not stating a cause of action, or the verdict should be set aside, and a new trial granted, with costs.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b27-10\">Moncrief, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Anm\">This action is brought upon a written contract of sale of saltpetre; in plain terms, entitling the defendants to receive from the plaintiffs when landed in Boston, alongside of the ship Arabella, 733 bags crude saltpeter, to arrive on board the said ship; and there is an ample illustration in the bill of exceptions in this case, of the peculiarities of mercantile contracts; and the necessity of giving construction to each, according to the intent of the contracting parties, manifest from their respective contracts. By the sale note from Bullard to the Hazard Powder Co. following the decision in <em>Havemeyer </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>(35 <em>Barb. </em>515, 521,) the latter was entitled as a purchaser of an invoice of goods then on board the ship Arabella, to whatever portion of the quantity sold arrived in a sound condition, and they received their one half part of the invoice so purchased. The plaintiffs\u2019 contract calls for \u201c the <em>one half </em>of 1464 bags saltpetre,\u201d and hence, in my view, differs most essentially from the agreement to deliver <em>\u201c </em>one hale of an <em>invoice </em>of saltpetre, to arrive per ship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Arabella, say about 783 bags more or less.\u201d * * The one can legally claim 732 bags of saltpetre from on board the vessel Arabella. The other having bought the moiety of whatever is on board and may arrive at the port of destination, of course is entitled to demand what may arrive. The distinction between the sale to the Hazard Powder Oo. and the case cited from 35 <em>Barb. </em>{supra,) is that in the one there was no guarantee as to quality, and in the other \u201c the sugar was to be of current quality clayed; \u201d this, however, is immaterial in the present discussion, inasmuch as in both these instances the contract of sale must be held to be absolute in the sense that the party was entitled to the thing he had agreed to buy, being then on board of vessel. (35 <em>Barb. </em>519.) With reference to the contract made with the plaintiff, it may be questionable whether they were bound to receive under it any greater number of bags than 732, being the one half of 1464 bags of saltpetre on board of the ship Arabella on the 12th September, 1855.\u201d If on that day on board of that ship, there was in existence only 786 bags of saltpetre, it can need no argument to state as a legal verity, that Mr. Bullard could not by virtue of the contract require the plaintiff to accept 393 bags, being the one half of the saltpetre actually arriving at Boston, and delivered from on board the ship Arabella, unless their contract is construed to import a sale of half of the invoiced saltpetre then on board of the ship Arabella. (2 <em>Ell. &amp; Bl. </em>836. 23 <em>Law. J. 2 B. </em>27.)</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">It is an elementary principle of law, that if the right of property has not passed by the bargain, the purchaser cannot be made responsible for the price, unless the vendor can show that the article or chattel tendered for acceptance, fairly corresponded in <em>quantity </em>* * with the things bargained for and agreed to be bought; for no man can be compelled to <em>take more than he agreed to buy. </em>(2 <em>Pars. on Cont. </em>163. <em>Pars. Mer. Law, </em>53. 1 <em>Campb. </em>53, 361. 15 <em>M. &amp; W. </em>85. <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>15 <em>Law J. Exch. </em>200. <em>Addison on Contracts, </em>238, <em>p. </em>237, <em>top paging, 2 Amer. </em>ed.) It will not be pretended that in either <em>Havemeyer </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>(supra,) or by virtue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>of the contract of Bullard with the Hazard Powder Co., the importer or vendor was divested of his property, or that the title to the goods passed to the vendee.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The weight of the articles remained to be ascertained. <em>(Add. on Cont. </em>224, 225, <em>and cases cited. Pars. Mer. </em>Law, 48, 49.) The evidence fully establishes the fact, in the present case, that the title to the goods remained in Mr. Bullard until the 7th January, 1856. At any time subsequent to the 11th August or 12th September, 1855, he could have assigned and transferred the title to the saltpetre on board of the ship Arabella by the indorsement and delivery of the bills of lading which he then had, and which he continued to hold until after the arrival of the ship at Boston. In confirmation of this view, Mr. Bullard abandons property to the underwriters, and-receives payment therefor from them, which property, otherwise was owned by the plaintiffs or by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Again : the transaction betw\u00e9en these parties on the 25th September, 1855, cannot be treated as an absolute sale of 733 bags of saltpetre at that time; it does not appear that such a quantity which could be claimed by the plaintiffs under their contract with Bullard, was in existence on board the ship Arabella on that day; only 393 bags arrived at Boston, over which the plaintiffs exercised acts of ownership or control, or became entitled to the possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">The contract of the plaintiffs with the defendants, called for the delivery of 733 bags of saltpetre from on board the ship Arabella, to be taken when landed alongside the ship at Boston; the plaintiffs could not be required to transfer any greater, and the defendants as plainly cannot be compelled to accept any less number of'bags of saltpetre, than they had agreed to purchase, and the plaintiffs contracted to deliver. <em>(Kelley </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>5 <em>Duer, </em>336.) The tender of a number less than 733 bags of saltpeter, did not satisfy the requirements of the contract on the part of the plaintiffs, and the defendants were not bound to accept. <em>Shields et al. </em>v. <em>Pettie et al. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>(4 <em>Comst. </em>122); <em>S. C. </em>2 <em>Sand. S. C. Rep. </em>262,) is in striking analogy with the agreement between these parties, and is decisive of the question involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Upon the evidence in the case, I am of the opinion that the learned judge erred in not directing a verdict for the defendants) and in my opinion the refusal to dismiss the complaint upon the plaintiffs resting their case, was also erroneous; a verdict of a jury for the plaintiffs, upon the evidence then introduced cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">In this view, the other exceptions need not be,'and are not noticed;</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">The exceptions should be sustained, and a new trial directed, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<author id=\"b30-9\">Robertson, Ch.

Y. Rep. 122; S. C. </em>2 <em>Sandf. </em>262 ; <em>Benedict </em>v. <em>Field, </em>16 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>595 ; <em>S. C. </em>4 <em>Duer, </em>154,) and not a transfer of title. The only question is,, whether the contract was for the delivery of so much of the amount sold as should arrive, and therefore apportionable, or only of the specified amount. In <em>Havemeyer </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>(35 <em>Barb. </em>515,) the contract was of an invoice of goods, of a certain number of tons, \u201c <em>more or less,\u201d </em>and <em>for that reason only, </em>it was held that the seller was only bound to deliver what arrived, and was not responsible for any loss on the voyage. In the present case, the contract was for a definite number of bags of saltpetre, although not for a specified quantity. There does not seem to be any good reason, why a purchaser of goods at sea, of whose quantity he cannot be presumed to be aware, should be compelled to accept part of the quantity bought by him, any more than if they were in a distant warehouse. The fact that such goods have not arrived, merely postpones the execution of the contract, and without some qualification in its terms, ought not to affect the right of either party. In the case last cited, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>principal question was whether the terms \u201c <em>to arrive on or before\u201d </em>a certain day, used in it, made the sale absolute, or conditional on the arrival, on or before that day, and it was held to be absolute <em>on arrival, </em>whenever it happened, merely postponing the time of delivery, distinguishing it from <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Nicoll, </em>(3 <em>Wend. </em>112,) only by the insertion of the name of the vessel. The obligation of the seller only to deliver what arrived, in such a case, sustains a correlative obligation on the part of the buyer to accept it. But unless the former obligation had been limited by the use of the words \u201c more- or less,\u201d and \u201cinvoice,\u201d the purchaser, by whom the action was brought, could not have been enabled to recover for non-delivery of the cargo actually arrived, if less than the amount specified, as embracing the whole of the contract. All the reasons, which in the case of any other contract entitle the party seeking to enforce it, to reject a partial, and require a full performance, equally applies to such an one. Less than the full amount contracted for, may baffle all the purposes of a buyer. His right to insist on a complete performance, is established by numerous authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"ADoF\">Besides, there was on hoard the vessel, on its arrival, the full number of bags of saltpetre required to be delivered by the contract, although nearly one half had been lessened ibulk, by the dissolving of part of the contents by water. These were transferred to underwriters by the plaintiffs, or those under whom they claim, by abandonment. There was no guaranty of quality in the contract, and the price was to be regulated by weight. I see no reason why the defendants were not entitled to whatever remained of the saltpetre -in the bags, which were abandoned. It was held, in <em>Havemeyer </em>v. <em>Cunningham, (ubi supra,) </em>that the purchasers were entitled to recover for the part of the cargo alleged to have been injured.. They were, at least, entitled to an election. Possibly, if such goods were <em>unmerchantable, </em>as charged in the complaint, as the defendants would not be bound to accept them, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>tiff was not bound to tender them ; but the evidence did-not sustain this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Without regard to the mode of delivery, I, therefore, concur in the opinion that the defendants are entitled to a new trial, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Monell, J. concurred in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
