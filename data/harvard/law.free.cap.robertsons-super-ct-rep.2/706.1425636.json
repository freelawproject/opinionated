There can be no necessity for a formal written bill of items, where the plaintiff has been partly examined as a witness, although she has not already upon her direct examination disclosed the nature of her claim, since she can be compelled to do so, upon her cross-examination,</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b714-7\">(Before Moncrief, J. at special term,</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AL-\">October, 1884.)</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b714-8\">Moncrief, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APy\">This is an application by the defendants for \u2022 a bill of particulars of the plaintiff\u2019s demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">It appears that the action was commenced in July, 1863 ; that issue was joined in August,-1863 <em>; </em>that the action was referred to Hon. W. F. Allen to hear and determine in November, 1863 ; that the plaintiff has given testimony on her own behalf upon several occasions, and the further trial of the cause stands over for the cross-examination of said plaintiff by the defendants,</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">The order to show cause why a bill' of particulars should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>not be furnished, and in the meantime staying all proceedings, would not have been granted had thes\u00e9 facts been presented to the judge who granted the order; there can be no necessity for a formal written bill of items when the plaintiff, if she has not already upon the direct, can, upon her cross-examination be compelled to disclose the nature of her claim with the nicest particularity.</p>\n<p id=\"ALz\">It was held in <em>Andrews v. Cleveland, </em>(3 <em>Wend. </em>437,) that <em>\u201c </em>when a bill of particulars is applied for by a defendant <em>after issue joined, </em>it is a suspicious circumstance and the officer granting the order should be well satisfied that the object of the party is not delay ; and he should require a good excuse for the <em>late </em>application.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Assuming the court to have the power to order a bill of particulars after the issues have been referred to a referee to hear and determine, I am quite clear that it will\" not be exercised to interrupt a trial actually proceeding before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">The motion must be denied, with $10 costs. The order staying proceedings is vacated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
