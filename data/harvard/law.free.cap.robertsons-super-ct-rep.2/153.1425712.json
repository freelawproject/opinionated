The complaint was in the usual form, and simply set up possession from prior grantors. The defendant\u2019s answer set up the purchase of said lot by one John L. Brouwer, under a corporation sale for assessments, made the 18th of July, 1862 ; that, under such purchase, so made by said Brouwer, he obtained the usual lease from the corporation in such cases, and that on the 21st day of December, 1855, the said Brouwer duly assigned said lease to the defendant, Mc-Cafferty, who immediately took possession of the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-12\">On the trial, the plaintiff simply proved title and rested. The defendant then offered in evidence the corporation ordinance under which the assessment was made, the appointment of assessors and a notice to owners, &amp;c. The defendant further proved and offered in evidence the ordinance of the common council, approved July 7, 1848, designating the Hew York <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>Evening Post </em>and <em>Commercial Advertiser </em>as corporation papers for one year from that date, and also proved the publication in said papers for ten consecutive days, from July 26, 1849, of the following notice <em>i</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-4\"><em>\u201c Corporation </em>Notice.\u2014Public notice is hereby given to the owner or owners, occupant or occupants of all houses and lots, improved or unimproved lands affected thereby, that the following assessments have been completed by the assessors, and are lodged in the office of the bureau of assessments, for examination by all persons interested, viz : for regulating and setting curb and gutter stones in the Fourth avenue, from 28 th to 38th streets, and flagging a space four feet wide through the side walks of the same. The limits embraced by such assessment include all the several houses and lots of ground, vacant lots, pieces and parcels of land, situated on both sides of Fourth avenue, between 28th and 38th streets on the northerly side of 28th street, between Lexington and Madison avenues on both sides of 29th, 30th, 31st, 32d, 33d, 34th, 35 th, 36 th and 37th streets, between Lexington and Madison avenues, and on the southerly side of 38th street, between Lexington and Madison avenues. All persons whose interests are affected by the above named assessments, and who are opposed to the same, or either of them, are requested to present their objections in writing <em>to the undersigned, </em>at their office, within 30 days from the date of this notice.

The judge who tried the case sustained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>the objection on the first ground, and charged the jury accordingly, who found a verdict for the plaintiff, with \u00a7500 damages. Judgment having been entered upon the verdict, the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b163-5\"><em>Schell, Slosson &amp; Hutchins, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b163-6\"><em>Adriance &amp; Vanderpoel, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b163-7\">By the Court,</p>\n<author id=\"A9v\">McCunn, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aub\">I fully concur in the r\u00faling of the judge, at the trial. My view of the case is that both of the objections taken by the plaintiff to the introduction of the notice, are valid objections, and go to defeat the defendant\u2019s entire case.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Where a statute, in effect, strips an individual of his property or title, or which in any way affects the same, its requirements must be strictly complied with to enable parties purchasing to acquire a title. Moreover, the requirements of the statute are the very conditions upon which the owner is divested of his title and property ; and it does not lie with the court to consider whether the statute was reasonable, or whether the notice in this case nearly complied with the act ; but whether the provisions of the statute have been literally pursued, and strictly complied with. The two cases, <em>(Culver </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>1 <em>Ver. R. </em>359, <em>and cases therein cited; Spear </em>v. <em>Ditty, </em>9 <em>id. R. </em>282,) cited in the plaintiff\u2019s points establish this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">The requisitions of the law are the substantial parts of the title, and cannot in the slightest degree he dispensed with. Sales of property, similar to the one in question, are invariably \u2022 attended with great hardships to the owners of such lands, and purchasers at such sales, purchase therefor' at their peril. They calculate on great profits from small investments, and it behooves them to see that the proceedings, under which they claim title, have been strictly complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">These sales for taxes and assessments, are a mode of transferring title by operation of law, without the consent or sane<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>tion of the owner, and are in the nature of a forfeiture, and all the conditions being conditions precedent must be literally-, followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The authorities cited by the defendant do not apply to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">In my view, the form of the notice did not comply with the language of the statute, and was clearly irregular and insufficient, and consequently void. I am also of opinion, that to make these sales valid, and binding on the parties against whom they are intended to operate, the corporation should, at the end of each and every year, designate by ordinance the proper newspapers for such publications.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
