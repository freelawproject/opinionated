After a careful inspection of the entire case, and after examining the law, I find it is quite out of my power to grant the relief claimed. The action was f\u00f3r a money demand on contract. The parties reside within the jurisdiction of the court, and are fully under its control. This being so, and more than two years having elapsed since the perfection, entry and service of notice of the judgment upon the defendant\u2019s attorney, the 174th section of the. Code precludes all interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">Other points were raised, in the\u2019case, but as this is the principal and overshadowing one, I refrain from saying any thing in regard to the others. .</p>\n<p id=\"b633-13\">Motion denied, with ten dollars costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
