The action was brought to recover for sails, &amp;c. furnished by the plaintiff in June, 1860, for the ship <em>Sunshine, </em>at the request of' Amos Howes, a part owner of the ship. The action was referred to a referee, who, by his report, found the following facts: That on or about the 11th ,day of June, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>1860, the plaintiff sold and delivered to the ship Sunshine materials, (sails,) amounting to $1004.35. That such sale was on credit of six months. That interest was to he added to such bill from December 11, 1860, the time when the payment thereof became due. That at the time of such sale and delivery by the plaintiff, Amos Howes and James A. Suydam, .composing the copartnership firm of Howes &amp; Oo. were the owners of five eighths of the said ship Sunshine. That.on or about the 8th day of November, 1860, Howes &amp; Co. transferred all their interest in the said ship, being five eighths, to Williams <em>&amp; </em>Gui\u00f3n, the ship then being on her voyage to San Francisco from New York, and in consideration of such transfer, Williams &amp; Gui\u00f3n proposed to become responsible and pay all the bills against the ship; that' a memorandum of such bills was given at the time to Williams &amp; Gui\u00f3n, who were to run the ship for Howes &amp; Co.\u2019s benefit, and until the bills.and any balance Howe &amp; Co. owed them was paid ; and upon those terms a bill of sale was given by Howes &amp; Co. to Williams <em>&amp; </em>Gui\u00f3n. That at the time of the giving of the bill of sale, no money passed between Howes &amp; Co. and Williams &amp; Gui\u00f3n, the consideration of the purchase being the bills owing by the ship which Williams &amp; Gui\u00f3n agreed to pay, and the bill of sale was intended as collateral security for the payment of the bills. That such agreement was not in writing, and no agreement to pay the bills was ever executed by the defendants. No memorandum in writing was made by Williams <em>&amp; </em>Gui\u00f3n in relation to the bill of plaintiff, and the same had not become due and payable at the date of the bill of sale. That the said ship Sunshine was not delivered to the defendants. The plaintiff having rested his case, the counsel for the defendants moved for a dismissal of the complaint upon the following grounds \u2022:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-5\">1. It is a contract or promise to pay the debt of Howes &amp; Suydam, and that contract is not in writing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-6\">2.

That a list of the bills against the ship was given by Howes <em>&amp; </em>Co. to the defendants, in which list the bill of the plaintiff was included. That the defendants would have a commission on all those bills, and that the regular commission is 2-| per cent. That the object of giving the bill of sale was, that the defendants -were to pay all the bills, and the agreement was that they were to settle all the bills included and not included in the bottomry, by compromise or in any way they pleased or thought best. That on such agreement the bill of sale was delivered to the defendants, and they were to take the ship and act as ship\u2019s husbands until all these bills were repaid to them, and until all the indebtedness of Howes <em>&amp; </em>Co. to them was repaid out of the earnings of the ship. That the defendants got a commission of the ship\u2019s business, charter, &amp;c. from $2 to $4000 a year, depending upon the business; they would have a commission of all these bills ; the regular commission is 2J per cent. That the bill of the plaintiff 'was one of the bills which was in the list given to the defendants, which they agreed to pay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-7\">The plaintiff excepted' to the report, and judgment being entered thereon he appealed therefrom.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b56-8\"><em>E.

The defense interposed is a denial of any promise to pay. The case was referred, and the complaint dismissed on the ground that the promise proved was void by the statute of frauds. Judgment was entered for the defendants, and the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">It will be conceded that this sale and transfer was a sufficient consideration to sustain the promise, unless it was necessary to reduce it to writing, as required by the statute of frauds. This statute makes all promises to answer for the <em>debt of another </em>void, unless reduced to writing. This is plain. It is also true, and quite as plain, that a promise to pay, for a good consideration, is valid, though not reduced to writing. The first is a promise to answer for the debt of another. The last. an obligation and promise to answer for one\u2019s own debt. It is well settled, upon authority, that all promises founded upon a consideration which \u201c moves to the primary debtor,\u201d as a forbearance to sue him, a release of some security to <em>him, </em>or harm to <em>his </em>creditor, or any benefit to the debtor, in which the promissor has no interest or concern, are void, because within the statute. But where the promise is founded upon a consideration, (whatever its nature,) in the. language of Chief Justice Savage, \u201cmoving to the party making the promise,\u201d it is not within the statute, and the subsisting liability of the primary debtor is no objection to a, recovery. <em>(Farley </em>v. <em>Cleveland, </em>4 <em>Cowen, </em>432, 439.) Where the promise to pay the debt of another arises out of some <em>neto </em>and original consideration of benefit or harm, \u201cmoving\u201d between the <em>newly </em>contracting parties, it is not within the statute. <em>(Leonard </em>v. <em>Vredenburgh, </em>8 <em>John, </em>29.) These two cases, and the principles there laid down, have been approved by the Court of Appeals, in the case of <em>Mallory </em>v. <em>Gillett, 21 N. Y. Rep. </em>412.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">By these rules this case must be decided : 1st. Did the defendants receive any consideration from any source, as the foundation of the promise in question ? and, 2d. Did they agree, therefor, to pay the plaintiff\u2019s debt ? The referee finds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>both facts. The primary debtors, (Howes &amp; Co.) conveyed their interest in the ship to the defendants, on or about the 8th of November, 1860, by bill of sale, whether absolutely or as collateral security, makes no difference. 2d. That the defendants agreed to pay the plaintiff\u2019s demands, together with 'other demands, each of which were specified and pointed out at the time the transfer took place. The defendants deemed it for their benefit and advantage to take the interest of Howes &amp; Co.\u201e in the ship, and by the bill' of sale got the control of their property, for their undertaking and promise to pay the bills against the ship. Plowes <em>&amp; </em>Co. parted with, their interest in the ship to the defendants, thus giving the defendants a consideration upon which they promised Howes <em>&amp; Go. </em>to pay the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Although the effect of the defendants\u2019 promise was to pay the debt of Howes &amp; Co. to the plaintiffs, the primary and leading design of the defendants was to obtain the interest of Howes <em>&amp; Co. </em>in the ship, and to secure their own demand against them. In other words, Howes <em>&amp; Co. </em>conveyed their interest in the ship to the defendants, they promising, in consideration thereof, to pay this debt to the plaintiff, thus obtaining the property of Howes <em>&amp; Co. </em>and promising to pay for it. If the agreement upon this consideration had been to pay Howes <em>&amp; </em>Co. directly, no one would have thought it void because not put in writing, for it would then have been their own promise to pay for a consideration received by them. Is it any less their own debt because they agree to pay to the plaintiff, for the benefit of Howes <em>&amp; Co. </em>whose property they have received as a consideration therefor ? The statute referred to, operates only upon and makes void promises to answer for the debt of another-; not upon the party\u2019s own debt and promise to pay for a consideration received. The defendants made this their own debt to the plaintiff, and it was not necessary to put their promise in writing to make it valid and obligatory upon them. It is said and objected, that there was no delivery of the ship to the defendants. \u25a0 I think the rule is well settled that the sale of a specific chattel passes the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>perty therein to the vendee without delivery. <em>(Chitty on </em>Con. <em>8 Am. ed. </em>332. 25 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>520.)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Again, it is urged that this action cannot be maintained on a promise made to Howes &amp; Co. and not to plaintiff. It was decided as early as 1st Johnson\u2019s Reports, 140, that where one person makes a promise to another for the benefit of a third person, that third person may maintain an action upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The same principle is recognized \"and expressly adjudicated in <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>(20 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>268.) Such promise is to be deemed made to the plaintiff, if adopted by him, although he was not a party to, nor cognizant of it, when made. These views are decisive of this case. The referee erred in dismissing the complaint. His report should be set aside, the judgment entered thereon reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event; and let the rule referring the case be vacated, unless both parties desire to retain it.</p>\n<author id=\"b59-7\">Robertson, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Age\">It may be considered as finally settled in this state by the court of last resort, in the case of <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>(20 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>268,) that whoever in consideration of a benefit to himself, or prejudice to another, promises to pay the debt of a third party, is liable directly to the creditor to whom such debt is due, even when the consideration proceeds from and the promise is made to the debtor alone. That decision bears strongly on the question whether such a promise be within the statute of frauds, for if it be in every aspect legally equivalent to a promise directly to the creditor, it is, in fact, an undertaking to answer for the debt of another, although he is still to remain liable. Had it been left simply as an express promise to the debtor to relieve him of a burden, or indemnify him against a liability, which is not within the statute, <em>(Conkey </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>17 <em>John. </em>113.) the debtor, if he were afterwards compelled to pay the debt, could recover the same amount as the measure of his damages, in an action brought by him, against such promissor. ' It seems to be a little incongruous, if both actions were brought on the same promise, that creditor and debtor could sug separately, equally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>well, upon an undertaking created by the same words, but only in terms directed to one of them. This difficulty is sought to be got rid of in the opinion of two of the learned judges in the case first referred to; by supposing the promise to be to the debtor as the creditor\u2019s agent. <em>(P. </em>275, <em>Johnson, Ch. J. Denio, J.) </em>That supposes an agency without the consent of the agent, and should exclude the debtor from any right of action. Though he had paid the consideration, the promise was made to him, and he was to receive the benefit of it, and it makes the promise purely collateral. The only reasonable ground of sustaining the liability of the promissor directly to the creditor, seems to be that laid down by Ch. J. Shaw, in <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Dyer, </em>(7 <em>Cush. </em>337,) quoted with approbation in the leading opinion in the case first referred to, <em>(Lawrence v. Fox.) </em>By that the law is made to presume a general duty to pay the debt, growing out of the form of the promise. By that means a privity between the creditor and the promissor is created, warranting tile implication of another promise in law directly from the latter to the former, and its acceptance by the former. <em>(Berly </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>5 <em>Hill, </em>577, 584.) Such reasoning, however artificial, is necessary to keep a promise to a debtor to pay his debt out of the reach of the statute of frauds, if it is to be construed as creating any promise on which an action can be maintained directly by the creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The supplemental report of the referee finds that Howes <em>&amp; </em>Co. the original debtors to the plaintiff, were part owners and ship\u2019s husbands of a vessel, and delivered a bill of sale of her to the defendants, who were to take their place as such ship\u2019s husbands. That the object of such bill of sale was for the defendants to pay all debts due on such vessel, including that to the plaintiffs. And the agreement between them was that the former should settle all such debts, for which they were to receive a certain commission for paying such, debts, and to be repaid such advances and all other indebtedness of Howes <em>&amp; </em>Co. to them out of the earnings of the vessel. In his first report, the referee found that such bill of sale was given as collateral security ipr the payment of such debts. These facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>constituted a promise by the defendants to Howes <em>&amp; </em>Co. to pay the plaintiffs the debt due to them, in consideration of the, pledge of the vessel as security to them for repaying the amount so advanced, as well as the commissions; the bill of sale, in fact, being a mere mortgage. Such a promise comes direct within the ruling in <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Fox.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">It only remains to determine whether such pledge of the vessel to secure future advances, with an agreement to allow the defendants to act as ship\u2019s husbands and earn commissions, being a benefit to the latter and a prejudice to the debtors, (Howes &amp; Co.) and the promise of the defendants to such debtors in consideration thereof, took the case out of the statute of frauds. The case of <em>Mallory </em>v. Gillet, (21 N. <em>Y. Rep. </em>412,) contains a thorough examination of the authorities on that point; although it only decides that a promise to a creditor to pay a debt due to him by another, where the only consideration was some benefit moving to the debtor from such creditor, was rvithin the statute ; in that respect sanctioning the modification or explanation of the language used by Ch. J. Kent in <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Vredenburgh, </em>(8 <em>John. </em>29,) wherein he states a consideration for a new promise by a third party to be sufficient to take the case out of the statute of frauds, if it moved <em>between </em>the newly contracting parties, by the limitation of Ch. J. Savage in <em>Farley </em>v. <em>Cleveland, </em>(4 <em>Cowen, </em>432, 439,) who requires the consideration to move to the <em>promissor; </em>whether it were of benefit to him or harm to the promisee. The case alluded to sanctions, also, the same distinction as put by Ch. J. Shaw in the case of <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Boynton, </em>(3 <em>Metc. </em>396, 400,) who makes the leading object of the promissor in the new contract the test of including in or excluding from the statute of frauds a promise to pay the debt of another; that is to say, whether it is or is not the promotion of some interest of his own, although incidentally part of the result may be the payment of another\u2019s debt. And this corresponds precisely with the object of the statute, which was to prevent any one from being made liable to pay another\u2019s debt by untrustworthy oral evidence of a promise to do so, sustained by some trivial pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>mise by the creditor as a sufficient consideration, and the plaintiff can therefore sustain the action in his own name, if it is maintainable at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The doctrine is conceded in both the prevailing and dissenting opinions in the case just commented on, <em>(Mallory </em>v. <em>Gillett, ubi supra,) </em>that a promise by a stranger to either a creditor or debtor, to pay the debt of the latter to the former, when the consideration moves from the promissee to such prornissor, was clearly out of the statute. The numerous authorities commented on in the prevailing opinion in that case fully sustain that view. To which may be added others : <em>Westfall </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>10 <em>Barb. 645 ; Cailleux </em>v. <em>Hall, 1 E. D. Smith, 5 ; Mersereau </em>v. <em>Lewis, 25 Wend. 243; Earle </em>v. <em>Crane, </em>6 <em>Duer, 564; Blyer </em>v. <em>Monholland, 2 Sandf. Ch. </em>478 ; which are to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The conclusion of the referee that the promise in this case came within the statute of frauds, was, therefore, erroneous. The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial had, with costs to abide the event. The order of reference to be discharged, unless both parties agree to retain it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
