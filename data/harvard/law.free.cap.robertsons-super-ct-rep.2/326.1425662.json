Mills, plaintiff and respondent, <em>vs. </em>The New York and Harlem Railroad Company, defendant and appellant.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b334-11\">1. Even if any one has a right to use his own premises as a hospital for his diseased horses, he has not the right to permit such horses, when afflicted with a contagious disease, to go at large in the highway, or to water them at a public tank used for watering the sound horses of other persons.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b334-12\">2. The right of an individual to place a large number of sickly and diseased horses upon his own premises, although in immediate contiguity with a neighbor\u2019s stables containing his horses, is all that such individual can claim, and it is the only concession the law makes. In the exercise of that right, he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>bound to use due diligence to see that his neighbor is not injured by his negligence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b335-5\">3. The owner of diseased horses, knowing their disorder to be contagious, is bound to exercise all the care that a prudent man would exercise, or a rightful regard for the interests of others requires, such as placing his diseased horses so remote from a partition between his stable and that of a neighbor, as to render contact with his neighbor\u2019s horses impossible.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b335-6\">(Before Moncbiee, Momeul and McCumr, JJ.)</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b335-7\">Heard April 14,1864;</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Atd\">decided May 28, 1864.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-8\">The action was to recover damages for the loss of a number of horses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-9\">The complaint alleges that the defendants carelessly, negligently and improperly placed a large number of their horses, then infected and suffering from infectious, contagious and dangerous diseases, known as farcy and glanders, in their shed adjoining the stables of the plaintiff, and allowed them to remain there for a long space of time. That said horses so infected and diseased, by reason of the want of proper care, by the defendants, communicated the said disease to the plaintiff\u2019s horses ; and that through the negligence, carelessness, and improper conduct of the defendants in placing said horses in the yard and shed of the defendants, adjoining the stables of the plaintiff, the said disease was communicated to the plaintiff\u2019s horses, and they have died.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-10\">The answer of the defendants alleges that their said horses were placed upon the defendants\u2019 premises, contiguous to their railroad, and that if the plaintiff has sustained any damage, it was occasioned by his own negligence and not by the negligence of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-11\">The action was tried by a justice of this court- and a jury. A motion was made to dismiss the complaint, which was denied, and the defendants excepted. Several requests were made by the defendants to the court to charge the jury, which were refused and the defendants excepted ; they also excepted to such parts of the charge as were inconsistent with such requests. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, upon which judgment was entered and the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number><em>C. W. Sandford, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-5\">I. The defendants had a right to keep their sick horses upon their own premises. <em>(Boom </em>v. <em>Utica, </em>2 <em>Barb. </em>104.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-6\">II. The defendants are not liable for any injury to the plaintiff\u2019s horses, if any occurred, unless it were proved that they were guilty of some negligence by which their horses came in contact with the plaintiff\u2019s horses, on his own premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-7\">III. If the plaintiff kept his own stables so insufficiently closed, that the defendants\u2019 horses came in contact with his horses, from some neglect on the part of the defendants, he cannot recover. (<em>Wilbrand </em>v. <em>Eighth Avenue Railroad Co., </em>3 <em>Bosw. 317, and cases there cited.)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-8\">IV. It was negligence in the plaintiff to water his horses at a tank on the public highway, where any glanderous or otherwise diseased horse might drink.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-9\">V. The court erred in refusing to charge the four propositions laid down in the foregoing points.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-10\">VI. The court erred in refusing to nonsuit the plaintiff upon the defendant\u2019s motion. <em>(Haring </em>v. <em>N. Y. and Erie R. R. Co., </em>13 <em>Barb. </em>9.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-11\">VII. The evidence does not sustain the verdict, and the damages, if it does, are excessive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-12\">1. The whole damage actually proved by the plaintiff was $1396. The residue is so vague, uncertain and contradictory, as not to amount to any thing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-13\">2. The defendants\u2019 horses were. only kept there from April until October, during which period the plaintiff lost fourteen horses. When he lost the residue does not appear, and certainly not until long afterwards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-14\">VIII. The only cases relied upon by the plaintiff are actions of nuisance, and there is no evidence in this case to establish a nuisance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-15\">1. The defendants have the same right to occupy a stable as the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-16\">2. There is no analogy between this case and those cases which refer to slaughter houses and blacksmith shops^ which in some instances have been pronounced nuisances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>IX. There is much vulgar \"error touching rights supposed to exist, beyond the line of the lot owner\u2019s boundary. Much of it has been exploded in this country. No judicial trace of it exists, except in England.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-5\">1. The supposed riparian right. <em>(Gould </em>v. <em>Hudson River R. R. Co., </em>2 <em>Seld. </em>522. <em>Lansing </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>4 <em>Wend. </em>9)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-6\">2. The supposed right of prospect and light from adjacent lands. <em>(Meyers </em>v. <em>Gemmel, </em>10 <em>Barb. </em>540.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-7\">3. The supposed right to have one\u2019s building or earth supported by adjacent lands. <em>(Radcliff\u2019s executors </em>v. <em>Mayor, &amp;c. of Brooklyn, </em>4 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>202, 203, 204.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-8\">4. The supposed right to ancient lights. <em>(Parker </em>v. <em>Foote, 19 Wend. </em>318. 10 <em>Barb. </em>546.)</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-9\"><em>T. Dunphy </em>and <em>Edwin James, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-10\">The only exceptions made are to the charge of the judge at the trial, and his refusal to dismiss the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-11\">I. The judge did right in refusing to dismiss the complaint. The complaint alleged that the defendants, well knowing the horses to be infected with an infectious, contagious and dangerous disease, placed those horses in a place where they could and did communicate the disease to the horses of the plaintiff. This, was proved by the testimony, and was not attempted to be contradicted by the defendants. Upon these facts, as alleged in the complaint and proved, an action is maintainable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-12\">II. It is a rule of common law that a man should so use his own as not to hurt another ; and, therefore, if one carry on a lawful trade or business in such a manner as to prove injurious to his neighbor, he must answer in damages. <em>(Bradley </em>v. Gill, <em>Lutw. </em>29. <em>Aldred\u2019s case, </em>9 <em>Coke, </em>58. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Powell, Hutton, </em>135. <em>Moreley </em>v. <em>Pragnell, Co. Car. </em>510. <em>Fish </em>v. <em>Dodge, </em>4 <em>Denio, </em>311. <em>Selwyn\u2019s Nisi Prius, vol. </em>2, 1124, <em>title </em>Nuisance.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-13\">III. It is not necessary to a right of action, that the owner should have been driven from his <em>dwelling; </em>it is enough that the enjoyment of life and property has been rendered uncom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>fortable. <em>(Per Lord Mansfield, in Rex </em>v. <em>White, </em>1 <em>Burr. </em>337. 9 <em>Paige, </em>576.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-5\">IV. Where one erects a nuisance, he is answerable for the. continuance of it, as well as for the injury done. <em>(Roswell </em>v. <em>Prior, </em>12 <em>Mod. </em>635. 1 <em>Ld. Ray, </em>713, <em>and </em>2 <em>Salk. </em>460, <em>S. C. Boom </em>v. <em>City of Utica, </em>2 <em>Barb. </em>103. <em>Vedder </em>v. <em>Vedder, </em>1 <em>Denio, </em>257. Fish v. <em>Dodge, </em>4 id.311. <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Weeks, </em>3 <em>Barb. </em>157. <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Malcolm, </em>6 Hill, 292. <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Kent, </em>19 <em>John. </em>223. 2 <em>Denio, </em>443-446.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-8\">V. As to the refusals to charge : 1st. The defendants had no right to keep their horses in the state they were, so near to the plaintiff\u2019s stables as to communieate the disease to his horses, as it was proved they did, and after they knew the fact. (See cases cited <em>above.)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-9\">2d. The evidence of negligence consisted in the proof that their horses in a diseased state were allowed to gnaw holes in the stable of the plaintiff, and were permitted to run loose in the pen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-10\">3d. The plaintiff\u2019s stables were sufficiently closed, and notice was given to the defendants of the mischief the diseased horses were doing. This question was properly left to the jury by the judge, who decided in the plaintiff\u2019s favor; and it is not alleged that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence. The plaintiff was not bound to remove his horses ; they had become infected with the disease, and the defendants are responsible. He requested the defendants to discontinue turning their diseased horses into the pen, and they refused to do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-11\">4th. The plaintiff was guilty of no negligence in watering his horses at his own tank, where he was accustomed for years to do so. The tank was his own private property, and placed in front of his stable door on the side walk. . It was not pretended at the trial, that any disease was or could be communicated by other horses than the defendants\u2019. The only negligence was that of the defendants, in allowing their diseased horses to escape and drink at the plaintiff\u2019s tank. There is no exception to any evidence given at the trial, and the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>ants did not dispute the amount .of damages sustained by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b339-5\">By the Court,</p>\n<author id=\"AvW\">Monell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_\">The ground of the plaintiff\u2019s action, as stated in his complaint, and attempted to be proved on the trial, was that the injury to his horses was occasioned by the <em>negligent </em>act of the defendants. It is not now claimed that the defendants are liable for any other reason. The motion to dismiss the complaint was not put upon the ground that the evidence of the plaintiff failed to establish any negligence by the defendants, but on the ground that the defendants had a right to use their own property in any way they thought proper, except where the use was a nuisance. This I do not understand to have been disputed. The judge charged the jury, substantially, that the use of the defendants\u2019 sheds as a shelter for their diseased horses was not a nuisance, and therefore they had a right to use them for such purpose, <em>(Bloom </em>v. <em>City of Utica, 2 Barb. S. C. R. </em>104,) and no exception was taken to the charge. But every man is responsible for the negligent use of his own property, and the right of enjoyment is limited to a prudent and careful use. <em>(Clark </em>v. <em>Foot, </em>8 John. 421. <em>Vanderburgh </em>v. <em>Truax, 4 Denio, </em>464.)</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The sheds or pens in which the defendants placed their diseased horses were separated from the plaintiff\u2019s stables by a wooden partition, and the heads of the plaintiff\u2019s and defendants\u2019 horses were towards and near the partition; so that except for the partition they could have come into immediate contact. In the rear of the stables a hoard fence separated the respective lots. It was in evidence that the defendants\u2019 horses gnawed the boards and the fence, and made holes through the partition. One witness testified that the defendants\u2019 horses ate through the partition a hole half a foot in size, which came through upon the manger of the plaintiff\u2019s stable. There was a water tank in the street outside of the defendants\u2019 premises, at which their diseased horses were allowed to drink. The doors or gates were left open, and the horses were suffered to go out: This tank was also used for watering the plaintiff\u2019s horses.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>The weight of the evidence is, that the disease which the defendants\u2019 horses had (the glanders) was contagious and not infectious. The holes gnawed by the defendants\u2019 horses through the wooden partition, and into the fence between the lots, afforded a means of easy contact with the virus deposited by the defendants\u2019 horses, and was sufficient to convey the disorder. It was the duty of the defendants to have immediately closed the holes, and to have been vigilant in using all necessary means to prevent the disorder from being conveyed by contact to the plaintiff\u2019s horses. This they do not seem to have done, for the plaintiff himself nailed boards over the holes. The defendants knew the disorder was contagious, and they were bound to exercise all the care that prudence and a rightful regard for the interests of others required, or else to place their horses so remote from the wooden partition that contact would not have been possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Again, suffering the defendants\u2019 horses to go to the street tank for water, was not only unnecessary, as they had water in their yard, but it was highly negligent. There could be no. more sure way of communicating the disease. And whatever may have been the right of the defendants to use their premises for hospital purposes, for their diseased horses, they had not the right to let them go at large in the street, or to allow them to drink at a public tank.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">This is within the principle established by some of the English cases. <em>(See Hay on Liability, p. </em>154, <em>and cases cited.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">I am of opinion that there was sufficient evidence of negligence of the defendants to go to the jury, and therefore that the motion to dismiss the complaint was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">The learned justice, in submitting the case to the jury, instructed them' that \u201cif the plaintiff\u2019s horses, without any negligence on his part, and before he was aware, or ought, as a careful man, to have known of the existence of. the holes, contracted the disease from the horses of the defendants, and if at the same time the defendants were guilty of negligence, the plaintiff was entitled to recover.\u201d And they were told that they must be satisfied that the defendants knew of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>existence of the holes, or that as careful men they ought to have known' of their existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The only questions, therefore, in the case which could determine the defendants\u2019 liability, namely, the absence of all negligence on the part of the plaintiff, and the negligence of the defendants, was properly and fairly submitted to the jury, and I can find no reason for disturbing their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">All the requests to charge (although refused to be made in the precise language in which they were submitted,) were substantially made to the jury. A judge is not bound to use the language of a request to charge ; if he gives the substance of it to the jury it is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">I am in favor of affirming the judgment. To concede the right of the defendants to place a large number of sickly and diseased horses upon their own premises, in immediate contiguity with the neighboring stables of the plaintiff, is conceding all that the defendants can expect, and it is the only concession the law makes. In the enjoyment of that right, they must look to it that their neighbor is not injured by their negligence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
