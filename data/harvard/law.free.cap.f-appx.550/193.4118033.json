Durfey challenges the district court\u2019s finding that he was not entitled to a sentence reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 because he did not truthfully provide the government with all relevant information concerning his offense. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings concerning a defendant\u2019s eligibility for a reduction under the \u00a7 5C1.2 safety valve for clear error. <em>See United States v. McCrimmon, </em>443 F.3d 454, 457-58 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-23\">A defendant is eligible for a two-level reduction in the offense level if he meets the five criteria listed in the \u00a7 5C1.2 safety valve provision. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(16). The fifth criterion, the only one at issue here, requires that \u201cthe defendant has truthfully provided to the government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense.\u201d \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5). The defendant has the burden of showing that he truthfully provided the government with all relevant information. <em>United States v. Flanagan, </em>80 F.3d 143, 146-47 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>In this case, the district court made an \u201cindependent determination\u201d that Durfey had not provided all relevant truthful information that qualified him for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 5C1.2. <em>See McCrimmon, </em>443 F.3d at 457-58. That determination is not clearly erroneous in light of the fact that Durfey failed to provide information regarding the supplier of the marijuana he was transporting. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b219-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
