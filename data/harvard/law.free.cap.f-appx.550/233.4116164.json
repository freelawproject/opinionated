For the first time on appeal, he contends that the district court\u2019s consideration of his most recent arrest for assault renders his sentence procedurally and substantively unreasonable. He also avers that the presumption of reasonableness should not attach to his within-guideline sentence because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis. He concedes, however, that the argument is foreclosed; he seeks only to preserve it for further review. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>660 F.3d 231, 232-33 (5th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-22\">The newly raised procedural- and substantive-unreasonableness arguments are reviewed for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>484 F.3d 783, 792 (5th Cir.2007); <em>see also United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). To establish plain error, Noriega-Alanis must show a forfeited error that is clear or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, this court may exercise its discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Noriega-Alanis contends that the district court erroneously considered his \u201cbare arrest record.\u201d To the contrary, the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) not only listed the alleged offense for which he was arrested but included additional information as to the facts underlying the arrest and why prosecution did not result. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>702 F.3d 226, 230-31 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.2012); <em>cf. United States v. Windless, </em>719 F.3d 415, 418, 420-21 (5th Cir.2013). Noriega-Alanis did not object to the PSR or offer rebuttal evidence. The court therefore did not plainly err in considering the information in the PSR concerning the arrest when denying the request for a downward variance. <em>See Harris, </em>702 F.3d at 231; <em>see also Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Because the sentence is within the guideline range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). NoriegaAlanis urges, however, that the district court\u2019s consideration of his bare arrest record constituted consideration of an improper factor and thus that the presumption of reasonableness has been rebutted.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The district court considered NoriegaAlanis\u2019s personal history and the circumstances of his illegal-reentry offense, balancing those factors against his lengthy and violent criminal past and denying his request for a sentence below the guideline range based in part on the court\u2019s rejection of the claim that he was a changed man, as evidenced by the fact that he was recently arrested for assaulting for hitting his pregnant wife. The court expressly gave more weight to other 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, namely Noriega-Alanis\u2019s significant criminal history and the need to protect the public from future crimes and to provide deterrence. The court did not plainly err in considering the prior arrest when imposing a sentence within the guideline range, and Noriega-Alanis has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that is accorded a within-guideline sentence. <em>See Harris, </em>702 F.3d at 231; <em>Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186; <em>see also Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b259-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
