The district court concluded Johnson was eligible for a sentence reduction, but nevertheless declined to resentence him. Johnson asserts that, in declining to resentence him, the district court impermissibly relied on the factor of future rehabilitation and failed to consider evidence of his rehabilitation since his initial sentencing. Johnson also contends that, in making those errors, the court must have utilized the incorrect edition of the Sentencing Guidelines. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Johnson\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">Congress has codified the principle that it is inappropriate for a sentencing court to \u201cimposte] a sentence to a term of imprisonment for the purpose of rehabilitating the defendant....\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(k); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(a). The Supreme Court has held \u00a7 3582(a) precludes a sentencing court from imposing or lengthening a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment to promote his rehabilitation. <em>Tapia v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2382, 2391, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-14\">Johnson\u2019s contention the court relied on the impermissible factor of rehabilitation in deciding not to resentence him is unpersuasive. While the court explicitly mentioned \u201crehabilitation\u201d in its statement of reasons for declining to resentence him, the prohibition against sentencing based on rehabilitation extends only insofar as a court may choose to lengthen a sentence for the purpose of promoting a defendant\u2019s rehabilitation. <em>See id. </em>Here, the court considered the lack of potential rehabilitation as evidence that a sentence reduction was inappropriate because of the need of the sentence to protect the public. The need to protect the public is a permissible factor, both in sentencing and in deciding whether a \u00a7 3582(e)(2) reduction is appropriate. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(b)(ii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-15\">Johnson\u2019s argument the court erred in failing to consider evidence of good conduct after his initial sentencing is also without merit. Generally, when a person is being resentenced, a court is entitled, but not required, to consider evidence of the prisoner\u2019s rehabilitation since the initial sentencing. <em>See Pepper v. United </em>States,\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 1229, 1241, 179 L.Ed.2d 196 (2011) (holding that, during a resentencing, a court \u201cmay consider evidence of defendant\u2019s rehabilitation since his prior sentencing\u201d). The Guidelines commentary governing \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reductions also states that, when deciding whether and to what extent to reduce an eligible prisoner\u2019s sentence, the court \u201cmay\u201d consider post-sentencing conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(B)(iii)). While the court could have (and may have) considered that evidence, it was not required to do so. The court therefore did not abuse its discretion in failing to explic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>itly consider that evidence when deciding not to reduce Johnson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">To the extent Johnson argues the court used the wrong version of the Sentencing Guidelines, that argument also fails. Johnson\u2019s argument in his initial brief<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is that, because the court considered an impermissible factor and failed to consider relevant evidence, it must have used the wrong edition of the Guidelines. However, as discussed above, the court committed no such error. Therefore, Johnson has failed to demonstrate that the court abused its discretion in declining to resentence him, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b871-11\">. \"We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v.

Johnson\u2019s argument, raised for the first time in his reply brief, that the district court miscalculated his Guidelines range is without merit. Based on 10.16 kilograms of crack cocaine, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1), Johnson\u2019s present base offense level is 38, the highest base offense level. His enhancements totaled four levels, so his total offense level is 42. With a criminal history category of II, his Guidelines range is 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment, which is the range the district court used.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
