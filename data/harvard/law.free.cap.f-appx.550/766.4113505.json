Johnson argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b793-16\">This is not Johnson\u2019s first revocation of supervised release. We review his earlier revocation and then this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-17\">A. First Petition for Revocation of Supervised Release</p>\n<p id=\"b793-18\">In 2002, Johnson pled guilty to conspiring to distribute cocaine and money laundering. The district court imposed concurrent 87-month sentences, followed by five years of supervised release. Later, Johnson\u2019s prison term was reduced to 70 months, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b). On March 30, 2007, Johnson completed his prison term and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>began supervised release in the Northern District of Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Less than four months later, on July 19, 2007, Johnson\u2019s probation officer petitioned the district court for a warrant for his arrest and to revoke supervised release. The petition alleged that Johnson: (1) was charged with new criminal conduct, driving on a suspended license, in Tennessee; (2) had failed to answer the probation officer\u2019s questions truthfully concerning his reasons for leaving the district; and (3) had traveled outside the district without the probation officer\u2019s permission. The petition alleged that Johnson had told the probation officer that he left the district for Tennessee due to an emergency concerning his daughter but that the official police reports indicated Johnson told the arresting officers in Tennessee that he was returning from Buffalo, New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">B. First Revocation Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">At a revocation hearing, Johnson admitted the allegations. Johnson and his flane\u00e9 told the district court that Johnson went to New York to sell some of her jewelry because they were having financial problems and that Johnson was returning from New York with the proceeds when he was arrested in Tennessee. Johnson admitted asking Charmane Porter, the woman arrested with him in Tennessee, to claim that the money belonged to her because Johnson feared his probation officer would think he had returned to drug dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">The district court found that Johnson had violated the conditions of his supervised release. The district court stated that Johnson\u2019s explanation for why he was outside the district \u201c[did] not compute\u201d and found that Johnson \u201cin fact [was] lying still about what actually happened.\u201d The district court further found that the advisory guidelines range of three to nine months\u2019 imprisonment was not adequate. The district court revoked Johnson\u2019s supervised release and imposed a twelvemonth sentence, followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">C. Second Petition for Revocation of Supervised Release</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">On August 15, 2008, Johnson was released from prison and began serving his second period of supervised release. In May 2010, Johnson\u2019s probation officer again petitioned the district court for a warrant for Johnson\u2019s arrest. The petition alleged that Johnson had failed to report to the probation officer for the last two months and his whereabouts were unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-11\">Johnson\u2019s whereabouts remained unknown for almost three years, until February 2013, when Johnson was arrested in Texas for presenting a fictitious driver\u2019s license to Transportation Security Administration officers at an airport. Johnson\u2019s probation officer then filed an amended petition, including this February 2013 arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-12\">D. Second Revocation Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b794-13\">At his second revocation hearing, Johnson admitted the allegations in the amended petition and did not oppose revocation of supervised release. Johnson requested a sentence within the advisory guidelines range of three to nine months.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-14\">In mitigation, Johnson explained that he panicked after a traffic accident and chose to abscond rather than risk revocation. Johnson said that, at that time of his accident, his oldest son was facing an attempted murder charge, his grandson was hospitalized and later passed away, and his mother was in poor health and having financial troubles. Johnson submitted letters from his oldest son, his daughter, his girlfriend, and his girlfriend\u2019s daughter, all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>of whom spoke generally of Johnson as a caring and supportive father.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The government asked for the maximum four-year sentence, noting that: (1) the circumstances of Johnson\u2019s Texas arrest raised suspicions that Johnson had returned to the drug trade; (2) Johnson absconded for almost three years; (3) this was Johnson\u2019s second revocation, and he had served a one-year term after his first revocation; and (4) at Johnson\u2019s original sentencing, he received an 87-month sentence, below the ten-year mandatory minimum, and then later received a reduction to 70 months based on his cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Johnson\u2019s counsel objected to the government\u2019s speculation that Johnson had reengaged in drug activity, noting that there was no evidence of drug involvement in Texas. When the district court pointed out that there was also no evidence of any non-drug-related activity in Texas, Johnson\u2019s counsel stated that Johnson was in Texas for a bike event.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">The district court sentenced Johnson to a three-year term, followed by one year of supervised release. In considering \u201cthe 3553 factors,\u201d the district court emphasized the importance of \u201cpromoting respect for the law,\u201d and that Johnson \u201cjust disregarded the court\u2019s instructions as far as supervised release goes,\u201d and \u201cjust basically decided that what he wanted to do was more important.\u201d The district court further noted that the sentence was imposed as \u201cpunishment for Mr. Johnson\u2019s just skipping out on supervised release.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">The district court stated it was \u201cstruck\u201d by the letters from Johnson\u2019s family and acknowledged that his family regarded him as a good father. The court concluded, however, that Johnson had offered \u201cno real explanation for what happened here.\u201d The district court stressed that Johnson \u201cdecided to absent himself from the court\u2019s supervision for several years.\u201d The district court acknowledged that it could not speculate about Johnson\u2019s activities in Texas, stating, \u201cI won\u2019t do that, but it just seems to me that there ought to be more information coming in about what Mr. Johnson was doing during the period when he was absconding from supervised release.\u201d The district court credited Johnson\u2019s explanation of the family problems at the time that he absconded, but concluded that the explanation was not sufficient, stating that if Johnson had not been caught in Texas, he would \u201cstill be out on the lamb.\u201d Finally, the district court opined that Johnson\u2019s case was not a \u201cgood case for giving him a break,\u201d because he had already received a break on his original sentence, and it was Johnson\u2019s second revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">Johnson objected \u201cto the substantive reasonableness of the length of the sentence\u201d and \u201cto the substantive reasonableness of the imposition of an additional year of supervised release.\u201d Johnson then appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AOx\">A. General Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b795-12\">Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), a district court may revoke a term of supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment after considering certain factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court also must consider the policy statements in Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines, including recommended, nonbinding ranges of imprisonment. <em>United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 799 (11th Cir.2006); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-13\">Here, the parties do not dispute that, with a Grade C violation and a criminal history of I, Johnson\u2019s recommended guidelines range under advisory Chapter 7 was three to nine months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). Because Johnson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>was on supervised release for a Class A felony, the statutory maximum sentence upon revocation was five years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). However, Johnson had already served one year after his first revocation. Thus, at Johnson\u2019s second revocation, the district court was authorized to impose up to four years of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>425 F.3d 987, 989 (11th Cir. 2005) (concluding that \u201c \u00a7 3582(e)(3)\u2019s statutory m\u00e1ximums apply in the aggregate\u201d for sentences imposed on multiple revocations of supervised release).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">\u201cWe review the sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir. 2008). Our reasonableness review applies the deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We first examine whether the district court committed any significant procedural error and then whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). The party challenging the sentence has the burden to show it is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, 431 F.3d 784, </em>788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">If the district court decides to impose an upward variance, \u201cit must \u2018consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597). However, we will vacate such a sentence \u201conly if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">B. Procedural Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">Johnson contends his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court improperly speculated that Johnson had committed additional criminal conduct in Texas.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A sentence is procedurally unreasonable if the district court, <em>inter alia, </em>selected a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts. See <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>see also United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1197 (11th Cir.2011) (explaining that the district court \u201cmay not speculate about the existence of a fact that would result in a higher sentence\u201d and instead the government must prove the fact by \u201creliable and specific evidence\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">The record belies Johnson\u2019s claim. In explaining the sentence, the district court explicitly stated that it would not speculate on whether Johnson was engaged in wrongdoing in Texas. Rather, the district court merely observed that, although Johnson was requesting mitigation, he had provided \u201cno real explanation\u201d of his whereabouts during the nearly three years he was a fugitive. The district court\u2019s comments reflected its frustration with Johnson\u2019s failure to explain adequately his activities over that three-year period and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>its unwillingness to give Johnson yet another \u201cbreak\u201d in light of that failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">C. Upward Variance and Substantive Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Johnson argues that his 36-month sentence is \u201cunreasonably harsh.\u201d While Johnson\u2019s sentence is above the recommended guidelines range in Chapter 7, it was 12 months below the statutory maximum. Furthermore, the totality of the circumstances warranted the upward variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Johnson not only failed to report to his probation officer, he also absconded from supervised release for three years and was found only after he was arrested in Texas. Although Johnson explained that he initially absconded because he \u201cpanicked\u201d after his accident, he did not provide a satisfactory explanation for why he then remained a fugitive for almost three years and appeared to have no intention of turning himself in when he was caught by authorities. Additionally, this was Johnson\u2019s second revocation, and the one-year sentence he received for his first revocation had not deterred him from violating the terms of his supervised release again. Finally, as the district court noted, Johnson had received a significant sentence reduction of 17 months as a result of the government\u2019s Rule 35(b) motion. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4, cmt. n. 4 (providing that \u201can upward departure may be warranted\u201d if the defendant\u2019s \u201coriginal sentence was the result of a downward departure (e.g., as a reward for substantial assistance)\u201d). Under the totality of the circumstances, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion when it imposed a 27-month upward variance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">D. Relevant Factors in Revocations and Substantive Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b797-12\">Johnson alternatively contends his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court considered improper factors. A revocation sentence may be substantively unreasonable if it is \u201cbased entirely\u201d on impermissible factors. <em>Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d at 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-13\">Specifically, Johnson points to the district court\u2019s comments about \u201cpromoting respect for the law\u201d and \u201cpunishment\u201d and argues that those factors were omitted from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(e)(3)\u2019s list of factors to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-14\">In initial sentencing, courts consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors which are:</p>\n<p id=\"b797-15\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;</p>\n<p id=\"b797-16\">(2) the need for the sentence imposed\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b797-17\">(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;</p>\n<p id=\"b797-18\">(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;</p>\n<p id=\"b797-19\">(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant</p>\n<p id=\"b797-20\">(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocation training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner;</p>\n<p id=\"b797-21\">(3) the kinds of sentences available;</p>\n<p id=\"b797-22\">(4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established [under the Sentencing Guidelines or federal statute];</p>\n<p id=\"b797-23\">(5) any pertinent policy statement [of the Sentencing Commission or Congress];</p>\n<p id=\"b798-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>(6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">(7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Revocations of supervised release are governed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). Section 3583(e) provide that a district court \u201cmay, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7)\u201d revoke a term of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). In other words, \u00a7 3583(e)(3) references most, but not all, of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and does not reference the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) \u2014 \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed ... to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">Ordinarily, we review <em>de novo </em>whether the district court considered an impermissible factor. <em>Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d at 1252. Because Johnson did not object to his sentence on this ground in the district court, however, we review this claim only for plain error. <em>United States v. Castro, </em>455 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir. 2006). Here, Johnson has not shown plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-11\">First, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the district court considered the factors in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), it is not \u201cplain\u201d that those factors are impermissible in the revocation context. Section 3583(e)(2) contains a list of factors district courts are obligated to consider but that list does not purport to be exhaustive and does not identify any impermissible factors. Thus, \u00a7 3582(e)(3) does not <em>explicitly </em>prohibit consideration of the factors in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-12\">Neither this Court nor the Supreme Court has addressed whether it is error to consider a factor listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) in imposing a sentence after revoking supervised release. Other circuits that have addressed this issue do not agree. The First, Second, Third, and Sixth Circuits have concluded that it is not error, while the Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Circuits concluded that it is error. <em>Compare United States v. Vargas-Davila, </em>649 F.3d 129, 131-32 (1st Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Young, </em>634 F.3d 233, 238-39 (3d Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>498 F.3d 393, 399-400 (6th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>443 F.3d 35, 47-48 (2d Cir.2006); with <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 844 (5th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 438-39 (4th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Miqbel, </em>444 F.3d 1173, 1181-83 (9th Cir.2006). Under such circumstances, any alleged error cannot be \u201cplain.\u201d See <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1019 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that an error cannot be plain \u201c[w]hen neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has resolved an issue, and other circuits are split on it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-13\">Second, even assuming it was error to consider the factors in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) in the revocation context, a review of the district court\u2019s comments as a whole convinces us that the district court did not do so here. Subsection (a)(2)(A) is concerned with the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s offense and the need to promote respect for the criminal law the defendant violated and to provide just punishment for the defendant offense. Sentences imposed upon revocation, on the other hand, are not directed toward \u201cany new criminal conduct\u201d committed by the defendant. U.S.S.G. Ch. 7, Pt. A, intro, cmt. 3(b). Instead, revocation sentences are imposed primarily as a sanction for the defendant\u2019s breach of trust. <em>Id. </em>(explaining that \u201cat revocation the court should sanction primarily the defendant\u2019s breach of trust, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>while taking into account, to a limited degree, the seriousness of the underlying violation and the criminal history of the violator\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Here, the district court, after stating that \u201cpromoting respect for the law\u201d was important, pointed out that Johnson had \u201cdisregarded the court\u2019s instructions as far as supervised release goes\u201d and instead \u201cdecided that what he wanted to do was more important.\u201d The district court then stated that Johnson\u2019s sentence was \u201cpunishment\u201d for \u201cjust skipping out on supervised release.\u201d In other words, the district court\u2019s concern was for Johnson\u2019s flagrant disregard of the court-ordered terms of his supervised release and not for Johnson\u2019s possible violation of any criminal statutes. The district court appropriately considered Johnson\u2019s breach of trust and \u201cto a limited degree\u201d the seriousness of Johnson\u2019s violations. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 7, Pt. A, intro, cmt. 3(b). Significantly, the district court\u2019s stated concerns were equally relevant to other, explicitly permissible factors under \u00a7 3583(e)(3), such as the nature and circumstances of Johnson\u2019s violations (i.e., his blatant disregard of the court-ordered terms of supervised release) and the need to afford deterrence of further such blatant violations (either by Johnson or others). For these reasons, we are convinced the district court did not in fact consider either \u201cpro-mot[ing] respect for the law\u201d or \u201cproviding] just punishment for the offense\u201d as those phrases are used in \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">For all these reasons, Johnson has not carried his burden to show that his 36-month sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b796-6\">. The government contends we should review Johnson\u2019s procedural reasonableness claim only for plain error because he did not raise this procedural objection to his sentence in the district court. We need not decide if plain error review applies because we conclude that there was no procedural error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b797-8\">. In addition, Johnson has not shown that the district court\u2019s decision to impose an additional year of supervised release after his three-year prison term was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
