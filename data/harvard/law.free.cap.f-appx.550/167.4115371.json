Coleman appeals the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2006) complaint. The district court referred this case to a magis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>trate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2012). The magistrate judge recommended that relief be denied and advised Coleman that failure to file timely objections to this recommendation could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The timely filing of specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned of the consequences of noncompliance. <em>Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir. 1985); <em>see also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Coleman has waived appellate review as to his claim against the York County court by failing to file specific objections after receiving proper notice. We conclude, however, that Coleman\u2019s objections adequately preserved his claim against Judge Hayes, but that the claim fails because the judge is immune from suit. <em>See Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 356-57, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
