At sentencing, based on James\u2019s prior felony convictions, the District Court applied an Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) enhancement and sentenced him to prison for a term of 262 months. After his conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal, James mounted several collateral attacks on his conviction; none were successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">On August 6, 2010, James petitioned the District Court for habeas corpus relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, contending that his sentence is invalid because the court erroneously imposed the ACCA sentencing enhancement; as a result, he received a sentence in excess of the statutory maximum sentence for a \u00a7 922(g)(1) offense. The court denied his petition, and he appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>the availability of \u00a7 2241 habeas relief and may affirm for any reason supported by the record. <em>Turner v. Warden Coleman FCI (Medium), </em>709 F.3d 1328 (11th Cir.2013). A collateral attack of a federal sentence must generally be brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. However, second and successive motions under \u00a7 2255 are barred except in certain circumstances not available here. <em>Id.; see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h) (requiring the court of appeals to certify the existence of either newly discovered evidence or a new rule of retroactively applicable constitutional law before a petitioner can file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion). In such situations, a petitioner may try to take advantage of the \u201csavings clause\u201d and seek relief pursuant to \u00a7 2241 if a motion pursuant to \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>709 F.3d at 1331 (citing \u00a7 2255(e)). In <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293 (11th Cir. 2011) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 1001, 181 L.Ed.2d 743 (2012), we left open the question of whether a prisoner could bring, pursuant to \u00a7 2241, a claim of \u201cpure <em>Begay </em>error,\u201d\u2014 that the petitioner was sentenced in excess of what would have otherwise been the statutory maximum because of the application of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). <em>Turner, </em>709 F.3d at 1332. However, before we will resolve the question of whether relief is available pursuant to \u00a7 2241, a petitioner must demonstrate that he no longer qualifies for the enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 924(e). <em>Id. </em>at 1334-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-12\">James\u2019s \u00a7 922(g)(1) conviction carries a maximum sentence of ten years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). However, any person who violates \u00a7 922(g) and has \u201cthree previous convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offence, or both, ... shall be ... imprisoned not less than fifteen <em>years....\u201d Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(1). A \u201cserious drug offense\u201d is an offense under the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 <em>et seq. </em>or 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 951 <em>et seq., </em>for which \u201ca maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law\u201d or a similar state offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A). A \u201cviolent felony\u201d is any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that \u201c(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>In <em>Begay, </em>the Supreme Court addressed the definition of a violent felony under \u00a7 924(e) and found that a felony offense of driving under the influence did not qualify as a predicate violent felony under the ACCA. <em>Begay v. United States, </em>558 U.S. 137, 144-48, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 1586-88, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). However, an armed robbery conviction is \u201cundeniably a conviction for a violent felony.\u201d <em>United States v. Dowd, </em>451 F.3d 1244, 1255 (11th Cir.2006). Similarly, we have affirmed, when unchallenged on appeal, that a robbery conviction in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 812.13 is a predicate offense under the ACCA. <em>United States v. Gandy, </em>710 F.3d 1234, 1238 (11th Cir.2013); <em>see also United States v. Welch, </em>683 F.3d 1304, 1310-14 (11th Cir.2012) (holding that a conviction under \u00a7 812.13(1) is a violent felony), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 913, 184 L.Ed.2d 702 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">In Florida, \u201cit is unlawful for any person to sell, manufacture, or deliver, or possess with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver, a controlled substance.\u201d Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a). If the controlled substance is listed in Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 893.03(2)(a), the violation is a felony of the second degree. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(l). Cocaine and any derivative of cocaine is listed as a controlled substance under \u00a7 893.03(2)(a)(4). A felony of the second degree carries a maximum sentence of 15 years of imprisonment. Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 775.082(3)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">In this case, the application of the ACCA enhancement resulted in James\u2019s sentence exceeding the otherwise applicable statutory maximum sentence of ten years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). As a result, he fits within the opening left by <em>Gilbert </em>and <em>Turner </em>in the wake of <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236 (11th Cir.1999). However, he has failed to demonstrate that he is entitled to relief under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 because he still qualifies as an armed career criminal after <em>Be-gay.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
