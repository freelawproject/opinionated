On appeal, he argues the district judge lacked authority to increase his sentence, based upon prior convictions that were neither charged in the indictment nor proved to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">We review constitutional sentencing issues de novo. <em>United States v. Steed, </em>548 F.3d 961, 978 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1222, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held the government does not need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt a defendant had prior convictions or allege those prior convictions in the indictment in order to use them to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence under a federal statute. Although the Supreme Court has since expressed some doubt as to whether <em>Almendarez-Toires </em>was correctly decided, it has explicitly declined to revisit that decision. <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); <em>see also Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2160 n. 1, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013) (declining to revisit <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>because the parties did not contest that decision). Rather, the Supreme Court has maintained, \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">Furthermore, we since have held <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 846 (11th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1246-47 (11th Cir. 2006). We have also recognized that we are \u201cbound to follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>unless and until the Supreme Court itself overrules that decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>242 F.3d 1028, 1035 (11th Cir. 2001). Because Hernandez-Abraham concedes binding precedent forecloses his argument, the district judge erred by enhancing his sentence based on prior convictions not charged in the indictment or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
