Colbourne appeals the district court\u2019s affirmance of the bankruptcy court\u2019s denial of Colbourne\u2019s motions to value the claims of Deutsche Bank; claims asserted through Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC (\u201cOcwen\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his motions, Colbourne sought to cram down Ocwen\u2019s first-priority mortgage liens on two investment properties, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 506(a) and 1325(a)(5). No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-15\">In August 2009, Colbourne filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in which he listed both Ocwen claims. Colbourne received a discharge. The Chapter 7 case was closed as a \u201cno asset\u201d case in December 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-16\">Colbourne filed this Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in January 2010. In his schedules, Colbourne listed Ocwen\u2019s mortgage liens: (1) a first-priority lien in the amount of $374,000 on Colbourne\u2019s Hopewell Drive property, which property is valued at $125,000; and (2) a first-priority lien in the amount of $226,800 on Colbourne\u2019s Grasmere Parkway property, which property is valued at $70,000. Colbourne then filed motions to value and cram down Ocwen\u2019s claims based on the current appraised values of the properties, both of which were substantially less than the amounts outstanding on the mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-17\">The bankruptcy court denied Colbourne\u2019s motions. The bankruptcy court concluded that, because Colbourne was ineligible to receive a Chapter 13 discharge \u2014 pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1328(f)(1)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 based on his recent Chapter 7 discharge, he was precluded from cramming down Ocwen\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Colbourne argues that the bankruptcy court erred in concluding that, because Colbourne was ineligible to receive a discharge under Chapter 13, he may not cram down Ocwen\u2019s mortgage liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">When the district court affirms the bankruptcy court\u2019s order, we review only the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Educ. Credit Mgmt. Corp. v. Mosley, </em>494 F.3d 1320, 1324 (11th Cir.2007). And we review the bankruptcy court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo. Hemar Ins. Corp. of Am. v. Cox, </em>338 F.3d 1238, 1241 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">\u201cChapter 13 debtors enjoy \u2018broad power to modify the rights of the holders of secured claims.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Paschen, </em>296 F.3d 1203, 1205 (11th Cir .2002). \u201cSection 1325(a)(5) is recognized as the source of a Chapter 13 debtor\u2019s authority to bifurcate secured claims and to \u2018strip down\u2019 the value of the claim to an amount equal to the value of the collateral.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1206.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">\u201cSection 1325(a)(5) specifies the conditions under which Chapter 13 plans must address \u2018allowed secured claims\u2019<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> if the plans are to be confirmed.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1205-06. In pertinent part, section 1325(a)(5) requires Chapter 13 plans to provide that the holder of \u201ceach allowed secured claim ... retain the lien securing such claim until the earlier of ... the payment of the underlying debt determined under nonbankruptcy law; or ... discharge under section 1328.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(i)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-13\">Although Ocwen\u2019s claims are undersecured, that Ocwen is a \u201cholder\u201d of two \u201callowed secured claims\u201d for purposes of section 1325(a)(5) is undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-14\">Other courts have explained that, when a \u201ccreditor\u2019s claim is bifurcated into a secured component and an unsecured component, [section 1325(a)(5)(B)(i)(I)] makes clear that the creditor may not be forced to release its lien upon payment of only the secured component.\u201d <em>In re Lilly, </em>378 B.R. 232, 235 (Bankr.Ct.C.D.Ill.2007). Thus, where a debtor is ineligible for a discharge \u2014 as Colbourne was in this case \u2014 the creditor retains its lien \u201cuntil the entire amount of the debt, calculated without regard to the modifications permitted in bankruptcy, is paid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-15\">Absent a discharge, \u201cany modifications to a creditor\u2019s rights imposed in the plan are not permanent and have no binding effect once the term of the plan ends.\u201d <em>Id.; see also In re Jarvis, </em>390 B.R. 600, 605-06 (Bankr.Ct.C.D.Ill.2008) (\u201cA no-discharge Chapter 13 case may not ... result in a permanent modification of a creditor\u2019s rights where such modification has traditionally only been achieved through a discharge and where such modification is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>binding if a case is dismissed or converted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Several courts \u2014 including the Middle District of Florida \u2014 have followed the reasoning in <em>In re Lilly </em>and <em>In re Jarvis </em>in concluding that debtors ineligible for discharge may not modify a secured creditor\u2019s rights through cram down or strip off. <em>See, e.g., In re Pierre, </em>468 B.R. 419, 423-24, n. 19 (Bankr.Ct.M.D.Fla.2012) (collecting cases and explaining that debtors who are ineligible for Chapter 13 discharge are unable to cram down a partially secured lien on investment property); <em>In re Judd, </em>66 Collier Bankr.Cas.2d (MB) 1620, 6 (Bankr.Ct.M.D.Fla.2011) (denying Chapter 13 debtor\u2019s motion to strip off a partially secured second-priority mortgage lien on an investment property when the debtor was ineligible for a Chapter 13 discharge).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">We are persuaded by the reasoning in these decisions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, because Colbourne is ineligible for discharge under section 1328, he is unable to modify permanently Ocwen\u2019s claims through a cram down. <em>See In re Lilly, </em>378 B.R. at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Colbourne also argues that, although he is ineligible for a Chapter 13 discharge, the Bankruptcy Code does not preclude him from filing for, or from receiving, Chapter 13 relief. Although Colbourne\u2019s argument may be correct as a matter of law, the bankruptcy court \u2014 in fact \u2014 made no ruling that Colbourne was ineligible for filing a Chapter 13 case or that Colbourne was ineligible for all forms of Chapter 13 relief. Instead, after denying Colbourne\u2019s motions to value, the bankruptcy court confirmed Colbourne\u2019s Chapter 13 plan pending resolution of this appeal. Thus, although Colbourne is unable to cram down Ocwen\u2019s claims, he has already filed for (and benefited from) other forms of Chapter 13 relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">We see no reversible error. Colbourne\u2019s motions were denied properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b714-11\">. On appeal, Colbourne does not challenge the bankruptcy court's denial of Colbourne\u2019s motion to value a claim filed by Wells Fargo Dealer Services, f/k/a Wachovia Dealer Services, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b714-12\">. Section 1328(f)(1) provides that \"the court shall not grant a discharge of all debts provided for in the plan or disallowed under section 502, if the debtor has received a discharge ... in a case filed under chapter 7 ... of this title during the 4-year period preceding the date of the order for relief under this chapter....\" 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1328(f)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b714-20\">. The bankruptcy court later confirmed Colbourne\u2019s Chapter 13 plan. Although the plan payments to Ocwen were calculated based on the proposed crammed down values, the bankruptcy court ordered Colbourne to pay all disposable income into the estate until this appeal was resolved. The bankruptcy court also ordered Colbourne to file a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>modify the confirmed plan to pay Ocwen\u2019s claims in full if his appeal was unsuccessful.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b715-10\">. The district court\u2019s order affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s denial of Colbourne\u2019s motions is a final and appealable order. <em>See In re Donovan, </em>532 F.3d 1134, 1136 (11th Cir. 2008); <em>T &amp; B Scottdale Contractors v. United States, </em>866 F.2d 1372, 1375 (11th Cir.1989). The district court concluded definitively that Colbourne was not permitted to cram down Ocwen's claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">Although the bankruptcy court must continue to oversee the administration of Colbourne\u2019s bankruptcy estate \u2014 including modification of the confirmed plan in accordance with the district court\u2019s ruling \u2014 the district court's order fully resolved the issue and left the bankruptcy court with no discretion in implementation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b715-17\">. The term \u201callowed secured claim\u201d refers to section 506(a), which provides that \u201d[a]n allowed claim ... secured by a lien on property ... is a secured claim to the extent of the value of such creditor's interest in the estate\u2019s interest in such property, ... and is an unsecured claim to the extent that the value of such creditor\u2019s interest ... is less than the amount of such allowed claim.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b716-7\">. We acknowledge that courts have approached differently the issue of lien-stripping in \"Chapter 20\u201d cases. Because the majority of cases that permit lien-stripping, including each of the cases cited by Colbourne in his appellate brief, involve the stripping off of wholly unsecured second-priority liens on principal residences \u2014 not the cram down of undersecured first-priority liens on investment property \u2014 we see their guidance less applicable to the facts of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
