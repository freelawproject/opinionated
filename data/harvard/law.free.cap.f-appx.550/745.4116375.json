Wittmer appeals her 24-month sentence, imposed above the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range of 10 to 16 months, after pleading guilty to one count of possession of a stolen firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(j). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-24\">From approximately September 2011 to April 2012, Wittmer and five other individuals illegally engaged in the business of selling firearms without a license. Wittmer personally participated in the sale of two firearms. On December 15, 2011, Wittmer provided a rifle to a codefendant, Terryon Norris, who sold the rifle to confidential informants. Wittmer\u2019s three-year-old son and newborn daughter were present during the transaction. On another occasion, before April 26, 2012, Wittmer stole a firearm from Amber Meeks and sold that firearm to Norris for $75.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-25\">A federal grand jury subsequently charged Wittmer with conspiracy to engage in the business of dealing in firearms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>without a license, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371 and 922(a)(1), and possession of a stolen firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(j). Following her initial appearance, Wittmer was granted a $20,000 unsecured bond. She later pled guilty to possession of a stolen firearm, pursuant to a written plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">While on pretrial release, Wittmer violated several of her bond conditions. She changed residences without permission on multiple occasions, and she tested positive for marijuana and cocaine use. Wittmer also avoided her presentence interview several times, and she lied to probation officers about having employment, taking drugs, and being on jury duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">At sentencing, the district judge determined an upward variance was warranted, based on Wittmer\u2019s failure to understand the seriousness of the offense, her multiple lies to probation officers, the need to afford adequate deterrence, and the need to provide her with rehabilitation. The judge imposed a sentence of 24 months of imprisonment, above the applicable Guidelines range of 10 to 16 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">On appeal, Wittmer argues her 24-month sentence is unreasonable. She contends the district judge did not consider her arguments in mitigation, but considered unknown impermissible factors and factors already considered in the Sentencing Guidelines. Wittmer further argues her 24-month sentence creates a sentencing disparity between similarly situated defendants and is longer than necessary to achieve the goals of sentencing. Finally, she asserts the court did not provide adequate reasons for the upward variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-12\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence deferentially for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). This \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard\u201d applies regardless of whether the sentence is \u201cinside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41, 128 S.Ct. at 591. In evaluating a sentence for reasonableness, we examine the sentence in light of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-13\">The district judge must impose sentences that are \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct, and provide the defendant with needed vocational training or medical care. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In imposing a particular sentence, the judge also must consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable Guidelines range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>When considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district judge need not discuss each of them individually. <em>United, States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, the \u201cweight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">A district judge, who sentences outside the Guidelines range, should explain why the variance is appropriate in the particular case. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.2009). While extraordinary justification is not required, <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 47, 128 S.Ct. at 595, the \u201cjustification for the variance must be sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance,\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1187 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In imposing a variance, a district judge may consider conduct a probation officer had considered in calculating the defendant\u2019s Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that, although defendant\u2019s previous offenses were part of the Guidelines calculation, those offenses fit squarely into the history and characteristics factor of \u00a7 3553(a)(1) and properly could be considered by the judge); <em>see also United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833-34 (11th Cir.2007) (concluding it was not error for the district judge to rely on factors in imposing a variance that had been considered in imposing an enhancement).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">We will \u201cvacate the sentence if, but only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We \u201cmay not presume that a sentence outside the guidelines is unreasonable and must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1187 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The burden of establishing the sentence is unreasonable, considering both the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, is on the party challenging the sentence. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (1 1th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">Wittmer has not met her burden of establishing her 24-month sentence is unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>Contrary to her argument, the district judge did not consider any impermissible factors on which she relies. Nothing in the record suggests the judge considered unknown facts; the judge based Wittmer\u2019s sentence on the presentence investigation report. In addition, the judge considered Wittmer\u2019s arguments in mitigation and noted they were \u201cappealing.\u201d The judge was permitted to rely on factors already considered by the Sentencing Guidelines when imposing the upward variance, such as Wittmer\u2019s bond violations. <em>Williams, </em>526 F.3d at 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">The district judge also provided adequate reasons for imposing the upward variance and recognized Wittmer had \u201cthumbed her nose at the processes of the court,\u201d had lied to probation officers, and had a total disregard for the rules of society. The judge determined a variance was required to provide an appropriate sentence, to provide rehabilitation, and to \u201cmake any sort of example for this conduct.\u201d Finally, Wittmer has not identified a similarly situated defendant who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>given a lesser sentence; therefore, her sentencing-disparity argument fails. Accordingly, Wittmer\u2019s 24-month sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b772-8\">. A district judge, however, \"may not impose or lengthen a prison sentence to enable an offender to complete a treatment program or otherwise to promote rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Tapia v. United States, </em>564 U.S.-131 S.Ct. 2382, 2393, 180 L.Ed.2d 357 (2011). Wittmer does not argue the judge imposed or lengthened her sentence for the sole purpose of providing her with treatment or vocational training; consequently, she has abandoned that argument. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003) (recognizing that an appellant abandons a claim not raised plainly and prominently in the initial brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
