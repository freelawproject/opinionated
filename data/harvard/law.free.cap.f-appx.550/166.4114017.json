We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the claims against the Rock Hill Municipal Court and Judge Modlz for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Coleman v. Rock Hill Mun. Court, </em>No. 0:12-cv-01909-JFA, 2013 WL <em>3929784 </em>(D.S.C. July 29, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-21\">However, we agree with Coleman that the favorable termination rule announced in <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), does not bar his pro se \u00a7 1983 action against Judge Long. <em>See </em>512 U.S. 477, 487 &amp; n. 7, 114 S.Ct. 2364 (\u201c[I]f the district court determines that the plaintiffs action, even if successful, will <em>not </em>demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal judgment against the plaintiff, the action should be allowed to proceed, in the absence of some other bar to the suit.\u201d). We nevertheless affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on this claim on alternative grounds. <em>See MM ex rel. DM v. Sch. Disk of Greenville Cnty., </em>303 F.3d 523, 536 (4th Cir.2002) (\u201c[W]e are entitled to affirm the court\u2019s judgment on alternate grounds, if such grounds are apparent from the record.\u201d). Our review of the record leads us to conclude that Judge Long is entitled to absolute judicial immunity because his actions were well within the scope of his jurisdiction. <em>See Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 356-57, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-22\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the material before this Court and argument will not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
