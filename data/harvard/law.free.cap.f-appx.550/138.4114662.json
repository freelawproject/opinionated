Daniels began receiving a monthly housing subsidy from the Homeownership Option of the Housing Choice Voucher Program, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f (West 2012) (\u201cSection 8\u201d). Fourteen months later, Daniels brought suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2006) against the Housing Authority of Prince George\u2019s County and Eric Brown, its executive director (collectively, \u201cHAPGC\u201d), alleging deprivations of her due process rights and violations of her rights under Section 8, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d) regulations, and HAPGC\u2019s Administrative Plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, Daniels alleged that HAPGC deprived her of her due process rights by failing to provide her an informal hearing to challenge the calculation of her 2010 housing subsidy (Counts I and II); and improperly reduced her subsidy by failing to timely process her payment for August 2010 (Count III); using an inflated estimate of her income (Count IV); failing to exclude her son and his income from the household promptly (Count V), and failing to credit her properly for her medical expenses (Count VI).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-14\">Daniels filed a partial motion for summary judgment on Counts I, IV, V, and VI. In an order entered on November 20, 2012, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Daniels as to Count I. The court dismissed Count II as duplicative of Count I and otherwise denied Daniels\u2019 motion. The court scheduled a bench trial to determine damages on Count I and liability on the remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-15\">At the bench trial in March 2013, the district court dismissed Count III as unsupported by the evidence. In an order entered on April 17, 2013, which Daniels now appeals, the district court ordered judgment for Daniels in the amount of $25, comprising $24 in economic damages on Count VI and $1 in nominal damages on Count I. The court ordered judgment in favor of the HAPGC on Counts IV and V. Having thoroughly reviewed the record, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-16\">Daniels\u2019 claims alleged \u25a0violations of Section 8, HUD regulations, and HAPGC\u2019s Administrative Plan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2018We review a judgment resulting from a bench trial under a mixed standard of review \u2014 factual findings may be reversed only if clearly erroneous, while conclusions of law are examined de novo.\u201d <em>Plasterers\u2019 Local Union No. 96 Pension Plan v. Pepper, </em>663 F.3d 210, 215 (4th Cir.2011). Decisions of a state agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>implementing federal law should be afforded deference, in an effort to \u201cuphold the letter of federal law while allowing agencies the discretion to perform their function of reasonably administering the federal program.\u201d <em>Clark v. Alexander, </em>85 F.3d 146, 150 (4th Cir.1996). Such deference \u201capplies only to the extent the agency\u2019s rules are not contrary to the statute or regulation, and that question is one of law for the courts to determine de novo.\u201d <em>Ritter v. Cecil Cnty. Office of Hous. &amp; Cmty. Dev., </em>33 F.3d 323, 328 (4th Cir.1994). \u201cOnce it is determined, however, that a rule is not inconsistent with the statute or regulation, deference is accorded, and a court may not substitute its own interpretation for the agency\u2019s if the agency\u2019s interpretation is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">On appeal, Daniels first argues that HAPGC failed to conduct a timely inspection of her residence, in violation of HUD regulations and the Administrative Plan. As the district court held, however, neither 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1437f nor HUD regulations provide a time limit within which a housing authority must conduct the required inspection, though they do require that the participant\u2019s home pass the inspection pri- or to issuance of a Section 8 subsidy. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.628(a)(4) (2013). Daniel began receiving payments once the inspection requirement was satisfied. Accordingly, we conclude that Daniels\u2019 challenge to the timeliness of the inspection lacks merit, as does her claim for $77,000 in damages that she asserts were caused by the delayed inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Daniels argues that HAPGC failed to timely exclude the income of her son from the calculation of her subsidy after he moved out of the residence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 7-II.D. of the Administrative Plan provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">If an adult family member who was formerly a member of the household is reported to be permanently absent, the family must provide evidence to support that the person is no longer a member of the family (e.g., documentation of another address at which the person resides such as a lease or utility bill).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">Thus, as the district court determined, HAPGC acted reasonably in requiring a specific type of proof of change in residence. Moreover, Daniels\u2019 assertion that HAPGC did not adjust her monthly subsidy for over a year is belied by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">Daniels next asserts that in June 2013, she requested a hearing with HAPGC to discuss her housing subsidy. She contends that the district court erred in failing to schedule a hearing and requests that this Court sanction HAPGC. Because Daniels\u2019 request for a hearing occurred after the district court issued its order and judgment on April 17, 2013, this claim was not properly before the district court, and we decline to consider it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>materials before this Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-11\">. HUD regulations require public housing authorities to adopt written administrative plans. 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.54(a) (2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b165-12\">. The parties in this case do not dispute the district court\u2019s determination that Section 8 creates enforceable federal rights under \u00a7 1983. Nor does either party dispute the district court\u2019s finding of Daniels\u2019 right to enforce provisions of HUD regulations and the Administrative Plan that define the housing authority\u2019s obligations and have a direct impact on the calculation of her monthly assistance payments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b166-5\">. Daniels contends that her son's status as a full-time student precluded the inclusion of his income in the subsidy calculation. As this issue was not raised before the district court, however, we decline to consider it in the first instance. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>666 F.3d 877, 887 (4th Cir.2011); <em>Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b166-12\">. Daniels also asserts that her counsel was ineffective in representing her. However, a litigant in a civil action has no constitutional or statutory right to the effective assistance of counsel. <em>Taylor v. Dickel, </em>293 F.3d 427, 431 (8th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
