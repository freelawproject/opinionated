No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372, which respectively lowered the base offense levels and statutory minimum sentences for crack-cocaine offenses. In 1991, Hudson was sentenced to 420 months imprisonment after a jury found him guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine, two substantive counts of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, and one count of money laundering. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(B)(i). Although his base offense level was initially calculated under the then-existing version of \u00a7 2D 1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, the crack-cocaine guideline, he was designated a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, which resulted in a guideline range of 360 months to life imprisonment. Because Hudson was sentenced as a career offender, instead of under the crack-cocaine guideline subsequently lowered by Amendment 750, the district court concluded that he was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-12\">On appeal, Hudson contends that he is entitled to a sentence reduction notwithstanding the fact that he was sentenced as a career offender. While acknowledging our holding in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), that career offenders are not eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief because their sentences are based on \u00a7 4B1.1, not the crack-cocaine guideline, he asserts that the Supreme Court\u2019s plurality opinion in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), effectively abrogated <em>Moore </em>and allows for reductions in sentences that were in any way based on a retroactively amended guideline range. He also contends that he is entitled to be resentenced under the more lenient statutory penalties prescribed by the FSA, particularly in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority to grant a \u00a7 8582(c)(2) sentence reduction. <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012). Section 3582 authorizes a district court to reduce a defendant\u2019s prison term if it was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). In <em>Moore, </em>we held that \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment,\u201d such as Amendment 750, \u201creduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in a sentence.\u201d 541 F.3d at 1330; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A) (explaining that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction is not authorized if the relevant guideline amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">In <em>Freeman, </em>which addressed whether defendants who enter into Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreements that recommend particular sentences are eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief, a plurality of the Supreme Court concluded that such relief \u201cshould be available to permit the district court to revisit a prior sentence to whatever extent the sentencing range in question was a relevant part of the analytic framework the judge used to determine the sentence or to approve the [plea] agreement.\u201d 131 S.Ct. at 2692-93. Justice Sotomayor, in her concurrence, took a narrower view, arguing that a sentence imposed in accordance with a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement is based on the agreement itself and not the applicable guideline range. <em>Id., </em>131 S.Ct. at 2695 (Sotomayor, J., concurring). Only where a plea agreement \u201cexpressly uses a Guidelines sentencing range ... to establish the term of imprisonment,\u201d Justice Sotomayor argued, is a defendant eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief based on a retroactive guideline amendment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">We have already rejected the contention, pursued by Hudson on appeal, that <em>Freeman </em>effectively overruled <em>Moore </em>and extended \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief to defendants sentenced as career offenders. <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1320-21. Hudson argues that we should not follow our decision in <em>Lawson </em>because it unduly relied on Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence in <em>Freeman, </em>which in his assessment is not the controlling opinion that case. That contention is not only factually inaccurate, but legally irrelevant as well. While it is true that in <em>Lawson </em>we stated that Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence \u201ccan be viewed as the holding in <em>Freeman,\u201d </em>we nevertheless concluded that \u201ceven if the plurality opinion contained the holding, <em>Freeman </em>would [still] not overrule <em>Moore.\u201d Id. </em>at 1321 n. 1. We explained that \u201c[n]either the plurality opinion nor Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence in <em>Freeman </em>\u201d were \u201cclearly on point to the issue that arose in <em>Moore </em>\u201d because neither \u201caddressed defendants who were assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but who were ultimately assigned a total offense level and guideline range under \u00a7 4B.1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1321 (quotation marks omitted). And even if we were to assume that <em>Lawson\u2019s </em>analysis was somehow wanting or flawed, as Hudson insists, we would be still be bound by it under the prior panel precedent rule. <em>See Smith v. GTE Corp., </em>236 F.3d 1292, 1303 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201c[W]e categorically reject any exception to the prior panel precedent rule based upon a perceived defect in the prior panel\u2019s reasoning or analysis as it relates to the law in existence at that time.\u201d). Because Hudson\u2019s guideline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>range was driven by his career offender designation, not the crack-cocaine guideline found in \u00a7 2D1.1, he is not entitled to a sentence reduction under Amendment 750 because it did \u201cnot alter the sentencing range upon which his ... sentence was based.\u201d <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Hudson\u2019s assertion that he is entitled to a sentence reduction under the FSA is also foreclosed by binding circuit precedent. In <em>Dorsey, </em>the Supreme Court held that the FSA\u2019s lower mandatory minimum penalties apply to pre-Act offenders who are sentenced after the Act\u2019s effective date of August 3, 2010. 132 S.Ct. at 2326. We have since held that defendants who were originally sentenced before that effective date are not eligible for \u00a7 3582(c) relief under the FSA, both because it \u201cis not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission, but rather a statutory change by Congress,\u201d and because it does not otherwise apply retroactively to defendants sentenced before its effective date. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012). We also rejected the notion that <em>Dorsey </em>compelled a contrary conclusion, explaining that <em>\u201cDorsey </em>carefully confined its application of the FSA to preAct offenders who were sentenced after the Act\u2019s effective date\u201d and \u201cdid not suggest that the FSA\u2019s new mandatory minimums should apply to defendants ... who were sentenced long before the FSA\u2019s effective date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Hudson contends that our <em>Berry </em>decision is not controlling because it did not involve a defendant seeking a sentence reduction based on a combination of Amendment 750 and the FSA. But that argument is also foreclosed by circuit precedent. In <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 542 (11th Cir.2013), we rejected a defendant\u2019s argument that <em>Berry </em>was distinguishable from his case because he was relying on both Amendment 750 and the FSA. We explained that the defendant\u2019s argument \u201clack[ed] substance\u201d because Amendment 750 did not lower his guideline sentence, which was based on the statutory minimum prescribed by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1). <em>Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d at 542. In his dogged quest to evade the clear import of our precedent, Hudson contends that <em>Hippolyte </em>is itself distinguishable because it did not involve a career offender. That Hudson, unlike Hippolyte, was sentenced as a career offender, instead of in accordance with a statutory minimum, is a distinction without a difference because in either case Amendment 750 does not have the desired effect of lowering the applicable guideline range. The district court correctly concluded that Hudson is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction based on Amendment 750, the FSA, or a combination of the two.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
