Steverson, Joyce White Vance, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Birmingham, AL, Nadine Deluca Elder, Joseph Paul Palermo, III, Mary Ann Sloan, Susan Kelm Story, Dennis Robert Williams, Social Security Administration, Office of the General Counsel, Atlanta, GA, for DefendantAppellee.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b808-9\">Before WILSON, ANDERSON, and EDMONDSON, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b808-10\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">Michelle King appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration\u2019s (\u201cCommissioner\u201d) denial of her applications for disability insurance benefits and Supplemental Security Income, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g), 1383(c)(3). On appeal, King first argues that the district court should have remanded to the Appeals Council (\u201cAC\u201d) because the AC erred in denying review in the light of King\u2019s additional evidence. Second, King contends that the AC\u2019s written denial of review failed to show that it adequately evaluated King\u2019s additional evidence. Third, King believes that a reasonable possibility, based on King\u2019s additional evidence, exists that the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) would have reversed her opinion and determined that King was eligible for benefits under Listings 12.04 (Affective Disorders) or 12.05(c) (Mental Retardation).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-13\">The \u201cfinal\u201d decision of the Commissioner is subject to judicial review. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). We review the Commissioner\u2019s decision to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1260 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cWith a few exceptions, the claimant is allowed to present new evidence at each stage of [the] administrative process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1261. \u201cThe [AC] must consider new, material, and chronologically relevant evidence and must review the case if the [ALJ\u2019s] action, findings, or conclusion is contrary to the weight of the evidence currently of record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>the judgment of the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 1260. When a claimant properly submits additional evidence to the AC, a reviewing court must consider the entire record, including the additional evidence submitted to the AC, to determine whether the denial of benefits was substantially erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>We must affirm a decision that is supported by substantial evidence even if the evidence preponderates against the ALJ\u2019s findings. <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158-59 (11th Cir. 2004). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1158. Moreover, we may not reweigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for that of the ALJ. <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">A person claiming Social Security disability benefits must prove that she is disabled. <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999). The ALJ uses a five-step sequential evaluation process to determine whether a claimant has proved that she is disabled. <em>Id. </em>A claimant must show that (1) she is not performing substantial gainful activity; (2) she has a severe impairment; (3) the impairment or combination of impairments meets or equals an impairment listed in the regulations; or (4) she cannot perform her past relevant work; and (5) she cannot perform other work, based on her age, education, and work experience. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520; <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1237 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The ALJ must \u201cassess and make a finding about the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity [ (\u201cRFC\u201d) ] based on all the relevant medical and other evidence in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1238 (quotations and alterations omitted). We have recognized that a one-time examiner is not a treating medical provider, and the examiner\u2019s opinion is not entitled to deference. <em>McSwain v. Bowen, </em>814 F.2d 617, 619 (11th Cir.1987). A condition that is controlled by medication may not be a substantial limitation for purposes of a claimant\u2019s RFC. <em>See id. </em>at 620 n. 1 (explaining that the ALJ did not err in failing to include epilepsy in his hypothetical restrictions as presented to the vocational expert where the claimant testified that his epilepsy was substantially controlled by medication).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">King\u2019s first argument \u2014 that the district court should have remanded \u2014 is largely inapposite because we review, in regard to substantial evidence supporting the Commissioner\u2019s decision, the Commissioner\u2019s final decision, not the district court\u2019s decision. On this record, the Commissioner\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-13\">Second, when King withdrew her motion to remand in the district court, King conceded at least the Commissioner\u2019s point <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> that the AC is not required to meet a particular standard of clear articulation when it <em>denies </em>review; and we generally will not consider an issue that the claimant failed to raise and preserve in the district court. <em>See Stewart v. Dept. of Health and Human Serv\u2019s, </em>26 F.3d 115, 115 (11th Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-14\">Third, King does not object to the AC\u2019s denial of review or the ALJ\u2019s decision based solely on the evidence that was before the ALJ. Therefore, King has abandoned those arguments on appeal. <em>See Allstate Ins. Co. v. Swann, </em>27 F.3d 1539, 1542 (11th Cir.1994) (explaining that issues not raised on appeal are ordinarily considered abandoned). Furthermore, none of King\u2019s additional evidence was material, <em>chronologically </em>relevant, and contradictory to the ALJ\u2019s decision. Thus, King has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>failed to show that her additional evidence renders the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b809-8\"> The withdrawal contains these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-9\">\"The points in the Commissioner\u2019s response [to Plaintiff\u2019s motion to remand] are well taken. The motion to remand is hereby withdrawn.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
