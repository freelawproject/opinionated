The motion filed in the district court challenged Bazemore\u2019s 2009 conviction for securities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>fraud. As in the district court, Bazemore argues on appeal that the Government breached the proffer agreement entered into during the plea negotiation process. He contends that he is entitled to specific performance of the agreement or to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">By moving for leave to proceed IFP on appeal, Bazemore is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue and is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Bazemore\u2019s motion for specific enforcement, or alternatively to withdraw his guilty plea, was unauthorized because the relief he sought was not available under any federal rule or statute providing for postconvietion relief. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1994). Therefore, his appeal is \u201cfrom the denial of a meaningless, unauthorized motion.\u201d <em>See Early, </em>27 F.3d at 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Bazemore\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his request for leave to proceed IFP is denied, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b256-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
