We review the dismissal de novo. <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-23\">As the district court determined, Powell seeks to challenge the validity of his sentence rather than the manner in which his sentence has been executed, his petition properly arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Id. </em>at 451-52. A \u00a7 2255 motion must be brought by the movant in the court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>sentenced him. \u00a7 2255(a); <em>Ojo v. INS, </em>106 F.3d 680, 683 (5th Cir.1997). The district court did not impose the sentence at issue; thus, it did not err by dismissing the petition rather than construing it as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Ojo, </em>106 F.3d at 683. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b257-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
