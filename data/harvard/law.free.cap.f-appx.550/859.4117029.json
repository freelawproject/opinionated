No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-19\">McDuffie first argues that the prosecutor misconducted herself when she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>cross-examined McDuffie about \u2014 and disputed McDuffie\u2019s recollection of \u2014 statements he made to her during a pre-trial conversation. Because McDuffie failed to raise this argument in the district court, we review only for plain error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>694 F.3d 1192, 1195 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">McDuffie must show both that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were improper and that a reasonable probability exists that, but for the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments, the outcome of the case would have been different. <em>See United States v. Eyster, </em>948 F.2d 1196, 1206-07 (11th Cir.1991). We consider prosecutorial misconduct \u201cin the context of the entire trial and in light of any curative instruction.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>149 F.3d 1298, 1301 (11th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">McDuffie objects to three statements made by the prosecutor during her cross-examination of McDuffie: (1) that McDuffie told her that he was carrying a gun on the night of the carjacking; (2) that McDuffie said he knew to whom the coperpetrator sold the guns; and (3) that McDuffie had told her that his eo-perpetrator suggested the carjacking on the way to the store, not on the way back from the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">Even if we assume \u2014 without deciding\u2014 that the prosecutor\u2019s statements were improper, McDuffie has shown no reasonable probability that the prosecutor\u2019s comments affected the outcome of his case. McDuffie himself testified that he told the prosecutor that he had a gun that night. The prosecutor\u2019s comment about the gun sale carried no obvious risk of prejudicing the jury\u2019s determination about whether McDuffie had the requisite <em>mens rea </em>during the carjacking itself. And, in the light of all the evidence introduced at trial and the court\u2019s instruction to the jurors that lawyers\u2019 statements are not considered evidence, McDuffie has not shown that the prosecutor\u2019s third comment had a reasonable probability of changing the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">McDuffie next challenges the district court\u2019s jury instructions about aiding and abetting. McDuffie contends that the court\u2019s instructions led the jurors to believe erroneously (1) that a lesser <em>mens rea </em>was required to convict McDuffie of carjacking and (2) that a finding that McDuffie himself committed an act in relation to the gun was unnecessary to convict him under section 924(c). Because McDuffie\u2019s lawyer said expressly that the defense was \u201cin full agreement\u201d with the court\u2019s proposed jury instructions, McDuffie has waived his right to challenge the court\u2019s instructions on appeal. <em>See United States v. Silvestri, </em>409 F.3d 1311, 1337 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-14\">McDuffie next argues that the district court erred under <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), when the court enhanced McDuffie\u2019s sentence absent a jury finding that McDuffie brandished a gun. Because McDuffie made no objection to an <em>Alleyne </em>error at sentencing, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. McKinley, </em>No. 12-14655, 2013 U.S.App. LEXIS 20790 at *9-10 (11th Cir. Oct. 15, 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>That the district court erred under <em>Alleyne </em>seems clear. In <em>Alleyne, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that the question of whether a defendant brandished a weapon is an element of the offense that must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2162-63. But, under plain error review, \u201cwhere the evidence of a statutory element of an offense is overwhelming and essentially uncontroverted, there is no basis for concluding [that an Alleyne] error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>McKinley, </em>No. 12-14655, at *14 (citing <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1786, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Here, \u201coverwhelming and essentially uncontroverted\u201d evidence exists that McDuffie is criminally responsible for brandishing the gun during the carjacking. Although the two carjacking victims testified inconsistently about whether McDuffie brandished a gun personally, the evidence shows clearly that McDuffie\u2019s co-perpetrator brandished a gun. As an aider and abettor, McDuffie is responsible for his co-perpetrator\u2019s conduct in its entirety. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>334 F.3d 1228, 1232-33 (11th Cir.2003) (concluding that a defendant who aided and abetted a bank robbery could receive an enhanced sentence under section 924(c)(1) based on his co-perpetrator\u2019s use of an assault rifle). McDuffie has not satisfied the fourth element of our plain error analysis; we see no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">McDuffie next argues that the district court erred in sentencing him as an armed career offender. McDuffie specifieally contends that the district court misapplied the modified categorical approach when it determined that his Florida conviction for aggravated battery on a pregnant woman, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.045, qualified as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a conviction is a violent felony under the ACCA. <em>United States v. Day, </em>465 F.3d 1262, 1264 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">McDuffie argues correctly that his Florida conviction is not categorically a violent felony. <em>See United States v. Diaz-Calderone, </em>716 F.3d 1345, 1347 (11th Cir.2013). Because section 784.045 has, as an element \u2014 the commission of battery \u2014 and because battery under Florida law is divisible,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we must use the modified categorical approach to determine whether McDuffie\u2019s conviction constitutes a violent felony. For background, see <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2283-85, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), and <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. 133, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 1269, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-13\">Under the modified categorical approach, we may consider the underlying charging document to determine which portion of Florida\u2019s battery statute McDuffie violated. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1263, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). We use the information in the charging document to determine only \u201cwhich statutory phrase was the basis for the conviction,\u201d not to determine what, in fact, happened for the offense. <em>Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2284-85. We consider the language of the charging document as a whole in resolving what portion of the statute underlies the conviction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number><em>See United States v. Rainer, </em>616 F.3d 1212, 1216 (11th Cir.2010) (reasoning that, although state law defined the term \u201cbuilding\u201d to include structures, vehicles, aircraft and watercraft, the factual descriptions of the buildings in the charging documents indicated that defendant was convicted of burglarizing two structures and, thus, had been convicted of \u201cburglary\u201d for purposes of the ACCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Here, the charging document charged McDuffie with \u201cactually and intentionally touching or striking\u201d the victim, and the document specifically added that he did so by \u201cpunching\u201d the pregnant victim \u201cin the stomach.\u201d McDuffie pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">McDuffie argues that he was charged with \u201ctouching <em>or </em>striking\u201d the victim; so, he says he was not necessarily charged with a violent offense. Although the isolated phrase \u201ctouching <em>or </em>striking\u201d might create some ambiguity, we must consider the language of the charging document as a whole. That the charging document set out expressly that McDuffie punched the victim in the stomach tells us that McDuffie\u2019s conviction was for the \u201cstriking\u201d \u2014 not merely the \u201ctouching\u201d \u2014 portion of Florida\u2019s battery statute: to punch = to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">We have already determined that a violation of the \u201cstriking\u201d portion of Florida\u2019s battery statute constitutes a crime of violence for purposes of the sentencing guidelines. <em>See Diaz-Calderone, </em>716 F.3d at 1351. Because the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Guidelines is analogous to the definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA, it follows that the district court sentenced McDuffie correctly as an armed career offender under the ACCA. <em>See United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-8\">. Under plain error review, McDuffie must show that (1) an error occurred; (2) the error was plain; (3) the error affected his substantial rights; and (4) the error \"seriously affectfed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>See Johnson, </em>694 F.3d at 1195.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b888-7\">. Under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.03, a person may commit a battery by engaging in three distinct acts: (1) intentionally touching, (2) intentionally striking, or (3) intentionally causing bodily harm. <em>State v. Hearns, </em>961 So.2d 211, 218 (Fla.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b889-7\">. On appeal, McDuffie also contends that the district court violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), by sentencing him based on a felony conviction that was never proved to the jury. McDuffie\u2019s argument is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which remains binding precedent. <em>See Alleyne, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2160 n. 1; <em>United States v. Dowd, </em>451 F.3d 1244, 1253 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">We also reject McDuffie\u2019s challenges to the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 2119 as foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>263 F.3d 1270, 1274 (11th Cir.2001) (addressing the constitutionality of section 922(g)); <em>United States v. Hutchinson, </em>75 F.3d 626, 627 (11th Cir.1996) (addressing the constitutionality of section 2119).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
