On appeal, Lorenzi argues the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (ALJ) determination that she was not disabled was not supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, she claims: (1) the ALJ improperly rejected the opinion of Lorenzi\u2019s treating physician and her testimony regarding her hand problems; and (2) the ALJ erred by not including a functional limitation of the hands in the hypothetical posed to the vocational expert (VE). After review, we affirm the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">Lorenzi contends the ALJ improperly rejected her treating physician\u2019s opinion, which established that her fibromyalgia caused hand problems. Lorenzi also argues her testimony regarding her hand problems was not properly refuted and should be accepted as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-13\">The ALJ must give the testimony of a treating physician \u201csubstantial or considerable weight unless good cause is shown to the contrary.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240 (11th Cir.2004) (quotations omitted). Good cause exists when: (1) the opinion \u201cwas not bolstered by the evidence,\u201d (2) the \u201cevidence supported a contrary finding,\u201d or (3) the \u201copinion was conclusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1240-41. The ALJ must clearly articulate the reasons for giving less weight to the opinion of a treating physician. <em>Id. </em>at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-14\">When a claimant attempts to establish disability through her own testimony concerning pain or other subjective symptoms, she must show evidence of an underlying medical condition, and either (1) \u201cobjective medical evidence confirming the severity of the alleged pain,\u201d or (2) \u201cthat the objectively determined medical condition can reasonably be expected to give rise to the claimed pain.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1225 (11th Cir.2002). If the ALJ fails to articulate the reasons for discrediting subjective testimony, then, as a matter of law, the testimony must be accepted as true. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b882-15\">The ALJ did not err by failing to accord the treating physician\u2019s opinion controlling weight. The ALJ articulated specific reasons for doing so, and those reasons are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1241.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The treating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>physician\u2019s evaluation evidencing hand problems was inconsistent with a later evaluation by the same physician, which indicated that Lorenzi\u2019s extremities were normal and that there was no small joint pain or swelling. Moreover, the later evaluation was internally inconsistent, and stated Lorenzi had taken a hiatus from treatment, indicating that her symptoms were not very severe. The ALJ clearly articulated \u201cgood cause\u201d for declining to give significant weight to the treating physician\u2019s evaluation. <em>See id. </em>at 1240-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">The ALJ\u2019s finding that Lorenzi\u2019s testimony was not entirely credible was also supported by substantial evidence. Many of Lorenzi\u2019s descriptions of her hand pain were inconsistent with the medical documentation and with her own descriptions of her daily activities. <em>See Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1225; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c)(3)(i). Although we have indicated that the \u201challmark\u201d of fibromyalgia is a \u201clack of objective evidence,\u201d <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005), the ALJ did not rely on the absence of objective evidence of Lorenzi\u2019s hand pain. Rather, the ALJ relied on the inconsistencies between Lorenzi\u2019s descriptions of her daily activities, the objective medical evidence, and her claims of pain. The ALJ thus articulated explicit and adequate reasons for choosing to discredit Lorenzi\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">Lorenzi also argues the ALJ committed reversible error by giving the VE an incomplete hypothetical. Lorenzi claims a complete hypothetical would have included a functional limitation of her hands. However, because substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s determination that Lorenzi\u2019s hand limitation was not a functional limitation, the ALJ was not required to include it in the hypothetical posed to the VE. <em>See Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1270 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cThe hypothetical need only include \u2018the claimant\u2019s impairments,\u2019 not each and every symptom of the claimant.\u201d (citation omitted)). Accordingly, the ALJ properly relied on the VE\u2019s answer to the complete question regarding the existence of jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-10\">. We review the Commissioner's legal conclusions <em>de novo, </em>but \"we review the resulting decision only to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir. 2005). Substantial evidence is defined as \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b882-17\"><em>. </em>Lorenzi argues, for the first time on appeal, that the ALJ erred in finding that a report of the treating physician was written in January 2009. Because Lorenzi did not present this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>argument to the district court, we decline to address it. <em>See Crawford v.
