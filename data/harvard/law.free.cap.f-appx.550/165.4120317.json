Rippy-Bey seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and dismissing his \u201cLegal Notice Proclamation of Status and Jurisdiction,\u201d which the district court construed as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2012) petition. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-21\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). \u201c[T] he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-24\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on March 20, 2013. The notice of appeal was filed on April 25, 2013.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because Rippy-Bey failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis and dismiss the appeal. We dismiss Rippy-Bey\u2019s pending mandamus petitions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-25\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b191-19\"> In a previous opinion, we remanded this case for the limited purpose of determining when Rippy-Bey delivered the notice of appeal to prison officials for mailing to the district court. <em>Rippy-Bey v.
