Vann, </em>660 F.3d 771 (4th Cir.2011) (en banc). On appeal, Alvarez-Yanez challenges the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>court\u2019s application of a sixteen-level sentencing enhancement under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (2011), upon finding that he had been deported after being convicted of a crime of violence. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In reviewing a sentence, we must ensure that the district court did not commit any \u201csignificant procedural error,\u201d such as failing to properly calculate the applicable Guidelines range. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We review de novo the issue of whether a prior conviction constitutes a crime of violence for purposes of a sentencing enhancement. <em>United States v. Diaz-Ibarra, </em>522 F.3d 343, 347 (4th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">A defendant like Alvarez-Yanez who is convicted of illegal reentry in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 (2012), faces a sixteen-level increase to his base offense level if he previously was deported from the United States following \u201ca conviction for a felony that is ... a crime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Here, the district court applied this enhancement based on Alvarez-Yanez\u2019s prior conviction for taking indecent liberties with a child, in violation of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-202.1 (2013). Alvarez-Yanez relies on <em>Vann </em>to argue that this conviction does not constitute a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">We have recently held, in a published opinion, that a North Carolina conviction for taking indecent liberties with a minor qualifies categorically as sexual abuse of a minor, and therefore upheld an enhancement under the very Guideline provision at issue here. <em>United States v. Perez-Perez, </em>737 F.3d 950, 951 (4th Cir.2013). Alvarez-Yanez\u2019s arguments to the contrary are therefore foreclosed. Accordingly, the district court did not err in applying the challenged enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
