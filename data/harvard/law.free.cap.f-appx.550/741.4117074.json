On appeal, Ortega argues that he should have received a two-level downward adjustment during his sentencing for his minor role in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>the offense pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">\u201c[Wjhether a defendant qualifies for a minor role adjustment under the Guidelines is a finding of fact that will be reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 934 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). The defendant bears the burden of proving his role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The district court has \u201cconsiderable discretion\u201d in determining whether defendant is entitled to a minor role reduction. <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277-78 (11th Cir.2002). In making its decision, \u201cthe district court <em>must </em>measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable.\u201d <em>Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940 (emphasis added). \u201c[W]here the relevant conduct attributed to a defendant is identical to [his] actual conduct, [he] cannot prove that [he] is entitled to a minor role adjustment simply by pointing to some broader criminal scheme in which [he] was a minor participant but for which [he] was not held accountable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941. Additionally, the district court <em>may </em>compare the defendant\u2019s culpability \u201cto that of other participants in the relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. However, the court may only consider other participants that can be discerned from the evidence and that participated in the relevant conduct. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred when it determined that Ortega did not play a minor role in the scheme to encourage and induce aliens to enter the United States. He actively participated in the efforts to bring several aliens to the United States by aiding them in boarding the vessel that would transport them. In addition, he advised them of what to say if the vessel was stopped by authorities and aided in the vessel\u2019s operation. Furthermore, he did not demonstrate that he was less culpable than his co-conspirator. Therefore, the district court did not clearly err in denying Ortega a minor-role adjustment. Accordingly, we affirm the sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
