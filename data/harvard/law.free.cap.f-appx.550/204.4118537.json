We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">We find no basis in the record for crediting the complaint\u2019s conclusory contentions that Rita Lumpkin was deliberately indifferent to Corring\u2019s medical needs. <em>See Hathaway v. Bazany, </em>507 F.3d 312, 319 (5th Cir.2007). The record shows at most that Corring disagreed with Lump-kin about his treatment regimen or that she was arguably negligent or committed malpractice, none of which constitutes a sufficient basis for casting Lumpkin in judgment under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Stewart v. Murphy, </em>174 F.3d 530, 534 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Banuelos v. McFarland, </em>41 F.3d 232, 235 (5th Cir.1995). Additionally, as Corring failed to establish an underlying constitutional violation by Lumpkin, i.e., deliberate indifference by her to his serious medical needs, Pearl River County cannot be liable on his theory that it had an official policy of failing to train its agents. <em>See Hare v. City of Corinth, Miss., </em>74 F.3d 633, 649 n. 4 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-14\">The judgment is AFFIRMED. Cor-ring\u2019s motions for oral argument and for appointment of counsel are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b231-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
