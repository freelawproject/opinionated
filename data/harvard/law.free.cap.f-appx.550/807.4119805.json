The district court initially denied Morton\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion for reasons not relevant to this appeal, and, after Morton filed his Rule 59(e) motion, the district court clarified that it believed Morton to be arguing that he was actually innocent of the ACCA enhanced sentence, and noted that this Court had rejected expanding the actual innocence of sentence exception beyond cases involving the death penalty in <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293 (11th Cir.2011) <em>(en banc) (\u201cGilbert II </em>\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 1001, 181 L.Ed.2d 743 (2012). Nevertheless, the district court granted Morton\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability on the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-10\">Whether <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1322-23 (2011) <em>(en banc), petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Aug. 17, 2011) (No. 11-6053), and <em>McKay v. United States, </em>657 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir. 2011), foreclose Morton\u2019s entitlement to the retroactive application of <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 122, 129 S.Ct. 687, 691-93 [172 L.Ed.2d 484] (2009), <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137 [128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490] (2008), <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>558 F.3d 1280 (11th Cir.2009), and <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008), in his first Section 2255 motion to vacate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-12\">On appeal, Morton contends that neither <em>Gilbert II </em>nor <em>McKay </em>forecloses his claim because neither case involved an ACCA challenge brought in an initial \u00a7 2255 motion. After thorough review, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-13\">When reviewing the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, we review <em>de novo </em>questions of law, and we review findings of fact for clear error. <em>McKay, </em>657 F.3d at 1195. We review the denial of a Rule 59(e) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Case v. Eslinger, </em>555 F.3d 1317, 1325 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-14\">Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), a person who violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) and who \u201chas three previous convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another\u201d is subject to a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence. 18 U.S.C \u00a7 924(e)(1). Carrying a concealed weapon is not considered to be a violent felony. <em>United States v. Canty, </em>570 F.3d 1251, 1252, 1255 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-15\">In <em>Gilbert II, </em>we addressed whether the savings clause contained in \u00a7 2255(e) permits a federal prisoner to challenge his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 when a \u00a7 2255 motion would be second or successive. 640 F.3d at 1295. Gilbert claimed that, pursuant to <em>Begay </em>and <em>Archer, </em>he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>should not have been sentenced as a career offender, and that, even though he previously had filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, we should hold that he was entitled to seek relief under the savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e). <em>Id. </em>at 1301-02. We concluded that Gilbert was not entitled to use the savings clause to bring a \u00a7 2241 petition in part because of the interests of finality in criminal judgments. <em>Id. </em>at 1309-12. However, we said that we had no reason to decide whether a claim that the Sentencing Guidelines had been misapplied could be brought in an initial \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id. </em>at 1306.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">A claim is procedurally defaulted, such that the prisoner cannot raise it in a collateral proceeding, when a defendant could have raised an issue on direct appeal but did not do so. <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1234 (11th Cir.2004). In <em>McKay, </em>we addressed whether the actual innocence exception to procedural defaults applied where the movant argued that he was actually innocent of a sentence enhancement because his prior conviction no longer constituted a crime of violence. 657 F.3d at 1198. We determined that the actual innocence of sentence exception did not apply \u201cto claims of legal innocence of a predicate offense justifying an enhanced sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1199.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">Addressing the question posed by the COA, we conclude that the district court erred by determining that <em>Gilbert II </em>and <em>McKay </em>foreclosed Morton\u2019s \u00a7 2255 claim. Neither <em>Gilbert II </em>nor <em>McKay </em>determined whether a defendant could rely on the retroactive application of <em>Begay </em>and its progeny in an initial \u00a7 2255 motion. Instead, <em>Gilbert II </em>specifically addressed the availability of \u00a7 2241 relief via the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause. 640 F.3d at 1309-12. Separately, <em>McKay </em>determined whether legal innocence of a sentencing enhancement, based on the conclusion that one predicate conviction no longer constituted a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d was sufficient to overcome the procedural bar for claims not raised on direct appeal. 657 F.3d at 1199. Because neither involved the issue presented by this case \u2014 whether <em>Begay </em>and its progeny could be the grounds for relief in an initial \u00a7 2255 motion \u2014 neither <em>Gilbert II </em>nor <em>McKay </em>forecloses Morton\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">Here, the government concedes that neither <em>Gilbert II </em>nor <em>McKay </em>forecloses Morton\u2019s claim, but argues that we should affirm on alternative grounds. But because our scope of review in a habeas case typically is limited to the issues specified in the COA, we decline to resolve the appeal on this basis. <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250 (11th Cir.1998). Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s decision and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
