Hernandez now petitions for review of the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) that dismissed her appeal of the I J\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen her removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-23\">Hernandez contends that she was not notified of the hearing that resulted in the removal order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>\u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(ii). She acknowledges that a notice had been properly mailed to the address in Fort Worth that she originally provided to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, but she argues that the notice was never received. The record, however, does not support a conclusion that the IJ\u2019s application of the presumption of delivery was \u201ccapricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see Ghounem v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 740, 745 (8th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Additionally, we find no merit in the contention that the BIA abused its discretion in dismissing Hernandez\u2019s claim that changed country conditions in El Salvador dictated reopening so that the removal order might be rescinded. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(i). Contrary to the contention that there was no discussion of Hernandez\u2019s evidence, the record shows that the IJ addressed that evidence, disagreeing with Hernandez\u2019s interpretation of it and finding no changed circumstances. Thus, Hernandez fails to show that the immigration courts\u2019 rulings did not \u201cadequately convey the reasoning\u201d employed, <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 908 (5th Cir.2002), or that the rulings were capricious, irrational, or \u201cutterly without foundation,\u201d <em>Singh, </em>436 F.3d at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b228-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
