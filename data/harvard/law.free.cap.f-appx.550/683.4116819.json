We hold that the district court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-26\">Singh, a citizen of India, worked for Carnival Corporation, a Panama corporation, as a crewmember aboard its Panamanian flagged cruise ship, the <em>Dream. </em>On May 30, 2012, while participating in a lifeboat drill, the wire rope used to hoist Singh\u2019s lifeboat to the cruise ship suddenly parted, plunging Singh and several other crewmembers sixty-five feet to the sea below. Singh\u2019s fall inflicted serious injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Singh\u2019s employment contract calls for the mandatory arbitration of any claims Singh might have arising out of his employment with Carnival and selects the Philippines as the arbitration forum. It chooses Panamanian law to govern the contract. Over the course of four and a half years working for Carnival, Singh signed six employment agreements containing the same, or a similar, arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Nevertheless, Singh contends that he did not know he was signing a contract containing an arbitration clause. It appears that Carnival presented the employment contract to Singh and his fellow seamen on a \u201ctake it or leave it basis.\u201d Carnival provided the contract to Singh as he was boarding the ship to report for work, and Singh hurriedly signed it in order to avoid being late to his duty station. Additionally, Singh contends that even if he had been aware of the arbitration clause, he would not have understood it, because his employment contract was in English. His language is Hindi.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Singh filed suit in a Florida state court for injuries he sustained alleging four claims: (1) Jones Act negligence;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) failure to provide maintenance and cure;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (3) unseaworthiness; and (4) declaratory relief seeking a determination that his claims are not subject to arbitration. Pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 205, Carnival promptly removed Singh\u2019s action to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. The district court granted Carnival\u2019s motion to compel arbitration and denied Singh\u2019s motion to remand the case to state court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Singh appeals the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">Singh \u201cacknowledges that several issues presented in [his] brief have been decided adversely to him by panels of this Court ... [but] nonetheless makes the arguments in order to preserve them for further review.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 21-22). While Singh presents six separate issues in his brief, the underlying issue in this case is whether the district court erred by compelling arbitration. The six issues that Singh presents, as outlined in his statement of the issues in his brief, are as follows: (1) whether the arbitration agreement is valid under Panamanian law; (2) whether unconscionability based on gross disparity of bargaining power and attendant circumstances is a standard breach of contract defense that can be applied neutrally on an international scale and is, therefore, a defense to a motion to compel arbitration under Article II of the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards; (3) whether the district court properly compelled arbitration pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>an arbitration agreement in a seaman\u2019s contract with a mandatory choice-of-law clause that required Singh, an Indian seaman, to arbitrate in the Philippines, under Panamanian law, and prospectively waive his Jones Act and Maintenance and Cure claims; (4) whether the arbitration and foreign choice of law clauses which eliminate Carnival\u2019s Jones Act liability and Plaintiffs right to choose the forum violate the Jones Act; (5) whether Singh\u2019s claims for maintenance and cure are not subject to arbitration; and (6) whether the case must be remanded to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (Appellant\u2019s Initial Br. at 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s order to compel arbitration pursuant to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, <em>opened for signature </em>June 10, 1958, 21 U.S.T. 2517, 330 U.N.T.S. 3 (the \u201cConvention\u201d) (codified as 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 202-208 (2012)). <em>See Bautista v. Star Cruises, </em>396 F.3d 1289, 1294 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">When deciding a motion to compel arbitration, a court conducts a very limited inquiry. This limited inquiry generally consists of a two-step process: First, the court looks to see whether the Convention\u2019s jurisdictional perquisites are met. <em>See Bautista, </em>396 F.3d at 1294. If these perquisites are met, it then looks to see whether any of the Convention\u2019s Article II affirmative defenses apply.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Convention\u2019s four jurisdictional prerequisites are: (1) That there is an agreement in writing to arbitrate the dispute; (2) That the agreement provides for arbitration in the territory of a signatory of the convention; (3) That the agreement arises out of a legal relationship, whether contractual or not, that is considered commercial; and (4) That one party to the agreement is not a United States citizen, or that the commercial relationship at issue has some reasonable relation with a foreign state. <em>Id. </em>at 1294-95. The party seeking to compel arbitration, Carnival, bears the burden of proving each of these jurisdictional prerequisites. <em>See generally Lindo v. NCL (Bahamas), Ltd., </em>652 F.3d 1257 (11th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">The only jurisdictional prerequisite Singh disputes is the first one. Singh asserts two affirmative defenses, which the district court properly characterized as unconscionability and violation of public policy. The district court properly held that our decision in <em>Bautista </em>forecloses the argument that Article II includes an affirmative defense based upon unconscionability. Similarly, the district court properly held that Singh\u2019s public policy defense (based upon the assertion that the employment agreement insulated compliance with the Jones Act and the general maritime law of the United States) \u201capplies only at the arbitral award-enforcement stage\u201d. (Opinion at p. 10 quoting <em>Lindo, </em>652 F.3d at 1280.) Singh relies on <em>Thomas v. Carnival Corp., </em>573 F.3d 1113 (11th Cir.2009), and contends that <em>Lindo </em>is not binding precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Singh argues that because the parties in <em>Lindo </em>settled after the panel issued its opinion, but before our mandate issued, the settlement mooted the controversy and deprived the Court of subject matter jurisdiction to decide the case. Thus, according to Singh, <em>Lindo </em>is not valid precedent, and we should have vacated our opinion in the case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Based on Singh\u2019s logic, anytime a party does not like the outcome in a case, that party could essentially \u201cbuy\u201d the case\u2019s precedential value by settling the case. Our 1993 decision in <em>Key Enterprises of Delaware, Inc. v. Venice Hospital, </em>9 F.3d 893 (11th Cir.1993) (en banc), while not factually on point, appears to agree with Singh. <em>Key Enters., </em>9 F.3d at 894-95. There we said: \u201cBecause the case became moot after the panel published its decision but before the mandate issued, we dismiss the appeal, vacate the district court\u2019s judgment, and remand to the district court with instructions to dismiss the case.\u201d <em>Key, </em>9 F.3d at 899. Singh relies heavily on this case to press his point that the <em>Lindo </em>panel should have vacated its decision and that its failure to do so renders <em>Lindo </em>ineffectual as precedent. (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 44-45, 47-48).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">In 1994, however, the Supreme Court decided <em>U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, </em>513 U.S. 18, 115 5. Ct. 386, 130 L.Ed.2d 233 (1994), which modified its precedent in <em>United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., </em>340 U.S. 36, 71 S.Ct. 104, 95 L.Ed. 36 (1950). We relied on <em>Munsingwear </em>in formulating our decision in <em>Key.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">The Supreme Court acknowledged that it had established a broad rule regarding vacatur in <em>Munsingwear, </em>which required dismissal and vacatur if a case was mooted at any point in the appellate process. <em>Bancorp, </em>513 U.S. at 390. It recognized that <em>Munsingwear </em>made no distinction between categories of mooted cases and that its rule even applied to cases mooted by reason of settlement. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Lake Coal Co. v. Roberts &amp; Schaefer Co., </em>474 U.S. 120, 106 S.Ct. 553, 88 L.Ed.2d 418 (1985) (per curiam)). The <em>Bancorp </em>Court narrowed this rule and specifically addressed whether courts must vacate an opinion where subsequent mootness resulted from settlement. <em>Bancorp, </em>513 U.S. at 22-23, 115 S.Ct. 386. The Court held that the opinion need not be vacated. It explained that \u201c[tjhis is not to say that vacatur can never be granted when mootness is produced [by reason of settlement].... [T]he determination is an equitable one, and exceptional circumstances may conceivably counsel in favor of such a course.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29,115 S.Ct. 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-11\"><em>Lindo </em>was mooted by settlement of the parties after the opinion issued, so the determination became an equitable one where the panel was free to not vacate its opinion. The panel exercised this discretion when it denied the parties\u2019 motion to dismiss with prejudice due to their settlement. The <em>Lindo </em>panel\u2019s decision to not vacate its opinion appears especially correct in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncement that \u201c[\u00a1judicial precedents are presumptively correct and valuable to the legal community as a whole. They are not merely the property of private litigants and should stand unless a court concludes that the public interest would be served by a vacatur.\u201d <em>Bancorp, </em>513 U.S. at 26-27, 115 S.Ct. 386 (quoting <em>Izumi Seimitsu Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha v. U.S. Philips Corp., </em>510 U.S. 27, 40, 114 S.Ct. 425, 428, 126 L.Ed.2d 396 (1993) (Stevens, J., dissenting)). Since <em>Lindo </em>was correcting and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>clarifying the law and the precedential value of our earlier decisions in <em>Bautista </em>and <em>Thomas, </em>it was certainly valuable to the legal community as a whole, and its vacatur would not have served the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">And 11th Cir. R. 36-3, IOP 2 supports our result. It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\"><em>Effect of Mandate on Precedential Value of Opinion. </em>Under the law of this circuit, published opinions are binding precedent. The issuance or non-issuance of the mandate does not affect this result. <em>See Martin v. Singletary, </em>965 F.2d 944, 945 n. 1 (11th Cir. 1992)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-7\"><em>See </em>11th Cir. R. 36-3, IOP 2. Singh challenges the validity of 11th Cir. R. 36-3, IOP 2 when applied in this instance. He states, \u201cThe fact that 11th Cir. Rule 36 grants precedential authority to a published opinion before the mandate issues does not change [the conclusion that the <em>Lindo </em>panel should have vacated its decision] ... [and that] Carnival\u2019s reliance on 11th Cir. Rule 36 to provide precedential effect to Lindo must be rejected.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 12,14).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Singh is correct that, at first blush, our decision in <em>Key </em>and Rule 36-3, IOP 2 are inconsistent. But, this inconsistency disappears in this case when both are interpreted in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bancorp.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">The district court correctly analyzed and decided, based on our decisions in <em>Bautista </em>and <em>Lindo, </em>the other issues Singh presents. We find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s analysis and its order granting Carnival\u2019s motion to compel arbitration and denying Singh\u2019s motion to remand. <em>(See </em>opinion and order at Dkt. 22, pps. 1-14). The district court properly compelled arbitration of Singh\u2019s claims, and we affirm its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-6\">. The Jones Act confers on seamen the statutory right to sue their employers in an American court for the negligence of fellow crew members. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30104.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b710-7\">. \"Maintenance and cure\u201d is an ancient common-law maritime remedy for seamen who are injured while in the service of a vessel.

The Convention mentions affirmative defenses in two places that are relevant to this case: Article II and Article V. A party seeking to resist arbitration may raise only Article II defenses when a court is deciding whether to compel arbitration. Article II defenses are limited to standard breach-of-contract defenses, which can be applied neutrally on an international scale. <em>Bautista, </em>396 F.3d at 1302 (citing <em>DiMercurio v. Sphere Drake Ins. PLC, </em>202 F.3d 71, 79 (1st Cir.2000))(discussing Article II\u2019s \"null and void\u201d language). A party may raise Article V defenses only at the post-arbitration enforcement stage of proceedings. The Article V category of defenses is broader and includes unconscionability and violation of public policy as valid defenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b712-8\">.
