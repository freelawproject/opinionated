After review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">A jury found Williams guilty of one count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The district court sentenced Williams to 220 months\u2019 imprisonment and ordered him ineligible for all federal benefits for life. On appeal, this Court affirmed Williams\u2019s conviction but vacated his sentence because the district court erred by finding Williams ineligible for federal benefits for life. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>541 F.3d 1087, 1091 (11th Cir. 2008). Our opinion in Williams\u2019s direct appeal issued on August 29, 2008, and, on September 24, 2008, the district court entered an amended judgment altering Williams\u2019s ineligibility for federal benefits from life to five years. Our mandate in Williams\u2019s direct appeal, however, was not issued until January 21, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">On October 4, 2010, Williams filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, claiming he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel. On November 4, 2010, the district court dismissed William\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely. On February 11, 2011, Williams filed his first Rule 60(b) motion for relief from the dismissal of his \u00a7 2255 motion, contending his \u00a7 2255 motion should be deemed timely filed because his counsel abandoned him during his criminal proceedings following the district court\u2019s entry of the amended judgment. On February 17, 2011, the district court denied Williams\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">More than one year later, on November 8, 2012, Williams filed a second Rule 60(b) motion for relief from the dismissal of his \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, contending counsel abandoned him by failing to file a notice of appeal from the amended judgment and that he was therefore entitled to equitable tolling of the \u00a7 2255 limitations period. In his reply to the Government\u2019s opposition to the Rule 60(b) motion Williams explicitly argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the district court\u2019s amended judgment was void because the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter it given that this Court\u2019s mandate had not yet issued. He further asserted that because his amended judgment was void, the judgment dismissing his \u00a7 2255 motion was also void.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">On January 22, 2013, the district court denied Williams\u2019s second Rule 60(b) motion because he did not file the motion within a reasonable time. On February 1, 2013, Williams filed a motion for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s denial of his second Rule 60(b) motion, arguing the district court failed to resolve the claim raised in his reply that the amended judgment and judgment dismissing his \u00a7 2255 motion were both void. On February 13, 2013, the district court denied Williams\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Subsequently, the district court granted Williams a certificate of appealability (COA), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apq\">Ideally, the Court \u2014 in an effort to avoid elevating form over substance and to conserve judicial resources \u2014 would vacate its earlier, void, judgment and re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>sentence Williams, again. Williams[\u2019s] current notice of appeal, however, divests this Court of jurisdiction to travel that path....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXOC\">Instead of vacating its earlier judgment, and because reasonable jurists most assuredly could find it debatable whether the judgment at issue is valid, the Court <em>GRANTS </em>Williams\u2019s request for a COA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">On appeal, Williams argues his sentence should be vacated and his case remanded for resentencing because the district court admitted it did not have jurisdiction to enter the amended judgment in his criminal case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Williams, however, does not raise any argument that the district court erred by denying his Rule 60(b) motion or motion for reconsideration. Rather, he simply asks this Court to grant him relief from his criminal sentence. By failing to make any argument or raise any challenge to the judgment specified in his notice of appeal, Williams has abandoned his claims on appeal. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir. 2008) (\u201c[Ijssues not brief on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">Even if Williams had not abandoned all of his arguments on appeal he still would not be entitled to relief. Williams could not use a Rule 60(b) motion to challenge his criminal judgment. <em>United States v. Mosavi, </em>138 F.3d 1365, 1366 (11th Cir.1998). Furthermore, to the extent Williams raised a new argument challenging the district court\u2019s jurisdiction to impose his sentence in his second Rule 60(b) motion, that argument was a second or successive claim for habeas relief which the district court did not have jurisdiction to entertain in the absence of authorization from this Court. <em>See Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293, 1323 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc) (holding that prisoners cannot use Rule 60(b) to evade the statutory restrictions on filing second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions); <em>Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201cWithout authorization, the district court lacks jurisdiction to consider a second or successive petition.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">In conclusion, the district court does not have the authority to resentence Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b870-8\">. Although we review a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion, we review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and the underlying facts for clear error. <em>Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b870-22\">. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 also provides no basis for resentencing Williams. <em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>597 F.3d 1190, 1196-97 (11th Cir.2010) (explaining district courts possess no inherent authority to modify a sentence outside the seven-day time limit specified in the rule).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
