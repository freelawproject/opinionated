In accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Treadway\u2019s counsel has filed a brief certifying that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but questioning whether the district court erred in denying Treadway\u2019s request for a probationary sentence. Treadway has not filed a supplemental brief despite receiving notice of his right to do so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-20\">We review Treadway\u2019s sentence for reasonableness, using an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We first review for significant procedural errors, including improperly calculating the Guidelines range, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2012) factors, sentencing under clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>see United States v. Evans, </em>526 F.3d 155, 160-61 (4th Cir.2008). Only if we conclude a sentence is procedurally reasonable may we consider its substantive reasonableness. <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-21\">Here, the district court correctly calculated Treadway\u2019s Guidelines range and fully explained its reasoning supporting Treadway\u2019s sentence, including its rejection of Treadway\u2019s request for a downward departure or variance. Accordingly, we conclude that the sentence is procedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006) (affording within-Guidelines range sentence presumption of reasonableness on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-22\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious grounds for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Treadway, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Treadway requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may move in this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Treadway. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
