We withdraw the previous opinion handed down on July 80, 2013, and substitute the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Kristie Bellow brought suit against Kim Edward LeBlanc alleging that he unlawfully terminated her in violation of the Family Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d). LeBlanc brings this interlocutory appeal from the district court\u2019s denying, on qualified immunity grounds, his Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. Bellow\u2019s complaint alleges a cognizable statutory violation resulting from LeBlanc\u2019s objectively unreasonable conduct in the light of clearly-established law. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">FACTS &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">The events that we summarize are as stated in the complaint filed in this suit. Bellow worked at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (\u201cHealth Center\u201d) from August 2008 until her termination on July 18, 2010. In April 2010, Bellow was diagnosed with a facial tumor, which required surgical excision; the tumor impaired her ability to work, and, left untreated, would eventually have been fatal. That April, Bellow completed the necessary paperwork requesting eight weeks of \u201cself-help\u201d leave under the FMLA. LeBlanc, who was her supervisor and also a member of the Board of Supervisors of Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College (the \u201cBoard\u201d), approved Bellow\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">On June 14, 2010, Bellow returned from medical leave. She found her parking card and identification pass were inoperative at the Health Center. Three days later, on June 18, 2010, Bellow was notified in writing of her immediate termination. LeBlanc personally signed the letter of termination, and Bellow alleges her taking FMLA leave motivated LeBlanc\u2019s terminating her. Bellow maintains LeBlanc deviated from Health Center policy regarding employee discipline by failing to give her advance notice she was being considered for termination and by failing to provide meaningful reasons for her being terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">Bellow sued LeBlanc in his individual capacity for discrimination under the FMLA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> LeBlanc invoked the defense of qualified immunity. He moved to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The district court denied the motion, holding that Bellow had alleged an injury caused by LeBlanc\u2019s violating her clearly-established statutory right to medical leave under the FMLA, and that LeBlanc\u2019s allegedly terminating her in retaliation was objectively unreasonable in the light of clearly-established law. This interlocutory appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b208-15\">We have subject-matter jurisdiction to consider, on an interlocutory basis, a deni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>al of qualified immunity. <em>Wilkerson v. Stalder, </em>329 F.3d 431, 434 (5th Cir.2003). A district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss on qualified-immunity grounds is reviewed <em>de novo. Morgan v. Swanson, </em>659 F.3d 359, 371 (5th Cir.2011) (en banc). Such review requires taking all of the plaintiffs well-pleaded factual allegations as true, with all reasonable inferences drawn in her favor. <em>Toy v. Holder, </em>714 F.3d 881, 883 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">A complaint must contain \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed. R.CrvP. 8(a)(2). The statement must \u201cgive the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d <em>Dura Pharma., Inc. v. Broudo, </em>544 U.S. 336, 346, 125 S.Ct. 1627, 161 L.Ed.2d 577 (2005). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Two issues are before us: (1) did Bellow have a clearly-established statutory right not to be terminated for taking leave under the FMLA, and (2) if so, was LeBlanc\u2019s terminating her for taking FMLA leave objectively unreasonable in the light of that then clearly-established law?</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Qualified immunity promotes the necessary, effective, and efficient performance of governmental duties, <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 807, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982), by shielding from suit all but the \u201cplainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law,\u201d <em>Brumfield v. Hollins, </em>551 F.3d 322, 326 (5th Cir.2008) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985) (qualified immunity is immunity from suit, not merely an affirmative defense to liability). Once a defendant properly invokes qualified immunity, the plaintiff bears the burden to rebut its applicability. <em>McClendon v. City of Columbia, </em>305 F.3d 314, 323 (5th Cir.2002). To abrogate a public official\u2019s right to qualified immunity, the plaintiff must show: first, the official\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional or statutory right; and second, the official\u2019s \u201cactions [constituted] objectively unreasonable [conduct] in light of clearly established law at the time of the conduct.\u201d <em>Brumfield, </em>551 F.3d at 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">1. Statutory rights under the FMLA</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">LeBlanc contends Bellow, as a state employee, has no statutory rights under the relevant FMLA subsection because states enjoy sovereign immunity from such claims. He cited <em>Coleman v. Court of Appeals of Maryland, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 1327, 182 L.Ed.2d 296 (2012), and <em>Kazmier v. Widmann, </em>225 F.3d 519 (5th Cir.2000). LeBlanc also urges us to disregard Mo<em>dica v. Taylor, </em>465 F.3d 174 (5th Cir.2006), as being inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-13\">Among other rights, the FMLA allows eligible employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid medical leave per year for the employee\u2019s own serious health condition if that condition impairs the employee\u2019s ability to work. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2612(a)(1)(D). Employees have a statutory right to seek monetary and equitable relief \u201cagainst any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d \u00a7 2617(a)(2). The term \u201cemployers\u201d includes state officials acting in their individual capacities. <em>M\u00f3dica, </em>465 F.3d at 186-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-14\">LeBlanc\u2019s reliance on <em>Coleman </em>is misplaced. That decision addressed other parts of Section 2612(a)(1) in the context of state sovereign immunity, not in relation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>the qualified immunity at issue here. To the extent LeBlanc contends Louisiana is the real party in interest and that he benefits from the State\u2019s sovereign immunity, that issue was not addressed by the district court. Consequently, we leave this Eleventh Amendment question for the district court to answer first after sufficient briefing. Admittedly, the issue we defer is logically antecedent to the one we resolve. We do so because state sovereign immunity presents a wholly distinct issue from the one of qualified immunity which is fully briefed for us to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Accordingly, in the light of the FMLA\u2019s and M\u00f3dica\u2019s plain language, Bellow has the statutory right to take medical leave. By alleging LeBlanc terminated her in retaliation for properly exercising that statutory right, Bellow satisfies the first qualified-immunity prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">2. Objectively unreasonable conduct and clearly-established law</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">LeBlanc contends <em>M\u00f3dica </em>disturbed the law <em>Kazmier </em>had established, and therefore his conduct could not have been objectively unreasonable because the law was not clearly established at the time he terminated Bellow. LeBlanc again misapprehends M\u00f3dica\u2019s holding and the state of the law generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">The central concept of qualified immunity\u2019s second prong is one of \u201cfair warning.\u201d <em>Hope v. Pelzer, </em>536 U.S. 730, 741, 122 S.Ct. 2508,153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002). \u201c[T]he right the official is alleged to have violated must ... be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that [his actions] violate[ ] that right.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). After <em>M\u00f3dica, </em>LeBlanc had \u201cfair warning\u201d that terminating Bellow for availing herself of FMLA leave \u2014 that he personally approved\u2014 would violate her clearly-established right to do so. Therefore, accepting her allegations as true at this stage, Bellow has abrogated LeBlane\u2019s qualified-immunity defense with respect to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">The district court\u2019s denying LeBlanc\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">OWEN, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">I dissent for the reasons expressed in Judge Jones\u2019s opinion dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b208-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-16\">. Bellow also asserted claims against the Board. Those claims were dismissed. Because Bellow did not cross-appeal those dismissals, they are not relevant to this appeal and are discussed no further here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
