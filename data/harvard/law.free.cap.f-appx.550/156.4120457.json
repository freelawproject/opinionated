Juarez-Sanchez asserts that the agency erred in denying his application for cancellation of removal and that the Board abused its discretion in denying his motion to remand. We have reviewed the administrative record and Juarez-Sanchez\u2019s claims and conclude that they are without merit. We accordingly deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. <em>See In re: Juarez-Sanchez, </em>(B.I.A. Apr. 19, 2013). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
