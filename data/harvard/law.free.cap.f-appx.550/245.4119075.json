We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">We reject Tobias\u2019s claim that the district court misinterpreted the Sentencing Guidelines and caused it to fail to assign him a three-level reduction in his offense level for not transporting or harboring the aliens for profit. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(l)(A). That Guideline does not permit a reduction unless the offense was committed other than for profit. Although the jury made no profit-motive findings with regard to the conspiracy offenses, the presentence report demonstrates that they were committed for profit. A district court may rely on any factual information in the presentence report that has a minimum indicium of reliability. <em>United States v. Shipley, </em>963 F.2d 56, 59 (5th Cir.1992). As the offense was not committed other than for financial gain, the district court did not err and Tobias is not entitled to a reduction under \u00a7 2Ll.1(b)(1)(A). <em>See United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Cuellar-Flores, </em>891 F.2d 92, 93 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b271-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
