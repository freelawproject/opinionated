After reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">Cecil Nelson, Mr. Pretlow\u2019s cousin, escaped from a Swainsboro, Georgia prison while awaiting sentencing following a high-profile conviction for conspiracy to kidnap. According to Mr. Pretlow\u2019s account of events, he agreed to assist Mr. Nelson after Mr. Nelson explained that he had been released on bond and sought to leave Georgia for his own safety. En route to Pennsylvania, Mr. Nelson confessed to Mr. Pretlow that he had in fact escaped. Mr. Pretlow persuaded Mr. Nelson to surrender to authorities, and the FBI prearranged for Mr. Nelson to surrender at a designated location. Instead of leaving Mr. Nelson there, however, Mr. Pretlow acceded to Mr. Nelson\u2019s instructions and instead dropped him off at his mother\u2019s residence, where he later submitted to authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-14\">Mr. Pretlow pled guilty to concealing an escaped prisoner in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1072. Mr. Pretlow\u2019s pre-sentence investigation report, as adopted by the district court, listed an advisory guidelines range of four to ten months\u2019 imprisonment. Before sentencing, the government moved for a reduction in sentence, citing Mr. Pretlow\u2019s cooperation and admission of responsibility. At sentencing, the district court expressed skepticism about Mr. Pretlow\u2019s initial ignorance of Mr. Nelson\u2019s escape, particularly in light of the extensive media coverage surrounding the event, and sentenced him to twelve months\u2019 imprisonment to be followed by twelve months\u2019 supervised release, an upward variance of two months from the top end of the advisory guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-15\">On appeal, Mr. Pretlow argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court erroneously factored in Mr. Nelson\u2019s underlying crime in imposing an upward variance on Mr. Pretlow\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b769-17\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). This standard applies \u201c[rjegardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>the district court\u2019s sentence is more severe or more lenient than the sentence we would have imposed, we will only reverse if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Mr. Pretlow contends that the district court abused its discretion when it imposed an upward variance on the basis of Mr. Nelson\u2019s underlying crime. Subject to several listed enhancements that do not apply to Mr. Pretlow, \u00a7 2X3.1, the advisory guideline applicable to violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1072 provides for a base offense level of \u201c6 levels lower than the offense level for the underlying offense[.]\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X3.1 (a)(1). Mr. Pretlow appears to read \u00a7 2X3.1 as setting forth the only bases on which a district court may impose an enhancement to a sentence for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1072. Mr. Pretlow, however, cites no authority in support of this proposition, nor have we located any.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">To the extent the district court factored in Mr. Nelson\u2019s underlying crime in imposing an upward variance, it did not abuse its discretion in doing so. Mr. Pretlow\u2019s argument does not account for the non-binding nature of the advisory guidelines following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1184 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cIf <em>Booker </em>is to mean anything, it must be that district courts are obligated to impose a reasonable sentence, regardless of the Guidelines range, so long as the Guidelines have been considered.\u201d). The record indicates that the district court considered the advisory guidelines but that other factors dictated an upward variance to reach an appropriate sentence. In addition to citing the factors identified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court underscored the apprehension that Mr. Nelson\u2019s escape \u2014 which Mr. Pretlow prolonged\u2014 engendered in the community, Mr. Pretlow\u2019s decision to assist Mr. Nelson in disregarding his scheduled rendezvous with the FBI, and Mr. Pretlow\u2019s extensive criminal history which, in the district court\u2019s view, his pre-sentence investigation report did not adequately reflect. The district court, in short, considered the advisory guidelines but determined that the unique factual circumstances of the case warranted an upward variance. Because we find that \u201cthe justification for the variance [is] sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance,\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1187 (internal quotation marks omitted), we find that the imposed upward variance was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">Mr. Pretlow\u2019s 12-month sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
