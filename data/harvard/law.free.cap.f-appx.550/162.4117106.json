The order denying the \u00a7 2255 motion is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (2006). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2006). When the district court denies relief on the merits, a prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims is debatable or wrong. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>see Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). When the district court denies relief on procedural grounds, the prisoner must demonstrate both that the dispositive procedural ruling is debatable, and that the motion states a debatable claim of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484-85, 120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Debreus has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss Debreus\u2019 appeal from the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">We review the district court\u2019s decision on whether to reduce a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Munn, </em>595 F.3d 183, 186 (4th Cir.2010). Because Debreus\u2019 Guidelines sentence was not lowered due to amendments to the Guidelines, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal from the denial of the \u00a7 2255 motion and affirm the appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying the \u00a7 3582(c) motion. We also deny Debreus\u2019 motion to vacate the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court' and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">No. 12-7640 <em>DISMISSED.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">No. 13-7439 <em>AFFIRMED.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
