Accordingly, the issue is waived. <em>See Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2004) (citations omitted) (holding claims not raised in petition for review are waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Regarding the BIA\u2019s dismissal of his appeal, Okwandu contends he is statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a) (cancellation of removal). In support, he maintains his counsel rendered ineffective assistance during the removal proceedings by failing to establish a basis for discretionary relief under \u00a7 1229b(a), which resulted in the IJ\u2019s decision to deny his request for such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">To the extent Okwandu challenges the purely discretionary denial of cancellation of removal, we lack jurisdiction over the claim. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) (denials of discretionary relief); <em>see also Sung v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 372, 377 (5th Cir.2007). On the other hand, we have jurisdiction for \u201creview of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review\u201d, even if those claims are associated with a claim for discretionary relief. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (judicial review of certain legal claims); <em>see also Garcia-Maldonado v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 284, 287 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\u201cAlthough an alien has no Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel during removal proceedings, <em>Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, </em>252 F.3d 383, 385 n. 2 (5th Cir.2001), this court has repeatedly assumed without deciding that an alien\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance may implicate due process concerns under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>Mai v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 162, 165 (5th Cir. 2006) (citing <em>Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 475 (5th Cir.2004)). Because Okwandu\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim relates solely to his claim for discretionary relief, however, his claim does not amount to a due-process violation. <em>See Assaad, </em>378 F.3d at 475-76. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">In addition, Okwandu challenges the BIA\u2019s finding he failed to establish United States citizenship. He contends he qualified for derivative citizenship because, while Okwandu was under the age of 18, his father became a naturalized citizen. \u201c[This] nationality claim is a question of law that we review <em>de novo </em>\u201d. <em>Marquez-Marquez v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 548, 554 (5th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). Okwandu was over 18 years old on 27 February 2001, the effective date of the Child Citizenship Act; thus, the Child Citizenship Act is inapplicable. Instead, \u00a7 321 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (formerly codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432; repealed 30 Oct. 2000) is applicable to Okwandu. <em>E.g., Marquez-Marquez, </em>455 F.3d at 550 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">It is undisputed that Okwandu\u2019s parents divorced in 1986 and that his father was naturalized on 5 April 1996, when Okwandu was under the age of 18. Because he does not contend or establish that he was in the sole legal custody of his naturalized father, however, Okwandu cannot establish derivative citizenship. <em>See Bustamante-Barrera v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 388, 395-96 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b273-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
