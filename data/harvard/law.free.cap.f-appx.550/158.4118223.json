In the plea agreement, Tomblin agreed to waive his right to appeal his conviction and sentence, except a sentence exceeding the statutory maximum of ten years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-18\">On appeal, Tomblin\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396,18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether Tomblin\u2019s sentence is greater than necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) (2012). Although informed of his right to file pro se supplemental brief, Tomblin has not done so. The Government has moved to dismiss Tomblin\u2019s appeal based on the appellate waiver provision in his plea agreement. We dismiss in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-20\">We review a defendant\u2019s waiver of appellate rights de novo. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162,168 (4th Cir.2005). \u201cA defendant may waive his right to appeal if that waiver is the result of a knowing and intelligent decision to forgo the right to appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Amaya-Portillo, </em>423 F.3d 427, 430 (4th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Generally, if the district court fully questions the defendant about the waiver during the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 plea colloquy, the waiver is valid and enforceable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>410 F.3d 137, 151 (4th Cir.2005). We will enforce a valid waiver so long as \u201cthe issue being appealed is within the scope of the waiver.\u201d <em>Blick, </em>408 F.3d at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-21\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that Tomblin\u2019s waiver of appellate rights was knowing and intelligent. Therefore, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss Tomblin\u2019s appeal as to his sentence and dismiss this portion of the appeal. Although the waiver provision in the plea agreement precludes our review of the sentence, the waiver does not preclude our review of any errors in Tomblin\u2019s conviction that may be revealed pursuant to the review required by <em>Anders. </em>In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues that are outside the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>the appeal waiver. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment as to all issues not encompassed by Tomblin\u2019s valid waiver of his right to appeal. This court requires that counsel inform Tomblin, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Tomblin requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Tomblin. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
