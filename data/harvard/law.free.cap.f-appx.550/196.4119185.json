We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Llamas-Hernandez\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no non-frivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b222-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
