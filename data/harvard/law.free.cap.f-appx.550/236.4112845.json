Marcus Rashawn WILLIAMS, also known as Nuk, also known as Sealed1, also known as Nook, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b262-10\">No. 13-40296</docketnumber>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"AOy\">Summary Calendar.</p>\n<court data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b262-11\">United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b262-13\">Dec. 30, 2013.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-14\">John Albert Craft, Assistant U.S. Attorney, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Beaumont, TX, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-15\">Kimberly S.

California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). The motions by Williams to construe his pro se brief as a response to counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>motion and for leave to file the response out of time are GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-21\">We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Williams\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. The record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration at this time of Williams\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; such a claim generally \u201ccannot be resolved on direct appeal when the claim has not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We also concur with counsel that there is a clerical error in the final order of forfeiture that should be corrected to reflect that Williams has forfeited his interest in eighteen million, five hundred thousand dollars ($18,500,000.00). <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-22\">Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Williams\u2019s motion to appoint counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>is DENIED. The matter is REMANDED for correction of the clerical error pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
