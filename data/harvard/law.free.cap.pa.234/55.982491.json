Patrick Martin died on May 7, 1890, and no trustee was appointed in his place. Prior to his death, Patrick Martin, the trustee, leased the premises for oil and gas as trustee, and did other acts indirect to the ownership of the legal title. On February 1, 1907, the respondents, Mary Martin, the widow of Hugh Martin, Anastasia Woods, Henry John Martin and Patrick Charles Martin, being all the children of Mary and Hugh Martin, executed a mortgage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>to Elizabeth Renvers on the property in dispute to secure the payment of $7,000. Default having been made in the payment of the interest a scire facias was issued on the said mortgage, and prosecuted to judgment, and lev. fa. issued to the sheriff, on which writ the premises were exposed to sale and the property sold on February 9,1910, to Elizabeth Renvers, who received a deed for the same dated February 26,1910. The above petitioners became the owners of the property by deed from Elizabeth Renvers, March 31, 1910.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-5\">The answer of the respondents\u2019 claims that the deed from Hugh Martin to Patrick Martin created an active trust, that the legal title was in the trustee, and that the mortgage from the respondents was void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-6\">It will be observed that Hugh Martin, husband of Mary Martin, was dead many years before the execution of the mortgage, and therefore there can be no question of a separate use trust. That question being eliminated, as we view the language of the deed, the trust was a dry trust and the deed passed the legal title to Mary Martin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-7\">It follows then that the mortgage being valid, the title of the respondents passed with the sheriff\u2019s deed, and they have no right to hold possession as against the petitioners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-8\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in entering judgment for the petitioners.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b85-9\"><em>Joseph R.
