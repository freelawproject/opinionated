The only estate remaining is testator\u2019s undivided one-half interest in a lot, and business building thereon, situated on Liberty Avenue, this City, which interest is valued at $75,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-5\">The bequests to the widow of household goods, furniture, jewelry, monies, stocks and real estate, are specific and absolute. Having thus given her all his real estate, he expresses a desire that the general legacies shall be paid out of Ms estate, not out of what he had previously given her. This remaining estate not devised was his interest in the partnership; it is what he had reference to in the language \u201cbalance of my estate and share in business;\u201d after the legacies were paid therefrom what was left should in addition go to his widow; this does not change the absolute devise to her of the estate previously given; these legacies were to be paid, if binding, out of the balance of his estate not otherwise given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-6\">The devise of the real estate to the widow vested in her as a purchaser; her legacy is preferred over general legacies; University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Appeal, 97 Pa. 187; she is the first taker, the principal object of his bounty; Watson v.

Primarily, general legacies are payable out of the personalty; only express language, or necessary implication, charges them upon the land; Shenk v. Shenk, 150 Pa. 521; a mere direction that a devisee shall pay a legacy does not create a charge on the land; Cable\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Appeal, 91 Pa. 327; deficiency of personal assets does not create an interference of the intention to charge the real estate with payment; Heathcote\u2019s Estate, 209 Pa. 522; there is no direction to sell; no necessity to sell for the purpose of carrying out the binding provision of the will; nor such a blending of personalty and real estate as to indicate an intention to charge the real estate; Duvall\u2019s Estate, 146 Pa. 176.
