On June 2, 1908, the defendant company, in consideration of a premium paid, issued to him its policy of fire insurance for $1,500 on the three-story building \u201cwhile occupied as a private dwelling house and storeroom,\u201d and on August 29, 1908, the same company, in consideration of a premium paid, issued to him its policy of fire insurance for $1,000 on the. two-story building \u201cwhile occupied as a grocery and dwelling house.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-6\">Each of these policies was for a period of one year from its date, and in each other insurance was permitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-7\">The buildings were destroyed by fire on December 25, 1908. Proofs of loss were duly furnished, payment was refused, and an action of assumpsit was brought to recover on the policies. An affidavit of defense was filed, and a rule was taken for judgment for want of a sufficient defense, which rule was duly heard and discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-8\">The parties now submit a case stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-9\">Each of the policies provided (inter alia) that it should be null and void, and of no effect, \u201cif, with the knowledge of the insured, foreclosure proceedings be commenced, or notice given of sale of any property covered by this insurance by virtue of any mortgage or trust deed; or if any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>change, other than by the death of an insured, take place in the interest, title or possession of the subject of insurance (except change of occupants without increase of hazard) whether by legal process, or judgment, or by voluntary act of the insured, or otherwise, or if this policy .be assigned before a loss, or if illuminating gas or vapor be generated in the described building (or adjacent thereto) for use therein.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-3\">No waiver or modification of any of the above provisions and conditions was ever made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AKx\">On December 9, 1908, an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed by creditors of Marcello against him in the United States court for the western district of Pennsylvania. On December 12, 1908, Marcello, in writing, waived service of a subpoena in bankruptcy. On December 17, 1908, a petition for the appointment of a receiver of the property of Marcello was filed, and as respects said petition, there was a second written waiver by Marcello of the service of a subpoena or notice upon him. On December 17, 1908, the South Side Trust Company was appointed \u201cReceiver of all the assets and property, of every kind and character, belonging to said bankrupt.\u201d On December 18, 1908, the receiver gave bond, which was duly approved and filed on the same day, and thereupon, December 18, 1908, the receiver took possession of the property covered by these two policies of insurance, and placed a watchman upon it. On December 19,1908, the receiver took out policies of fire insurance issued by various companies, to the amount of $9,000, upon the same property covered by these two policies. Marcello, before the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, had, in addition to the two policies in suit, taken out other policies of several companies on said property, his entire insurance on the same being $9,000. On December 21, 23 and 24, 1908, the receiver advertised the personal property of Marcello for sale on December 31, 1908. On December 25, 1908, the buildings and their contents were destroyed by fire. The receiver\u2019s watchman was on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>property at the time of the fire, and Marcello was living in one of the dwellings, not having been dispossessed by the receiver. Marcello\u2019s policies, including the two in suit, had not been canceled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-4\">On December 29, 1908, Marcello was adjudged a bankrupt. No notice of the bankruptcy proceedings, nor of the appointment of a receiver, was given to the defendant company, nor did it ever consent to the \u201cchanged conditions,\u201d as set forth in the case stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-5\">The sole question in the case is whether there was such a change in the interest, title or possession of the subject of insurance as to terminate the policies. It does not appear among the facts, submitted, and expressly agreed to, that the change was \u201ca change of occupants without increase of hazard,\u201d or otherwise; nor does it appear that the receiver had no such title as to enable it to take out new policies of insurance; nor that it was not empowered to sell and dispose of the personal property, as it had announced its intention by advertisement to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-6\">The bankruptcy act of 1898 authorizes the appointment \u201cof receivers, or the marshals, upon application of parties in interest, in case the courts shall find it absolutely necessary for the preservation of estates to take charge of the property of bankrupts, after the filing of the petition, and until it is dismissed, or the trustee is qualified.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-7\">The title to the property of the alleged bankrupt remains in him until adjudication; subject to the control of the court, to be exercised either by a receiver, or the marshal, if otherwise the interests of the creditors are not sufficiently protected: In re La Plume Condensed Milk Co., 145 Fed. Repr. 1013.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-8\">The duty required, and the power conferred, clearly are that the receiver, or the marshal, should take possession of property that would otherwise go to waste, and hold it and preserve it, so that it might come to the trustee, when selected, without needless injury: Boonville Nat. Bank v. Blakey, 107 Fed. Repr. 891.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-9\">As a general rule, no order of sale should be made until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>after adjudication, unless the property is of such a nature that a sale is necessary to preserve its value: In re Kelly Dry Goods Co., 102 Fed. Repr. 747; In re Garner &amp; Co., 153 Fed. Repr. 914; In re Harris, 155 Fed. Repr. 216.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-3\">A receiver in bankruptcy is a mere custodian, and has no title to the property of the bankrupt: 2 Foster, Fed. Practice (4th ed.), 1815.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-4\"><em>\u201c </em>In general, the receiver in a bankrupt proceeding is a caretaker and custodian of the property of the bankrupt, and is not a trustee for the creditors. ... In an involuntary proceeding, the duty of the receiver, who conducts the business of the bankrupt, is to maintain as far as possible the continuity of his affairs, so that, if no adjudication is made, his property and business may be returned to him with the least possible damage:\u201d Alderson on Receivers, 361.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-5\">From the above recited authorities, it appears that, while the receiver might be justified in advertising for sale and selling the personal property, and doubtless would be, if so authorized and directed by order of the court, it would have no authority to sell the real estate; and that as respects title to the real estate, it was in the bankrupt at the time of the destruction of the buildings by fire, and until adjudication. Whether or not the receiver had such insurable interest in the buildings, as to enable it to take out new policies of insurance on them as it did, is not a question which calls for decision in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-6\">Had the fire occurred after the adjudication of Marcello as a bankrupt, and especially after the appointment of a trustee for the benefit of creditors, qualification of the trustee, and that taking of actual possession by the trustee, the question here presented could not have arisen. But under the circumstances, it cannot be said that it is one which involves mere technicality. It comes naturally from the contracts of insurance and the facts agreed upon, and the insurance company is entitled, to have it fully considered, and passed upon by the courts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>The receiver did take possession of the premises. It placed a watchman upon them. The watchman was there, in personal charge of the property \u2014 both real estate and personalty \u2014 at the time of the fire.\u00bb The receiver did not lease them to a tenant; it did not dispossess the bankrupt, who was living upon them. He was allowed to remain, and he was there at the time of the fire. As a further act of possession, it reinsured the property in its own name for creditors; and as a further act of possession, it advertised the personal property for sale. Its possession was complete in the sense that it had absolute charge of the property, and actually occupied it without notice to, or knowledge of, this defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-4\">The safety of the insurer is dependent much upon the character of the assured, not alone upon his integrity and good faith, but upon his habits of carefulness, of prudence, and vigilance. It is obvious that the danger of fire may be much less when the assured is a man watchful and provident than where he is heedless and negligent, as well as dishonest. The provision, therefore, which requires assignment of a policy to be made with the consent of the insurers, and to be approved by them, is not unmeaning. Nor is its purpose to stipulate for a new contract with the assignee. It is designed rather to afford substantial protection to the underwriters, by enabling them to preserve, during the continuance of the risk, the safeguards which existed at its origin; those found in the honesty and watchfulness of the assured. It was for this reason that it was early laid down that a fire policy could not be assigned pending the risk, so as to give to the assignee any interest in it whatsoever, either legal or equitable: Lord Chancellor King, Lynch v. Dalzell, 4 Bro. P. C. 431. Such a policy has indeed in some of the later cases been held assignable in equity, with the subject itself, when it contained no provision to the contrary, and it is on that account that the prohibition to assign has been generally introduced: State Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. Roberts, 31 Pa. 438.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>It was not contemplated by the parties to the contracts that mere change of occupancy should vitiate them, because change \u201cin the interest, title or possession\u201d is expected in case of \u201cdeath of an insured,\u201d and likewise, \u201cchange of occupants without increase of hazard.\u201d The word \u201cpossession,\u201d as used in the policies, seems to have a broader significance than any that could be gathered from the words \u201coccupant,\u201d \u201coccupancy,\u201d or \u201coccupation.\u201d Such is the view taken by the Superior Court in a case involving the consideration of a policy of insurance, which contained this provision: \u201cThis entire policy . . . . shall be void .... if any change, other than by the death of the insured, takes place in the interest, title or possession of the subject of insurance (except change of occupants without increase of hazard), whether by legal process, or judgment, or by voluntary act of the insured, or otherwise.\u201d The court says (inter alia): \u201cWe are not aware that the precise question here involved has been decided in this state. But there is a decision in Rumsey v. Ph\u0153nix Insurance Co., 1 Fed. Repr. 396, by the United States circuit court of appeals for the northern district of New York, opinion by Judge Wallace, which seems to decide this question. In that case the policy provided that it should be void \u2018if the property be sold or transferred, or any change take place in the title or possession, whether by legal process, judicial decree, voluntary transfer, or conveyance.\u2019 The court said in that case, \u2018The fact that Zimmer moved out of the dwelling house, and let it to tenants, is not a defense within the conditions that avoid the policy if any change takes place in title or possession. The change of possession contemplated is something more than a change of occupation; it is a change effected by legal process, judicial decree, voluntary transfer, or conveyance; one which refers to his possessory right, and not to the occupancy of the insured. The possession of Zimmer\u2019s tenants was his possession within the meaning of the policy.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-3\">\u2018 In our opinion the proper legal, as well as reasonable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>construction of the word \u2018possession,\u2019 as used in the policy in the present case, limits it to legal possession, or possessory right. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-4\">\u201c 'Where the terms of a policy are susceptible, without violence, of two interpretations, that construction which is most favorable to the insured, in order to indemnify him against loss sustained, should be adopted:\u2019 Humphreys v. National Benefit Assn., 139 Pa. 264.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-5\">\u201cIn the present policy the word \u2018occupant\u2019 seems to be used to indicate actual possession or occupancy, and the word \u2018possession,\u2019 as used with the words \u2018interest\u2019 and \u2018title\u2019 in the clause in question, seems to mean legal possession, or possessory right, and, in accordance with the doctrine above quoted, these words should be so construed as to indemnify the insured against the loss sustained. . . . We do not find that there was any change in the possession except the physical occupancy of the premises, which is not forbidden by the term of the policy of insurance:\u201d McGinnis v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co., 38 Pa. Superior Ct. 390.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-6\">We regard the above quoted authority as decisive of the question now submitted; and therefore, the receiver having no possessory right, but being merely a caretaker, pending adjudication in bankruptcy, the plaintiff is entitled to judgment. The bankruptcy proceeding was involuntary on his part, and it is not material that he had knowledge of it, or that he waived the service of notices connected with its progress.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-7\">The decision here reached can hardly be said to work a hardship upon the defendant company. It is not deprived of any right or privileges contemplated at the time the policies were issued. It is not claimed that the hazard was increased. On the contrary, it seems to have been lessened, or at least the tendency was to lessen it. The occupancy of the insured was not disturbed, and both he and the receiver\u2019s watchman were on the premises at the time of the fire. What was said in this respect in Fuller v. New York Fire Insurance Co., 184 Mass. 12 (67 N. E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Repr. 879), namely: \u201cThe rights and obligations of the receiver tend to add to, and not diminish the care and oversight of the insured property, and could in no way increase the risk, or alter it to the detriment of the insurer,\u201d is quite applicable here, although in that case the assured had been adjudged a bankrupt and a receiver, who had been designated, had not qualified, nor had he taken actual possession. Later he did qualify, and still later, a trustee was appointed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-4\">In further support of the views here entertained are the cases of Fuller v. New York Fire Insurance Co., 184 Mass. 12, and Fuller v. Jameson, 98 N. Y. App. Div. 53 (90 N. Y. Supp. 456). As against them, the defendant cites, and confidently relies upon, a case entitled, In re Hamilton et al., decided by the United States district court in Arkansas, and reported in 102 Fed. Repr. 683. The policy of insurance there considered contained provisions respecting a change in the \u201cinterest, title or possession\u201d of the subject of insurance, similar to the provisions of these policies; and in the opinion of the court are certain dicta in which are expressed substantially the view taken by defendant here; namely, that possession of the receiver before adjudication in bankruptcy was such a change of possession as brought about a cancellation of the policy. But the policy, which was a renewal, was assigned by the assured to the receiver, with the written consent of the insurance company, and the question before the court was, whether a bank, which had received the original policy as a pledge for the payment of a debt by the assured, was entitled to claim the renewal as a continuation of the pledge under the terms of the original agreement with the assured. The point decided was that \u201cthe assignment of the policy to the receiver, with the consent of the company, operated as a new and substantive contract by which the rights of the bank, as pledgee, were terminated.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b67-5\">We do not regard this case as an authority upon the question presented here, but if we are mistaken in this re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>spect, it need only be said that the decisions of our own state are binding upon us.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-4\"><em>Error assigned </em>among others was the judgment of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Aav\"><em>William A.
