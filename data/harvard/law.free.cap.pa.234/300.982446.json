On motion for judgment for defendant non obstante veredicto. Haymaker, J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-10\">This is an action in ejectment for two lots of ground in the Fifth Ward of the City of Pittsburgh, being numbered 20 and 21 in Block 11 of the Plan of Lots of Elizabeth F. Denny, recorded in this County in Plan Book, Yol. 6, page 178, on which are erected seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>brick dwelling houses. On the trial of the case we directed a verdict for the Plaintiff:.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-5\">The common source of title was that of Andrew Mulholland, the Plaintiff\u2019s father. The statement of the case is practically this: Andrew Mulholland died intestate on the sixth day of September, 1884, leaving to survive him a widow, Margaret Mulholland, and one daughter, Mary E. George, the Plaintiff, whose husband is still living. The widow and daughter renounced their right to administer the estate, and administration was granted to strangers. The Administrators obtained proper authority to sell the lots in question at public sale for the payment of decedent\u2019s debts, and they were purchased by the widow, on August 29th, 1885, and the deed to her was acknowledged by the Administrators in open Court on November 14th, 1885.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-6\">The widow and her daughter resided continuously in one of these houses from the death of Andrew Mulholland, on September 6th, 1884, down to March 12th, 1895, when the widow died. The widow devised the property in question to her Executors in trust for various purposes, among which was the payment to the Plaintiff of $20.00 per month during her natural life, and in addition thereto $100 \u25a0 annually for clothing, with authority in their discretion to increase the amount of the monthly payments. The will likewise directs the Trustees to pay to decedent\u2019s brother, Joseph Sawyer, $25.00 per month during his natural life. The will also provides that the whole estate shall go to any child or children of the Plaintiff surviving her, subject-to the provision made for the brother. In case of the death of the daughter without a child or children surviving, the testatrix provides for the disposition of her estate in a manner unnecessary here to relate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-7\">The Plaintiff contends that, on the death of Andrew Mulholland intestate, she and her mother became co-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>tenants in common of the land described in the writ, and that when the widow purchased the same at an Orphans\u2019 Court sale for the payment of debts that relation of ownership previously existing was not thereby changed, and that the widow could not by her will dispose of the interest of her co-tenant, the Plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-4\">The contention on the part of the defense is that the Plaintiff accepted the provision made for her in her mother\u2019s will, and has regularly and without complaint received her monthly and annual payments for some ten years, and that having elected to so take she is now estopped to question her mother\u2019s title to the property. The Plaintiff\u2019s answer to the allegation of estoppel is that she was under the disability of coverture, and the doctrine of estoppel or election does not apply to her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-5\">The defense relies on the following undisputed facts: That the Administrators of Andrew Mulholland presented their petition to the Orphans\u2019 Court for leave to sell decedent\u2019s real estate for payment of debts aggregating over $19,000.00, and a citation was issued to the Plaintiff, then of full age; the purchase of the property by the widow and the confirmation of the sale by the Court; the exercise of entire ownership by the widow from the date of her deed of Novembr 14th, 1885, to the time of her death on March 12th, 1896; the probating of her mother\u2019s will on March 15th, 1895, whereby she disposes of the property in question; the acceptance by the Plaintiff of legacies given her by her mother\u2019s will, payable monthly and annually, which the Plaintiff received for a period of ten years; the payment by the Trustees under the will, for the same length of time, the sum of $25.00 per month to decedent\u2019s brother, with knowledge on the part of Plaintiff; Plaintiff\u2019s participation in the distribution of balance in hands of Executors on filing of their first account; the first and final account of the Trustees under the will of Plaintiff\u2019s mother, showing the payment of $3,516.01 to the Plaintiff from February 5th, 1897, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>March 19th, 1906, being the annuity provided for her in said will, and likewise showing payment of $3,102.50 to the other annuitant, of which Plaintiff had knowledge, and the presentation of a joint petition to the Orphans\u2019 Court by the Plaintiff and Joseph Sawyer, legatees under the will of Plaintiff\u2019s mother, to enforce payments due them under the provisions of said will, and the obtaining of the order and the enforcement of payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b331-5\">The evidence is uncontradicted that the Plaintiff not only accepted the annuity payable to her under her mother\u2019s will, for many years, and on one occasion employed counsel and enforced the provisions of the will in her favor in the Orphans\u2019 Court. She not only received her own annuities without protest, but had full knowledge of the payment of an annuity to her uncle during the same period of time. For all these years she recognized her mother\u2019s title to and ownership of the land in question, and this down to the time of bringing this action of ejectment. It also appears that her mother purchased the property for $2,350, subject to certain mortgages against the same, and that Plaintiff in no way endeavored to or did reimburse her mother in the purchase. There was an attempt on the part of the Plaintiff to show that her mother made certain declarations to the effect that the Plaintiff and her husband had contributed to the purchase of the property, but his evidence was so indefinite as not to be worthy of consideration. The Plaintiff saw her mother purchase this property at a public sale, and pay the purchase price; she saw her from the time of her purchase to the day of her death \u2014 some ten years\u2014 exercising every right of ownership over it; she saw her dispose of it by will, and she became a beneficiary thereunder, and enjoyed the fruits of that will for ten years. She enforced her rights as a legatee in and out of Court, down to the time of bringing this suit, having received $3,516.01, and now without proof of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>reimbursement for money paid by ber mother on the purchase of the property, and without the slightest offer to return to the estate the amount of the legacy she has been regularly receiving for ten years under her mother\u2019s will, she now claims the land as the heir at law of Andrew Mulholland, and that her unequivocal acts as legatee under her mother\u2019s will are not binding upon her by reason of coverture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-5\">We cannot agree with Plaintiff in her contention, and are of the opinion that under the undisputed facts of the case the Plaintiff is not entitled to recover, and that judgment should be entered for the Defendant non obstante veredicto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-6\">And now, July 10th, 1911, the rule for judgment non obstante veredicto is made absolute and judgment is now entered for Defendants on payment of verdict fee. The motion for a new trial is refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-7\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in entering judgment for defendant non obstante veredicto.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b332-8\"><em>Morton Hunter, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGK\">\u2014 Appellant was not estopped: Tompkins v.
