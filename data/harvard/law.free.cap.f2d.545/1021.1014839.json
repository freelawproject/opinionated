Citizens Casualty Company of New York et al., </em>5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1085-24\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1085-25\">Appellants were convicted for conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952(a) and 841(a)(1) and 846; and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Appellants contend that evidence introduced at trial was obtained in violation of Fourth Amendment protection, and that they were entrapped.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-26\">The appellants were arrested in a Miami motel room by five Drug Enforcement Administration agents. Incident to, and contemporaneous with, the arrest a suitcase containing $38,000 was seized and searched. Moments before its seizure, an agent had been told by a coconspirator/informant that currency was to be found in the suitcase. The currency was to be used to purchase cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-27\">The appellants do not contest the validity of the arrest, but contend that the search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>was extended beyond the lawful scope of a search incident to an arrest. Appellants place primary reliance upon <em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">In defining permissible scope the <em>Chimel </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1086-5\">\u201cThere is ample justification for a search of an arrestee\u2019s person and the area \u2018within his immediate control\u2019 \u2014 defining that phrase to mean the area from which he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\"><em>Chimel, </em>395 U.S. 752, 763, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 2040, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969). Appellants urge that the suitcase was not within their \u201cimmediate control\u201d as defined in <em>Chimel, </em>and that the search was thereby invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-7\">At the moment of arrest the suitcase was within the control of appellant French, as it was an arm\u2019s length from him. As the trial judge emphasized, this search is far removed from the general exploratory search that <em>Chimel </em>forbids.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-8\">The search of the suitcase was a search of an item in open view, within an arm\u2019s length of appellant French, connected with the offense for which the arrest was made. The seizing agent had probable cause to believe that the suitcase contained an instrumentality of the crime. The search is based on probable cause and falls within the \u201csearch incident to a lawful arrest\u201d exception to the warrant requirement. <em>Chimel, supra. </em>The search was in all respects proper.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-9\">The appellants also assert the defense of entrapment. This defense is without merit in this case.-</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-10\">The judgment of district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1086-12\">. In <em>Draper v. United States, </em>358 U.S. 307, 79 S.Ct. 329, 3 L.Ed.2d 327 (1959), the Supreme Court found that a warrantless search of a \u201czipper bag\u201d based on probable cause and incident to a lawful arrest was constitutional.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
