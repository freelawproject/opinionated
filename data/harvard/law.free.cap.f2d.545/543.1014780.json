Universal Underwriters Insurance Company had issued a stock floater policy which allowed Moultrie to report monthly changes in the value of parts and goods on hand. The value reporting clause allowed the insured thirty days after the last day of the month to report the value of covered property for the month just ended. Universal Underwriters adjusted the premiums according to the reported fluctuations in value, and the last reported value governed the amount of coverage in case of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-14\">Moultrie suffered a fire on January 17, 1975. It claimed that coverage was determined by its monthly report for December 1974, reflecting a covered value of $143,-426.50. Universal Underwriters claimed the loss was limited to the $74,533.36 value reflected in the November 1974 report. Moultrie claimed to have mailed its December 1974 report on January 16, one day before the fire. Universal Underwriters argued that this report with enlarged values was mailed hurriedly after the fire, perhaps on January 18. The December 1974 report was received on January 20, 1975; no postmark was preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-15\">The loss limitation clause confined liability to the amount \u201clast reported prior to the loss.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Universal Underwriters argued that \u201clast reported\u201d could only mean \u201creceived by the insurance company and on file in its office prior to the loss.\u201d Moultrie argued that a report placed in the mail prior to the loss was the \u201clast reported.\u201d The trial judge concluded that \u201clast reported,\u201d as used in the policy, was sufficiently ambiguous to require judicial interpretation. He then construed \u201clast reported\u201d to mean \u201cplaced in the mail prior to the loss\u201d and submitted to the jury the question of whether the December 1974 report was mailed before or after the fire on January 17, 1975. The jury resolved the question in plaintiff\u2019s favor, and recovery was based on the December 1974 report.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-16\">This diversity action is governed by Georgia law, and if a procedure existed for certifying the question of what \u201clast reported\u201d means to the Georgia courts, we would gladly do so and defer to their judgment. But as Georgia has no certification procedure, we must seek to unravel this question as the Georgia courts would interpret it.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-17\">After closely reading the value reporting clause, Paragraph 8, and the loss limitation clause, Paragraph 9, we must reverse the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the term \u201clast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>reported\u201d is ambiguous. Unless \u201clast reported\u201d in the loss limitation clause is interpreted to mean \u201clast filed,\u201d the term \u201creport\u201d means one thing in Paragraph 8 and another in Paragraph 9.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-4\">8. Value Reporting Clause. It is a condition of this supplemental policy that the insured <em>shall report to </em>this Company not later than thirty (80) days after the last day of each calendar month, the actual cash value of all property covered hereunder on the last day of each calendar month. Such reports of value are to include the values of any property insured hereunder which may be elsewhere than at locations specifically named on Pages 1 and 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">9. Loss Limitation Clause. Liability under this supplemental provision shall not in any case exceed the lesser of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">(a) That proportion of any loss hereunder, which the last value reported to this Company prior to the loss bears to the actual cash value of the property hereinbefore described on the date for which the report was made, provided further that,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">(b) if at the time of any loss the insured has failed <em>to file with this Company </em>reports of values as <em>required in Paragraph 8, </em>liability is limited to that proportion of the amount <em>last reported </em>\u2018 prior to the loss that the actual value at the loss location on date of the loss bears to the total actual value at all locations on date of loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">[emphasis added]. Paragraph 9(b) says that \u201creport\u201d as used in Paragraph 8 means \u201cfiled with this Company.\u201d We can see no reason not to interpret \u201clast reported\u201d as used in Paragraph 9(b) also to mean \u201cfiled with this Company.\u201d Otherwise, there is an inconsistency in the policy. The value reporting clause protects the insured from over-insuring by adjusting his premium as the value of stock increases or decreases. The loss limitation clause protects the insurer from incurring greater risk than has been paid for by limiting coverage to the last value relied upon to set premiums. Giving \u201creport\u201d a different meaning in each clause amounts to rewriting the contract in the name of ambiguity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This we cannot sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">Our grammatical analysis is bolstered by the policy considerations supporting this interpretation of \u201clast reported.\u201d Faced with a similar value reporting clause,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Louisiana courts have held that \u201creported\u201d is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>ambiguous as used and that a value is not \u201creported\u201d until it is received:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-4\">There is no ambiguity in the words \u201creported\u201d and \u201cfiled\u201d as used in the monthly reporting policy. The obvious and simple meanings found in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, Second-Edition, should suffice. \u201cReport\u201d or \u201creported\u201d there is defined as \u201cto give notification of.\u201d File means \u201cto deliver to the proper officer so that it is received by him to be kept on file among the records of his office.\u201d . . . The obvious import of the words \u201creported\u201d or \u201cfiled\u201d is that the intehded recipient of the document to be \u201cfiled\u201d or \u201creported\u201d actually receive the document. One does not report until the recipient receives \u201cnotification\u201d of the report; one has not filed until the recipient has received custody of the document.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">Thus, we conclude that the words \u201creported\u201d and \u201cfiled\u201d mean transmitted to, and delivered unto, the insurer, both by simple definition and in the necessary context in which such words are used in this \u201cmonthly reporting policy.\u201d Depositing in the mail prior to the loss does not constitute reporting to, or filing with the insured prior to the loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-7\"><em>Reilly-Benton Co., Inc. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., </em>278 So.2d 24, 28 (La.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Our court has previously interpreted Georgia law to require that monthly value changes in these fluctuating inventory policies be filed <em>before </em>the loss, despite the thirty-day grace period for filing a report for the month just ended. <em>Camilla Feed Mills, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co., </em>177 F.2d 746 (5th Cir. 1949). To interpret \u201creport\u201d to mean placed in the mail is to defeat the holding in <em>Camilla Feed Mills </em>by creating a capability in the insured to change values after a loss. The simple act of turning the date back on a postage meter and the decreasing incidence of legible postmarks, combined with the increasing unpredictability of mail delivery, would make it virtually impossible for an insurance company ever to determine whether a report was placed in the mail before or after a loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">We therefore reverse the district court and hold that an insurance notice is reported on the date it is received, not on the date it is mailed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The December 1974 monthly report was received on January 20, 1975, three days after the fire. This makes the November 1974 value the last one reported to Universal Underwriters before the fire, and according to the loss limitation set forth in Paragraph 9, Moultrie\u2019s recovery for its loss on January 17, 1975, is governed by the November 1974 values.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">REVERSED and REMANDED for entry of a judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-13\">. 9(b) [I]f at the time of any loss the insured has failed to file with this Company reports of value as required in Paragraph 8, liability is limited to that proportion of the amount last reported prior to the loss that the actual value at the loss location on date of the loss bears to the total actual value at all locations on date of loss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b609-11\">. The district court\u2019s definition of \u201creport\u201d rewrites the policy by removing the insurance company\u2019s protection against an insured who undervalues inventory to obtain low premiums and then inflates value after a loss to obtain a higher coverage than he has paid for. A review of Moultrie\u2019s monthly reports before and after the January 1974 fire illustrates the need for a definition of \u201creport\u201d that prevents changing reported values after a loss:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-12\">Date Total Value Reported</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXdg\">September 1974 $ 87,016.31</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Afj\">October 1974 71,495.11</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATG\">November 1974 74,533.86</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjE\">*December 1974 143,426.50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOF\">January 1975 24.000. 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYm\">February 1975 45.000. 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aty\">April 1975 45.000. 00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-19\">* This is the report Moultrie claims to have mailed the day before the fire. Universal Underwriters introduced evidence that a letter mailed the day after the fire could have reached its office on the same day the December 1974 report was received. To define report as depositing in the mail creates the opportunity for changing values after a loss, whether or not that happened in this instance, a matter on which we neither hold nor imply we hold any opinion whatever.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b609-21\">.
