The appellant claims there was not substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s decision. The district court below rejected appellant\u2019s contention. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-22\">Appellant claims that he was disabled by a heart attack. Despite substantial evidence to the contrary adduced by appellant\u2019s doctors, a specialist to whom the Administrative Law Judge referred appellant reported on the basis of a complete physical examination that appellant could perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>sedentary or light activity on a sustained basis and medium activity for short periods. The Administrative Law Judge found that although appellant could not return to his work in a shipyard, he retained the capacity to operate a liquor store he owned in which he had worked for short periods or to operate his barbershop.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">Appellant contends that the Administrative Law Judge improperly isolated one doctor\u2019s medical judgment while ignoring contrary medical testimony. He also argues that his activity at the liquor store cannot be considered substantial gainful activity because he had worked at the store only an hour or two a day since his heart attack. Similarly, he argues that his work at his barbershop was not substantial gainful activity because he earned only $300 to $400 a year from this part time work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-6\">Although it would be improper to isolate some doctor\u2019s findings instead of considering the record as a whole, this is not a case in which the Secretary\u2019s determination can only be explained by assuming he disregarded the medical evidence. <em>See Thorne v. Weinberger, </em>530 F.2d 580 (4th Cir. 1976). Our appellate function is not to weigh the evidence anew, but solely to determine whether there is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1427, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1970); <em>Gaultney v. Weinberger, </em>505 F.2d 943, 945 (5th Cir. 1974). Although we might have reached a different conclusion, we hold that there is substantial medical evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s determination. <em>See Entrekin v. Weinberger, </em>477 F.2d 561 (5th Cir. 1973); <em>Stillwell v. Cohen, </em>411 F.2d 574 (5th Cir. 1969) .</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-14\">There is evidence to show that appellant has retained the capacity to perform sedentary jobs not requiring arduous physical activity. The appellant\u2019s jobs as liquor store operator and barber constituted such sedentary activities, and we cannot say there was no reasonable basis for the conclusion that Dubose could still perform these jobs. Because the Administrative Law Judge concluded that Dubose could return to these previous occupations, the government had no burden to show that other suitable jobs existed. <em>See Gray </em>v. <em>Secretary of HEW, </em>421 F.2d 638 (5th Cir. 1970) . That Dubose was in fact working only intermittently at these jobs prior to this judgment does not mean that they could not constitute substantial gainful activity, as long as the medical evidence inde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>pendently suggests that Dubose could work at them on a sustained basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-4\">The appellant confuses the issue by relying on <em>Flemming v. Booker, </em>283 F.2d 321 (5th Cir. 1960), where this court said that evidence that a disability claimant had worked in a used car lot during that statutory period<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> did not preclude a finding of disability where those services had yielded the claimant less than $1,000 in yearly earnings and there was unanimous medical testimony of claimant\u2019s disability. In the case at bar, evidence of Dubose\u2019s previous occupations was not used to rebut unanimous medical evidence of a disability. Rather, it was used, once the Administrative Law Judge had made a credibility finding among conflicting medical testimony and had concluded that Dubose was able to perform certain work, to show that Dubose had performed such work in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-5\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1041-7\">.
