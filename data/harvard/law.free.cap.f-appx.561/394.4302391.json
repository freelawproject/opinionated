The district court sentenced Russell to 180 months in prison pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). As he did in the district court, Russell argues that his prior Texas conviction for burglary of a building was not a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and could not be used to support application of the ACCA enhancement in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i)-(ii) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4. We review \u201cthe district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the [ACCA] <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Harrimon, </em>568 F.3d 531, 533 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Russell concedes that he was convicted of burglary of a building, an offense that is a state jail felony and punishable by imprisonment for no more than two years and no less than 180 days. Texas Penal Code \u00a7 12.44(a) provides discretion, however, for a court to punish a defendant convicted of a state jail felony by imposing a sentence as if the offense were a Class A misdemeanor. Russell\u2019s sole argument is that because he was sentenced under \u00a7 12.44(a), his offense was not a felony because it was not punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year. In <em>Harrimon, </em>we held that a conviction was a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) because the offense\u2019s statutory maximum was two years in prison, even though the sentencing court exercised its discretion to allow the offense to be punished as a misdemeanor under \u00a7 12.44. <em>Harrimon, </em>568 F.3d at 533 n. 3. Russell\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED. The motion for an extension of time in which to file a brief is DENIED. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
