On appeal, Miranda argues that the BIA and IJ erred by determining that he was not eligible for relief of cancellation of removal because he did not establish that removal would result in an exceptional and extremely undue hardship to a qualifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>relative. He does not raise any arguments that challenge the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration. After careful review, we deny the petition in part, and dismiss it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">\u201cWe review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. \u201d Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006). We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>Assa\u2018ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). \u2018While we read briefs filed by <em>pro se </em>litigants liberally, issues not briefed on appeal by a <em>pro se </em>litigant are deemed abandoned[.]\u201d <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">First, we lack jurisdiction over Miranda\u2019s claim that the BIA and IJ erred by determining that he was not eligible for relief of cancellation of removal. The immigration statute makes clear that a petition to review a decision by the BIA must be filed with the Court of Appeals within 30 days of the final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). This deadline is mandatory and jurisdictional, and it is not subject to equitable tolling. <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005). The deadline is not tolled by a motion to reconsider. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">In this appeal, we do not have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s final order affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of relief because Miranda did not file the petition for review within 30 days of the BIA\u2019s final order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). The BIA\u2019s order was issued on April 11, 2013, and Miranda filed his petition for review on June 17, 2013. Miranda\u2019s motion for reconsideration did not toll the time limitation, and thus, we are without jurisdiction to review the final order of removal. <em>See Dakane, </em>399 F.3d at 1272 n. 3. Accordingly, we dismiss the petition so far as it seeks review of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">As for the BIA\u2019s denial of Miranda\u2019s motion for reconsideration, Miranda has not challenged this order on appeal. Even construing his brief liberally, we can find no arguments concerning this order and conclude that he has failed to brief the issue. As a result, he has abandoned the issue and we deny this part of the petition for review. <em>Timson, </em>518 F.3d at 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
