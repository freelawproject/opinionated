He also moves for the appointment of counsel and to correct the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-17\">This court must examine the basis for its jurisdiction on its own motion. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). In a civil case, a timely notice of appeal is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-23\">Sutton\u2019s notice of appeal, filed more than 30 days after the denial of his timely motion to alter and amend judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e), is untimely. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(a)(1)(A), (a)(4)(A). Thus, this court lacks jurisdiction over the instant appeal, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See Bowles, </em>551 U.S. at 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360. Sutton\u2019s motions for the appointment of counsel and to correct the record are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b431-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
