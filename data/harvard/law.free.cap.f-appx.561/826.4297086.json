Beasley pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine and other drugs. He then faced a sentence guideline range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>on his status as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. The district court sentenced him to 130 months in prison. Beasley contends that he now is eligible for a sentence reduction pursuant to Amendments 750 and 759 of the Sentencing Guidelines \u2014 which amended how quantities of drugs are calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 \u2014 notwithstanding the fact that his guideline range was determined based on the career offender provision in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Because these amendments did not alter Beasley\u2019s sentencing range, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">We review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) de novo. <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">\u201cAs a general rule, district courts may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed, except in specific circumstances delineated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c).\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th Cir.2008). Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the court is allowed to reduce a defendant\u2019s prison term if the defendant was \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1). However, \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) (providing that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction is not authorized if the amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-13\">Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines lowered some of the drug-quantity calculations used under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. But, Beasley\u2019s sentencing range was calculated under the career-offender guideline in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, Amendment 750 did not alter the sentencing range upon which his sentence was based, and \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-14\">For these reasons, the district court did not err in denying Beasley\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b851-7\">. Beasley contends the district court actually used the sentencing range under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1 because the court chose a downward departure from the sentencing range under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. We find no merit in this contention. The court chose a downward departure from the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 sentencing range. If the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1 sentencing range applied, the court's sentence would instead be an upward departure.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
