He asserts that the district court erroneously applied the guidelines sentencing enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(11)(C)(i) to determine his sentence. Agbor completed his term of imprisonment and was released by the Bureau of Prisons on December 31, 2013. He was not sentenced to a term of supervised release. Because he \u201chas completed the confinement portion of his sentence, any argument that the prison term should be reduced is moot.\u201d <em>United States v.
