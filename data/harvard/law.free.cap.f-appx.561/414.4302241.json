Saldana contends that the BIA and Immigration Judge, whose opinion was adopted by the BIA, employed the wrong standards of proof when considering his CAT claim and that his CAT claim should be considered on its merits using the correct legal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-20\">The argument as to the standards of review employed by the IJ and BIA was not raised before the BIA. The argument was not exhausted, and we lack jurisdiction to review it. <em>See Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 318 (5th Cir.2009). Because Saldana was convicted of an aggravated felony offense, we lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of his CAT claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-21\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b438-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
