United States, </em>567 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012), and the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA), Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372 (2010). After careful review, we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">Shaw was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute fifty grams or more of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) &amp; (b)(1)(A)(iii) and 846, and possession with intent to distribute fifty grams or more of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) <em>&amp; </em>(b)(1)(A)(iii). At his original sentencing, Shaw argued that the FSA, effective August 3, 2010, was applicable and that the jury\u2019s finding that he was responsible for fifty grams or more of crack only triggered the five-year mandatory minimum sentence under the FSA, which would be enhanced to a ten-year mandatory minimum under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 based on his prior felony drug conviction. The district court, however, found that the FSA did not apply and that the jury\u2019s finding that Shaw\u2019s crimes involved fifty grams or more of crack cocaine therefore triggered the ten-year mandatory minimum under the pre-FSA sentencing statute, enhanced to twenty years based on Shaw\u2019s prior conviction. The court sentenced Shaw to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">Shaw appealed his convictions and sentence. We affirmed his convictions but vacated his sentence and remanded for re-sentencing in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Dorsey, </em>567 U.S. at \u2014, 132 S.Ct. at 2335, that the FSA\u2019s lower mandatory m\u00ednimums apply to defendants whose crimes preceded the effective date of the FSA (August 3, 2010) but who were sentenced after that date. <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>482 Fed.Appx. 449, 453-54 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-15\">Prior to the FSA, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 provided that a defendant responsible for fifty grams or more of crack cocaine was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii) (2009). The same statute also provided that such a defendant who had a prior felony conviction for a drug offense was subject to an enhanced mandatory minimum sentence of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>The FSA then lowered the statutory mandatory minimums for crack-cocaine offenses. <em>Dorsey, </em>567 U.S. at \u2014, 132 S.Ct. at 2329. Pursuant to the FSA, a finding of 280 grams of crack cocaine, increased from the pre-FSA quantity of fifty grams, is required for the ten-year mandatory minimum to apply. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii) (2010). That ten-year mandatory minimum is enhanced to twenty years for a defendant with a prior felony drug conviction. <em>Id. </em>On the other hand, a finding of only twenty-eight grams or more of crack cocaine, increased from the pre-FSA five grams, subjects a defendant to a mandatory minimum of five years\u2019 imprisonment, enhanced to ten years if such a defendant has a prior felony drug conviction. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii). The FSA\u2019s lower mandatory m\u00ednimums apply to defendants, like Shaw, .who committed offenses involving crack cocaine before August 3, 2010 but who were sentenced after that date. <em>Dorsey, </em>567 U.S.\u2014, 132 S.Ct. at 2335.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-17\">At Shaw\u2019s re-sentencing, the district court applied the FSA but imposed the same sentence. Although Shaw was convicted of crimes involving \u201c50 grams or more\u201d of crack cocaine, as that was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>quantity charged in the pre-FSA superseding indictment, the district court adopted the Presentence Investigation Report\u2019s (PSI\u2019s) finding that Shaw was responsible for 5896.8 grams of crack. Noting that defense counsel at the original sentencing concurred with a calculation of well over 5000 grams of crack cocaine, the district court imposed the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence applicable to defendants convicted of crimes involving at least 280 grams of crack, which the court enhanced to a twenty-year sentence based on Shaw\u2019s prior conviction. Accordingly, the district court again sentenced Shaw to 240 months\u2019 imprisonment, from which Shaw now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">On appeal, Shaw argues that the district court erred in sentencing him pursuant to the mandatory minimum of ten years\u2019 imprisonment based on the court\u2019s finding that Shaw\u2019s crimes involved more than 280 grams of crack cocaine when the jury only convicted him of crimes involving fifty grams or more. Shaw cites <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), to argue that the Sixth Amendment requires a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt any fact that triggers a mandatory minimum sentence <em>(ie., </em>that the jury here was required to find that Shaw\u2019s crimes involved 280 grams or more of crack cocaine for the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence to be applicable).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. Two years later, the Supreme Court in <em>Harris v. United States </em>drew a distinction between facts increasing a defendant\u2019s minimum sentence and those increasing his maximum sentence, holding that only the latter need be charged in the indictment, submitted to the jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. 536 U.S. 545, 565-66, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 2418-19, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002), <em>overruled by Alleyne, </em>570 U.S. at \u2014, 133 S.Ct. at 2155. The Court thereby expressly declined to extend <em>Appren-di </em>\u2019s holding to facts that increase a mandatory minimum sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 566-67, 122 S.Ct. at 2421.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\">Recently, in <em>Alleyne, </em>the Supreme Court found that the distinction between facts increasing a defendant\u2019s mandatory maximum sentence and those increasing his mandatory minimum sentence was inconsistent with <em>Apprendi. </em>570 U.S. at \u2014, 133 S.Ct. at 2155. Consequently, the Court overruled <em>Harris </em>and held that any fact that increases the mandatory minimum sentence constitutes an element of the offense and must be submitted to the jury. <em>Id. </em>The Court then concluded that the district court in that case violated the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights by increasing the mandatory minimum sentence based on the judge\u2019s finding, rather than the jury\u2019s, that the defendant brandished a firearm. <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 133 S.Ct. at 2163-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-15\">Here, Shaw argues that the district court erred under <em>Alleyne </em>when it imposed the ten-year mandatory minimum based on the court\u2019s finding that Shaw\u2019s crimes involved over 280 grams of crack cocaine. He argues that the mandatory minimum could not be imposed because the jury only convicted him of crimes involving fifty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>grams or more of crack. After careful review, we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Because <em>Alleyne </em>represents an extension of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have held that the same framework for review applies. <em>United States v. McKinley, </em>732 F.3d 1291, 1295 (11th Cir.2013). To preserve an <em>Apprendi </em>error, and by extension an <em>Alleyne </em>error, for review, a defendant must make a timely constitutional objection in the district court. <em>Id.; United States v. Candelario, </em>240 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2001). The failure to make such an objection results in this Court\u2019s application of plain error review. <em>McKinley, </em>732 F.3d at 1296.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">A defendant may raise a constitutional objection by invoking <em>Apprendi </em>or <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 243 n. 6, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 1224 n. 6, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), by contending that the issue of drug quantity should go to the jury, or by arguing that an element of the offense was not proved, that the judge cannot determine drug quantity, or that the quantity must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Candelario, </em>240 F.3d at 1304. A defendant\u2019s objection to the quantity of drugs alone, however, is not sufficient to preserve an <em>Apprendi-type </em>error. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, a constitutional objection is timely if a defendant makes the objection at sentencing or any time prior thereto. <em>Id. </em>at 1304, 1305. If a defendant makes a timely constitutional objection, we review <em>de novo </em>the preserved <em>Apprendi </em>or <em>Alleyne </em>error. <em>Id. </em>at 1306.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">If we find an <em>Apprendi </em>or <em>Alleyne </em>violation upon <em>de novo </em>review, such a violation is subject to the harmless error rule, meaning that the error must be disregarded as not affecting substantial rights if it is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 1307. A constitutional error is harmless if it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the verdict. <em>Id. </em>In reviewing an <em>Apprendi </em>or <em>Alleyne </em>error, we look to whether the omitted element \u2014 here, the 280-gram quantity of crack cocaine that would trigger the ten-year mandatory minimum \u2014 is supported by uncontroverted evidence and also whether the record contains evidence that could rationally lead to a contrary finding. <em>Id. </em>at 1308.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">Here, Shaw preserved any <em>Alleyne </em>error for review when he argued at sentencing (1) that the FSA required the jury to find him guilty of crimes involving 280 grams or more of crack cocaine for the ten-year mandatory minimum <em>to </em>be applicable and (2) that he was only charged with and convicted of crimes involving fifty grams or more and thus could not be subject to the ten-year mandatory minimum. We therefore review his <em>Alleyne </em>claim <em>de novo </em>and apply the harmless error rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">Although we find that the district court erred under <em>Alleyne </em>in imposing the ten-year mandatory minimum based on the court\u2019s judicial finding of a quantity of crack cocaine not found by the jury, we conclude that such error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-12\">The government concedes that the district court erred under <em>Alleyne </em>when it imposed the mandatory minimum sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment, enhanced to twenty years due to Shaw\u2019s prior conviction, based on the court\u2019s finding that Shaw\u2019s crimes involved 280 grams or more of crack. The government, however, argues that such an error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because Shaw conceded that his crimes involved well over 280 grams of crack. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-13\">An <em>Alleyne </em>error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if the omitted element <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>triggering the mandatory minimum sentence is supported by uncontroverted evidence and if the record does not contain evidence that would rationally lead to a contrary finding. <em>See Candelario, </em>240 F.3d at 1308 (listing those factors to be considered by a court reviewing an <em>Apprendi </em>error). Here, uncontroverted evidence in the record demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that Shaw\u2019s crimes involved over 280 grams of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">The trial testimony of one of Shaw\u2019s buyers established that Shaw\u2019s crimes involved thousands of grams of crack cocaine over a period of four years. Based on that testimony, the PSI found Shaw responsible for 5896.8 grams of crack. Importantly, in objecting to the offense level computation in the PSI, Shaw argued only that he should be held accountable for 4070 grams of crack, instead of 5896.8 grams, based on the buyer\u2019s testimony. Shaw also maintained in his sentencing memorandum that the testimony gave rise to a calculation of 4243.2 grams of crack. Similarly, in his sentencing memorandum on remand, Shaw argued that a five-year mandatory minimum was applicable under the FSA, as the jury only convicted him of crimes involving fifty grams or more of crack, but he conceded that the buyer\u2019s testimony demonstrated that Shaw\u2019s offenses involved over 1900 grams of crack.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">In addition, defense counsel concurred at the original sentencing with the prosecutor\u2019s calculation of 5796 grams. Shaw argues on appeal that his counsel\u2019s concurrence was only to the offense level, and not to the drug quantity, but that argument is contradicted by a plain reading of the hearing transcript. In any event, even if we disregard defense counsel\u2019s concession at the original sentencing, the record nevertheless demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that Shaw repeatedly conceded to a crack-cocaine quantity of well over 280 grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">Moreover, although Shaw argues that the jury could have found that he was guilty of crimes involving more than fifty but less than 280 grams of crack by rejecting the testimony of Shaw\u2019s buyer, the evidence in the record could not rationally lead to such a finding, especially considering Shaw\u2019s own concessions as to quantity. Thus, we find that the uncontroverted evidence in the record supports a finding that Shaw\u2019s crimes involved well over 280 grams of crack and that the district court\u2019s <em>Alleyne </em>error in imposing the ten-year mandatory minimum despite the lack of a jury finding to that effect was therefore harmless. Accordingly, we affirm Shaw\u2019s 240-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-9\">. The Supreme Court had not yet decided <em>Alleyne </em>at the time Shaw filed his initial brief, but he nevertheless raises the <em>Alleyne </em>objection specifically to preserve the issue for review on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
