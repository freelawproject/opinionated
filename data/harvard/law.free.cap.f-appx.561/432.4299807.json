He was sentenced, <em>inter alia, </em>to 480 months\u2019 imprisonment, below the advisory Sentencing Guidelines sentencing range of 595-600 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, he contends: the district court erred by denying his motion for substitution of counsel; his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the court failed to adequately explain it; and his sentence was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">\u201cUnless a Sixth Amendment violation is shown, whether to appoint a different lawyer for an indigent criminal defendant who expresses dissatisfaction with his court-appointed counsel is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Young, </em>482 F.2d 993, 995 (5th Cir.1973). The refusal to appoint new counsel is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>E.g., United States v. Mitchell, </em>709 F.3d 436, 441 (5th Cir.2013). Along that line, \u201cthe defendant must show good cause, such as a conflict of interest, a complete breakdown in communication or an irreconcilable conflict which leads to an apparently unjust verdict\u201d. <em>Young, </em>482 F.2d at 995 (citations omitted). \u201cA showing that appellant\u2019s appointed attorney had disclosed confidential defense matters to the prosecutor which would damage the defense would have amounted to \u2018good cause\u2019 for not proceeding to trial with the same counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). As noted, betrayal of trust by an attorney <em>may </em>serve as good cause if it results in \u201cirreconcilable conflict\u201d or a complete \u201cbreakdown in communication\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 995-96. However, district courts \u201cmust be vigilant that requests for appointment of a new attorney on the eve of trial should not become a vehicle for achieving delay\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 996 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">Elam\u2019s counsel, without Elam\u2019s knowledge or consent, and in connection with the prosecution, helped arrange a telephone call to Elam from his brother, who assured defense counsel he could convince Elam to accept a plea agreement. Elam\u2019s brother was attempting to cooperate with the authorities to obtain a reduction in his own sentence. As Elam and his brother both were in jail, the call was recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-13\">Elam contends his counsel\u2019s actions precluded the use of an, even-now, unexplained defense, which evidently was based on the identification of Elam\u2019s voice. The Government, however, stated at the hearing on Elam\u2019s substitution-of-counsel motion that it would not use the recording of the telephone call as evidence. Moreover, after the district court had granted eight continuances, the <em>pro se </em>motion for substitution of counsel was filed as trial drew near, and the hearing on the motion was held the day trial began. Under these circumstances, Elam has failed to show the denial of the substitution-of-counsel motion constituted a violation of the Sixth Amendment or was an abuse of discretion. <em>See Mitchell, </em>709 F.3d at 441-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Although post <em>-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the Guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). Because Elam did not object at his sentencing hearing to the procedural or substantive reasonableness of his sentence, his challenges are reviewed only for plain error. <em>E.g., United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009). Under that standard, Elam must show a plain (clear or obvious) forfeited error that affected his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he shows such reversible plain error, we have the discretion to correct the error, but should do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court heard Elam\u2019s reasons for a 360-month sentence and the Government\u2019s reasons for one within the 595-600 month advisory Guidelines sentencing range. In imposing a below-Guidelines sentence of 480-months\u2019 imprisonment, the district court implicitly determined the Guidelines range provided too high a sentence and Elam sought too low a sentence. Moreover, the district court considered the sentencing factors, provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and the advisory Sentencing Guidelines. The explanation for the sentence was adequate to allow for review. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586. Accordingly, Elam has failed to show a clear or obvious error as to the procedural reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The 360-month sentence requested by Elam was the minimum aggregate sentence required by law for his two convictions of using, carrying, or possessing a firearm during and in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i) (five-year minimum on first offense), (c)(l)(C)(i) (twenty-five-year minimum on second offense), (c)(1)(D)(ii) (consecutive-sentence requirement). Elam oversaw a significant drug-distribution operation involving hydrocodone pills. The operation used several houses for its transactions, and the jury found his offenses involved 5,178 hydrocodone pills and 7,241 grams of marijuana. The consecutive, 120-month sentence imposed for the remaining offenses adequately reflected the seriousness of Elam\u2019s criminal conduct. Elam has not shown that the district court failed to account for a relevant factor, gave too much weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or made a clear error in judgment as to balancing the sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006). Again, Elam has failed to show a clear or obvious error as to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b457-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
