In 1986, Appellant, who had been convicted of murdering a Mississippi Highway Patrolman and was serving a life sentence, filed a civil rights complaint asserting that MDOC had confined him for six months without due process. In 1988, the parties reached a settlement. Appellant contends that he agreed to dismiss his case in exchange for MDOC\u2019s agreement to place him in \u201cA\u201d custody, the least restrictive confinement. Appellant remained in \u201cA\u201d custody until 2011, when he was downgraded to \u201cB\u201d custody. Shortly thereafter, Appellant filed a motion seeking enforcement of the settlement agreement. The district court denied Appellant\u2019s motion. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Appellant challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion that MDOC reasonably complied with the 1988 settlement agreement by affording him \u201cA\u201d custody for 23 years. Appellant, however, has not submitted a copy of the settlement agreement, and neither MDOC nor the district court that presided over Appellant\u2019s 1986 civil rights case remain in possession of the agreement. Under the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, Appellant bears the burden of submitting evidence relevant to a challenged conclusion or finding. Fed. R.App. P. 10(b)(2). Appellant has failed to meet this burden. Accordingly, the denial of Appellant\u2019s motion is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
