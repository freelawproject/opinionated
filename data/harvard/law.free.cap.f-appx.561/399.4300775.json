Ms. Ashcraft filed a suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against the Appellees, claiming that they targeted her for harassment in retaliation for her outspoken opposition to then Mayor Winfield. The district court granted the Appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment, finding that Ms. Ashcraft had not established a violation of her constitutional rights. Ms. Ashcraft timely appealed the district court\u2019s judgment, arguing that the Appellees violated her First and Fourth Amendment rights when Mayor Winfield allegedly directed Deputy Chief Dolan to ticket Ms. Ashcraft for having an illegal out-of-state tag on her vehicle and when Deputy Chief Dolan subsequently conducted a traffic stop and issued two tickets to Ms. Ashcraft for her out-of-state driver\u2019s license and vehicle tag. Ms. Ash-craft also asserts that the City of Vicksburg is vicariously liable for Mayor Win-field\u2019s retaliatory conduct, given his status as a city \u201cpolicy-maker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-17\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de </em>novo, applying the same standard as the district court. <em>DePree v. Saunders, </em>588 F.3d 282, 286 (5th Cir.2009). Deputy Chief Dolan and Mayor Winfield seek qualified immunity on Ms. Ashcraft\u2019s claims against them in their individual capacities. Qualified immunity protects public officials from \u201cundue interference\u201d and \u201cpotentially disabling threats of liability,\u201d <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 806, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982), \u201cunless their conduct violates a clearly established constitutional right,\u201d <em>Brumfield v. Hollins, </em>551 F.3d 322, 326 (5th Cir.2008). Thus, in order for a plaintiff to abrogate a public official\u2019s right to qualified immunity on summary judgment, the plaintiff must demonstrate that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the official violated a clearly established constitutional right and show that the official\u2019s conduct was objectively unreasonable in light of clearly established law at the time of the incident. <em>Brumfield v. Hollins, </em>551 F.3d 322, 326 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-18\">Chief Deputy Dolan is entitled to qualified immunity on Ms. Ashcraft\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim because she has failed to demonstrate that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he violated her constitutional right when he conducted a traffic stop based on the out-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>of-state tag on Ms. Ashcraft\u2019s vehicle. Mississippi law requires every state resident who operates a vehicle on Mississippi roads to have a valid Mississippi driver\u2019s license and vehicle tag. <em>See </em>Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 27-19-68, 27-19-181, 63-1-5, 63-1-7. Though Ms. Ashcraft claims to have been a resident of Pensacola, Florida, at the time of the traffic stop, Chief Deputy Dolan presented evidence that Ms. Ash-craft appeared to be a resident of Vicksburg: Ms. Ashcraft operated a business in Vicksburg; her business had been featured in the Vicksburg local paper; Chief Deputy Dolan had received a letter from an anonymous citizen complaining about Ms. Ashcraft and referencing her residence as being in Vicksburg; and he had personally seen her appear before the Vicksburg city board to complain about local issues. Although Ms. Ashcraft was ultimately found not guilty of the charges against her for having an illegal out-of-state driver\u2019s license and illegal out-of-state tag, it is apparent from the evidence presented for summary judgment that at the time of the traffic stop Chief Deputy Dolan had \u201ca reasonable and articulable suspicion\u201d that Ms. Ashcraft was operating her vehicle on Mississippi roads in violation of state law. <em>See United States v. Jenson, </em>462 F.3d 399, 403 (5th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). In sum, Chief Deputy Dolan did not violate Ms. Ashcraft\u2019s Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure because he conducted a valid <em>Terry </em>stop based on his reasonable suspicion that Ms. Ashcraft was a Mississippi resident continuing to drive with an out-of-state driver\u2019s license and out-of-state vehicle tag in violation of state law. Furthermore, we are hard-pressed to find that Chief Deputy Dolan\u2019s alleged misconduct violated Ms. Ashcraft\u2019s First Amendment rights because Ms. Ash-craft has not demonstrated that she had a clearly established \u201cright\u201d to be free from a retaliatory arrest that was otherwise supported by probable cause. <em>See Reichle v. Howards, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2088, 2093, 182 L.Ed.2d 985, 80 U.S.L.W. 4405 (2012) (holding that a \u201cFirst Amendment right to be free from a retaliatory arrest that is supported by probable cause\u201d has never been a clearly established right).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Likewise, Mayor Winfield is entitled to qualified immunity on Ms. Ashcraft\u2019s constitutional claims because she has not demonstrated that her traffic stop, for which she blames Mayor Winfield, was constitutionally invalid. To the extent that Mayor Winfield did issue a retaliatory directive for Chief Deputy Dolan to ticket Ms. Ash-craft, Ms. Ashcraft has failed to demonstrate that Chief Deputy Dolan was not legally justified in executing the subsequent traffic stop for her out-of-state vehicle tag. Mayor Winfield\u2019s alleged conduct, without a resulting violation of Ms. Ash-craft\u2019s constitutional rights, does not abrogate his qualified immunity under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">Lastly, because we find that Chief Deputy Dolan\u2019s traffic stop was valid and that neither his actions nor those of Mayor Winfield violated Ms. Ashcraft\u2019s constitutional rights, the City of Vicksburg cannot be held vicariously liable under \u00a7 1983 for Ms. Ashcraft\u2019s alleged injury. <em>See Doe ex rel. Magee v. Covington Cnty. Sch. Dist. ex rel. Keys, </em>675 F.3d 849, 866-67 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
