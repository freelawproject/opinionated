The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the findings of the immigration judge that Patel\u2019s accounts of past persecution were not credible and that he had failed to establish that he was likely to be tortured if he returned to India. We deny Patel\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">Patel abandoned any challenge he might have made to the denial of his application for asylum. The immigration judge found Patel not credible based on his different accounts of persecution in his statements to border patrol agents and asylum officers, in his application, and in his testimony. Patel contested the adverse credibility ruling in his appeal to the Board, where he argued that he was \u201cconfused by many of the questions he was asked\u201d about the inconsistencies, but in his petition, Patel focuses exclusively on the merits of his requests for asylum and withholding of removal. Patel abandoned his challenge to the adverse credibility ruling. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cWhen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">Substantial evidence supports the finding that Patel is unlikely to be tortured if he returns to India. The record is bereft of evidence that Patel would likely be tortured. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). Patel argues that he is entitled to relief based on information in his declaration, but we cannot consider a document that Patel prepared after the Board dismissed his appeal. We are required to \u201cdecide the petition only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">We DENY Patel\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
