On September 1, 2001, Jabbie filed an I-589 application for asylum and withholding of removal on the ground that he had been persecuted on account of race, religion, and nationality by the Revolutionary United Front (\u201cRUF\u201d) rebels in Sierra Leon, who had killed both of his parents and his fourteen-year-old sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-14\">After filing his 1-589 application, Jabbie was twice interviewed by an asylum officer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The officer found Jabbie\u2019s testimony not credible in material respects \u2014 given the inconsistencies in what he stated in his 1-589 application and in what he said to the officer during the interviews \u2014 and therefore concluded that Jabbie had failed to show that he was a refugee and thus eligible for asylum. The asylum officer then referred Jabbie\u2019s case to Immigration Court, explaining, in his Assessment to Refer, why he concluded that Jabbie had not established eligibility for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-15\">The IJ heard Jabbie\u2019s application on August 27, 2007, and again in August 20, 2010.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the conclusion of the August 20 hearing (the hearing relevant here), the IJ found Jabbie\u2019s testimony not credible\u2014 that his testimony was plainly inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>with what he stated in his 1-589 application and then to the asylum officer in the asylum interviews \u2014 and for that reason denied his application and ordered his removal. Jabbie appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA, and, on June 17, 2013, the BIA dismissed his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">In his brief to this court, Jabbie argues that the BIA erred in relying on the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination in dismissing his appeal. He also argues that the IJ erred in finding that he failed to establish that the <em>RUF </em>had persecuted him on a protected ground, that he failed to show a well-founded fear of future persecution, and that he failed to meet his burden of proof for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Our review focuses on the IJ\u2019s credibility finding. Since the BIA based its decision to dismiss Jabbie\u2019s appeal on the IJ\u2019s credibility finding, we review the IJ\u2019s finding. <em>Id. </em>Where, as here, the BIA declines to address the IJ\u2019s alternative ground for his decision, the alternative ground is not before us for review; thus, we do not consider it. <em>See Martinez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1219, 1220 n. 2 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">We review a factual finding, including credibility determination, under the substantial evidence test. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). Under that test, we must accept the finding if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). Moreover, the record evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the Attorney General\u2019s (or the Secretary of Homeland Security\u2019s) decision and all inferences are drawn in favor of the finding at issue. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc). Thus, \u201c[t]o reverse a factual finding ... [we] must find not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but that it compels one.\u201d <em>Farquharson v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>246 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir.2001). That evidence in the record may also support a finding contrary to the Attorney General\u2019s is not enough to justify a reversal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">The applicant carries the burden of showing eligibility for relief and must present evidence that is reliable, that is \u201ccredible.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287 (quotation omitted). \u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006). Once the factfinder, here the IJ, has made an adverse credibility finding, the applicant, to obtain relief, bears the burden of showing that the finding was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">The Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum to an alien who meets the definition of a refugee. INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(A); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). The INA defines a refugee as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-10\">any person who is outside of any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). An asylum applicant must establish eligibility by \u201coffering credible, direct, and specific evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. To establish eligibility for asylum, an appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>cant may satisfy his burden of proof in either of two ways. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1230-81. First, he may show that he was persecuted in the past in his home country on a protected ground, which gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of future persecution. <em>Id. </em>Second, he may meet his burden by establishing that he has a well-founded fear, meaning the fear is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable, that he will be persecuted in the future on account of a protected ground. <em>Id. </em>at 1231. \u201c[A]n adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application\u201d where there is no other evidence of persecution. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. \u201cIf, however, the applicant produces other evidence of persecution, whatever form it may take, the IJ must consider that evidence, and it is not sufficient for the IJ to rely solely on an adverse credibility determination in those instances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">An applicant is entitled to withholding of removal under the INA if he can show that, if removed, his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). The burden of proof for withholding of removal, however, is \u201cmore likely than not,\u201d and is thus \u201cmore stringent\u201d than the standard for obtaining asylum relief. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The IJ found that Jabbie\u2019s testimony was not credible and thus failed to establish his asylum claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Jabbie\u2019s argues that the finding was not supported by specific, cogent reasons. We are not persuaded. In light of the numerous and material inconsistencies in Jabbie\u2019s 1-589 application, his interviews with the asylum officer, and his testimony before the I J, the IJ was more than justified in refusing to accept his testimony as credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">Critically, Jabbie\u2019s story differed as to whether his family members were killed during one RUF attack in September 1999 or during two separate RUF attacks, one in September 1999 and another January 2000. Jabbie indicated in his 1-589 application that his father was killed in September 1999 and that his mother and sister were lolled in January 2000. Then, in his first interview with the asylum officer, he testified that they were all killed during the September 1999 attack. In his second interview with the officer, and later in his testimony before the IJ, he said that the deaths occurred during two separate attacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">In reaching his adverse credibility finding, the IJ relied on other glaring inconsistencies that Jabbie was unable to explain. For example, Jabbie indicated that he was imprisoned directly after the RUF\u2019s attack on his mother and sister in January 2000, and that the imprisonment lasted three months, until his release in April 2000. This three-months\u2019 imprisonment could be so only if his mother and sister were killed in the January 2000 attack. Otherwise, when he said that they were killed (along with his father) during the September 1999 attack, the episodes become mutually exclusive. That is, as the IJ discussed, Jab-bie, during the asylum interview, \u201cwas unable to resolve the internal inconsistency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>with his statements that (1) he was in captivity for three months and (2) he was in captivity from September of 1999 until April of 2000.\u201d A.R. at 54. The IJ properly found that his explanation that this was a \u201cminor discrepancy\u201d was unpersuasive. A.R. at 3-4, 26-27. <em>See also D-Muhumed v. U.S. Atty. Gen. </em>388 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2004) (discussing implausible testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Jabbie also gave inconsistent testimony as to how and when he applied for, and received, his passport. Not only were these versions of the passport procurement completely different, but he was unable to offer a reasonable explanation for the discrepancy. During his July 14, 2004, interview with the asylum officer, Jabbie testified that he applied for and received the passport in Sierra Leone. But during the August 27, 2004, interview, he said he applied for the passport while in Sierra Leone, but did not receive it until after he had entered the United States. Confronted with the discrepancy, he told the officer that he was simply \u201cnervous,\u201d which the officer found to be an unreasonable explanation. Moreover, during his hearing before the IJ, Jabbie testified that David (his father\u2019s friend) made \u201csome document for\u201d him and that it was a passport, but claimed that he never even saw the document. When confronted with his statement in the interview that he had applied for and received his passport while he was still in Sierra Leone, Jabbie said that he had applied for it, but had not received it before his departure, and that David ultimately received his passport for him. When confronted with the fact that he had told the asylum officer that he had received it before leaving Sierra Leone, he simply said, \u201cthat\u2019s not my testimony,\u201d but did not try to explain the discrepancy. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Jabbie\u2019s argument that the inconsistencies the IJ found do not go to the heart of his application is unavailing. Inconsistencies such as when Jabbie\u2019s family was killed and how long he was held captive go to the heart of his claim for asylum and withholding of removal. His argument that the discrepancies are minor and easily explained by the trauma of the attacks and his captivity is also unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">In sum, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding and thus the BIA\u2019s dismissal of Jabbie\u2019s appeal. Given this conclusion, it follows that substantial evidence supports the denial of Jabbie\u2019s claims for asylum and withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b855-11\">. Jabbie also applied for protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\"CAT\u201d), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). At the conclusion of the hearing on his application, the IJ denied relief, and the BIA, on appeal, affirmed. In his petition for review, Jabbie challenges the BIA\u2019s CAT ruling. He has abandoned the challenge, however, by not providing argument on the ruling in his brief to this court. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). We therefore make no further mention of Jabbie\u2019s application for CAT relief in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b855-12\">. Jabbie was interviewed on July 14 and August 27, 2004. Jabbie\u2019s interpreter during these interviews was an individual named Souleymane Camara, who was subsequently indicted and expected to plead guilty to more than 100 counts of conspiracy and asylum fraud for his role in a scheme to help West Africans stay in the United States. A.R. at 540-543. The Government placed the judgment in his case in the record. A.R. at 458. Neither the IJ nor the BIA relied on Jabbie\u2019s association with Soulaymane Camara in finding Jabbie's testimony not credible. A.R. at 55 n. 1. Nor do we in disposing of Jabbie\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b855-17\">.At the conclusion of the August 27, 2007, hearing, the IJ issued an oral decision in which he found Jabbie not credible and denied his application. Jabbie appealed the decision to the BIA. On May 12, 2008, the BIA returned the case to the IJ because the transcript of the August 27 hearing was incomplete and thus unreviewable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b857-6\">. The IJ found in the alternative that Jabbie failed to meet his burden of showing past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of a protected ground. The BIA did not address these alternative grounds for denying relief. We therefore do not reach them. <em>See Martinez v. U.S. Atty Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1219, 1220 n. 2 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009) (reviewing the BIA decision as the final agency decision, and reviewing the IJ decision to the extent the BIA approved it.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
