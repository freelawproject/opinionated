The court denied the motion because the case was closed and on appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-17\">\u201c[T]he filing of a valid notice of appeal from a final order of the district court divests that court of jurisdiction to act on the matters involved in the appeal, except to aid the appeal, correct clerical errors, or enforce its judgment\u201d. <em>Ross v. Marshall, </em>426 F.3d 745, 751 (5th Cir.2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). McCoy filed his motion to recuse after filing notices of appeal from the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition and the denial of his motion filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). Accordingly, the district court lacked jurisdiction to rule on the recusal motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b456-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
