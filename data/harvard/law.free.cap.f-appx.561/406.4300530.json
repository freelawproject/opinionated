They argue that the IJ abused his discretion in denying the continuance requested by their newly retained counsel without considering the obvious deficiency in the performance of prior counsel and that this abuse of discretion tainted his credibility finding. This is the sole issue for appeal, as Xu and Zhang do not challenge any other findings or conclusions made by the IJ and affirmed by the BIA. Accordingly Xu and Zhang have abandoned any other claims of error. <em>See Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-21\">With respect to the argument that the IJ abused his discretion by failing to consider prior counsel\u2019s deficient performance in denying the motion to continue the hearing scheduled for March 8, 2011, the BIA was not afforded an opportunity to address the issue because Xu and Zhang did not include any reference to the failure to consider counsel\u2019s performance in the brief submitted to the BIA. <em>See Claudio v. Holder, </em>601 F.3d 316, 319 (5th Cir.2010). Accordingly, Xu and Zhang failed to exhaust their administrative remedies as to this issue, and we lack jurisdiction to consider it in the instant petition. <em>See Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 321 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-22\">The petition for review is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b430-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
