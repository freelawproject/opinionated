He now requests leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, in which he sought a sentence reduction pursuant to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (FSA) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines. By moving to proceed IFP, Lister challenges the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, 117 F.3d 197, </em>202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The Government has filed a motion to summarily dismiss this appeal due to Lister\u2019s failure to file a timely notice of appeal or, in the alternative, to summarily affirm the district court\u2019s order or, in the further alternative, to grant it a 30-day extension to file an appellate brief. The district court\u2019s order denying \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief was entered on July 9, 2013. Lister\u2019s notice of appeal, dated August 25, 2013, was not only untimely but also beyond the time during which the district court could have extended the time for filing a notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A)(i), (b)(4). Although Rule 4(b) is not jurisdictional, a defendant may not have his untimeliness disregarded when the Government objects. <em>Eberhart v. United States, </em>546 U.S. 12, 18, 126 S.Ct. 403, 163 L.Ed.2d 14 (2005); <em>United States v. Garcia-Cabrera, </em>472 Fed.Appx. 340, 341 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary dismissal is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as untimely. The Government\u2019s alternative motions for summary affirmance and an extension of time to file a brief are DENIED. Lister\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b439-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
