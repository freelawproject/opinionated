For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-19\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b452-20\">On June 18, 2012, Plaintiff-Appellant John David Moore filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint in federal court against Defendants-Appel-lees Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cCCA\u201d), the CCA\u2019s nine sitting judges, the Denton County Commissioner\u2019s Court (\u201cDCCC\u201d), and the DCCC\u2019s County Judge and four commissioners.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his corn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>plaint, Moore alleged that the defendants<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> violated his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment by not reviewing his petition for writs of habeas corpus and prohibition. He asserted that the CCA had a \u201cpolicy, practice and procedure that clearly denied Plaintiff ... a fair and impartial review of his State habeas application ... and Writ of Prohibition\u201d in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. He asserted that the DCCC had a \u201cpolicy, practice and procedure that allowed the 16th District Court judge to deny a criminal defendant the right to a fair and impartial jury trial where reasonable doubt exist[ed] concerning the convicted offense.\u201d Moore sought declaratory and injunctive relief, \u201csecuring [his] right to a proper review of the claims within both habeas application and/or writ of prohibition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The CCA moved to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), contending that it was entitled to judicial, sovereign, and Eleventh Amendment immunity. The CCA also argued that the complaint was barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, which prevents federal courts from adjudicating claims in which the plaintiff seeks to overturn a state court judgment. <em>See District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923). CCA asserted that the suit was barred under <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>because it amounted to a collateral attack on a state court decision. Finally, CCA argued that Moore\u2019s request for equitable relief should be denied because he failed to show that he does not have an adequate remedy at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">The district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge, who issued his Report and Recommendation on January 2, 2013. The magistrate judge recommended dismissing the case against both defendants on multiple grounds. The magistrate judge \u201cconclude[d] Plaintiffs claims are collateral attacks on final state court judgments and proceedings inextricably intertwined with final state court proceedings.\u201d Therefore, the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine applied and the court should decline to exercise jurisdiction. The magistrate judge concluded that the CCA was \u201cnot entitled to immunity from Plaintiffs claims for injunctive and declaratory relief,\u201d since state officials and agencies are not protected from suit for injunctive relief under the Eleventh Amendment. Finally, the magistrate judge determined that Moore had an adequate remedy at law available to him, in the form of a writ of habeas corpus in federal court. As a result, Moore \u201cfailed to show the necessary requisites for a grant of non-monetary relief,\u201d and the magistrate judge recommended that the motion to dismiss should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">Moore filed.objections to the Report and Recommendation. The district court approved and accepted the Report and Recommendation on May 20, 2013, granting CCA\u2019s motion to dismiss and ordering Moore\u2019s claims dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">Moore filed a notice of appeal, which arrived one day late due to his use of the zip code for the district court\u2019s prior federal courthouse, rather than its new one. He filed a subsequent motion for leave to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>file a notice of appeal, explaining the circumstances surrounding the late filing, along with a second notice of appeal. The district court construed Moore\u2019s motion as a motion to extend time to file a notice of appeal, and granted it, finding that he had shown good cause or excusable neglect for extending the time to file a notice of appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Pursuant to Moore\u2019s motion to dismiss, on November 19, 2013, the circuit clerk dismissed County Judge Horn and the individual commissioner defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal of a claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Richard v. Hoechst Celanese Chem. Grp., </em>355 F.3d 345, 349 (5th Cir.2003). We likewise review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal of a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Moore argues that the district court erred by finding that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine applied, that he is entitled to equitable relief because he has shown that he has no adequate remedy of law available to him, and that the district court erred by relying on Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) to dismiss his claims. We conclude that Moore\u2019s arguments are unmeritorious, and we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Moore argues that <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>is inapplicable. He contends that \u201chis \u00a7 1983 civil suit was not a collateral attack on a state court judgment[,] as no state court judgment exist[s] addressing or resolving the issue of whether [Moore] was denied his civil rights and entitlement to Due Process.\u201d Similarly, he asserts that his \u201cclaims seeking injunctive and declaratory relief cannot be \u2018inextricably intertwined\u2019 with his claims ... alleging a denial of his civil rights as of this date [because] no state court judgment has been rendered or entered as to whether Appellant was denied his civil rights by the Texas criminal court system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">Appellees argue that Moore\u2019s suit amounts to a collateral attack on a state court judgment, and that he cannot avoid the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine \u201cby characterizing his allegations a[s] a civil rights complaint.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-14\">The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine applies to \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). Our precedent holds that \u201clitigants may not obtain review of state court actions by filing complaints about those actions in lower federal courts cast in the form of civil rights suits.\u201d <em>Hale v. Harney, </em>786 F.2d 688, 691 (5th Cir.1986); <em>accord Liedtke v. State Bar of Tex., </em>18 F.3d 315, 317 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201cThe casting of a complaint in the form of a civil rights action cannot circumvent this rule.... \u201d). This principle is not \u201climited to actions ... which candidly seek review of the state court decree; it extends to others in which \u2018the constitutional claims presented [in federal court] are inextricably intertwined with the state court\u2019s\u2019 grant or denial of relief.\u201d <em>Hale, </em>786 F.2d at 691 (quoting <em>Feldman, </em>460 U.S. at 482 n. 16, 103 S.Ct. 1303) (alteration in original). As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Feldman, </em>claims presented to a federal district court are inextricably intertwined with a state court\u2019s judgment when \u201cthe District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>is in essence being called upon to review the state court decision. This the District Court may not do.\u201d 460 U.S. at 482 n. 16, 103 S.Ct. 1303.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, \u201c[j]udicial errors committed in state courts are for correction in the state court systems ...; such errors are no business of ours.\u201d <em>Hale, </em>786 F.2d at 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Here, Moore\u2019s request for declaratory and injunctive relief, \u201cstripped to essentials, is an attack on the judgment of the state [court].\u201d <em>Liedtke, </em>18 F.3d at 318. Moore\u2019s allegations are that the CCA and its judges denied him \u201ca fair and impartial review of his State habeas application\u201d and writ of prohibition on multiple grounds. These allegations called for the federal district court to evaluate the CCA\u2019s judgment, which the district court \u201cmay not do.\u201d <em>Feldman, </em>460 U.S. at 482 n. 16, 103 S.Ct. 1303. Moore\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit, \u201cwhich arises from the state proceeding, is \u2018inextricably intertwined\u2019 with that judgment.\u201d <em>Liedtke, </em>18 F.3d at 318. The only proper recourse for Moore is with the United States Supreme Court; he cannot file a complaint in the federal district court challenging the state court\u2019s judgment. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, \u201c[w]e have no alternative but to affirm the decision of the federal district court dismissing [Moore\u2019s] claims for lack of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Because we conclude that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine bars Moore\u2019s claims, the district court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction was not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">Moore\u2019s other arguments are unavailing. He cites <em>Pulliam v. Allen, </em>466 U.S. 522, 540, 104 S.Ct. 1970, 80 L.Ed.2d 565 (1984), for the proposition that \u201cnothing in the legislative history of \u00a7 1983 or in this Court\u2019s subsequent interpretations of that statute supports a conclusion that Congress intended to insulate judges from prospective collateral relief.\u201d This statement reflects the rule, noted <em>supra, </em>that a judge is not immune to a suit seeking injunctive relief. The magistrate judge noted this rule in recommending that Moore\u2019s claim not be dismissed on judicial immunity grounds. The rule has no bearing on the applicability of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine here.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">Lastly, because we conclude that there is no subject matter jurisdiction under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, we do not reach Moore\u2019s arguments that equitable relief is appropriate and that the jury did not find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on each of the grounds for which he was found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b452-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b452-11\">. Although Moore named the DCCC in his complaint, the district court docket sheet does not list the DCCC as a party. Regardless, in a motion filed with our court, Moore moved to dismiss the DCCC, County Judge, and commissioners. The circuit clerk dismissed the County Judge and commissioners, but took no action with respect to the DCCC because the DCCC was not a party due to its exclusion from the district court docket sheet. Because Moore moved to dismiss the DCCC and does not challenge any actions of the DCCC, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>deem the DCCC not to be a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b453-8\">. Moore listed the CCA and DCCC as \"Defendant # 1\u201d and \"Defendant # 2,\u201d respectively, in the body of his complaint. Although he named the individual judges and commissioners in the case caption, he did not allege in his complaint that these individual defendants were responsible for any of the constitutional violations he asserted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b454-10\">. The filing of two notices of appeal resulted in this case being assigned a second case number, No. 13-50576. Our resolution of the present matter resolves both matters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b455-6\">. As we recently explained in <em>Truong v. Bank of America, N.A., 717 </em>F.3d 377, 385 (5th Cir.2013), \"numerous federal courts of appeal have recognized that \u2018inextricably intertwined' does not enlarge the core holding of <em>Rooker </em>or <em>Feldman.\u201d </em>Unlike the plaintiff in <em>Truong, </em>however, Moore's claims are not \"independent claims\u201d for purposes of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>See </em>id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b455-7\">. <em>See also Price v. Porter, </em>351 Fed.Appx. 925, 926-27 (5th Cir.2009) (dismissing under <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>because complaint asserting that state court judge should have been re-cused and challenging validity of outcome in state court proceedings was a collateral attack on the state court\u2019s judgment); <em>Manor v. Tex. Supreme Court Justices, </em>76 Fed.Appx. 520, 521 (5th Cir.2003) (\"Because Manor\u2019s alleged deprivation of constitutional rights arose solely from the state-court divorce and child custody proceeding and was 'inextricably inter[t]wined' with the state court\u2019s judgment, the district court did not err in dismissing it in part for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
