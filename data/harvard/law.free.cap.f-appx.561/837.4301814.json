Maurice Grant, II, appointed counsel for Cladek, has moved to withdraw from further representation of the appellant in this appeal and filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Although Cladek argued in her Rule 33 motion and in response to Grant\u2019s <em>Anders </em>motion that counsel was ineffective, the record in this case is insufficient to review counsel\u2019s effectiveness. <em>See United States v. Franklin, </em>694 F.3d 1, 8-9 (11th Cir.2012). Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel should usually be raised in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>United States v. Curbelo, </em>726 F.3d 1260, 1267 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">Because our independent examination of the record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the denial of Cladek\u2019s Rule 33 motion for a new trial is AFFIRMED. In addition, Cladek\u2019s <em>pro se </em>request for new counsel in this appeal is DENIED as moot, and Cladek\u2019s various other requests in this appeal for relief, also filed <em>pro se, </em>are DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
