County of Cook, Illinois, </em>No. 94-C-7068, at 3, 1997 WL 639049 (N.D.Ill. Oct. 3, 1997). Because 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1500 bars jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims over the transferred claims, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-21\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b873-22\">This lengthy litigation arises from Cook County\u2019s attempts to tax two federal office buildings located within the county. While detailed mastery of the facts and procedural history are not necessary to understand and resolve the legal issues presented in this appeal, we briefly set forth those details necessary to put the present dispute into context.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-23\">The office buildings at issue were constructed in the early 1970s pursuant to 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 602a, which authorized the United States\u2019 Administrator of General Services to enter into installment purchase contracts for the acquisition of federal buildings. The statute permitted state and local taxation of \u00a7 602a property until the date that title to the buildings formally passed to the government. <em>See </em>40 U.S.C. \u00a7 602a(d) (1994). The title to both buildings did not pass to the United States until 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>In 1979, the Cook County Tax Assessor assessed property taxes against the buildings for certain prior tax years and eventually foreclosed on and sold the buildings when the United States failed to pay the taxes. The United States filed suit in federal district court seeking a declaration that the buildings were exempt from state taxation and an order vacating the sales of the buildings. On appeal, a panel of the Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s declaration that the buildings were not subject to taxation because Illinois law exempted from local taxation property \u201cthat is being purchased by a governmental body under an installment contract....\u201d <em>See United States v. County of Cook, Illinois, </em>725 F.2d 1128, 1130 (7th Cir. 1984) (quoting Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 120, \u00b6 500.9a), <em>overruled-in-part by United States v. Hynes, </em>20 F.3d 1437 (7th Cir.1994) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">In response to the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision and in light of \u00a7 602a(d), the Illinois legislature in 1984 amended its statute to permit taxation when the \u201cgovernmental body has permitted itself\u2019 to be taxed. <em>See </em>Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 120, \u00b6 500.9a (West 1992) (now codified at 35 Ill. Comp. Stat. 205/19.9a). Cook County thereafter assessed taxes against the buildings for certain tax years subsequent to 1984. The United States again filed suit, seeking a declaration that the amended statute was unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause. The Seventh Circuit, sitting en bane, disagreed with the United States and held that the taxes had been constitutionally levied under the amended statute, in the process overruling a portion of the earlier panel\u2019s decision. <em>See United States v. Hynes, </em>20 F.3d 1437, 1441 (7th Cir.1994) (en banc) (\u201cWe therefore overrule <em>County of Cook </em>to the extent that taxing federal \u00a7 602a property while exempting similar property of state and local governmental bodies would be unconstitutionally discriminatory and that \u00a7 602a(d) is not a sufficient consent to such discriminatory taxation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">After the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Hynes, </em>and after continued non-payment of the taxes, Cook County amended its pleadings in a related state <em>court </em>action <em>to seek </em>the issuance of tax deeds on the buildings in order to facilitate their sale. This prompted the United States to file the instant action in the Northern District of Illinois. This action sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prohibit the foreclosure sales of the buildings, and also sought a declaration that the United States is not liable for interest and penalties incurred with respect to the unpaid taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">Cook County filed a counterclaim constituting five separate counts, four of which are relevant here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Count II sought taxes for tax years 1985-93, with interest. Count III sought \u201cjust compensation\u201d and alleged that the United States\u2019 \u201crepudiation\u201d of its obligation to pay its taxes in 1985-93 constituted a taking actionable under the Fifth Amendment; this count also sought interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Counts IV and V were largely duplicative of counts II and III, respectively, except that they applied to tax years 1977-84.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">Both parties moved for summary judgment. <em>See United States v. County of Cook, Illinois, </em>No. 94-C-7068 (N.D.Ill. Sept. 30, 1997). The district court, inter aha, granted the United States\u2019 motion for summary judgment and in the process dismissed all of Cook County\u2019s counterclaims, reasoning that Cook County could not assert counterclaims against the United States in district court without violating principles of sovereign immunity. See id. at 28-29 (citing <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>309 U.S. 495, 60 S.Ct. 659, 84 L.Ed. 888 (1940) and <em>United States v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 309 </em>U.S. 506, 60 S.Ct. 653, 84 L.Ed. 894 (1940)); <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty, </em>309 U.S. at 512, 60 S.Ct. 653 (\u201cIn <em>[Shaw] </em>we hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>cross-claims against the United States are justiciable only in those courts where Congress has consented to their consideration.\u201d). The court also granted the United States the declaratory and injunctive relief it sought, holding that \u00a7 602a did not waive the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity against state foreclosure sales or penalties and interest accruing on taxes payable thereunder. <em>See United States v. County of Cook, Illinois, </em>No. 94-C-7068, at 22-27 (N.D.Ill. Sept. 30, 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Cook County thereafter moved the district court to amend its judgment and to transfer Counts III and V to the Court of Federal Claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 (1994). The district court granted Cook County\u2019s request to transfer and otherwise reaffirmed the summary judgment for the United States on its claims and on the counterclaims that were not transferred. <em>See United States v. County of Cook, Illinois, </em>No. 94-C-7068, at 3 (N.D.Ill. Nov. 14, 1997). Cook County later appealed the entry of summary judgment against it to the Seventh Circuit, which reversed and reinstated Cook\u2019s claims. <em>See United States v. County of Cook, Illinois, </em>167 F.3d 381 (7th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">The only issue before this court is the propriety of the district court\u2019s transfer order. We have jurisdiction to review this order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(d)(4)(A) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision to transfer a case to the Court of Federal Claims de novo because it is jurisdictional.\u201d <em>James v. Caldera, </em>159 F.3d 573, 578 (Fed. Cir.1998) (citing <em>Benderson Dev. Co. v. United States Postal Serv., </em>998 F.2d 959, 962 (Fed.Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">The United States contends that the district court erred in transferring to the Court of Federal Claims Counts III and V of Cook County\u2019s counterclaim, and it makes two arguments in support of this contention. The United States first argues that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 (1994) only authorizes the transfer of an entire \u201ccivil action,\u201d not less than all of the claims of an action. In the alternative, the United States argues that, even if \u201cbifurcation\u201d of the claims in a civil action is permissible under \u00a7 1631, jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims over the transferred claims is still barred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1500 (1994). This second argument relies on the fact that non-transferred Counts II and IV, which the United States asserts are no different in substance from transferred Counts III and V, were \u201cpending\u201d in another court for purposes of \u00a7 1500 at the- time of the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">Cook County responds that the transfer order did not \u201cbifurcate\u201d the case because non-transferred Counts II and IV had been dismissed. Cook County therefore contends in effect that its \u201ccivil action\u201d had been narrowed to include only those claims that were transferred, and that the transfer was in compliance with the statute. Cook County responds further that \u00a7 1500 is inapplicable in assessing the propriety of a transfer under \u00a7 1631, and, regardless, that \u00a7 1500 does not preclude jurisdiction because transferred Counts III and V seek a different remedy from non-transferred Counts II and IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">A. <em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">We address the United States\u2019 \u00a7 1631 argument first. That section states in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-14\"><em>Transfer to cure ivant of jurisdiction: </em>Whenever a civil action is filed in a court ... and that court finds that there is a want of jurisdiction, the court shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer such action ... to any other such court in which the action ... could have been brought at the time it was filed ..., and the action ... shall proceed as if it had been filed in ... the court to which it is transferred on the date upon which it was actually filed in ... the court from which it is transferred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEY\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-15\">Whether \u00a7 1631 permits a court to transfer some but not all claims in a \u201ccivil action\u201d is an issue that has not been uniformly resolved by the circuit courts. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has interpreted \u00a7 1631 according to its plain language to authorize only the transfer of an entire action, not individual claims within an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>action. <em>See Hill v. United States Air Force, </em>795 F.2d 1067, 1070 (D.C.Cir.1986) (\u201cSection 1631 directs a court to transfer an \u2018action\u2019 over which it lacks jurisdiction, rather than an individual claim.\u201d). In contrast, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has concluded that \u00a7 1631 allows for the transfer of some claims in an action when the district court \u201cclearly indicates\u201d an intention to create two separate actions, for example, through the application of Rule 21<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>See Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. McGlamery, </em>74 F.3d 218, 222 (10th Cir.1996) (finding that the district court\u2019s transfer order evinced such an intention); <em>see also Miller v. United States, </em>753 F.2d 270, 275-76 (3rd Cir.1985) (allowing transfer of part of an appeal to the Federal Circuit under \u00a7 1631, but without an express analysis of the propriety of doing so).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">No prior decisions of our court have squarely addressed the issue whether \u00a7 1631 permits the transfer of less than all of the claims of an action, although in <em>James v. Caldera, </em>159 F.3d 573 (Fed.Cir.1998), we affirmed an order of the district court that transferred only certain claims to the Court of Federal Claims. However, <em>James </em>did not decide or even discuss the present issue, presumably because it was not raised by either party. Similarly, in <em>Galloway Farms, Inc. v. United States, </em>834 F.2d 998 (Fed.Cir. 1987), we stated that \u201cCourts have exercised their section 1631 transfer powers but not usually, or preferably, in the form of bifurcation of claims,\u201d but ultimately declined to transfer any of the claims in the action on the ground that they were \u201cfrivolous.\u201d <em>See Galloway, </em>834 F.2d at 1001. This statement in <em>Galloway </em>did not reflect any investigation into the text, legislative history, or purpose of \u00a7 1631 and, in any event, constituted mere dictum given the court\u2019s disposition of the transfer request on the ground of frivolousness. Moreover, in <em>Cooper v. Department of the Navy, </em>108 F.3d 324 (Fed.Cir.1997), a district court transferred a four-count complaint to this court. Although we affirmed one count that related to a decision made by the Merit System Protection Board, a decision over which we have appellate jurisdiction, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9) (1994), we transferred the remaining counts over which we did not have jurisdiction back to the district court. See Cooper, 108 F.3d at 327. However, like <em>James, Cooper </em>lacks an analysis of the import of the \u201ccivil action\u201d requirement of \u00a7 1631. We therefore cannot read <em>James, Galloway, </em>or <em>Cooper </em>as setting forth an explicit rule as to whether \u00a7 1631 allows for the transfer of less than all of the claims of an action. <em>See National Cable Television Ass\u2019n v. American Cinema Editors, Inc., 937 </em>F.2d 1572, 1581 (Fed.Cir.1991) (\u201cWhen an issue is not argued or is ignored in a decision, such decision is not precedent to be followed in a subsequent case in which the issue arises.\u201d). Without binding precedent to guide us, we address this issue <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">Our analysis of the question whether \u00a7 1631 permits a court to transfer less than all claims in an action begins, as it must, with the language of the statute. <em>See Consumer Prod. Safety Comm\u2019n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980) (\u201cWe begin with the familiar canon of statutory construction that the starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself. Absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.\u201d). In this regard, we recognize the United States\u2019 point that the language of \u00a7 1631 refers to the transfer of a \u201ccivil action,\u201d not \u201cclaims\u201d underlying such an action. <em>See also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 2 (\u201cThere shall be one form of action to be known as \u2018civil action.\u2019 \u201d); Fed.R.Civ.P. 3 (\u201cA civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court.\u201d); Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(e)(2) (noting that a complaint can \u201cstate as many separate claims ... as the party has.\u201d). However, we do not view such language as dispositive of Congress\u2019s intention concerning \u201cbifurcation\u201d of an action under \u00a7 1631. Rather, we find Congress\u2019s intent more clearly expressed in the text of a different statute, <em>viz., </em>the statute that provides this court with jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number>over this case. That statute provides in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-5\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit shall have exclusive jurisdiction of an appeal from an int\u00e9rlocu-tory order of a district court of the United States ... granting or denying, <em>in whole or in part, </em>a motion to transfer <em>an action </em>to the United States Court of Federal Claims under section 1631 of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avq-\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(d)(4)(A) (1994) (emphasis added). In this statute, Congress clearly recognized that a transfer of an action under \u00a7 1631 may be granted \u201cin whole or in part.\u201d While this provision does not expressly provide for such a transfer, we understand it to have that meaning. Otherwise our review jurisdiction would lack substance. We therefore read \u00a7 1292(d)(4)(A) as reflective of Congress\u2019s intention in \u00a7 1631 to permit the transfer of less than all of the claims in an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">This reading of \u00a7 1631 promotes the policies that Congress intended to foster through its enactment of that section. As both parties point out, \u00a7 1631 was designed to remedy the situation in which a litigant has mistakenly filed an action in a court that lacks jurisdiction. In Congress\u2019s words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-7\">Because of the complexity of the Federal court system and of special jurisdictional provisions, a civil case may on occasion be mistakenly filed in a court \u2014 either trial or appellate \u2014 that does not have jurisdiction. By the time the error is discovered, the statute of limitations or a filing period may have expired. Moreover, additional expense is occasioned by having to file the case anew in the proper court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">S.Rep. No. 97-275, at 30 (1981).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because suits against the United States may be brought in the district courts in some circumstances and in the Court of Federal Claims in other circumstances, it is likely that some litigants will mistakenly file some claims in a court that lacks jurisdiction. Section 1631 was clearly intended by Congress to remedy this problem through the simple mechanism of a transfer to the court of proper jurisdiction. The United States suggests no logical reason why this remedy should not be allowed on a claim-by-claim basis. It would indeed be a curious result that a district court could transfer an action under \u00a7 1631 containing a single claim over which it lacked jurisdiction but could not transfer that claim if the claimant made an additional claim in his action over which the court did have jurisdiction. We see no reason to deny the remedial benefit of \u00a7 1631 in this circumstance merely because some of the claims were properly lodged in the transferor court. Instead, the logical result, one which promotes the policy of \u00a7 631 of aiding litigants mistaken as to the proper forum for filing certain claims, is to transfer the claims over which the transferor court lacks jurisdiction. This result is one which our previous cases have implicitly recognized as proper. <em>See James, Cooper, supra. </em>In light of \u00a7 1292(d)(4)(A)\u2019s \u201cin whole or in part\u201d requirement, we now make this result explicit and hold that \u00a7 1631 allows for the transfer of less than all of the claims in a civil action to the Court of Federal Claims. The district court\u2019s transfer order was therefore not erroneous on this basis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">B. <em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1500</em></p>\n<p id=\"b877-12\">We next turn to the United States\u2019 argument that \u00a7 1500 precludes jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims over transferred counts III and V. That section reads in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-13\"><em>Pendency of claims in other courts: </em>The United States Court of Federal Claims shall not have jurisdiction of any claim for or in respect to which the plaintiff or his assignee has pending in any other court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>any suit or process against the United States....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1500 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Counts III and V were transferred to the Court of Federal Claims pursuant to \u00a7 1631, which provides that the action brought on those counts \u201cshall proceed as if it had been filed in ... the court to which it is transferred on the date upon which it was actually filed in ... the court from which it is transferred.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631. Accordingly, through the operation of \u00a7 1631, we must consider that Claims III and V were filed in the Court of Federal Claims simultaneously with the filing of Claims II and IV in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">That these claims were simultaneously filed is significant to a \u00a7 1500 analysis because jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims under that section \u201cdepends upon the state of things at the time of the action brought.\u201d <em>Keene Corp. v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 200, 207, 113 S.Ct. 2035, 124 L.Ed.2d 118 (1993) (citations and quotation omitted). Accordingly, an issue presented for our consideration is whether Counts II and IV were \u201cpending\u201d in the district court at the time that Counts III and V were simultaneously filed in the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">Whether claims simultaneously filed are \u201cpending\u201d with respect to one another under \u00a7 1500 is an issue that has not been squarely addressed by this court or its predecessors. The parties argue, but dispute, the relevance of <em>Tecon Engineers, Inc. v. United States, </em>170 Ct.Cl. 389, 343 F.2d 943 (1965),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to this issue. In <em>Tecon, </em>the Court of Claims held that the filing of a claim against the United States in district court subsequent to the filing of the same claim in the Court of Claims did not divest that court of jurisdiction. The court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK_D\">the only reasonable interpretation of [\u00a7 1500] is that it serves to deprive this court of jurisdiction of any claim for or in respect to which plaintiff has pending in any other court any suit against the United States, <em>only </em>when the suit shall have been commenced in the other court <em>before </em>the 'claim was filed in this court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-11\"><em>Tecon, </em>343 F.2d at 949 (emphasis in original). While this language suggests that simultaneously filed claims are not \u201cpending\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1500, the opinion later notes that the facts of the case did not present the situation of simultaneously filed claims, and cites two cases in which the Court of Claims denied jurisdiction over claims which were simultaneously filed in the district courts. See <em>id. </em>at 950 &amp; n. 4 (citing <em>British Am. Tobacco Co. v. United States, </em>89 Ct.Cl. 438 (Ct.Cl.1939) and <em>National Cored Forgings Co. v. United States, </em>132 Ct.Cl. 11, 132 F.Supp. 454 (1955)). However, these Court of Claims opinions lack an express analysis of whether a claim simultaneously filed in the district courts is \u201cpending\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1500. Furthermore, <em>Tecon\u2019s </em>fact situation renders the above quotation dictum with respect to the simultaneous filing issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-12\">Our independent review of the case law has not revealed any precedent squarely on point to whether claims filed simultaneously in the district court and the Court of Federal Claims are \u201cpending\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1500. Finding neither the language of the statute nor the legislative history enlightening, we endeavor to further the established policies of \u00a7 1500, which are \u201cto force plaintiffs to choose between pursuing their claims in the Court of [Federal] Claims or in another court,\u201d <em>UNR, </em>962 F.2d at 1018 (citing the legislative history of the original version of \u00a7 1500, 81 Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 2d Sess. 2769 (1868)), and to \u201cprotect the United States from having to defend two lawsuits over the same matter simultaneously,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1019; <em>see also National Cored Forgings, </em>132 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>F.Supp. at 458 (\u201cThe obvious and declared purpose of [\u00a7 1500] was to require an election between a suit in this court against the United States and one brought\u201d in the district courts) (citing <em>Matson Navigation Co. v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 352, 52 S.Ct. 162, 76 L.Ed. 336 (1931)). These policies are promoted by precluding jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims over claims which had been previously filed in the district courts, and nothing suggests that these policies would not similarly be promoted by precluding jurisdiction in the simultaneous filing context. Accordingly, we hold that the \u201cfiling\u201d of the same claim simultaneously in the district court and the Court of Federal Claims by operation of \u00a7 1631 deprives the latter court of jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 1500. Accordingly, Counts II and IV were \u201cpending\u201d in the district court for purposes of \u00a7 1500 at the time that Counts III and V were simultaneously filed in the Court of Federal Claims.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">The only remaining question for our resolution is whether the claims filed in the two fora were indeed the same for purposes of \u00a7 1500. \u201cFor the Court of Federal Claims to be precluded from hearing a claim under \u00a7 1500, the claim pending in another court must arise from the same operative facts, and must seek the same relief.\u201d <em>Loveladies Harbor, Inc. v. United States, </em>27 F.3d 1545, 1551 (Fed.Cir.1994) (en banc). This test is applied without consideration to the legal theory underlying the claim. <em>See British Am. Tobacco Co. v. United States, </em>89 Ct.Cl. 438, 440, 1939 WL 4266 (Ct.Cl.1939) (\u201cWe think it clear that the word \u201cclaim\u201d as used in [the predecessor statute to \u00a7 1500] has no reference to the legal theory upon which a claimant seeks to enforce his demands ....\u201d) (cited with approval by <em>Keene, </em>508 U.S. at 213-14, 113 S.Ct. 2035). As we noted in <em>Loveladies, </em>in a discussion of the facts of <em>British American Tobacco:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-7\">The plaintiff [in <em>British American Tobacco </em>] brought suit against the government in district court under a tort theory, and in the Court of Claims under a contractual theory. In both courts plaintiff sought a money judgment. The Court of Claims held that \u00a7 1500 barred the claim before it. It made no difference that the two suits were based on different theories; the plaintiff had only one claim for money based on the same set of facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-8\"><em>Loveladies, </em>27 F.3d at 1551; <em>see also Keene, </em>508 U.S. at 213-14, 113 S.Ct. 2035 (rejecting the notion that only claims presenting the same legal theory were within the scope of \u00a7 1500\u2019s jurisdictional bar: \u201c[T]his reinterpretation ... would ... render[ ] the statute useless, in all or nearly all instances, to [a]ffect the very object it was originally enacted to accomplish.\u201d). The facts of <em>British American Tobacco </em>are analogous to those before us and warrant the conclusion that Cook County\u2019s Counts II and III (and Counts IV and V) are the same \u201cclaim\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1500. Both counts clearly arise out of the same operative facts, and both counts seek the same relief \u2014 money with interest, albeit under different theories (tax law versus a Fifth Amendment takings theory).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">Because the non-transferred district court claims were \u201cpending\u201d at the time that the action on the transferred claims was effectively filed in the Court of Federal Claims, and because those claims were the same for purposes of \u00a7 1500, that statute precluded jurisdiction over the transferred claims in the Court of Federal Claims. The district court therefore erred in ordering the transfer of Counts III and V to the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">The district court erred in transferring Counts III and V to the Court of Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>Claims because 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1500 precluded jurisdiction over those claims given the pen-dency of Counts II and IV before the district court. Accordingly, the decision of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">\n<em>REVERSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b874-6\">. Count I sought payment of the principal amount owing for tax years 1985-93. The United States paid this money into escrow in the district court. As stated by Cook County, this payment \"mooted\u201d Count 1. Cook County's Brief at 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b874-12\">. The escrow payment also \"mooted\u201d Counts II and III to the extent that they sought payment of the taxes, leaving only the interest and penalties in dispute. Cook County\u2019s Brief at 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b874-13\">. Cook County alleged that Counts IV and V were not barred as res judicata by the Seventh Circuit\u2019s 1984 panel decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b876-5\">. Rule 21 states in relevant part that \"[a]ny claim against a party may be severed and proceeded with separately.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b877-9\">. Congress also explained that prior to the enactment of \u00a7 1631, \"[a] litigant's main protective device ... [was] the wasteful and costly one of filing in two or more courts at the same time. This put[ ] increased burdens on the courts as well as on the parties.\u201d S.Rep. No. 97-275, at 11 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b877-14\">. Because of our conclusion that \u00a7 1631 allows for the transfer of less than all of the claims in a given action, we need not address the parties' arguments concerning the relevance of the fact that Counts II and IV were dismissed from the district court action and that the dismissal was appealed to (and has subsequently been reversed by) the Seventh Circuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b878-8\">. <em>Tecon, </em>and several other cases, were expressly overruled by this court in <em>UNR Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>962 F.2d 1013, 1023 (Fed.Cir. 1992) (en banc), <em>aff'd sub. nom Keene v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 200, 113 S.Ct. 2035, 124 L.Ed.2d 118 (1993). The Supreme Court affirmed <em>UNR </em>in <em>Keene, </em>but noted that we did not need to overrule precedent concerning fact situations which were not before us in <em>UNR. </em>See Keene, 508 U.S. at 215-16, 113 S.Ct. 2035. Accordingly, in <em>Loveladies Harbor, Inc. v. United States, </em>27 F.3d 1545 (Fed.Cir.1994) (en banc), we stated that \"anything we said in <em>UNR </em>regarding the legal import of cases whose factual bases were not properly before us was mere <em>dictum, </em>and therefore we will not accord it <em>stare decisis </em>effect.\u201d <em>Loveladies, </em>27 F.3d at 1549 (emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b879-6\">. It is worth noting that \u00a7 1500 is not implicated when <em>all </em>of the claims in an action are transferred to the Court of Federal Claims pursuant to \u00a7 1631. Section 1631 mandates that the transferred claims be treated as if they were filed in the transferee court at the time they were filed in the transferor court. Therefore, when all claims in an action are transferred, no claims are pending in the district court that could preclude jurisdiction over the transferred claims in the Court of Federal Claims pursuant to \u00a7 1500. In addition, \u00a7 1500 is not implicated when claims based on differing operative facts or seeking differing remedies are filed in district court and a transfer is made of claims properly belonging in the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
