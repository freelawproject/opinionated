The bankruptcy court and the district court rejected the trustee\u2019s objections to the exemption. Both courts relied on other lower court opinions, acknowledging that some bankruptcy courts have construed the relevant provision of Louisiana law differently. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d) and review the issue de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-16\">A bankruptcy estate ordinarily includes \u201call legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a)(1). The debtor, however, may claim exemptions provided by law. Congress offered a detailed scheme of exemptions in \u00a7 522(d), but allowed states to opt out in favor of their own exemptions. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 522(b). Louisiana has exercised this option and has provided, \u201cAll assistance shall be inalienable by any assignment or transfer and shall be exempt from levy or execution under the laws of this state.\u201d La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 46:111. \u201cAssistance\u201d is defined by a statute in the same title of the code as \u201cmoney payments under this Title.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 46:1(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-18\">Collins would be entitled to the exemption only if the EITC is part of the \u201call assistance\u201d referred to in \u00a7 46:111. It is plainly not, because the federal credit is not a \u201cmoney payment under this Title.\u201d Collins presses that \u201call assistance\u201d would be redundant if it simply meant \u201cmoney payments under this Title,\u201d and that the legislature used the word \u201call\u201d to make clear that any kind of assistance would be covered. This is a weak argument. Substituting the definition into the provision allows an exemption for \u201call money payments under this Title.\u201d This is not redundant, because it forecloses the possibility that a court might read the statute as covering some or most but not all \u201cmoney payments under this Title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-19\">The canons of interpretation are suspicious of surplusage. But we cannot allow these canons to produce absurd results when a legislature has sought to make a statute crystal clear rather than just clear. Louisiana defines the \u201cassistance\u201d that it allows debtors to exempt. The word \u201call\u201d does not reveal that the legislature intended to bypass the definition it had crafted in favor of a broader one left undefined. The most basic rule of construction is that when a statute is unambiguous, it means what it says. We cannot invent ambiguities where linguistically there are none.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-20\">The bankruptcy and district courts thus erred in granting the exemption. The trustee\u2019s objections should be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-21\">REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
