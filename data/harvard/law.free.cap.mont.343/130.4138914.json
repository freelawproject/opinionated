We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"At9\">\u00b62 Merrill raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in violation of Merrill\u2019s right to due process of law by granting a request from a law enforcement officer to restrain Merrill with leg shackles during his jury trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Merrill\u2019s proposed jury instruction on negligent endangerment as a lesser included offense of criminal endangerment?</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in imposing conditions on Merrill\u2019s parole?</p>\n<p id=\"b151-13\">\u00b66 We conclude that Issue 1 is dispositive of this appeal and, consequently, do not address Issues 2 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b151-15\">\u00b67 The State of Montana (State) charged Merrill by information with one felony and eight misdemeanor offenses arising from a traffic stop and subsequent high-speed chase involving Merrill and Montana Highway Patrol, Hill County Sheriffs Department, Havre Police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Department and Rocky Boy\u2019s Tribal Police officers. The State subsequently dismissed five of the misdemeanor counts and the case proceeded to a jury trial on the charges of felony criminal endangerment and misdemeanor driving under the influence of alcohol, eluding a peace officer and resisting arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">\u00b68 On the morning of trial, prior to <em>voir dire, </em>the parties met with the District Court in the courtroom to discuss several matters. At the end of the discussion, defense counsel requested that Merrill\u2019s leg shackles be removed prior to trial. The District Court observed that the law enforcement officer responsible for escorting Merrill to and from the courtroom had requested that Merrill remain in shackles while in the courtroom and made a record of the officer\u2019s reasons. The court determined Merrill would remain shackled during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">\u00b69 The jury convicted Merrill of all four charges. The District Court sentenced Merrill on the convictions and entered judgment. Merrill appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">\u00b610 We review a trial court\u2019s decision to restrain a criminal defendant during trial to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Herrick, </em>2004 MT 323, \u00b6 15, 324 Mont. 76, \u00b6 15, 101 P.3d 755, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">\u00b611 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion in violation of Merrill\u2019s right to due process of law by granting a request from a law enforcement officer to restrain Merrill with leg shackles during his jury trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">\u00b612  The due process clause of the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 17 of the Montana Constitution entitle criminal defendants to appear before a jury free of shackles and other physical restraints. <em>Herrick, </em>\u00b6 12 (citing <em>Morgan v. Bunnell, </em>24 F.3d 49, 51 (9th Cir. 1994)), and \u00b6 15. This right is of constitutional magnitude, but is not absolute. Therefore, a trial court\u2019s decision to shackle a defendant during trial is not <em>per se </em>unconstitutional. <em>Herrick, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">\u00b613  We recently adopted a two-part test for addressing whether a trial court abused its discretion in ordering that a defendant be shackled during trial. <em>Herrick, </em>\u00b6 15. The first prong requires that the trial court \u201cmust be persuaded by compelling circumstances that some measure is needed to maintain the security of the courtroom ....\u201d <em>Herrick, </em>\u00b6 14. In that regard, the trial court \u2018\u201chas wide discretion to decide whether a defendant who has a propensity for violence poses a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>security risk and warrants increased security measures.\u2019\u201d <em>Herrick, </em>\u00b6 15 (quoting <em>Morgan, </em>24 F.3d at 51). The second prong of the test requires a trial court to pursue less restrictive alternatives before imposing physical restraints. <em>Herrick, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">\u00b614 Merrill contends that the District Court abused its discretion in ordering that he remain shackled during trial because the court\u2019s decision failed to comply with either prong of the two-part <em>Herrick </em>test. We agree that the District Court failed to satisfy the first prong of the <em>Herrick </em>test and, because the <em>Herrick </em>test is written in the conjunctive, we need not address the second prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\u00b615 In <em>Herrick, </em>the prosecution filed a written motion prior to trial requesting the district court to allow additional security measures during trial based on the nature of the charges against the defendant and his conduct while incarcerated after his arrest. The State supported its motion with a brief outlining specific factual allegations justifying the increased security and detailing the security measures it requested. <em>Herrick, </em>\u00b6 7. The State\u2019s factual allegations included that, since his arrest, the defendant had been charged with two counts of possession of a deadly weapon; he had sent letters to the county attorney and the United States District Attorney for Montana stating that a white powdery substance in the letters was anthrax, as well as another letter threatening the lives of the county attorney and the President of the United States; and he also had been charged with felony intimidation since his arrest based on his communicating a telephone bomb threat to a local attorney. <em>Herrick, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\u00b616 The defendant did not dispute the State\u2019s factual allegations, but did challenge the propriety of most of the requested additional security measures. <em>Herrick, </em>\u00b6 8. The district court held a hearing on the motion prior to <em>voir dire </em>and found, based on the State\u2019s undisputed allegations, that the defendant had a propensity to violence and presented a danger to court personnel. <em>Herrick, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9 and 21. The court granted the State\u2019s motion in part, tailoring the additional security measures to ensure the jury did not observe the defendant in restraints. <em>Herrick, </em>\u00b6 9. We affirmed on appeal, determining the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the State\u2019s motion because the undisputed facts-as alleged by the State and found by the district court-presented sufficient compelling circumstances to support the court\u2019s conclusion that some additional security measures were needed and the court pursued the least restrictive alternatives available by granting only part of the State\u2019s requested security measures. <em>Herrick, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>\u00b617 In the present case, Merrill apparently was brought into the courtroom in leg shackles. The record exchange regarding the shackling occurred as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-4\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, there is one matter. Would it be possible to remove Mr. Merrill\u2019s shackles?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">THE COURT: No, I will not. Let me get it on the record. Officer Nugent, you had indicated that you felt that leaving the shackles on Mr. Merrill is appropriate. What is your reason for that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqh\">OFFICER NUGENT: Just because in his past history he\u2019s had some difficulties with law enforcement, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">THE COURT: And he\u2019s presently in custody of the Department of Human Services, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">OFFICER NUGENT: I believe so, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">THE COURT: He\u2019s a jail inmate pending this trial, but upon any kind of a conclusion of this matter, he would be returned to the State for custody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-9\">OFFICER NUGENT: I believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-10\">THE COURT: So he\u2019s in custody .... I do this just as a matter of caution. That\u2019s why he is here and the jury is downstairs. Nobody will see his shackles. The procedure would be that the jury would go out of the front, before they are chosen. If he needs to go to the-at the point when the jury is chose they-when they are gone, you can go out and use the bathroom. If you decide to testify, you will come on and testify. So the way the courtroom is set up nobody should see the shackles. That\u2019s the best I can do. I honor the officer\u2019s thoughts here and with the facts, I\u2019m going to require that the shackles stay on the legs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I just wanted to express an objection. I do believe that it\u2019s possible, if Mr. Merrill is moving around that, even if it\u2019s involuntarily to adjust himself, or to be comfortable that someone in the jury box on this end may see it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-12\">THE COURT: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And I believe it was in his last trial, down in Justice Court, that he was not shackled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-14\">THE COURT: All right. Well, he will be shackled here and we would-obviously, Mr. Merrill, try to keep any jingling from happening, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be that big of deal [sic] to the jury. I think we have taken pretty good precautions here to make sure restraints are not visible, or not obvious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-15\">\u00b618 As the exchange indicates, the initial request to keep Merrill shackled while in the courtroom was not made by the prosecutor. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>request to the District Court was made by the law enforcement officer in charge of escorting Merrill to and from the courtroom. In addition, the request had been made off the record and, apparently, outside the presence of the parties. The only reasons provided by the officer to support his request on the record were that Merrill had prior \u201cdifficulties with law enforcement\u201d and, at the trial court\u2019s prompting, that Merrill not only was incarcerated in the jail on the current charges, but also was in the custody of another State agency as the result of another proceeding. The officer did not provide, and the District Court did not request, specific facts to support the officer\u2019s request. The prosecutor did not participate at all in the exchange regarding Merrill\u2019s shackling.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">\u00b619 As stated above, before a trial court may order that a criminal defendant be restrained during trial, the court \u201cmust be persuaded by compelling circumstances that some measure is needed to maintain the security of the courtroom <em>....\u2019\u2019Herrick, </em>\u00b6 14. <em>In Herrick, </em>the State filed a pretrial motion for security measures during trial and supported its request with specific factual allegations detailing the defendant\u2019s violent and threatening behaviors. <em>Herrick, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">\u00b620 Here, the decision to shackle had been made off the record and out of the parties\u2019 presence. Moreover, the limited information presented to the District Court simply did not establish \u201ccompelling circumstances\u201d for security measures. The officer\u2019s cursory statement that Merrill previously had \u201cdifficulties with law enforcement\u201d provides no basis on which the District Court could determine Merrill had a propensity toward violence, had ever been violent or otherwise posed a security risk. Indeed, the phrase \u201cdifficulties with law enforcement\u201d could mean mere prior arrests for non-violent misdemeanor offenses or even contacts with law enforcement not resulting in arrest. Similarly, the fact that Merrill was in the custody of a State agency as a result of a separate proceeding, without more, cannot constitute a compelling circumstance that some security measure in the courtroom is needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">\u00b621 The State does not contend that the District Court\u2019s decision comported with the <em>Herrick </em>test. It does remind us-and properly so-that, <em>in Herrick, </em>we vested broad discretion in trial courts deciding whether a defendant with a propensity for violence poses a security risk warranting increased security measures. <em>See Herrick, </em>\u00b6 15. As <em>Herrick </em>states, however, an exercise of the court\u2019s discretion must begin with \u201ca defendant who has a propensity for violence.\u201d Even that initial basis for exercising broad discretion is highly questionable here. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Moreover, the ultimate decision must be based on the factual information of record establishing compelling circumstances which persuade the court that some measure is needed to maintain the security of the courtroom. That factual information of record is simply absent here. Thus, we conclude the District Court failed to comply with the first prong of the <em>Herrick </em>test and, as a result, abused its discretion in ordering that Merrill remain shackled for his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">\u00b622 We observe that the State frames this issue as whether the District Court \u201cabuse[d] its discretion in denying Merrill\u2019s request to remove his leg shackles during trial.\u201d The State then asserts that the court did not abuse its discretion and notes that, although the court\u2019s decision to shackle Merrill during trial \u201cis not supported by an in-depth, on-the-record analysis,\u201d Merrill failed to request either the District Court or the State to provide any further reasoning or analysis. This argument is totally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">\u00b623  As stated above, the due process clauses of the United States and Montana Constitutions entitled Merrill to appear before the jury free of shackles or other physical restraints. This right exists unless and until compelling circumstances persuade a trial court that some added measure is necessary to maintain the security of the courtroom; even then, a court must pursue less restrictive alternatives before imposing physical restraints. A defendant has no obligation to prove the constitutional entitlement to be unrestrained for trial; nor is it conceivable that a defendant is obligated to request the State to come forward with additional argument and analysis to support his being shackled.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">\u00b624 The State also contends that other information contained in the record and known to the District Court-such as the factual allegations underlying the current charges as set forth in the affidavit in support of its motion for leave to file an information, as well as Merrill\u2019s criminal history-supported a determination that Merrill was both dangerous and an escape risk, thus justifying the court\u2019s decision to keep Merrill shackled during trial. This argument, too, is totally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">\u00b625 The factual allegations underlying the charges on which Merrill was about to be tried were simply that-unproven allegations of criminal behavior of which Merrill was presumed innocent. In addition, nothing of record establishes-or even suggests-that Merrill\u2019s criminal history was brought to the District Court\u2019s attention before or during the limited exchange regarding shackling Merrill for trial. The constitutional right to be free from restraints during trial cannot co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>exist with allowing infringement of that right based on unproven allegations or pure speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">\u00b626  We hold that the District Court abused its discretion in violation of Merrill\u2019s right to due process of law by granting a request from a law enforcement officer to restrain Merrill with leg shackles during his jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">\u00b627 Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b157-6\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b157-7\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"A81\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">\u00b628 I dissent from the Court\u2019s reversal of Merrill\u2019s conviction and order for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">\u00b629 In <em>Herrick, </em>upon which the Court exclusively relies, we first noted the principle offered by Herrick that \u201cshackling, when observed by the jury, is inherently prejudicial,\u201d but concluded, in rejecting Herrick\u2019s due process argument, that the case presented \u201cno indication of any impact on the presumption of innocence\u201d because efforts had been taken to ensure \u201cthe restraints were not visible to the jury. Nothing of record shows or even suggests... that jurors or potential jurors saw the shackles.\u201d <em>Herrick, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-19. We likewise rejected Herrick\u2019s individual dignity argument, noting \u201c[w]e again observe that nothing of record indicates that jurors or potential jurors saw Herrick\u2019s leg restraints at any time.\u201d <em>Herrick, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">\u00b630 These facts, heavily emphasized <em>hi Herrick, </em>are overlooked today. But as in <em>Herrick, </em>there is nothing of record in this case which indicates that the jury saw Merrill\u2019s shackles. Merrill did not argue that the jury saw him in shackles in his opening brief and, in his reply brief, argued that the jury \u201cmay\u201d have seen him in shackles. Thus, the record does not permit an \u201cindication of any impact on the presumption of innocence.\u201d <em>Herrick, </em>\u00b6 19. Similar to this emphasis in <em>Herrick, </em>many other courts have likewise held that \u201c[a]n appellate court will not find error on the ground that the defendant was shackled unless it is shown that the jury saw the shackles.\u201d <em>State v. McMurtrey, </em>664 P.2d 637, 642 (Ariz. 1983) (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">\u00b631 On this basis-that the record is insufficient to factually support Merrill\u2019s claim-I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
