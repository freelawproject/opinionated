Bair Family Trust. The Trustee, U.S. Bank, N.A., cross-appeals from the District Court\u2019s decision to allow the Friends of the Bair to intervene in this action. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">\u00b63 Did the District Court correctly determine that the Trust Agreement did not require the creation of the Museum?</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">\u00b64 Did the District Court correctly determine that the Board did not breach its fiduciary duties to the Trust?</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">\u00b65 Did the District Court correctly determine that the Friends of the Bair had standing to intervene in this action?</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">\u00b66 On January 3,1990, Alberta M. Bair executed a Trust Agreement with First Trust Company of Montana (succeeded in interest by U.S. Bank, N.A. (\u201cthe Trustee\u201d)). The Trust Agreement provided for the creation of the Charles M. Bair Family Trust (\u201cthe Trust\u201d), a charitable trust that was to receive Alberta Bair\u2019s estate upon her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">\u00b67 The Trust Agreement stated, in a section entitled PURPOSES OF THE TRUST, that the \u201cpurposes of the Trust are to devote and apply the property and the income to be derived therefrom exclusively for charitable, religious, scientific, literary, or educational purposes ....\u201d The section further stated that \u201cno part of the Trust shall inure to the benefit\u201d of any person, entity, or individual. The Trust Agreement prohibited the Trust from carrying on propaganda, attempting to influence legislation, or participating in, or intervening in any political campaign for any candidate for public office. The Trust Agreement required that the Trust be maintained in such a manner that it would maintain tax-exempt status under \u00a7 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>\u00b68 The Trust Agreement also created the Board of Advisors (\u201cthe Board\u201d) and granted the Board the power and authority to make charitable distributions from the Trust\u2019s income. The Trust Agreement directed that five members would constitute the Board: the president or the president\u2019s nominee of First Trust Company of Montana; the president or the president\u2019s nominee of First Bank (N.A.), Billings; the president or the president\u2019s nominee of Moulton, Bellingham, Longo &amp; Mather, P.C.; and two members, designated by the Trustee, from the counties of Meagher, Wheatland, and Yellowstone, with not more than one member appointed from either Meagher or Wheatland counties.</p>\n<p id=\"A-O\">\u00b69 The Trust Agreement also provided for the creation of a museum. In the section entitled, CREATION OF THE CHARLES M. BAIR FAMILY MUSEUM, the Trust Agreement stated that it had long been the \u201ccherished aim and foremost desire\u201d of Alberta Bair to establish a museum that would \u201cperpetuate the historic and artistic significance of the Charles M. Bair Ranch and the people associated with it.\u201d The Trust Agreement then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-4\">It is therefore [Alberta Bair\u2019s] will that the Board of Advisors devote [her] entire residence, together with all personal property of lasting historical and artistic value located therein, and together with surrounding grounds and outbuildings necessary for such purpose, to the establishment of a museum to be named the Charles M. Bair Family Museum [(\u201cthe Museum\u201d)] which shall be open for the educational benefit of the general public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqHW\">The Trust Agreement granted the Board the option to establish a separate charitable entity to operate the Museum and directed the Board to use \u201cwhatever principal and income\u201d of the Trust \u201cnecessary to establish, improve and maintain the museum ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u00b610 The Trust Agreement authorized the Board, \u201c[i]n fulfilling its purposes of opening the museum to the general public for scholarly, educational and historical purposes,\u201d to acquire additional land, to \u201cerect and/or maintain existing structures suitable\u201d to a museum\u2019s operation, and to hire employees to operate the museum. The Trust Agreement instructed that the Museum had \u201cfirst priority on income\u201d distributed by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\u00b611 The Trust Agreement empowered the Board to \u201csell, transfer, relocate the museum, or otherwise dispose of all of the property then held as a part of [the Museum]\u201d in two circumstances: (1) following the fifth anniversary of Alberta Bair\u2019s death, if the Board, \u201cacting in its sole judgment and discretion,\u201d determined that the Museum no longer served its purposes such that it was \u201cinadvisable to continue the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>museum for public and educational purposes\u201d; and (2) if a \u201cfire or other cause\u201d so damaged or destroyed the Bair Family residence or its contents that the Board determined, in its sole judgment, that \u201cit would be impossible, impractical or inadvisable to repair and restore the same\u201d and for the Museum to carry out its original objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">\u00b612 The Trust Agreement assigned a primarily administrative role to the Trustee relating to the Trust\u2019s charitable distributions and the Museum. The Trust Agreement granted the Trustee no power to approve or deny specific charitable requests and no decision-making power to determine whether the Museum should be closed or remain open.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\u00b613 Following Alberta Bair\u2019s death in 1993, the Board held its initial meeting at Alberta Bair\u2019s residence in Martinsdale, Montana. The Board reviewed the Trust Agreement and determined that it indicated a clear directive to create the Museum. Soon after, the Board issued a press release introducing the Board members and informing the public that the Board had been \u201ccharged with the responsibility of fulfilling \u2018the cherished aim and foremost desire of Marguerite and Alberta Bair to establish a museum which would perpetuate the historic and artistic significance of the Charles M. Bair Ranch ....\u2019\u201d The release also informed the public that, though the Trust Agreement \u201cdesignates this priority [the Museum], other charitable requests will be considered\u201d by the Board. In 1993, the Trust was valued at approximately $23,500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\u00b614 At the initial meeting, David Leavengood, a restoration architect, provided the Board his assessment regarding the conversion of the Bair Family residence to a museum. The Leavengood Study addressed the issues fundamental to \u201ccreating an environment of acceptable standards for a modern museum....\u201d Leavengood stated that he had no doubts that the Bair Ranch had the \u201cpotential of being a world-class institution.... The family history, the collection and the building are all in place; the museum\u2019s future is bright and needs only careful guidance.\u201d His study documented the ranch\u2019s existing condition, recommended changes to \u201ccorrect hazardous aspects[,]\u201d and offered suggestions to transform the residence into a museum. Leavengood\u2019s suggestions included installing a fire-sprinkler system, installing a new air-handling system to maintain stable temperatures and humidity levels, installing a sophisticated security system, and constructing an additional building for the Museum. Leavengood estimated the total preplanning costs for converting the Bair Family residence to a Museum to be between $1,935,375 and $2,517,320.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>\u00b615 By March 30, 1994, the Board had also established a working relationship with CTA Architects Engineers (\u201cCTA\u201d). CTA generated a Master Plan that identified many of the same concerns as Leavengood\u2019s study. CTA\u2019s recommendations included installing a fire-sprinkler system, installing electrical and plumbing upgrades, constructing a climate-controlled enclosure with precise temperature and humidity controls for the archives, constructing an additional building for a visitor center, and general repainting and landscaping. CTA\u2019s preliminary cost analysis estimated the costs at $1,023,200.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap3\">\u00b616 In November 1994, CTA submitted a second estimate entitled, \u201cRevised Project Cost Analysis-Minimum Operation.\u201d The revised proposal focused on (1) making critical improvements or repair to the house; (2) installing high priority safety and security items, such as a fire sprinkler, new electrical wiring, fire-protection water storage, and storm windows; (3) simplifying the barn renovation by using existing materials and forgoing a sprinkler system and loft improvements, including the air-handling system with temperature and humidity controls; (4) simplifying the site development; and (5) providing staff support housing consisting of a renovated mobile home for the Caretaker and a new mobile home for the Curator. CTA estimated the costs of its Minimum Operation proposal at $521,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">\u00b617 Following additional discussions, CTA further amended its Minimum Operation\u2019s estimate. CTA\u2019s reworked proposal eliminated the fire sprinkler system and the related fire-protection expenses and modified the staff housing. Through these reductions, CTAreduced the estimated costs to $328,000, approximately one-third the amount of its original estimate. The Board unanimously approved CTA\u2019s proposal. The Board ultimately spent approximately $600,000 on converting the home into a museum, including $25,000 to \u201cspruce up\u201d the Museum before its grand opening. CTA continued to perform maintenance and repairs for the Museum through 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u00b618 The Board consulted with the C. M. Russell Museum (\u201cCMR\u201d) throughout the process of converting the Bair Family residence into a Museum. CMR assisted the Board in identifying issues related to the preparation, opening, and operation of the Museum, and CMR helped the Board develop an initial operating budget for the Museum. In 1995, the Board contracted with CMR to operate the Museum on a year-to-year basis. CMR\u2019s services included those \u201cthat are generally performed by an organization that operates a museum for the educational benefit of the general public.\u201d CMR served as the Museum\u2019s operator during the years that the Museum was operational.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>\u00b619 The Museum opened to the public on May 2,1996, and more than 14,000 visitors toured the Museum in its first season. The Museum\u2019s collection included unique Native American art of the highest quality; European furniture, silver, and decorations; photographs by Edward S. Curtis; and paintings and watercolors by Charles M. Russell, Joseph Henry Sharp, and J. K. Ralston. Though the Museum\u2019s attendance in 1997 and 1998 exceeded CMR\u2019s expectations, the Museum\u2019s attendance successively declined in the years following the Museum\u2019s opening. In 2002, the Museum\u2019s final year of operation, 4,357 visitors toured the Museum.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\u00b620 Following the 2002 season, CMR submitted an annual report to the Board that advised the Board of issues that CMR considered critical to the Museum\u2019s future success. CMR recommended that the Board increase the Trust\u2019s contribution to the Museum and that the Board project expenses and revenues for three to five years. CMR recognized that the Board would eventually implement a separate Board of Trustees for the Museum, and it recommended that the new board focus on meeting the Museum\u2019s short-term needs and working to ensure the Museum\u2019s long-term financial health. CMR also recommended that the Board hire a professional museum administrator to give year-round attention to \u201cfund raising, management, collections, education and interpretation and marketing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\u00b621 Based on CMR\u2019s report, the Board had \u201cserious concerns\u201d as to whether the Museum was meeting its purposes. The Board\u2019s 2005 Memorandum of Decision (\u201cMemorandum\u201d), in which the Board set forth its reasons for closing the Museum, stated that, after reviewing CMR\u2019s report, it \u201cwas readily apparent that much more time, money, and resources were required by the Museum while the likelihood of any return, in terms of greater attendance or educational possibilities, was not good.\u201d In November 2002, the Board unanimously voted that the Museum \u201cnot be reopened for the year 2003 and beyond.\u201d The Board chairman described the Board\u2019s action as a temporary suspension of the Museum\u2019s operation in response to an inquiry from the Attorney General\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">\u00b622 Following the decision to close the Museum temporarily, the Board decided to hire a consultant to review the feasibility of the Museum\u2019s continued operations and to provide the Board with recommendations. In an email to his fellow Board members, the Board chairman expressed his view, shared by the Trust Administrator, regarding the Museum\u2019s repairs and maintenance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Given-The museum was never really made \u2018museum ready\u2019 in 1995 when it opened. A lot of work was done but many issues linger in terms of compliance with government regs, good curatorship, etc. The house is not disability friendly. It does not have climate control for good preservation of artifacts. It is not user friendly in terms of taking large groups through. It has inadequate bathrooms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\">Given-The museum has band-aided itself along through it\u2019s [sic] 8 years of operations as it dealt with all these inconsistencies. These inconsistencies contribute to cost, efficiency and other factors key to successful operation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">Given-We are headed off on the same track again in asking CMR to get bids to fix leaky roof, replace bay windows and rebuild rails on second floor balconies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The Board eventually hired CTA to assess the Museum\u2019s current condition, to prioritize deferred maintenance tasks, and to provide cost estimates. In addition to CTA, the Board hired a consultant, Peter Hassrick, to review the Museum\u2019s continued feasibility and to provide the Board with options to preserve the Bair family legacy. Gene Kolstad, a CTA architect, also presented the Board with options for the Museum\u2019s future. The Museum remained closed while Hassrick and CTA, working together with CMR, conducted their studies.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">\u00b623 On February 29, 2004, the Friends of the Bair sent the Trustee a letter threatening legal action if the Trustee did not reopen the Museum. The Trustee then filed a petition with the District Court in which the Trustee asked the court to determine (1) whether the Board had the power to direct the Trustee to suspend the Museum\u2019s operation; (2) whether the Board had the power to determine that the Museum had ceased to serve its purposes under the Trust Agreement to the extent that it was \u201cinadvisable to continue the Museum for public and educational purposes\u201d; and (3) whether the Board had the power to direct the Trustee to sell, transfer, or relocate the museum if the Board determined that the Museum had ceased to serve its purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">\u00b624 The Friends of the Bair filed a motion to intervene in the action and claimed that the individual members comprising the Friends of the Bair possessed a statutory right to enforce the terms of the charitable trust as \u201cspecial interest\u201d beneficiaries under \u00a7 72-33-503, MCA. The Trustee opposed the motion and asserted that the Friends of the Bair lacked standing to intervene. The Trustee further argued that the Montana Attorney General bears the responsibility to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>safeguard and to advocate for the general public\u2019s interest. The District Court determined that the individual members had a \u201cspecial interest\u201d and allowed the Friends of the Bair to intervene. Subsequently, the District Court granted the Attorney General\u2019s and the Board\u2019s motions to intervene in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\u00b625 In the midst of the proceedings, the Board announced its decision to permanently close the Museum. The Board set forth its reasoning in a Memorandum of Decision. The Board stated that the Museum had \u201cceased to meet the scholarly, educational and historical purposes for which [the Museum] was established ....\u201d As support for its decision, the Board cited the 1993 Leavengood Study, the 2002 CMR report, and a Sotheby\u2019s appraisal of the Museum\u2019s collection as documents that the Board felt \u201craised serious concerns regarding the feasibility of continuing to operate\u201d the Museum. The Board specifically noted that the Leavengood Study had highlighted concerns such as the location of the Museum and the \u201cextended response time from the local volunteer fire department and/or law enforcement[,]\u201d the lack of a proper HVAC system to handle temperature fluctuations and relative humidity concerns, and the recommendation that an interior and exterior closed-circuit television monitoring system be installed to address security concerns. In light of these \u201cphysical limitations,\u201d the Board considered \u201calarming\u201d the Museum collection\u2019s increase in value; an appraisal by Sotheby\u2019s of New York indicated that the collection had increased nearly $3,000,000 in value between 1996 and 2004. At the time the Board decided to permanently close the Museum, the Trust was valued at approximately $55,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\u00b626 Following the Board\u2019s decision to close the Museum, the State moved for summary judgment and requested that the District Court determine that the Board, acting through the Trustee, had breached its fiduciary duties and its duties under the Trust. In a ruling denying the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the District Court determined that the Trust Agreement authorized the Museum\u2019s creation in a precatory clause, and thus, the Museum\u2019s creation was not required. Nonetheless, the District Court determined that, because the Board had created the Museum, the Board was obligated to follow the Trust Agreement\u2019s directions when determining the circumstances under which the Board could close the Museum. The District Court denied the State\u2019s motion, reasoning that, \u201cabuse of discretion, on the one hand, and reasoned forethought, on the other, are mixed questions of law and fact that dictate a decision on the law and facts at trial and not by summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>\u00b627 After conducting a four-day trial, the District Court concluded that the Board had \u201captly managed and overseen\u201d its duties, that the Board had \u201csuccessfully and appropriately managed their part\u201d of the Trust\u2019s financial affairs, and that the Board had \u201cmanaged, improved, maintained and repaired the museum.\u201d The District Court further concluded that the Board did not act arbitrarily and capriciously and that the Board had acted with \u201cconsidered forethought and reasoning.\u201d The District Court entered judgment in favor of the Trustee and the Board. The State and the Friends of the Bair appeal the District Court\u2019s judgment, and the Trustee appeals the District Court\u2019s decision allowing the Friends of the Bair to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\u00b628 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Slauson v. Bertelsen Family Trust, </em>2006 MT 314, \u00b6 10, 335 Mont. 43, \u00b6 10, 151 P.3d 866, \u00b6 10. We review for correctness a district court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Slauson, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A2z\">\u00b629 I. Did the District Court correctly determine that the Trust Agreement did not require the creation of the Museum?</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">\u00b630 The State asserts that the District Court mistakenly interpreted the Trust Agreement when it concluded that the creation of the Museum was authorized in a precatory clause and thus viewed the Board\u2019s decision to create the Museum as discretionary. The State argues that the terms of the Trust Agreement-describing the Museum as Alberta Bair\u2019s \u201ccherished aim and foremost desire\u201d and expressing her <em>\u2018\u201cwill </em>that the [Board] devote\u2019 her residence, its contents, and its grounds to \u2018[the Museum] which <em>shall be </em>open\u2019\u201d for the general public\u2019s educational benefit-contradict the District Court\u2019s determination. The State further argues that this language expresses a trust\u2019s primary purpose. According to the State, the Board\u2019s and the District Court\u2019s \u201cinitial failure\u201d to appreciate the Trust Agreement\u2019s plain meaning underlies their neglect of the Museum.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">\u00b631 The Board responds that the Museum was never the \u201cdriving force\u201d behind the Trust. The Board maintains that the Trust Agreement unambiguously expresses that the Trust\u2019s purpose was to devote the Trust\u2019s property and income to general philanthropy. Further, the Board contrasts the Trust Agreement\u2019s language regarding the duration of the Trust and the duration of the Museum: the Board argues that the Trust was to endure forever, while the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Museum was limited to the five years following Alberta Bair\u2019s death if the Board determined that the Museum was failing to meet its purposes. Similarly, the Trustee asserts that the Museum was not the central purpose of the Trust because Alberta Bair did not refer to the Museum in the PURPOSES OF THE TRUST section. The Trustee states that reference to the Museum\u2019s creation is \u201cnoticeably absent\u201d from the Trust Agreement\u2019s expressly stated purposes, and the Trustee asserts that if Alberta Bair \u201chad intended the Museum to be the central purpose, she could have said so.\u201d The Trustee maintains that the Trust\u2019s purpose was not to create and fund a museum, and the State\u2019s contrary arguments reflect a \u201cfundamental misreading of the Trust Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\u00b632 The District Court\u2019s interpretation of the Trust Agreement presents a question of law, which we review for correctness. <em>In re Marriage of </em>Holloway, 2000 MT 104, \u00b6 5, 299 Mont. 291, \u00b6 5, 999 P.2d 980, \u00b6 5. The trustor\u2019s intent controls our interpretation of a trust agreement, and we attempt to discern the trustor\u2019s intent from the language of the entire trust agreement, rather than from a particular word or phrase. <em>Matter of Estate of Bolinger, </em>284 Mont. 114, 120, 943 P.2d 981, 985 (1997); <em>In re Estate of Snyder, </em>2000 MT 113, \u00b6 10, 299 Mont. 421, \u00b6 10, 2 P.3d 238, \u00b6 10. We seek to interpret a trust agreement\u2019s language such that every expression gains \u201csome effect,\u201d rather than an interpretation that renders inoperative any of the expressions. <em>In re Estate of Snyder, </em>\u00b6 10 (citations omitted). When interpreting an instrument, we emphasize substance over form, and we construe the instrument\u2019s words in \u201ctheir ordinary and grammatical sense[,]\u201d absent a clear opposite intention. <em>In re Estate of Snyder, </em>\u00b6 10 (citations omitted). Laws governing the construction and operation of wills also apply to trusts. Section 72-33-106, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u00b633 The language Alberta Bair used in \u00a7 6.2(a) of the Trust Agreement, entitled PURPOSES OF THE TRUST, clearly manifests her intention that the Charles M. Bair Family Trust exist as a charitable trust. The Trust Agreement provides that the \u201cpurposes of the Trust are to devote and apply the property and the income to be derived therefrom exclusively for charitable, religious, scientific, literary, or educational purposes ....\u201d The section further states that <em>\u201cno </em>part of the Trust shall inure\u201d to the benefit of any private person, entity, or individual. The Trust Agreement prohibits the Trust from carrying on propaganda, attempting to influence legislation, or participating in any campaign activity for or against candidates for public office. In summary, the Trust Agreement\u2019s language parallels <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 501(c)(3), which defines tax-exempt entities. Section 6.2(a) further provides that \u201cthe Trust shall not conduct or carry on any activities not permitted to be conducted or carried on by an organization exempt under [I.R.C. \u00a7 501(c)(3)] and its regulations as they now exist or as they may hereafter be amended ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">\u00b634 Section 6.2(b) of the Trust Agreement, entitled USE OF TRUST FUNDS, directs the Board \u201cto distribute from time to time exclusively for charitable, religious, scientific, literary or educational purposes, or any of them, each year, such amount of the income only of the Trust as [the Board] in its discretion may order, appoint or direct.\u201d The Trust Agreement instructs that the Board must make the distributions in such a manner that the Trust will incur no tax on the undistributed income. Based on these sections of the Trust Agreement, we conclude that Alberta Bair intended to create a charitable trust with general philanthropy as a Trust purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\u00b635 Though we conclude that general philanthropy was a purpose of the Trust, we cannot agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Trust Agreement granted the Board discretion to decide whether to establish the Museum. Section 6.2(e) of the Trust, entitled CREATION OF THE CHARLES M. BAIR FAMILY MUSEUM, instructs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">In carrying out the charitable purposes of the Trust as aforesaid and without intending to limit the generality thereof, it has long been the cherished aim and foremost desire of Grantor\u2019s sister and Grantor [Alberta Bair] to establish a museum which would perpetuate the historic and artistic significance of the Charles M. Bair Ranch and the people associated with it. It is therefore Grantor\u2019s will that the Board of Advisors devote Grantor\u2019s entire residence, together with all personal property of lasting historical and artistic value located therein, and together with surrounding grounds and outbuildings necessary for such purpose, to the establishment of a museum to be named the Charles M. Bair Family Museum which shall be open for the educational benefit of the general public.... The Board of Advisors is directed to use whatever principal and income of the Charles M. Bair Family Trust that is necessary to establish, improve and maintain the museum, and shall have full discretion and authority to administer and manage the same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The District Court dismissed this language as precatory and concluded that the Trust Agreement did not require the establishment of the Museum. Precatory language expresses merely a wish or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>recommendation and generally creates, at most, an ethical obligation, rather than a legal obligation. <em>Matter of Estate of Bolinger, </em>284 Mont. at 122-23, 943 P.2d at 986 (citing George T. Bogert, <em>Trusts </em>\u00a7 19, 41 (6th ed., West 1987)). The primary inquiry when construing an expression is whether the testator intended only \u201cto advise or influence\u201d the devisee\u2019s discretion, or to \u201ccontrol or direct the disposition intended.\u201d <em>Matter of Estate of Bolinger, </em>284 Mont. at 123, 943 P.2d at 986 (citing Bogert, <em>Trusts </em>\u00a7 19 at 42). In <em>Matter of Estate of Bolinger, </em>we determined that the will\u2019s language at issue failed to create an express trust because the words imposed no \u201cclear directive or obligation\u201d on the purported trustee. 284 Mont. at 124, 943 P.2d at 987. Further, the language provided the purported trustee no direction or guidance to implement the trustor\u2019s intent and granted the purported trustee \u201ccomplete discretion\u201d as to the estate\u2019s use. <em>Matter of Estate of Bolinger, </em>284 Mont. at 124-25, 943 P.2d at 987.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">\u00b636 The District Court\u2019s determination that the Trust Agreement imposed no legal obligation on the Board to create the Museum would find some support if Alberta Bair only described her desire to establish the Museum as her \u201ccherished aim and foremost desire.\u201d Section \u00a7 6.2(e) however, does more than advise or attempt to influence the Board to create Alberta Bair\u2019s Museum, <em>Matter of Estate of Bolinger, </em>284 Mont. at 123, 943 P.2d 986; rather, her Trust Agreement provides a clear directive to the Board to create the Museum and provides the Board with direction and guidance on how to proceed. The Trust Agreement sets forth the location of the Museum, the real and personal property that Alberta Bair wanted the Board to devote to the Museum, the name of the Museum, the purpose of the Museum, and the means to fund the Museum with \u201cwhatever principal and income\u201d necessary from the Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\u00b637 Moreover, although the Trust Agreement grants the Board discretion to administer and manage the Museum, the Trust Agreement grants the Board no discretion to decide whether to establish the Museum. On the contrary, the Trust Agreement <em>directs </em>the Board to \u201cuse whatever principal and income of the [Trust] that is necessary to establish, improve and maintain the museum ....\u201d Additional language in \u00a7 6.2(e) further demonstrates the level of direction and control Alberta Bair maintained regarding the Trust\u2019s assets and the relationship between the Museum and general philanthropy: the Museum \u201ccreated herein shall have first priority on income to be distributed from the Trust by the Board of Advisors.\u201d The Trust Agreement also grants the Board authority to \u201cacquire required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>additional land, erect and/or maintain existing structures suitable to the operation of a museum, and [to] employ such person or persons to operate the museum in accord with Grantor\u2019s wishes\u201d as interpreted by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">\u00b638  The specificity contained within the Trust Agreement\u2019s language expresses Alberta Bair\u2019s intent to \u201ccontrol or direct\u201d the establishment of the Museum, rather than to merely \u201cadvise or influence\u201d the Board. <em>Matter of Estate of Bolinger, </em>284 Mont. at 123, 943 P.2d at 986 (citing Bogert, <em>Trusts </em>\u00a7 19 at 42). We conclude that the District Court erroneously determined that the Trust Agreement did not require the establishment of the Museum; on the contrary, the Trust Agreement\u2019s language mandates the creation of the Museum.</p>\n<p id=\"APn\">\u00b639 Further, while we agree with the Board and the Trustee that general philanthropy was a purpose of Alberta Bair\u2019s Trust, we cannot agree that general philanthropy constituted the primary purpose of the Trust. On the contrary, we conclude from the plain language of the Trust Agreement that the establishment of the Museum constituted the Trust\u2019s primary purpose. As discussed in \u00b6 38, Alberta Bair issued a clear directive to the Board to establish the Museum; the Museum\u2019s creation was not left to the Board\u2019s discretion. Further, the Trust Agreement authorizes the Board to invade the principal of the Trust only on behalf of the Museum. Though the Trust Agreement directs the Board to distribute \u201cincome only\u201d for general philanthropic purposes, the Trust Agreement directs the Board \u201cto use <em>whatever principal and income </em>of the [Trust] that is necessary to establish, improve and maintain the museum ....\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">\u00b640  Additionally, the Trust Agreement\u2019s plain language accords the Museum priority over general philanthropy; the Trust Agreement specifically states that the Museum \u201cshall have first priority on income\u201d distributed by the Board. Finally, other than the section concerning the Board\u2019s self-administration, the Trust Agreement\u2019s only specific directions to the Board concern the Museum\u2019s creation. In contrast, the general philanthropic purposes are left to the Board\u2019s discretion, provided that the Board does not run afoul of the tax code. While Alberta Bair clearly intended to create a charitable trust with general philanthropic purposes, we conclude that the creation of the Museum was the primary purpose of the Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">\u00b641 The Board argues that the Museum\u2019s potentially limited five-year duration stands in \u201cstark contrast\u201d to the Trust\u2019s perpetual duration, and it asserts that these different durations support the Board\u2019s position that general philanthropy, rather than the Museum, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>constituted the Trust\u2019s primary purpose. We disagree with the Board\u2019s reading of the Trust Agreement. Unless the main dwelling or its contents suffers significant damage or destruction from \u201cfire or other cause[,]\u201d the Trust Agreement specifically prohibits the Board from selling, transferring, relocating, or otherwise disposing of the Museum and its property for the five-year period following Alberta Bair\u2019s death. After the five-year period, the Trust Agreement further requires that the Board first determine that the Museum \u201chas ceased to serve\u201d its purposes to the extent that it is \u201cinadvisable to continue the museum for public and educational purposes <em>...\u201d </em>Only after these conditions have been satisfied could the Board sell, transfer, relocate, or otherwise dispose of the Museum.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u00b642 In contrast, the Board could terminate the Trust at any time. The Trust\u2019s duration was not \u201cforever\u201d as the Board maintains; rather, the Trust Agreement provides that the \u201cTrust shall continue forever <em>unless </em>the Trustee and four members of the Board of Advisors decide to terminate it and distribute all of the principal and income, which action may be taken by the Board of Advisors <em>in its discretion at any time.\u201d </em>(Emphases added.) The Board could terminate the Trust at any time, including, presumably, at the Board\u2019s initial meeting. Thus, the Board finds no support in the different durations assigned to the Museum and to the Trust. On the contrary, the different durations weigh against the Board\u2019s interpretation of the Trust Agreement. Further, the Trust Agreement indicates that Alberta Bair contemplated that the Museum would exist independently from the Trust, and she granted the Board the option to establish and fund a separate charitable entity to operate the Museum-even if the Board terminated the Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u00b643 The Trustee\u2019s argument that the Museum cannot be the Trust\u2019s central purpose because the PURPOSES OF THE TRUST section does not specifically refer to the Museum conflicts with our well-established interpretational principles. Although subheadings may aid when interpreting a trust, according such dispositive effect to the subheading, as the Trustee suggests, would require us to elevate form over substance and to abandon our practice of discerning the trustor\u2019s intent from a sympathetic reading of the entire trust agreement, rather than from a particular word or phrase. <em>In re Estate of Snyder, </em>\u00b6 10. The Trust Agreement\u2019s language contradicts the Trustee\u2019s and the Board\u2019s assertions that general philanthropy constituted the Trust\u2019s primary purpose, and we conclude that the Trust Agreement sets forth the establishment of the Museum as the primary purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">\u00b644 II. Did the District Court correctly determine that the Board did not breach its fiduciary duties to the Trust?</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\u00b645 The State argues that the Board violated its fiduciary duties when it failed to use \u201cwhatever principal and income of the [Trust] that is necessary to establish, improve and maintain the museum,\u201d when it failed to give the Museum \u201cfirst priority on income to be distributed from the Trust[,]\u201d and when it closed the Museum without first determining that the Museum had ceased to serve its purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\u00b646 Fiduciary duties arise as a matter of law in trustee relationships. Sections 72-34-101 to 72-34-207, MCA. Fiduciary duties include the duty to administer the trust according to the trust instrument, \u00a7 72-34-101, MCA; the duty of loyalty, \u00a7 72-34-103, MCA; the duty to use ordinary skill and prudence, \u00a7 72-34-114, MCA; and the duty to exercise discretionary powers reasonably, \u00a7 72-34-129, MCA. Further, a trustee must comply with the trustee\u2019s fiduciary duties when exercising the powers granted by a trust instrument. Section 72-34-303, MCA. We require that trustees perform their duties with \u201cthe punctilio of an honor the most sensitive ....\u201d <em>Murphy v. Redland, </em>178 Mont. 296, 309, 583 P.2d 1049, 1056 (1978) (quoting <em>Meinhard v. Salmon, </em>164 N.E. 545, 546 (N.Y. 1928)). Alberta Bair\u2019s Trust Agreement assigned duties to both the Trustee and the Board, and the parties agree that both the Trustee and the Board owed fiduciary duties to the Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">\u00b647 Whether a party has breached a duty generally presents a question of fact. <em>See e.g. Simmons v. Jenkins, </em>230 Mont. 429, 435, 750 P.2d 1067, 1071 (1988) (discussing breach of the duty of good faith). We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>Slauson, </em>\u00b6 10. A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that the district court committed a mistake. <em>Slauson, </em>\u00b6 10. Implicit in the District Court\u2019s decision that the Board acted reasonably is the finding that the Board and the Trustee did not breach their fiduciary duties to the Trust:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">this Court finds and concludes that the Board of Advisors has aptly managed and overseen the duties with which they were charged. They have successfully and appropriately managed their part of the financial affairs of the trust; they have created, implemented, and funded the museum; and they have managed, improved, maintained and repaired the museum. In performing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>their duties, the Board has hired architects, engineers, museum consultants and appraisers. The Board has exercised its discretion with considered forethought and reasoning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">\u00b648 However, as discussed under Issue I, the District Court erroneously determined that the creation of the Museum was a discretionary decision. In light of the District Court\u2019s erroneous interpretation of the Trust Agreement, the District Court applied a deferential standard to the entirety of the Board\u2019s conduct relating to the Museum. As set forth below, based on our review of the record and considering the Board\u2019s and the Trustee\u2019s fiduciary duties imposed by law and under the Trust Agreement, we conclude that the District Court misapprehended the effect of the evidence and erred when it determined that the Board complied with its fiduciary duties. <em>Slauson, </em>\u00b610.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">A. <em>Did the Board violate its fiduciary duty by failing \u201cto use whatever principal and income\u201d of the Trust necessary to \u201cestablish, improve and maintain\u201d the Museum?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\u00b649 The State argues that the Board breached its fiduciary duty to the Trust by choosing the \u201ccheapest options possible\u201d when establishing the Museum, by failing to acquire the Bair residence and grounds, and by delegating its duty to administer and manage the Museum to CMR on a year-to-year operating contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">\u00b650 The Board responds that the Trust\u2019s primary purpose was general philanthropy, rather than the Museum, but that it nonetheless \u201cassumed the task of establishing the Museum judiciously ....\u201d In support of its claim, the Board points to testimony from Michael O\u2019Leary, an architect with CTA, who testified that the Board expressed no reluctance or unwillingness to complete work that O\u2019Leary felt was necessary to open the Museum. The Board also cites to testimony from Lee Rostad, a member of the Friends of the Bair and a former member of the Board. Rostad testified that, during her tenure on the Board, she voted in favor of every dollar spent and that she never moved the Board to dedicate more money to the Museum.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">\u00b651 The Board further asserts that the Trust Agreement vested the Board with \u201cthe absolute discretion to determine what amount of Trust income and principal was necessary to establish, improve, and maintain the Museum.\u201d The Board relies on the <em>Restatement (Second) of Trusts for </em>the proposition that, when a trust grants a board discretion to use whatever trust property the board deems necessary, a court should refrain from interfering with the board\u2019s discretion provided the board \u201capplies at least the minimum amount which could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>reasonably be considered necessary....\u201d Section 187 cmt. e (1959). The Trustee then argues that the word \u201cnecessary\u201d can have a multitude of meanings and asserts that the term required the Board to spend only the amount \u201creasonably required\u201d for the Museum. The Board contends that it \u201c[c]learly ... dedicated more than \u2018the minimum amount which could reasonably be considered necessary\u2019 to the Museum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">\u00b652 Trustees have a duty to \u201cadminister the trust according to the trust instrument\u201d and according to Montana law. Section 72-34-101, MCA. In accomplishing the trust\u2019s purposes, trustees must exercise the \u201ccare, skill, prudence, and diligence\u201d of a prudent person. Section 72-34-114, MCA. A trustor may modify these standards by including express provisions in the trust instrument. Section 72-34-114, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"ACL\">\u00b653 The Board\u2019s and the Trustee\u2019s arguments emanate from their fundamental misunderstanding of the Trust Agreement. The Board and the Trustee share the misconception that the Museum did not constitute the Trust\u2019s primary purpose; as discussed under Issue I, the Museum constituted the Trust\u2019s primary purpose. Further, the plain language of the Trust Agreement contradicts the Board\u2019s claim of \u201cabsolute discretion.\u201d The Trust Agreement provides that the Board \u201cis directed to use whatever principal and income of the [Trust] <em>that is necessary </em>to establish, improve and maintain the museum, and shall have full discretion and authority to administer and manage the same.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Though the Trust Agreement grants the Board discretion to administer and manage the Museum, it grants the Board no discretion regarding the amount of principal and income to use in establishing, improving, and maintaining the Museum. On the contrary, the Trust Agreement directs the Board to use the amount of principal and income that actually is necessary to establish the Museum. In carrying out this directive, the Board was required to give the Museum a fair opportunity to succeed; the Board was required to exercise the \u201ccare, skill, prudence, and diligence\u201d of a prudent person. Section 72-34-114, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u00b654 The Board and the Trustee misplace their reliance on the <em>Restatement </em>for a definition of the word \u201cnecessary\u201d as the <em>Restatement </em>is both inapplicable to the language of the Trust Agreement and incongruent to Montana law. The <em>Restatement </em>provides that <em>\u201cif </em>the trustee is empowered to apply so much of the trust property as he may deem necessary\u201d courts will not interfere with a trustee\u2019s discretion provided the trustee applies \u201cat least the minimum amount which could reasonably be considered necessary <em>....\u2019\u2019Restatement (Second) of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number><em>Trusts </em>\u00a7 187 cmt. e (emphasis added). As discussed in \u00b6 53, however, the Trust Agreement specifically does not empower the Board to apply the amount of trust property it \u201cmay deem necessary\u201d; rather, it requires the Board to spend the amount of principal and income that actually is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u00b655 The Board\u2019s and the Trustee\u2019s proffered definition of \u201cnecessary\u201d also clashes with our rules of interpretation, which require that we construe an instrument\u2019s words in their \u201cordinary and grammatical sense ....\u201d <em>In re Estate of Snyder, </em>\u00b6 10 (citations omitted). Further, we refuse to apply a limited interpretation of the word \u201cnecessary,\u201d when the Trust Agreement itself contains no limiting language. <em>Matter of Estate of Lindgren, </em>268 Mont. 96, 100, 885 P.2d 1280, 1282 (1994). In this case, we need not comprehensively define \u201cnecessary\u201d because the Board\u2019s conduct in establishing, improving, and maintaining the Museum falls below even the limited definition offered by the Board and the Trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\u00b656 Following Alberta Bair\u2019s death, the Board hired Leavengood Architects and CTA Architects Engineers to provide assessments and recommendations for converting the Bair Family residence into a museum. The Leavengood Study noted that converting a residence into a museum would require the \u201coverhaul of many systems ... to protect the art collection and accommodate visitors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\u00b657 The Leavengood Study and CTA\u2019s Master Plan informed the Board of many challenges and concerns presented by the Bair Ranch, including inadequate fire suppression systems, inadequate security systems to protect against theft, and inadequate air-handling systems to protect the Museum\u2019s collection. Based on the remoteness of location and the lack of a professional fire-fighting department, the Leavengood Study recommended that the Board install a fire-sprinkler system as part of its fire-protection system. Similarly, CTA\u2019s Master Plan indicated the need for a fire-sprinkler water supply, and CTA proposed three different options to the Board for procuring a fire-sprinkler water supply. The Leavengood Study recommended that the Board consider using closed-circuit monitors and security personnel to minimize the risks of theft during the Bair Family residence\u2019s transition to a museum and noted that a more comprehensive security system would be needed after the museum was established. Both the Leavengood Study and CTA\u2019s Master Plan also recommended installing a new air-handling system that would provide stable temperature and humidity levels to protect the Museum\u2019s objects and archives from deterioration. Additionally, both the Leavengood Study and CTA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Master Plan advised the Board to construct additional structures to facilitate the Museum. The Leavengood Study estimated the costs for pre-planning of the museum facility to be between $1,935,375 and $2,517,320, and CTA estimated the preliminary costs at $1,023,200.</p>\n<p id=\"Ax_\">\u00b658 Despite the recommendations from Leavengood and CTA, the Board failed to address the absence of a fire-sprinkler system-a concern Leavengood described as \u201cparamount,\u201d and that CTA described as a high priority safety and security item. The Board also failed to install a new air-handling system to protect the Museum\u2019s collection. The CTA budget finally approved by the Board featured a truncated version of CTA\u2019s already abbreviated \u201cRevised Project Cost Analysis-Minimum Operation,\u201d which estimated the cost of converting the Bair Ranch House to a museum at $328,000. The adopted proposal featured no improvements to the temperature and humidity systems or fire-sprinkler systems. The adopted proposal also included no mention of a security system or the construction of additional structures for the Museum. When it approved CTA\u2019s $328,000 proposal, the Trust was valued at approximately $23,000,000, and the Board had access to approximately $8,500,000 in Trust principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u00b659 Though the Board ultimately spent approximately $600,000 on converting the Bair Ranch to the Museum, the Board failed to remedy the inadequate fire-protection system, the inadequate air-handling system, and to maintain an adequate security system. The Board also failed to construct additional buildings for the Museum. However, the Board cited to the absence of each of these items to support its decision to permanently close the Museum: according to the Board and the Trustee, the decision to close the Museum was based on multiple considerations, including the \u201crisk of theft;\u201d the \u201crisk of damage to fine art by keeping it in a house without proper environmental controls;\u201d the \u201crisk of fire and limited fire protection in the area associated;\u201d and \u201cspace limitation[s] in the home that made it difficult to rotate and display the art and artifacts....\u201d Though a security system initially was installed at the Museum, the record reveals that the Board later specifically rejected the installation of surveillance cameras at the Museum, and the Board\u2019s reliance on the risk of theft as a justification to close the Museum indicates that the Board failed to properly maintain the security system. By relying on these factors to justify closing the Museum, the Board implicitly acknowledged that addressing these deficiencies at the outset was necessary to properly establish and maintain the Museum.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u00b660  The Board breached its duty to administer the Trust according <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>to the trust instrument and breached its duty to administer the trust with the \u201ccare, skill, prudence, and diligence\u201d of a prudent person when it failed to install a fire-prevention system, failed to install a proper air-handling system, failed to maintain an appropriate security system, and when it failed to build additional structures for the Museum. Sections 72-34-101 and 72-34-114, MCA. Although the Board considered the Bair Ranch\u2019s inadequate systems and buildings as factors supporting its decision to close the Museum, the Board\u2019s initial failure to address these limitations, especially in light of Leavengood\u2019s and CTA\u2019s recommendations, more accurately demonstrates the Board\u2019s failure to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Trust. The Board\u2019s failures to address the non-existent fire-sprinkler system, the deficient air-handling system, the insufficient security system, and the Museum\u2019s space limitations constitute breaches of the Trust Agreement\u2019s directive to \u201cuse whatever principal and income of the [Trust] that is necessary to establish, improve and maintain the museum ....\u201d As the Board chairman so aptly observed in his 2003 email to the Trust members regarding repairs, the Museum \u201cwas never really made \u2018museum ready\u2019 in 1995 when it opened.\u201d We agree with the Board chairman\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u00b661 The Board\u2019s failure to make the Museum \u201cmuseum-ready\u201d constitutes a breach of the Board\u2019s fiduciary duty to the Trust. Though the Board has consisted of different individual members since its inception, the current Board is liable for the breaches of predecessor Boards. The Board\u2019s Memorandum of Decision closing the Museum establishes that the current Board knew of situations \u201cconstituting a breach of trust committed by the predecessor\u201d Boards and that the current Board failed to redress those breaches of trust. Section 72-34-504, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\u00b662 The State also argues that the Board breached its fiduciary duties to the Trust by leasing the \u201chouse and grounds from a bank-controlled entity on terms that would not allow the Trust to recoup any investments in improvements.\u201d According to the State, the Trust Agreement \u201cclearly contemplated\u201d the purchase of the Bair residence and surrounding grounds. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\u00b663  We seek to determine the trustor\u2019s intent from the language of the trust agreement. <em>Matter of Estate of Bolinger, </em>284 Mont. at 120, 943 P.2d at 985.

In fulfilling its purposes of opening the museum ... the Board of Advisors shall have the authority to acquire required additional land, erect and/or maintain existing structures suitable to the operation of a museum....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">(Paragraph breaks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u00b664 In 1994, the Trustee entered into a five-year lease, with a three-year renewal option, for the Bair Family residence and the surrounding grounds and outbuildings with THE BAIR CO., a Montana corporation that later became the Bair Ranch Foundation. The lease provided that, at the end of the five-year term, the Trustee \u201cshall surrender the leased premises and improvements to [the Bair Ranch Foundation] in as good a condition\u201d as at the beginning of the term. Further, the lease provided that any non-removable improvements or additions would become the Bair Ranch Foundation\u2019s property and that the Trustee was entitled to no compensation for the improvements or additions. The lease functioned as more than a token formality: the Trust Administrator testified that the Board would be required to obtain the Bair Ranch Foundation\u2019s permission before the Board could build another restroom at the Museum\u2019s visitor center.</p>\n<p id=\"APN\">\u00b665 The Trust Agreement simply does not authorize the Board to enter into a short-term lease to rent the residence and outbuildings; rather, it sets forth Alberta Bair\u2019s will that the Board \u201cdevote\u201d the residence to the establishment of the Museum. The verb \u201cdevote\u201d means \u201c1. To give or apply (one\u2019s time, attention, or self) entirely to a particular activity, pursuit, cause, or person. 2. To set apart for a specific purpose or use.... 3. To set apart by or as if by a vow or solemn act; consecrate ...\u201d <em>American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>497 (4th ed. Houghton Mifflin Co. 2000). The \u201cordinary and grammatical sense\u201d of the verb \u201cdevote\u201d carries more import than the Board grasped. <em>In re Estate of Snyder, </em>\u00b6 10. In short, the Board could not \u201cset apart\u201d Alberta Bair\u2019s entire residence, the surrounding grounds, and the outbuildings for the establishment of a museum that would \u201cperpetuate the historic and artistic significance\u201d of the Bair Ranch when it possessed only a five-year lease and was required to ask for permission to build a restroom. Moreover, the Trust Agreement granted the Board the authority to \u201cacquire required additional land, erect and/or maintain existing structures suitable to the operation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>a museum ....\u201d Underlying the use of the term \u201cadditional\u201d is the presumption that the Board would already have acquired the residence and the surrounding outbuildings. We conclude that the Board\u2019s failure to purchase the Bair Family residence constitutes a breach of the Trust Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u00b666 The State also argues that the Board breached its fiduciary duties when it delegated its duty to \u201cadminister and manage\u201d the Museum to CMR rather than establishing a separate charitable entity to operate the Museum, as authorized by the Trust Agreement. The State points to the current Board chairman\u2019s statement-that the Museum \u201cband-aided itself along through it\u2019s [sic] 8 years of operations\u201d and Peter Hassrick\u2019s statement-that \u201cthe Bair Museum was given what I would call \u2018step-child\u2019 treatment and not afforded a fair chance to survive on its true merits\u201d-to illustrate the Board\u2019s failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b667 The State\u2019s argument that the Board\u2019s delegation constitutes a breach of its duty to \u201cadminister and manage\u201d the Museum presents a closer question because the Trust Agreement granted the Board \u201cfull discretion and authority to administer and manage\u201d the Museum. Discretionary powers must be exercised reasonably. Section 72-34-129, MCA. We conclude that the Board did not breach its duty to the Trust when it delegated the Museum\u2019s management to CMR. The Board members had no prior experience managing a museum, and, though it may have been reasonable for the Board to establish a separate legal entity to manage the Museum, we cannot say that it was unreasonable for the Board to hire CMR to manage the operations of the Museum. Though Hassrick\u2019s and the Board chairman\u2019s comments arguably may suggest that the Board failed to comply with its duty under \u00a7 72-34-113, MCA, to \u201cexercise general supervision\u201d over CMR, that issue is not before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">\n<em>B. Did the Board violate its fiduciary duty by failing to give the Museum \u201cfirst priority\u201d on the income that the Board distributed from the Trust?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">\u00b668 The State argues that the Board breached its duty to give the Museum first priority on the Trust\u2019s income by disbursing more money through charitable grant-making than it spent to support the Museum. According to the State, the Trust Agreement\u2019s provision that the Museum \u201cshall have first priority on income to be distributed from the Trust\u201d means that the Museum was to receive more money than other recipients. The State argues that the Board\u2019s failure to grant the Museum first priority on income arises from the Board\u2019s lack of a formal conflict of interest policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>\u00b669 The Board and the Trustee respond that \u201cfirst priority\u201d means that the Board was required to provide the Museum the \u201cfirst right to the income to be distributed[,]\u201d not that the Board was \u201crequired to grant the Museum more money ....\u201d The Trustee maintains that the Trust Agreement requires the Board to grant the Museum \u201cfirst crack at whatever amount it reasonably required in the event there is a shortage of available Trust income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">\u00b670  We seek to determine the trustor\u2019s intent from the language of the trust agreement. <em>Matter of Estate of Bolinger, </em>284 Mont. at 120, 943 P.2d at 985. The Trust Agreement requires the Board to use \u201cwhatever principal and income of the [Trust] that is necessary to establish, improve and maintain the museum\u201d and provides that the Museum \u201cshall have first priority on income to be distributed from the Trust by the Board of Advisors.\u201d The Board breached its duty to the Trust -under either of the offered definitions of \u201cfirst priority.\u201d As discussed in \u00b6\u00b6 60-61, the Board failed to distribute the necessary amount of principal and income to establish, improve, and maintain the Museum; the Board has yet to make the Museum \u201cmuseum-ready.\u201d Nonetheless, in every year since the Trust\u2019s inception, the Board has distributed money through charitable grants. Regardless of the definition of \u201cfirst priority,\u201d the Board\u2019s failure to properly fund the Museum while at the same time making charitable distributions demonstrates the Board\u2019s failure to accord the Museum first priority to the Trust\u2019s income. The Board\u2019s failure to give the Museum first priority on income constitutes a breach of its duty to administer the Trust according to the Trust Agreement. Section 72-34-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\n<em>C. Did the Board violate its fiduciary duty by closing the Museum without first finding that it had \u201cceased to serve the purposes thereof so as to make it inadvisable to continue the museum for public and educational purposes\u201d?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\u00b671 The State contends that the Board breached its fiduciary duties by closing the Museum without first determining that the Museum had \u201cceased to serve\u201d its scholarly, educational and historical purposes. The State argues that, rather than determining that the Museum had ceased to serve its purposes, the Board determined that the Museum could better serve its purposes elsewhere. According to the State, the Board\u2019s rationales for closing the Museum fail to show that the Museum had ceased to serve its purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">\u00b672 The Board and the Trustee respond that the Trust Agreement grants the Board \u201cunfettered or absolute discretion to close the Museum, if, \u2018acting in it\u2019s [sic] sole judgment and discretion\u2019 the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>determines that the Museum no longer meets the scholarly, educational and historical purposes \u2018so as to make it inadvisable to continue the museum for public and educational purposes.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added by the Board.) The Board asserts that, absent an abuse of discretion, principles of trust law preclude a court from overruling the Board\u2019s discretionary decision to close the Museum. The Board and the Trustee then set forth a litany of reasons relied on in making the decision to close the Museum.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\u00b673 We seek to determine the trustor\u2019s intent from the language of the trust agreement. <em>Matter of Estate of Bolinger, </em>284 Mont. at 120, 943 P.2d at 985. The Trust Agreement provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">If, at any time following the fifth anniversary of [Alberta Bair\u2019s] death, the Board of Advisors, acting in its sole judgment and discretion, shall determine that the [Museum] has ceased to serve the purposes thereof so as to make it inadvisable to continue the museum for public and educational purposes, ... then and in any such event the [Board] is thereupon authorized and empowered to sell, transfer, relocate the museum, or otherwise dispose of all of the property then held as a part of the [Museum]....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The language of the Trust Agreement grants the Board the authority to close the Museum if certain conditions were satisfied. The Trust Agreement\u2019s grant of \u201csole judgment and discretion,\u201d clearly expresses Alberta Bair\u2019s intent that the Board should have significant discretion to determine whether the Museum had ceased to serve its purposes. Nevertheless, the Board\u2019s claim of \u201cunfettered\u201d discretion overstates the Trust Agreement\u2019s grant of authority. The Trust Agreement specifies that the \u201capplicable statutes of the State of Montana and the decisions of its courts\u201d apply to the Board\u2019s and the Trustee\u2019s powers. Montana law provides that a trustee endowed with \u201cabsolute\u201d or \u201csole\u201d discretion must \u201cact in accordance with fiduciary principles and may not act in disregard of the purposes of the trust.\u201d Section 72-34-130, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">\u00b674 Additionally, charitable trusts significantly differ from private trusts. While private trusts generally have easily identifiable beneficiaries who possess standing to enforce a trust, charitable trusts generally have no beneficiaries empowered to enforce a trust; individuals receive a benefit because \u201cthey are conduits through whom the social gains flow and not because they are beneficiaries who can qualify as enforcers of the trust.\u201d Ronald Chester, George Gleason Bogert &amp; George Taylor Bogert, <em>The Law of Trusts and Trustees </em>\u00a7 411, 2 (3d ed., West 2005). The public benefits emanating from charitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>trusts justify the traditional selection of the Attorney General\u2019s office as the enforcer of charitable trusts because the Attorney General\u2019s office serves as the protector of a state\u2019s citizens. Chester et al., <em>The Law of Trusts and Trustees </em>at \u00a7 411, 3. Accordingly, a charitable trust is never truly \u201cunfettered\u201d because the Attorney General\u2019s office always serves as the \u201cprotector, supervisor, and enforcer of charitable trusts.\u201d Chester et al., <em>The Law of Trusts and Trustees </em>at \u00a7 411, 3. In Montana, the Attorney General has the statutory right and obligation to initiate a lawsuit to enforce a charitable trust. Section 72-33-503, MCA. Thus, under Montana law, both the Attorney General\u2019s office and the courts play vital roles in the oversight of charitable trusts. In light of these parameters, the proper standard is whether the Board complied with its fiduciary duties and its duties under the Trust Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">\u00b675 The Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors, in <em>Conway v. Emeny, </em>96 A.2d 221 (Conn. 1953), addressed the scope of \u201cabsolute discretion\u201d under strikingly similar facts. In <em>Conway, </em>the testator left her home to trustees to maintain as a museum for the general public. Her will provided that, \u201cat any time after three years from the probating of her will\u201d the trustees, by a two-thirds vote, \u201cshould \u2018in their absolute discretion determine that there is not sufficient public interest in the Museum to warrant continuing to maintain\u2019 it, the trust ... should terminate, and all of the museum property ... should be transferred to the bank in trust\u201d for a local school\u2019s benefit. <em>Conway, </em>96 A.2d at 222. Relying on their grant of absolute discretion, the trustees voted to close the museum. The court noted that the trustees considered factors other than whether the museum had sufficient public interest, including what the testator would have done if she were still living and financial difficulties they feared the museum might face in the future. The court noted that none of the individual trustees voting to close the museum were \u201cactuated solely or principally by the belief that there was not sufficient public interest in the museum to keep it open.\u201d <em>Conway, </em>96 A.2d at 223-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u00b676 The Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors held that the trustees violated their duties by considering standards other than public interest. <em>Conway, </em>96 A.2d at 225. The court stated that, though the word \u201cabsolute\u201d gave the trustees considerable discretion, the discretion was not unlimited. The court then cited to three conditions that the testator imposed on the trustees\u2019 discretion: (1) the museum could not be closed in the initial three years following the will\u2019s probate; (2) two-thirds of the trustees had to approve of the museum\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>closure; and (3) the trustees were required to, \u201cin their absolute discretion determine that there is not sufficient public interest in the Museum to warrant\u2019 their maintaining it.\u201d <em>Conway, </em>96 A.2d at 224. The court stated that, although the third condition conferred discretion on the trustees, the testator had \u201cset the standard for exercising discretion\u201d: insufficient public interest. <em>Conway, </em>96 A.2d at 224. According to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-4\">The stubborn fact which the [trustees] cannot avoid is that, wisely or not, the testatrix established a standard to guide the trastees and to limit their action. This was whether there was sufficient public interest in the museum to warrant continuing to maintain it. It was the duty of the trustees to conform strictly to the directions which the testatrix gave. Trustees have no powers not expressly or impliedly conferred on them by the terms of the trust.... Their obligation to obey the instructions of the donor of the trust is the cornerstone upon which all other duties rest.... The failure of the trustees to apply the standard of public interest in reaching their decision to close the museum was a violation of their duty. They took unto themselves a power not granted them by the will.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-5\"><em>Conway, </em>96 A.2d at 224-25 (citations omitted). The court noted that the trustees violated their duties to the trust by ignoring the testator\u2019s sole standard even if their purposes were commendable and even though the trustees did not act for personal gain. <em>Conway, </em>96 A.2d at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"AeO\">\u00b677 In this case, the Trust Agreement\u2019s language granting the Board \u201csole judgment and discretion\u201d expresses Alberta Bair\u2019s intent that the Board should possess considerable discretion. As in <em>Conway, </em>however, the Trust Agreement imposes conditions on the Board\u2019s discretion: (1) absent destruction by \u201cfire or other cause[,]\u201d the Museum could not be closed in the five years following Alberta Bair\u2019s death; (2) a majority of the Board had to approve the Museum\u2019s closure; and (3) the Board was required to determine, exercising its sole discretion, that the Museum had \u201cceased to serve\u201d the scholarly, educational, and historical purposes to the extent that it was \u201cinadvisable to continue the museum for public and educational purposes ....\u201d As in <em>Conway, </em>although the third condition grants the Board discretion, the Trust Agreement plainly sets the standard that the Board must consider when exercising that discretion: the Museum must have ceased to serve its purposes to such an extent that it is inadvisable to continue the Museum.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\u00b678 In its 2005 Memorandum, the Board explained the reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>underlying its decision to permanently close the Museum, including declining attendance, the Bair collection\u2019s increased value, the costs associated with reopening and running the Museum, and the remoteness of the Museum\u2019s location. In their briefing to this Court, the Board and the Trustee present an expanded catalog of reasons justifying the Board\u2019s decision to permanently close the Museum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-4\">(1) steadily declining attendance, despite significant advertising; (2) risk of theft; (3) risk of damage to fine art by keeping it in a house without proper environmental controls; (4) risk of fire and limited fire protection in the area associated; (5) steady increase in the value of the fine art, which multiplied the risks of fire, theft or damage due to improper environmental controls; (6) lack of community support in buying annual memberships; (7) alternatives that could allow more people to experience the historical and educational aspects of the Bair Collection, as outlined by its expert Peter Hassrick; (8) space limitation in the home that made it difficult to rotate and display the art and artifacts; and (9) the inability to alter many of the conditions that were of concern, no matter how much money was spent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Though the Board\u2019s and the Trustee\u2019s concerns may be valid, they fail to justify the Museum\u2019s closure because they fail to address the standard required by Alberta Bair\u2019s Trust Agreement. At the time she executed her Trust Agreement, Alberta Bair contemplated many of the concerns cited by the Board and the Trustee. For example, Alberta Bair certainly was aware of Martinsdale\u2019s remote location, the risks associated with fire, and the space limitations of the Bair Ranch house. In fact, Alberta Bair specifically acknowledged in the Trust Agreement that fire posed a risk to the Museum, and the Trust Agreement authorized the Board to dispose of the Museum and the remaining property if a fire so damaged the property that repair became impossible, impractical, or inadvisable. Further, Alberta Bair clearly recognized that the Bair Ranch house and surrounding buildings may prove insufficient to the Museum\u2019s needs; accordingly, the Trust Agreement authorized the Board to \u201cacquire required additional land,\u201d and to \u201cerect and/or maintain existing structures suitable\u201d to the Museum\u2019s operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\u00b679 Moreover, many of the Board\u2019s and the Trustee\u2019s justifications for closing the Museum result from the Board\u2019s breach of its duty to \u201cuse whatever principal and income\u201d necessary to establish the Museum. As early as 1993, the Board knew of the risks presented by fire damage and the limited availability of fire protection, the risks of loss from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>theft, the risk to the collection from improper environmental controls, and the Museum\u2019s possible space limitations. The Leavengood Study and the CTA Master Plan identified these concerns and provided recommendations to the Board. As discussed in \u00b6\u00b6 60-61, the Board\u2019s failures to initially address these areas constitute breaches of its fiduciary duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">\u00b680 The Board\u2019s and the Trustee\u2019s justifications relating to the art collection\u2019s increase in value, the Museum\u2019s declining attendance, and the lack of annual memberships in the community also fail to address the standard required by the Trust Agreement. In the interim between the Museum\u2019s temporary closure and permanent closure, the value of the art collection increased from $4,792,232 to $6,690,532. This increase in value is consistent with prior increases, according to Sotheby\u2019s appraisals. While such increases in value may motivate the Board to purchase additional insurance or to address inadequacies in fire and theft protection, we fail to see how such dramatic increases could be anything short of a boon to a rural museum - they provide absolutely no support to the Board\u2019s determination that the Museum had ceased to serve its purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u00b681 Additionally, the Board and the Trustee both acknowledge that the Museum enjoyed more than 4,000 visitors in every year that it was open. Though the Board is correct to address the Museum\u2019s declining attendance, the record fails to support the Board\u2019s claim that the Museum\u2019s declining attendance is \u201cirreversible.\u201d Both CMR and Peter Hassrick offered suggestions to address the declining attendance, including hiring a professional museum administrator to give year-round attention to marketing and fund-raising, as well as to handle other responsibilities; underwriting public radio programs; creating traveling exhibits throughout Montana; and expanding the educational outreach by negotiating with Montana State University to offer courses related to the Museum\u2019s collection and exhibits. Further, at no point has the Board set forth a level of attendance at which the Museum would cease to serve its scholarly, educational, and historical purposes. Although the Board justifiably may be concerned with the Museum\u2019s declining attendance, a museum that educates 4,000 visitors a year has not yet ceased to serve its purposes under any standard.</p>\n<p id=\"Aii\">\u00b682 Moreover, the Trustee finds no refuge in its assertion that the Trust Agreement\u2019s language-that the Board has the discretion to close the Museum if the Board determines that the Museum \u201chas ceased to serve the purposes thereof so as to make it inadvisable to continue the museum for public and educational purposes\u2019-focuses on whether it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>\u201cinadvisable\u201d to continue the Museum, rather than whether the Museum has \u201cceased to serve\u201d its purposes. Since Alberta Bair\u2019s death, the Board has hired at least five experts to advise the Board on the Museum\u2019s operation. None of the Board\u2019s experts have advised the Board that the Museum can no longer serve its public and educational purposes. On the contrary, the Board\u2019s first expert, Leavengood, stated that the Museum had the \u201cpotential of being a world-class institution.... [T]he museum\u2019s future is bright and needs only careful guidance.\u201d Similarly, the Board\u2019s most recent expert, Hassrick, provided the Board a detailed proposal for reopening the Museum in Martinsdale and stated that the Museum was a \u201cunique experience for the region.... There is certainly nothing like the Bair Museum in Montana....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b683  The Board\u2019s Memorandum of Decision closing the Museum indicates that, rather than following the Trust Agreement and inquiring whether the Museum had ceased to serve its purposes, the Board instead sought to determine whether the Museum\u2019s purposes could be better served elsewhere. The Board\u2019s Memorandum reflects this new standard: \u201c[t]he Board has determined that the educational, scholarly, and artistic purposes of the Museum can be better served by its exhibition in an area more accessible and more populated.\u201d The Board concluded its Memorandum by stating that \u201cthe Board is determined that the story of the Bair Family and its remarkable place in Montana\u2019s history will be told, and told more effectively and to more individuals than ever possible at the Museum in Martinsdale.\u201d The Board granted itself a power not granted by the Trust Agreement when it sought to determine whether the Museum\u2019s purposes could be better served elsewhere, rather than considering whether the Museum had ceased to serve its purposes. While the Board\u2019s quest to more effectively tell the Bair Family\u2019s story may be commendable, it is nonetheless a breach of the Board\u2019s duty to the Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u00b684 III. Did the District Court correctly determine that the Friends of the Bair had standing to intervene in this action?</p>\n<p id=\"AmS\">\u00b685 In its cross-appeal, the Trustee asserts that the District Court erroneously determined that the Friends of the Bair had a \u201cspecial interest\u201d in the Trust, and thus, the District Court incorrectly allowed the Friends of the Bair standing to intervene in this action. The Friends of the Bair respond that their special interest in the Bair Trust grants them standing. The Friends of the Bair propose that we consider four factors to determine whether a party has standing to enforce a charitable trust: (1) the \u201cextraordinary nature of the acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>complained of and the remedy sought by the plaintiff\u2019; (2) the \u201cpresence of fraud or misconduct on the part of the charity or its directors\u201d; (3) the \u201cattorney general\u2019s availability or effectiveness\u201d; and (4) the \u201cthe nature of the benefited class and its relationship to the charity.\u201d Additionally, the Friends of the Bair claim that Lee Rostad, a member of the Friends of the Bair, has standing based on her position as a former Board member.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b686 Under Montana law, the Attorney General, a co-trustee, or a person possessing a \u201cspecial interest in the enforcement of the charitable trust\u201d has standing to sue to enforce a charitable trust. Section 72-33-503, MCA. A district court\u2019s determination on standing is a conclusion of law, which we review for correctness. <em>Druffel v. Board of Adjustment, </em>2007 MT 220, \u00b6 9, 339 Mont. 57, \u00b6 9, 168 P.3d 640, \u00b6 9. However, we refuse to render advisory opinions, and if our judgment will not grant effective relief, the matter is moot. <em>Clark v. Roosevelt County, </em>2007 MT 44, \u00b6 11, 336 Mont. 118, \u00b6 11, 154 P.3d 48, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u00b687 We decline to resolve whether the District Court erred when it determined that the Friends of the Bair had standing in this matter. As the Trustee correctly observes, the Attorney General has the \u201cright and obligation to represent the public in matters involving charitable trusts ....\u201d Further, the Trustee notes that the Attorney General intervened in the present litigation \u201cas a matter of right, on behalf of the State of Montana.\u201d Since the State is a proper party and has appealed the District Court\u2019s decision, the Trustee is a party to the appeal regardless of the Friends of the Bair\u2019s presence. To decide whether the Friends of the Bair have standing would amount to nothing more than an academic exercise; even if we concluded that the District Court erred, our decision would grant no effective relief to the parties and would yield only an impermissible advisory opinion. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b611.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">\u00b688 IV. The proper remedy for the Board\u2019s breach of its fiduciary duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\u00b689 The State requests that we remand this case to the District Court to order the removal of the Trustee and the Board from the Museum and the Bair collection. The State further requests that we direct the District Court to order the creation of an independent charitable entity to operate the Museum and that the entity receive sufficient Trust funds to endow the permanent support of the Museum and its collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">\u00b690 Several remedies exist for breach of a trust. For example, a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>may compel the trustee to perform its duties, enjoin the trustee from breaching the trust, compel the trustee to redress a breach of trust, appoint a receiver or temporary trustee to administer the trust, or remove the trustee. Sections 72-33-618 and 72-34-506, MCA. The remedies for breach of trust lie exclusively in equity. Section 72-34-507, MCA. When sitting in equity, we are empowered to do complete justice, including the power to fashion an equitable result. <em>In re Guardianship of Saylor, </em>2005 MT 236, \u00b6 33, 328 Mont. 415, \u00b6 33, 121 P.3d 532, \u00b6 33 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b691  The Trust Agreement granted the Trustee no power to determine the amount of principal and income necessary to establish, improve, and maintain the Museum. Nor did the Trust Agreement grant the Trustee a decision-making role in determining whether to close the Museum. The Trust Agreement directed the Board to spend the necessary principal and income to establish, improve, and maintain the Museum, and the Trust Agreement granted the Board the decision-making power to close the Museum, subject to the standard set forth in the Trust Agreement. Though the Trust Administrator appears to have played a part in the Board\u2019s decision to close the Museum, the Board made the decisions regarding the Museum. The Board, not the Trustee, breached its fiduciary duties to the Trust by failing to spend \u201cwhatever principal and income\u201d of the Trust that was \u201cnecessary to establish, improve and maintain\u201d the Museum. The Board, not the Trustee, breached its fiduciary duties to the Trust by closing the Museum without determining that the Museum had \u201cceased to serve the purposes thereof so as to make it inadvisable to continue the museum for public and educational purposes ....\u201d We conclude that removing the Trustee from the Trust is unnecessary considering that the Trustee breached no duty to the Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u00b692  The Board\u2019s breaches of its fiduciary duties to the Trust do not appear to stem from any bad-faith motives on the part of the Board, but rather from the Board\u2019s misconception that the Museum was not the primary purpose of the Trust. The Board\u2019s misconception resulted in the Museum receiving less than it deserved and less than Alberta Bair\u2019s Trust Agreement demanded. As a result of the Board\u2019s failure to spend \u201cwhatever principal and income of the Charles M. Bair Family Trust that is necessary to establish, improve and maintain the museum,\u201d the Museum never received a fair opportunity to succeed; the Museum was destined for failure, rather than success. The Board\u2019s ensuing breaches emanated from this initial failure. Given that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Board\u2019s misconceptions led to the Board\u2019s breaches of its duties, we deem it appropriate that the Board redress its breaches of trust with the proper understanding of the Museum as the primary purpose of the Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b693 Thus, we reverse the District Court, and we instruct the Trustee to appoint a new Board in accordance with Section 6.2(d) of the Trust Agreement. Section 6.2(d) of the Trust Agreement provides that the Board shall consist of five persons: the president of the First Trust Company of Montana, or the president\u2019s nominee; the president of First Bank (N.A.), or the president\u2019s nominee; the president of Moulton, Bellingham, Longo &amp; Mather, P.C., or the president\u2019s nominee; and two individuals designated by the Trustee from the counties of Meagher, Wheatland, and Yellowstone, with not more than one member appointed from either Meagher or Wheatland county.</p>\n<p id=\"Alx\">\u00b694 Throughout this litigation, the Board members have \u201cfrozen\u201d their terms. At this point, the members designated by the Trustee have served more than the maximum three-year term allowed by the Trust. We instruct the Trustee to appoint two new members to the Board in accordance with \u00a7 6.2(d) of the Trust Agreement. Further, to properly redress the Board\u2019s breaches, the current Board members who would remain members based on their positions as presidents of First Trust Company of Montana, First Bank, and Moulton, Bellingham, Longo &amp; Mather, P.C., or their successors, must each appoint a nominee to serve on the Board, as allowed by the Trust Agreement. We direct that the new Board members must be appointed and that the newly-constituted Board must conduct its first formal meeting within six months from the date of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\u00b695 We instruct the new Board to follow the directive of Alberta Bair\u2019s Trust Agreement to spend \u201cwhatever principal and income\u201d of the Trust that is \u201cnecessary to establish, improve and maintain\u201d the Museum and to ensure the Trust\u2019s primary purpose, the Museum, receive a fair opportunity to succeed. We acknowledge the Trust Agreement\u2019s language providing that \u201cfollowing the fifth anniversary\u201d of Alberta Bair\u2019s death, the Board was empowered to \u201csell, transfer, relocate the museum, or otherwise dispose of all the property\u2019 if the Board determined that the Museum had ceased to serve its scholarly, educational, and historical purposes to the extent that it became \u201cinadvisable to continue the museum for public and educational purposes ....\u201d We conclude that allowing the Board the exercise of this discretionary power at any time following the fifth anniversary of the new Board\u2019s first formal meeting would most comport with the intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>of Alberta Bair.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\u00b696 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b191-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b191-6\">JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"AcP\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\u00b697 I concur with the Court\u2019s holding herein, but have concerns about parts of the rationale employed. I fear that certain conclusions in the Opinion may interfere with the proper exercise of the Board\u2019s discretion in the future management of the Trust. I also feel that the Court\u2019s Opinion has made what was no doubt a very difficult decision by the Board-closing the Museum-seem like it was arbitrarily made and a clear-cut violation of the Board\u2019s discretion and its fiduciary duty to the Trust. While our decision rightly interprets the Trust Agreement, properly concluding that the Museum was the foremost purpose of the Trust and its closure premature, the question of whether to close the Museum was not, in my view, \u201cblack and white\u201d; indeed, there was language in the Trust which authorized closure under the appropriate circumstances. Though I agree that those circumstances had not yet occurred, it is yet possible they will occur in the future, and at that time the Board must be able to properly fulfill its duty. Similarly, other future decisions may very well involve complexities which require careful analysis of different options by the Board and the exercise of considerable discretion. This holding, while properly correcting the Board\u2019s course, should not also impede the proper exercise of discretion by the Board required by changing conditions and future circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">\u00b698 I agree with the Court\u2019s declining to \u201ccomprehensively define \u2018necessary\u201d\u2019 for purposes of maintaining the Museum. \u00b6 55. However, despite that conclusion, the Comb holds that the Board breached its duty when it \u201cfailed to install a fire-prevention system, failed to install a proper air-handling system, failed to maintain an appropriate security system, and when it failed to build additional structures for the Museum.\u201d \u00b6 60. The necessary implication is that if the Board fails to complete each of these tasks, the Board will remain in breach of its duty. While I agree that the Board\u2019s failure to complete the aforementioned measures is evidence supporting the breach of duty, I do not believe it should now become incumbent upon the Board to complete all items on the list, some being expensive and some without specificity (\u201cbuild additional structures\u201d), without further consideration by the Board. The Board voted to close the Museum temporarily over five years ago and voted to permanently close the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Museum over three years ago. It should not have to initiate upgrades without updating data and options. The record reveals that there are various studies and opinions about how the facility can be made museum-ready, and not all of them contain the same proposals. It is possible that the Board will adopt a plan which would be deemed appropriate, but not contain all of the items mentioned in the Court\u2019s Opinion. Such explicit directions could well put overly strict limitations on the Board\u2019s \u201cfull discretion and authority\u201d to act in the best interest of the Museum. Although a different case entirely, and a constitutional one, in <em>Columbia Falls Elementary School v. State, </em>2005 MT 69, 326 Mont. 304, 109 P.3d 257, we held that it was the Legislature\u2019s duty to first define a \u201cquality\u2019 education. <em>Columbia Falls, </em>\u00b6 31. Here, I would defer to the Board to first define \u201cmuseum-ready.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u00b699 I have similar concerns under Issue 11(C). The Trust Agreement explicitly provides that the Board may exercise its \u201csole judgment and discretion\u201d to close the Museum, which the Court acknowledges is a grant of \u201csignificant\u201d or \u201cconsiderable\u201d discretion. However, despite that initial acknowledgement, the discussion under Issue 11(C) does not appear to give any particular deference to this \u201cconsiderable\u201d discretion. While I agree that the Board\u2019s decision to close the Museum under the conditions as they existed was a breach of duty, and that its discretion is not absolute, the Board must retain significant discretion to act in the future on an issue of this complexity and other issues. Not knowing what the public response will be to the Board\u2019s actions to make the Museum ready, it is conceivable that the issue of closure could again arise and need to be revisited in a future year. If that happens, the Board must be able to fulfill its duties with the full powers bestowed upon it by the Trust Agreement. The Court rejects, point-by-point, each reason the Board offered for closing the Museum. While these reasons were not adequate today, future events could make these reasons, supported by different facts, appropriate another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\u00b6100 I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
