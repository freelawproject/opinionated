Does Herman present a record-based claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on her counsel\u2019s failure to provide the District Court with a recently prepared psychological report?</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err because it did not consider the psychological report which was mentioned by Herman at the sentencing hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b515-14\">\u00b65 On May 17, 2005, the State charged Herman with felony driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol, in violation of \u00a7 61-8-401, MCA. Herman initially pled not guilty. The State subsequently filed notice of its intent to seek Persistent Felony Offender designation for Herman based on her numerous prior DUI convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-15\">\u00b66 Herman and the State later entered a non-binding plea agreement under which she would plead guilty to felony DUI, not protest the Persistent Felony Offender designation, and the State would recommend an eight-year sentence at the Montana State Women\u2019s Prison. Herman pled guilty pursuant to the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-16\">\u00b67 The District Court held a sentencing hearing on February 27, 2006. At the hearing, the District Court had before it a Pre-Sentence Investigation report, which documented Herman\u2019s lengthy history of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>alcohol-related crimes, including seven prior DUI convictions. It also included a letter submitted by her counsel stating that Herman had been attending counseling. Counsel argued to the Court concerning an appropriate sentence. Herman\u2019s counsel requested that the District Court impose a five-year term of imprisonment, and the State recommended eight years.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">\u00b68 Herman spoke on her own behalf. She mentioned to the District Court that a psychological evaluation had been prepared which made treatment recommendations for her. Her counsel informed the judge that he was able to provide a copy of the report, although he had not previously given a copy to either the District Court or the State. The judge stated that it was \u201ctoo late now\u201d for the report and proceeded to designate Herman a Persistent Felony Offender and sentence her to seven years at the Montana State Women\u2019s Prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">\u00b69 The District Court entered a written judgment on March 7, 2007. Herman now appeals the sentence imposed in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">\u00b610 A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel presents mixed questions of law and fact that we review de novo. <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 12, 323 Mont. 6, \u00b6 12, 97 P.3d 1095, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">\u00b611  While the parties have not raised an issue regarding the correct standard of review, we take this opportunity to once again clarify that generally we review the imposition of a sentence for legality only, examining whether it is within the statutory parameters. <em>State v Vernes, </em>2006 MT 32, \u00b6 27, 331 Mont. 129, \u00b6 27, 130 P.3d 169, \u00b6 27. In the past, this Court has stated that we will review a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>E.g. State v. Richards, </em>285 Mont. 322, 324, 948 P.2d 240, 241 (1997). In 1999, the Court held that we will only review sentences for legality, and we will not apply an abuse of discretion standard. <em>State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, \u00b6 15, 295 Mont. 288, \u00b6 15, 983 P.2d 937, \u00b6 15. Since deciding <em>Montoya, </em>we have established two narrow exceptions to this rule. First, if a defendant is sentenced to serve less than one year of actual incarceration, we will review a sentence both for legality and for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Herd, </em>2004 MT 85, \u00b6 22, 320 Mont. 490, \u00b6 22, 87 P.3d 1017, \u00b6 22. Second, we will review for an abuse of discretion the reasonableness of conditions imposed on probation. <em>State v. Ashby, </em>2008 MT 83, \u00b6 9, 342 Mont. 187, \u00b6 9, 179 P.3d 1164, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">\u00b612 Since deciding <em>Montoya </em>the Court has occasionally referred to the abuse of discretion standard in considering the appeal of a sentence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number><em>E.g. State v. McCaslin, </em>2004 MT 212, \u00b6 17, 322 Mont. 350, \u00b6 17, 96 P.3d 722, \u00b6 17. We overrule our prior cases to the extent they state that this Court will review for an abuse of discretion a sentence which imposes one year or more of actual incarceration and which does not fall within either of the exceptions noted above.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AGz\">\u00b613 Herman argues that the procedure employed at her sentencing hearing violated her constitutional rights. This presents a question of law which we review de novo. <em>State v. Mason, </em>2003 MT 371, \u00b6 19, 319 Mont. 117, \u00b6 19, 82 P.3d 903, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\u00b614 Issue 1: Does Herman present a record-based claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on her counsel\u2019s failure to provide the District Court with a recently prepared psychological report?</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">\u00b615  Herman claims that her lawyer was ineffective because he did not provide the District Court with a copy of a psychological assessment prior to the sentencing hearing. On direct appeal, we will generally only address a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel if the claim is \u201crecord-based.\u201d <em>State v. Batemen, </em>2004 MT 281, \u00b6 23, 323 Mont. 280, \u00b6 23, 99 P.3d 656, \u00b6 23. A claim is record-based if \u201cthe record fully explain[s] <em>why </em>counsel took the particular course of action.\u201d <em>State v. White, </em>2001 MT 149, \u00b6 20, 306 Mont. 58, \u00b6 20, 30 P.3d 340, \u00b6 20. If a defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>not record-based, the defendant must raise the issue not on direct appeal, but in a post-conviction proceeding where she can more fully develop the record. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 14. A more complete record will allow the court to determine whether counsel\u2019s actions were ineffective or were simply tactical decisions which we accord wide discretion. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 14. \u00b616 Occasionally, we may address on direct appeal a claim that is not record-based if there is \u201cno plausible justification\u201d for counsel\u2019s conduct. <em>State v. Jefferson, </em>2003 MT 90, \u00b6 50, 315 Mont. 146, \u00b6 50, 69 P.3d 641, \u00b6 50. We have noted that the situations when no justification will exist for counsel\u2019s actions are \u201crelatively rare.\u201d <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">\u00b617 Herman has not presented a record-based claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The record shows that Herman\u2019s counsel had a copy of the psychological report and had not provided it to the District Court prior to sentencing. The record does not say \u201cwhy\u201d he chose not to provide it. Because the record does not answer the crucial question of \u201cwhy,\u201d Herman\u2019s claim is not record-based and thus not appropriate for direct appeal. <em>White, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u00b618 This is not the rare situation, as in <em>Kougl </em>and <em>Jefferson, </em>where there is no plausible explanation for counsel\u2019s decision not to submit the psychological report to the District Court. Counsel may have had good reasons for holding it back. Without the report and counsel\u2019s explanation why he did not provide it to the District Court and the State, we cannot know what, if any, justification existed for not submitting the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\u00b619 Herman\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is not record-based. We decline to further consider it on direct appeal. Should she desire, Herman may assert the claim in a petition for post-conviction review.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">\u00b620 Issue 2: Did the District Court err because it did not consider the psychological report mentioned by Herman at the sentencing hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"A0L\">\u00b621 Herman contends that the District Court committed error in not considering the psychological report before imposing sentence. \u201cDue process requires that an offender be given an opportunity to explain, argue, and rebut any information, including pre-sentencing information, that may lead to a deprivation of life, liberty, or property.\u201d <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>2005 MT 343, \u00b6 100, 330 Mont. 103, \u00b6 100, 126 P.3d 463, \u00b6 100 (citing <em>Mason, </em>\u00b6 21). The defendant has the right to be sentenced on the basis of substantially correct information. <em>State v. Bar-Jonah, </em>2004 MT 344, \u00b6 118, 324 Mont. 278, \u00b6 118, 102 P.3d 1229, \u00b6 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">\u00b622  We have consistently held that a defendant has an affirmative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>duty to bring evidence outside the pre-sentence report to the district court\u2019s attention. <em>Ferguson, </em>\u00b6 100; <em>State v. Winkle, </em>2002 MT 312, \u00b6 19, 313 Mont. 111, \u00b6 19, 60 P.3d 465, \u00b6 19; <em>State v. Trangsrud, </em>200 Mont. 303, 308, 651 P.2d 37, 40 (1982). If a defendant has information she desires the district court to consider in sentencing her, she must move for its admission. If the evidence is not offered, there is no error based on its absence from the record. <em>State v. Long, </em>274 Mont. 228, 235-36, 907 P.2d 945, 949 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\u00b623 As stated above, Herman\u2019s counsel may or may not have made a legitimate tactical decision when he chose not to provide the District Court with a copy of the psychological evaluation. However, the District Court was not required to insist on reviewing the report simply because Herman mentioned its existence. As in <em>Long, </em>the report was never properly before the District Court, and we will not fault the District Court for not considering it. The District Court did not err when it did not consider a report that was not before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\u00b624 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b519-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-7\"> This includes the following cases: <em>State v.
