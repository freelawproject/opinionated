(hereinafter \u201cHank\u2019s\u201d) and Arcane Worldwide Racing, LLC. (hereinafter \u201cArcane\u201d). Henry Booth appeals from an order of the District Court for the Eighth Judicial District, Cascade County, redesignating a custodian as a receiver with orders to wind up and liquidate Hank\u2019s and Arcane. Booth also appeals from a separate District Court order imposing discovery sanctions for Booth\u2019s failure to comply with an order compelling responses to discovery requests. We dismiss with respect to both claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\">1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it redesignated the custodian as a receiver, pursuant to \u00a7 35-1-941(4), MCA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\">2. Did the District Court err when it failed to hold a hearing prior to redesignating the custodian as a receiver?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-9\">3. Did the District Court err by imposing sanctions for failure to comply with an order compelling Booth to respond to discovery requests?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">\u00b63 Johnson and Booth are equal owners of both Hank\u2019s and Arcane. Hank\u2019s provided fire extinguishers, fire alarms, and fire sprinkler systems to various businesses. Johnson and Booth filed articles of incorporation for Hank\u2019s on April 22,1993. The articles provided that Booth and Johnson would serve as the two directors and that Booth would be the registered agent. Arcane\u2019s primary business focus was on motorcycles. Johnson and Booth filed the articles of organization for Arcane on September 28, 2004. Booth\u2019s residence served as the principal place of business for both entities; however, after this action commenced, Hank\u2019s relocated to another place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">\u00b64 On July 1, 2005, Johnson filed a complaint in which he made numerous allegations, including that Booth was attempting to \u201cdominate and control the business and affairs of [Hank\u2019s] at the exclusion and to the detriment of Bruce Johnson,\u201d that Booth unilaterally precluded Johnson from Hank\u2019s place of operation by means of police intervention, that Booth diverted a substantial amount of funds from Hank\u2019s for Arcane or Booth\u2019s personal use without Johnson\u2019s consent, and that Booth \u201chad usurped complete control of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>corporate holdings\u201d depriving Johnson from investment income and participation in the management of Hank\u2019s. Johnson\u2019s requested relief included: (1) that Booth be removed as both president and treasurer of Hank\u2019s and as managing member of Arcane; (2) an accounting of all business records of both businesses; (3) that the District Court appoint a custodian and/or receiver to manage the business and affairs of Hank\u2019s; (4) damages and statutory interest; and (5) either a distribution of, and/or purchase of the shareholders\u2019 interest in Hank\u2019s and the members\u2019 capital investment and interest in Arcane or that both businesses be dissolved with the proceeds to be distributed according to the parties\u2019 respective interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b65 Concurrent with the filing of his complaint, Johnson filed a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction, Request for Receiver or Custodian, Brief in Support and Request for Hearing. Johnson requested that the District Court enjoin Booth from interfering with the operation of Hank\u2019s and Arcane or from transacting business without an independent receiver\u2019s oversight. Johnson also requested that the court prevent Booth from transferring or disposing of any property of either company without Johnson\u2019s consent or a court order. The District Court issued the temporary restraining order that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b66 The parties entered into a stipulation on July 12, 2005, in which they agreed to several of the provisions found in the temporary restraining order, including that neither party would: (1) interfere with the reasonable and proper exercise of the other\u2019s activities in relation to Hank\u2019s or Arcane, (2) transfer property without the other\u2019s consent or a court order, (3) cause either business to spend more than $500 without providing written notice to the other party, or (4) disparage the other or imply that the other is without business authority. Johnson and Booth also agreed that both parties would have full access to all business, organizational, and financial records of Hank\u2019s and Arcane, and that until further court order, it would not be necessary for either entity to appear or otherwise defend itself. Upon reviewing the stipulation, the District Court ordered that the parties be bound by its terms until the Hank\u2019s and Arcane entities and/or the ownership interests separated.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u00b67 Only a little over three months after Johnson and Booth signed the stipulation, Johnson filed a Motion for Order to Show Cause and Renewed Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Request for Receiver or Custodian. Johnson alleged that in the time since the parties signed the stipulation, Booth violated numerous provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>the stipulated order, including continuing to operate the businesses as if they were Booth\u2019s sole proprietorships and unilaterally deciding to cease Arcane\u2019s operations (the parties later agreed to sell Arcane\u2019s motorcycles and other equipment in order to pay the company\u2019s debts). After reviewing Johnson\u2019s motion, the District Court issued an order to show cause and set the matter for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\u00b68 The District Court held three hearings on Johnson\u2019s renewed motion. Both Johnson and Booth then filed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, as requested by the court. In its subsequent order, the District Court refused to find Booth in contempt of court due to lack of personal service of the order to show cause. Similarly, the court also found that it could not appoint a receiver or a conservator due to lack of personal jurisdiction over Hank\u2019s or Arcane because Johnson had not served either entity through its registered agent. However, the court did find that Booth had violated a number of the terms of the stipulation and ordered the parties to again abide by its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The court also concluded \u201c[ajlthough it is abundantly clear that the parties can no longer successfully manage the corporation together, and that it would be in the best interest of the corporation to consider dissolving the corporation and/or appointing a receiver/custodian, for the reasons set forth herein, this Court does not have jurisdiction over the businesses to issue such an order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\u00b69 In response to the District Court\u2019s order, Johnson notified the court that he served Booth as the registered agent for Hank\u2019s and Arcane. Johnson later provided an affidavit of service to the court demonstrating that service was accomplished on May 4, 2006. On subsequent motion by Johnson, the court entered the defaults of Hank\u2019s and Arcane after both entities failed to appear.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Johnson then filed a Renewed Request for Custodian. The District Court held a hearing on Johnson\u2019s renewed request and heard arguments from both parties. In its subsequent order, the District Court determined that Hank\u2019s and Arcane needed an independent custodian. Notwithstanding Booth\u2019s arguments that a custodian was unnecessary as Hank\u2019s already had a manager in place, the court concluded that a custodian was necessary as \u201cthat manager is subject to the directives of each party and often receives completely conflicting instructions from Booth and Johnson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>\u00b610 On January 29, 2007, Johnson filed a Motion for Appointment of New Custodian and for Definitive Instructions to Custodian. In addition to addressing the issue of the appointment of a second custodian (the first custodian appointed by the District Court resigned earlier that month), Johnson also voiced his concerns about the role of the custodian. Johnson stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\">[Hank\u2019s] and [Arcane] have not answered the Complaint, and have been defaulted. The Complaint included a request for dissolution of both [Hank\u2019s] and [Arcane] to which neither entity has provided a defense. Therefore, these entities should be dissolved and the assets and liabilities of the businesses should be wound up and dealt with by the custodian in this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7O\">Johnson requested that the court appoint a new custodian with instructions to orderly dissolve both entities and wind up the business. In response to this motion, Booth filed a memorandum in opposition, in which he stated that under \u00a7 35-1-941, MCA, a custodian does not have the power to dissolve a business entity. Booth requested that the court defer its decision to grant dissolution of Hank\u2019s and Arcane as a remedy until trial. Prior to the District Court ruling on Booth\u2019s motion, Johnson and Booth agreed on a new custodian and the court appointed the parties\u2019 selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u00b611 After considering both parties\u2019 arguments, the District Court issued its order regarding Johnson\u2019s Motion for Definitive Instructions to Custodian. Pursuant to \u00a7 35-1-941(4), MCA, the District Court redesignated the recently appointed custodian as a receiver with instructions to wind up and liquidate the business and affairs of Hank\u2019s and Arcane. The court determined that the redesignation was necessary \u201cin the best interests\u201d of both entities, as well as the companies\u2019 shareholders and creditors. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\u00b612 We review a district court\u2019s decision to appoint a receiver under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Crowley v. Valley West Water </em>Co., 267 Mont. 144, 150, 882 P.2d 1022, 1025 (1994). A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or in excess of the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Kuhr v. City of Billings, </em>2007 MT 201, \u00b6 14, 338 Mont. 402, \u00b6 14, 168 P.3d 615, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">\u00b613 Our standard of review for discovery sanctions imposed under M. R. Civ. P. 37, is whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Murphy Homes, Inc. v. Muller, </em>2007 MT 140, \u00b6 <em>66, 337 </em>Mont. 411, \u00b6 66, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>162 P.3d 106, \u00b6 66. \u201cIn doing so, we generally defer to the district court because it is in the best position to determine both whether the party in question has disregarded the opponent\u2019s rights, and which sanctions are most appropriate.\u201d <em>Rothing v. Kallestad, </em>2007 MT 109, \u00b6 49, 337 Mont. 193, \u00b6 49, 159 P.3d 222, \u00b6 49 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\u00b614 <em>Issue One. Did the District Court abuse it discretion when it redesignated the custodian as a receiver, pursuant to \u00a7 35-1-941(4), MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\u00b615 Booth argues that the District Court abused its discretion when it redesignated the custodian as a receiver. Booth claims that the appointment of a receiver is \u201cone of the harshest remedies available\u201d and as such, due process requires that the court hold a hearing, absent emergency or extreme necessity. Booth claims that the defaults entered against Hank\u2019s and Arcane that led to the redesignation were improperly entered because the parties\u2019 stipulation stated that the two entities would not have to appear until further order of the court. Booth also argues that the defaults make no difference because neither Hank\u2019s nor Arcane had been dissolved and it would be premature to wind up and liquidate either entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u00b616 Johnson asserts that while the District Court did not abuse its discretion or err in redesignating the custodian as a receiver, Booth does not have standing to seek relief on behalf of the entities Hank\u2019s and Arcane.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As such, Johnson claims that a challenge to the appointment or redesignation of the custodian as a receiver can only be raised by Hank\u2019s and Arcane (neither of which has appeared) and as such, Booth does not have standing to assert a claim on their behalf. We agree with Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">\u00b617 A corporation has a separate and distinct identity from its stockholders. <em>First Sec. Bank of Glendive v. Gary, </em>245 Mont. 394, 402, 798 P.2d 523, 528 (1990). In <em>Richland Nat. Bank &amp; Trust v. Swenson, </em>249 Mont. 410, 816 P.2d 1045 (1991), we examined whether the defendants had standing to present claims for wrongs to themselves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>when those claims were essentially those of a corporation of which the defendants were the sole proprietors. <em>Swenson, </em>249 Mont. at 423, 816 P.2d at 1054. We agreed with the District Court that the claims being asserted were essentially those of the corporation and that the defendants as individual shareholders could not prosecute the claims of the corporation. <em>Swenson, </em>249 Mont. at 424, 816 P.2d at 1054. In reaching this conclusion, we stated, \u201cMontana law is clear that the stockholders and guarantors of a corporation do not have the right to pursue an action on their own behalf when the cause of action accrues to the corporation.\u201d <em>Swenson, </em>249 Mont. at 424, 816 P.2d at 1054; <em>see also Gullett v. Van Dyke Const. Co., </em>2005 MT 105, \u00b6 14, 327 Mont. 30, \u00b6 14, 111 P.3d 220, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u00b618 Furthermore, the stockholders generally may not defend for a corporation an action brought against the corporation as a defendant. <em>Malcom v. Stondall Land &amp; Inv. Co., </em>129 Mont. 142, 146, 284 P.2d 258, 260 (1955). \u201cThe corporation itself must in such circumstances appear and plead; or there may be neither suit nor defense for it.\u201d <em>Malcom, </em>129 Mont. at 146, 284 P.2d at 260. The reasoning of <em>Malcom </em>and <em>Swenson, </em>which both involved corporations wholly owned by the defendants in question, is no less compelling where the defendant, like Booth, owns 50% of the corporation and limited liability company and is the registered agent for both entities. There is no need for Hank\u2019s or Arcane to resort to having a stockholder or member defend an action to protect the entities\u2019 respective interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\u00b619  Likewise, Booth does not have standing to pursue an appeal on behalf of Hank\u2019s or Arcane. \u201cIn order to have standing on appeal, a party must be able to show an interest in the subject matter of litigation which has been injuriously affected by the judgment or order.\u201d <em>Daniels-Sheridan v. Bellanger, </em>2001 MT 235, \u00b6 22, 307 Mont. 22, \u00b6 22, 36 P.3d 397, \u00b6 22. Booth appeals from the District Court\u2019s order redesignating the custodian as a receiver for Hank\u2019s and Arcane. Any injury or adverse effect resulting from this order would impact and concern these two entities, not Booth. Accordingly, this claim belongs to Hank\u2019s and Arcane, and Booth cannot defend any claim properly belonging to the two entities or appeal on their behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\u00b620 Booth claims that he has standing to challenge the appointment of the receiver based on the stipulation that the parties signed. Paragraph 7 of the stipulation states, \u201cUntil further order of the Court, it shall not be necessary for [Hank\u2019s] and/or [Arcane] to appear or otherwise defend themselves in this action.\u201d Regardless of whether the stipulation initially controlled which parties needed to appear in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>action, the subsequent orders of the District Court clearly demonstrated the need for Hank\u2019s and Arcane to appear and be parties to the suit. After Johnson filed a motion requesting that the District Court appoint a receiver or custodian, Booth, in his Memorandum in Opposition to Request for Summary Ruling stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-4\">it is undisputed that [Hank\u2019s] and [Arcane], were never served with orders to show cause and have not appeared. There is no basis whatsoever to grant injunctive relief or a receiver or custodian against either of those entities without service upon them of the order to show cause. Simply stated, without such service there can be no personal jurisdiction over those entities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJf\">The District Court agreed and concluded it could not appoint a custodian or receiver for Hank\u2019s or Arcane, as the court lacked jurisdiction over the entities which had not been served. The District Court also noted that Booth\u2019s attorney maintained that he only represented Booth in the matter and <em>not </em>Hank\u2019s or Arcane.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\u00b621 Whatever the parties may have agreed to in the stipulation, the District Court deemed it necessary that Hank\u2019s and Arcane be served with process before a custodian or receiver could be appointed. Booth cannot simply rely on the assertion that the stipulation relieved the entities from any need to appear or defend themselves, especially in light of the language in the stipulation stating that Hank\u2019s or Arcane need not appear or otherwise defend themselves <em>\u201cuntil further order of the Court\u201d </em>(emphasis added) and the ensuing District Court order that both entities needed to be served in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\u00b622  The claim that the District Court abused its discretion in redesignating the custodian as a receiver concerns and belongs to the corporate entities, not Booth individually. Booth does not have standing to defend any claims properly belonging to Hank\u2019s or Arcane, nor does he have standing to pursue an appeal on behalf of Hank\u2019s or Arcane for claims belonging to the two entities. We hold that Booth does not have standing to challenge the redesignation on behalf of Hank\u2019s and Arcane and dismiss Booth\u2019s claims for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>\u00b623 <em>Issue Two. Did the District Court err when it failed to hold a hearing prior to redesignating the custodian as a receiver?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\u00b624 For the same reasons that led to our conclusion in Issue One that Booth did not have standing to challenge the redesignation of the custodian as a receiver, we need not address this issue and dismiss it accordingly for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\u00b625 <em>Issue Three. Did the District Court err by imposing sanctions for failure to comply with an order compelling Booth to respond to discovery </em>requests?</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\u00b626 Booth contends that the District Court erred when it imposed discovery sanctions against him. Prior to analyzing Booth\u2019s contentions, an overview of the factual background on the parties\u2019 discovery dispute is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\u00b627 On June 28, 2006, Johnson filed a Motion to Compel Answers to Interrogatories and Reponses to Request for Production. Johnson alleged that Booth had failed to fully and adequately answer Johnson\u2019s first set of discovery requests in Booth\u2019s November 18,2005 discovery responses. Booth then filed a memorandum in opposition to Johnson\u2019s motion to compel. The District Court held a hearing on September 12, 2006, at which Johnson withdrew several but not all of his discovery requests. The District Court subsequently issued an order granting Johnson\u2019s motion to compel as to the remaining discovery requests. The court concluded that Booth had failed to fully comply with M. R. Civ. P. 33(c) and 34(b) in his responses to several of Johnson\u2019s discovery requests. The court ordered Booth to fully and completely respond to the interrogatories and requests for production at issue. \u00b628 Less than two months later, Johnson filed a Motion for Default Judgment. In his motion, Johnson requested that a default judgment be entered against Booth as a sanction for Booth\u2019s failure to produce the documents that the District Court had previously ordered Booth to produce. While the court declined to enter a default judgment, it did impose sanctions by attributing amounts owed on several credit cards that were a subject of the discovery requests to Booth himself and the court ordered Booth to pay Johnson\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees and costs associated with the motion for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">\u00b629 While Booth argues that he fully responded to Johnson\u2019s discovery requests and that the District Court erred in concluding that Booth\u2019s responses were evasive and that he had possession, custody, or control of the requested documents, we need not address Booth\u2019s arguments as the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure do not authorize this issue to be reviewed by this Court at this stage in the proceedings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>\u00b630 M. R. App. P. 6(1) provides that \u201c[a] party may appeal from a final judgment in an action or special proceeding and from those final orders specified in sections (2), (3), and (4) of this rule.\u201d A final judgment is one which \u201cconclusively determines the rights of the parties and settles all claims in controversy in an action or proceeding, including any necessary determination of the amount of costs and attorney fees awarded or sanction imposed.\u201d M. R. App. P. 4(1)a.; see <em>also Matter of Litigation Relating to Riot, </em>283 Mont. 277, 280, 939 P.2d 1013, 1015-16 (1997) (\u201cA final judgment is one wherein a final determination of the rights of the parties has been made; any decree which leaves matters undetermined is interlocutory in nature and not a final judgment for purposes of appeal.\u201d). It is clear that the District Court\u2019s order granting sanctions against Booth is not a final judgment as the primary issues of the case remained unresolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">\u00b631 In addition, subsections (2), (3), or (4) of M. R. App. P. 6, which permit appeal of certain interlocutory orders, do not permit an interlocutory appeal of discovery sanctions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, M. R. App. P. 6(5) makes clear that certain orders and judgments of the lower court are not appealable. Subsection (5)e. specifically states that \u201corders granting or denying sanctions\u201d are not appealable, and subsection (5)f. states that interlocutory judgments are not appealable. M. R. App. P. 4(l)b. defines an interlocutory judgment as \u201can order or decree that determines a preliminary or subordinate question or issue and which enables the court to render a final judgment but does not finally decide the cause.\u201d \u201cTypically, orders pertaining to discovery are interlocutory in nature <em>...\u201d Hegwood v.

Under the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure, the imposition of sanctions for discovery abuse is precisely the type of order that is not subject to appellate review \u25a0until the judgment is final.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u00b632 Accordingly, we dismiss as premature Booth\u2019s appeal of the discovery sanctions without prejudice and remand to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\u00b633 Booth does not have standing on behalf of the corporate entities to challenge the redesignation of the custodian as a receiver and we dismiss his claims for lack of jurisdiction. Booth\u2019s appeal regarding the imposition of discovery sanctions is interlocutory in nature and cannot be reviewed at this stage of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\u00b634 Dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b298-6\">JUSTICES WARNER, NELSON, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b291-7\"> Booth has filed a motion to set aside the defaults of Hank\u2019s and Arcane; however, the District Court has not yet ruled on this motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b293-9\"> Booth contends that Johnson cannot raise the argument that Booth lacks standing to challenge the appointment of the receiver, as \u201cthis Court will not address an issue raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>See Jones v.

While this is generally true, standing is a threshold, jurisdictional requirement of every case and the general rule does not pertain to jurisdictional issues. <em>Bryan v.

On one hand, Booth maintains that his counsel only represents him personally and not Hank\u2019s or Arcane. Booth stated this in his December 23,2005 proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. After service upon Booth as registered agent of Hank\u2019s and Arcane, neither entity appeared and Johnson obtained entries of default against them. While Booth continued to maintain that his counsel does not represent Hank\u2019s or Arcane, he nonetheless filed a motion to set aside the defaults entered against Hank\u2019s and Arcane. The District Court has yet to rule on this motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b297-6\"> In contrast, M. R. App. P. 6(3)g. specifically authorizes an appeal from \u201can order appointing or refusing to appoint a receiver, or giving directions with respect to a receivership, or refusing to vacate an order appointing or affecting a receiver\u201d provided that the order is the lower court\u2019s final decision on the referenced matter. Thus, Booth\u2019s claims under Issues I and II are properly before the Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
