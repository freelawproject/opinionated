White (White) appeals from the order of the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, denying his motion for a mistrial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">\u00b62 We consider the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err by denying White\u2019s motion for a mistrial on the basis of a juror\u2019s comment, made during deliberations, that a Mend had called him about the case?</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">\u00b64 On June 25, 2005, White went to see his sister, Diane Temple, at her home in Billings. Diane\u2019s husband, Gary Temple, and White did not get along and upon Gary\u2019s return to the home, Gary told Diane that he did not want White in his house. Diane and White then left together and went to a friend\u2019s apartment, taking Diane and Gary\u2019s Dodge Durango. Later that evening, Gary went looking for Diane and, finding the Dodge parked on the street, activated the car alarm. Diane heard the alarm and went outside where she and Gary began to argue. White watched the argument from the porch until he and Gary began to argue, at which point White moved into the front yard. A physical confrontation ensued. During the course of the fight, White pulled out a knife and stabbed Gary seven times before finally stabbing Gary in the neck, severing Gary\u2019s jugular vein and cutting his carotid artery. Gary stumbled into the street and died. White and Diane fled the scene. Onlookers dialed 9-1-1 and emergency personnel arrived but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Gary could not be helped. White and Diane were apprehended by police a few blocks away and White was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">\u00b65 On June 30, 2005, the county attorney filed an information charging White with deliberate homicide, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-102(a), MCA. The case proceeded to jury trial on March 6, 2006. During the trial, eleven eyewitnesses testified about the fight leading to Gary\u2019s death. White testified in his own defense, admitting that he had caused Gary\u2019s death but asserting that his actions were justified in self-defense. However, eyewitnesses testified that White initiated the fight and continued the attack even after Gary retreated with both hands in the air. Witnesses testified that White told Gary \u201cyou\u2019re dead[, yjou\u2019re going to fucking die.\u201d On the sixth day of trial, March 13, 2006, the presentation of evidence concluded and the jury was dismissed overnight, with closing arguments and jury instructions scheduled for the next day, to be followed by jury deliberations. Prior to dismissal the judge admonished the jury, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">Once again, please do not discuss the case, or form any opinions about the case, and once again, there will be a newspaper article and some news stories about this. Please do not watch the news stories, go onto the internet, or read the newspaper articles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u00b66 The following day, after closing arguments and jury instructions were given, jury deliberations commenced. Approximately two hours after deliberations had begun, one of the jurors, Robert Lindbergh (Lindbergh), began to tell the jury how a friend of his had called Lindbergh the night before and wanted to know if Lindbergh would vote to convict White. Lindbergh told his friend that he could not discuss the case. However, the friend continued and \u201cgave [Lindbergh] his opinion\u201d that he \u201cread it in the paper ... [that] the Defendant was in prison and that he got out of prison and that he killed this man ....\u201d According to the jury foreman, Dion Campbell (Campbell), the jury\u2019s immediate reaction to Lindbergh\u2019s comment was that Campbell and several other jurors said \u201cwhoa, whoa, whoa, we can\u2019t hear this.\u201d The jury then decided to report the incident to the judge and contacted the bailiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">\u00b67 Soon after, the court, with counsel and White present, questioned Foreman Campbell and Lindbergh about the incident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Campbell explained to the court that, although all the jurors had heard the comment, they all \u201cagreed right at the front that [they were] not going <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>to consider\u201d it. Campbell explained that deliberations proceeded from there and the comment was not discussed further. Similarly, Lindbergh stated that when he began to tell the jury about the phone call, the other jurors</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-4\">cut me off right away. And that\u2019s when... it dawned on me... [that] I shouldn\u2019t have said that, I should have kept my mouth shut. But after it happened, you know, and then I apologized to them and then we got to talking about it a little bit in there and they agreed that what I had said has not affected them and what their thinking is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Following this testimony, White moved for a mistrial on the ground that the jury had been tainted against him. White argued that a \u201ccautionary instruction or any other type of admonition from the court\u201d would not cure the problem, making a mistrial appropriate. The District Court denied the motion, stating that White had not \u201cbeen denied a fair and impartial trial\u201d because (1) the jury quickly brought the issue to the court\u2019s attention, (2) both Campbell and Lindbergh stated that the jury had not discussed the comment further and the jury\u2019s discussion prior to and after the comment remained on the same track, and (3) the \u201coverwhelming evidence is that in fact, Mr. White is guilty of deliberate homicide and that the defense of justifiable use of force was not proven even close to beyond a reasonable doubt[.]\u201d The court then called the jury into the courtroom and gave the following cautionary instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">Members of the jury, one of the jury instructions that the Court gave was that you could only consider evidence which was received in this Courtroom and evidence which was able to be cross examined. Evidently some evidence has come in from other sources, and I\u2019m going to ask you to completely and totally disregard that evidence. The Defendant has a right to be tried on the charge only based upon the evidence which has been presented in this Courtroom and subject to cross examination. With that very strict admonition, I\u2019m going to ask you to go back into the jury room and continue your deliberations. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ac4\">The jury was then excused to continue deliberations. Deliberations continued for nearly another four hours before the jury returned its verdict, finding White guilty of deliberate homicide. The District Court sentenced White to life imprisonment at the Montana State Prison with a concurrent ten-year term pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-221, MCA, for use of a weapon. White appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\u00b68 When deciding whether to grant a motion for a mistrial, the district court must determine whether the defendant was denied a fair and impartial trial. <em>State v. Dubois, </em>2006 MT 89, \u00b6 33, 332 Mont. 44, \u00b6 33, 134 P.3d 82, \u00b6 33. We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for a mistrial to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Dubois, </em>\u00b6 33; <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>2004 MT 53, \u00b6 14, 320 Mont. 161, \u00b6 14, 85 P.3d 1279, \u00b6 14. The decision of a district court regarding the impartiality of a jury will not be set aside unless there is a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Kennedy, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u00b69 The State expresses some uncertainty about the correct standard of review, noting White argues an apparent \u201calternative to the \u2018fair and impartial trial\u2019 abuse of discretion legal standard\u201d which \u201cholds that a district court properly grants a motion for mistrial when a reasonable possibility exists that inadmissible evidence may have contributed to the conviction.\u201d However, this standard is not an alternative appellate standard of review, but rather one of the substantive legal factors by which a district court determines whether a motion for mistrial is meritorious. \u201cA <em>district court </em>properly grants a motion for mistrial when a reasonable possibility exists that inadmissible evidence may have contributed to the conviction.\u201d <em>Dubois, </em>\u00b6 33 (citing <em>State v. Long, </em>2005 MT 130, \u00b6 24, 327 Mont. 238, \u00b6 24, 113 P.3d 290, \u00b6 24) (emphasis added). Other like factors, such as the prejudicial effect of the inadmissible evidence, are further discussed herein. After the district court has applied these substantive factors, we review the district court\u2019s disposition of the motion on appeal for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err by denying White\u2019s motion for a mistrial on the basis of a juror\u2019s comment, made during deliberations, that a friend had called him about the case?</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">\u00b6 11 White argues that by this incident \u201cthe entire jury was exposed to prejudicial information\u201d and the \u201cnondescript cautionary instruction was insufficient to cure the prejudice,\u201d thereby denying him a fair and impartial trial. White contends that Lindbergh\u2019s comment was so prejudicial that a reasonable possibility exists that the outside information might have contributed to his conviction. The State responds that, while the outside information was indeed inappropriately given by one of the jurors, in the context of the entire case the statement alone did not render White\u2019s trial unfair or contribute to his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>\u00b612  In general, where a reasonable possibility exists that inadmissible evidence may have contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction, a grant of mistrial is proper. <em>Dubois, </em>\u00b6 33. When determining whether a prohibited statement contributed to the conviction, a district court should consider the \u201c\u2018strength of the evidence against the defendant together with the prejudicial influence of the inadmissible evidence and whether a cautionary, jury instruction could cure any prejudice ....\u2019\u201d <em>Long, </em>\u00b6 24 (quoting <em>State v. Brady, </em>2000 MT 282, \u00b6 14, 302 Mont. 174, \u00b6 14, 13 P.3d 941, \u00b6 14). Denial of a mistrial is appropriate where the defects \u201cdo not affect the substantial rights of the defendant and the record is sufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>Long, </em>\u00b6 24 (quoting <em>Brady, </em>\u00b6 14). With regard to juror contact or misconduct, \u201cthe Constitution does not require a new trial each time a juror is placed in a potentially compromising situation\u201d because it is \u201cvirtually impossible to shield jurors from every contact or influence that might theoretically affect their vote.\u201d <em>State v. Hage, </em>258 Mont. 498, 503-04, 853 P.2d 1251, 1254 (1993) (citing <em>Rushen v. Spain, </em>464 U.S. 114, 118-19, 104 S. Ct. 453, 455-56 (1983)) (internal quotations omitted). Accordingly, where there is juror misconduct, in order to receive a new trial, the defendant bears the initial burden of demonstrating that the misconduct actually injured or prejudiced the defendant. <em>State v. McNatt, </em>257 Mont. 468, 472, 849 P.2d 1050, 1052-53 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u00b613 Although White asserts that Lindbergh\u2019s impermissible comment prejudiced the jury and the District Court erred by not granting a mistrial, his claim of prejudice fades when the record is considered. Campbell promptly notified the baliff of the outside communication which had entered the jury room and, in response, the court immediately questioned Campbell and Lindbergh. Both Campbell and Lindbergh informed the court that the other jurors promptly stopped Lindbergh from continuing and agreed not to consider the information in their deliberations. The District Court then gave a cautionary instruction to the jury. Thereafter, the jury continued their deliberations for another four hours, during which time the jury sent out questions to the court about issues they were considering, evidencing their serious consideration of the evidence, instructions, and verdict. We do not presume that the jury ignored its duty to respect the instructions of the court, <em>Dubois, </em>\u00b6 60, and it appears from the record that the deliberations which followed were entirely appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\u00b614  Further, the general rule is that a cautionary instruction cures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>any error committed by the introduction of improper information. <em>Dubois, </em>\u00b6 60. While White contends that the court should have given a more specific cautionary instruction and questioned each juror individually, we conclude that under these circumstances the District Court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to do so. The two jurors questioned gave similar versions of what had occurred in the jury room in response to Lindbergh\u2019s comments and, as the State points out, a more specific cautionary instruction and individual questioning may have risked the possibility of prompting the opposite effect-drawing more attention to the inappropriate comment. The District Court assessed the situation carefully, first questioning Lindbergh and Campbell individually and then giving the entire jury a cautionary instruction, and by so doing acted reasonably under the circumstances to cure any prejudice that may have arisen by way of the comments.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag8\">\u00b615 Finally, the District Court correctly considered the \u201cstrength of the evidence\u201d in the case in making its determination. <em>Long, </em>\u00b6 24. The court noted that there was \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d that White was guilty of deliberate homicide. Eleven eyewitnesses testified about the fight. Several witnesses indicated that White was the initial aggressor of the fight and continued to attack Gary even as Gary attempted to retreat. Testimony included statements made by White that he intended for Gary to die. Moreover, White himself testified that he knew Gary was unarmed and that he was the aggressor in the fight. In light of this evidence, we cannot conclude that the District Court\u2019s assessment of the impact of the comment upon the trial was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"AvF\">\u00b616 [4] For these reasons, and being mindful that the district court is \u201cgiven a latitude of discretion in its rulings on motions for mistrial\u201d as it is in the \u201cbest position to observe the jurors[,]\u201d <em>Dubois, </em>\u00b6 61, we conclude that the District Court did not clearly abuse its discretion by denying White\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b92-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART and COTTER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b88-8\"> According to Campbell\u2019s recitation of the comments, Lindbergh also reported that his friend had said that White had obtained a knife.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
