Kirkbride (hereafter Kirkbride) appeals from his sentence in the District Court for the First Judicial District, Lewis and Clark County, on charges of deliberate homicide under \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(a), MCA. Kirkbride was sentenced to life in prison, with no parole eligibility for fifty-five (55) years. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it relied on a \u201cneed for retribution\u201d as a factor in sentencing Kirkbride?</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err by imposing a restriction on Kirkbride\u2019s parole eligibility for fifty-five (55) years?</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">\u00b65 The instant appeal requires the Court to determine whether a trial court judge can legally pronounce a sentence that is partially based on a need for retribution and whether a trial court can legally pronounce a sentence containing a partial parole restriction. The Court answers both questions in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">\u00b66 On the evening of December 8, 2006, Paul Raftery (hereafter Raftery) was walking home in Helena, Montana. Kirkbride and Robert Rickman (hereafter Rickman) agreed to commit robbery in order to obtain money for drugs. When they saw the victim, Raftery, walking up Lawrence Street, they began following him. Raftery noticed they were following him and crossed the street. Rickman approached Raftery, called out to him, and punched him in the face. Raftery yelled for help and attempted to get away, at which point Kirkbride stabbed him in the back with a large hunting knife. This blow was fatal, puncturing Raftery\u2019s left lung and pericardial sack and striking the pulmonary artery. Raftery again attempted to get away. This time Rickman tripped him. While Raftery was on the ground bleeding, Rickman and Kirkbride took Raftery\u2019s wallet. Rickman and Kirkbride returned to their vehicle and fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-13\">\u00b67 Kirkbride and Rickman threw the wallet, knife, Kirkbride\u2019s coat, and Rickman\u2019s jacket into a dumpster in central Helena. Meanwhile, two citizens heard Raftery\u2019s cry for help and called 911. Emergency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>responders found Raftery unresponsive and bleeding from his back. He was transported to St. Peter\u2019s Hospital and pronounced dead upon arrival. On December 11,2006, Kirkbride confessed to involvement in the slaying of Raftery, implicated Rickman, and took law enforcement officers to the dumpster where officers found the wallet and a bloody knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">\u00b68 Kirkbride was charged with deliberate homicide, a felony, under \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(a), MCA. On February 14,2007, Kirkbride pled guilty to deliberate homicide. The sentencing judge sentenced Kirkbride to life in prison with no possibility of parole for fifty-five years. One of the bases for Kirkbride\u2019s sentence was \u201cthe victim\u2019s family\u2019s need for retribution.\u201d Kirkbride brings the instant appeal challenging the legality of a sentence on three grounds. Kirkbride argues that basing a sentence on the need of the victim\u2019s family for retribution renders the sentence illegal. Kirkbride also contends his sentence was illegal because sentencing judges lack statutory authority to impose partial parole restrictions. Finally, Kirkbride asserts the judge\u2019s consideration of the presentence investigation report (PSI), which referenced Raftery\u2019s status as a Montana lawyer and law clerk for the Montana Supreme Court, renders the sentence illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">DISCUSSION STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">\u00b69 \u201c[The Court] reviewfs] criminal sentences that include at least one year of actual incarceration for legality only.\u201d <em>State v. Rosling, </em>2008 MT 62, \u00b6 59, 342 Mont. 1, \u00b6 59, 180 P.3d 1102, \u00b6 59. \u201cOur review is confined to determining whether the sentencing court had statutory authority to impose the sentence, whether the sentence falls within the parameters set by the applicable sentencing statutes, and whether the court adhered to the affirmative mandates of the applicable sentencing statutes.\u201d <em>Rosling, </em>\u00b6 59. \u201cThis determination is a question of law; as such, our review is de novo.\u201d <em>Rosling, </em>\u00b6 59. \u201cTrial judges are granted broad discretion to determine the appropriate punishment for offenses.\u201d <em>State v. Erickson, </em>2008 MT 50, \u00b6 10, 341 Mont. 426, \u00b6 10, 177 P.3d 1043, \u00b6 10. \u201cOn appeal we will not review a sentence for mere inequity or disparity.\u201d <em>Erickson, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">\u00b610 <em>Issue 1. Did the District Court err when it relied on a \u201cneed for retribution\u201d as a factor in sentencing Kirkbride?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Retribution is a component of punishment</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">\u00b611  Kirkbride correctly argued that retribution is not specifically among the sentencing policies articulated in \u00a7 46-18-101(2), MCA, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>the sentencing principles articulated in \u00a7 46-18-101(3), MCA. Kirkbride also argued sentencing policies and principles were violated by his sentence that was based on Raftery\u2019s status and his family\u2019s need for retribution. But the policies found in \u00a7 46-18-101(2), MCA, include punishing and holding offenders accountable, incarcerating violent offenders, and providing reparations to victims. The Court has repeatedly said retribution is a component of punishment. For example, \u201c[a] sentence of imprisonment following a criminal conviction is imposed because a particular crime was committed, and its purpose is both retributional and rehabilitational.\u201d <em>Matter of C.S., </em>210 Mont. 144, 146, 687 P.2d 57, 59 (1984). We restated this declaration of purpose in 1993. <em>Matter of B.L.T., </em>258 Mont. 468, 473, 853 P.2d 1226, 1229 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><em>\u00b612 Matter of B.L.T. </em>and <em>Matter of C.S. </em>are not the only cases in Montana that establish retribution is a component of punishment. <em>See e.g. State v. Mount, </em>2003 MT 275, \u00b6\u00b6 70, 73, 317 Mont. 481, \u00b6\u00b6 70, 73, 78 P.3d 829, \u00b6\u00b6 70, 73. (\u201c[One] factor addresses traditional aims of punishment-i.e., retribution and deterrence.\u201d The Court also said, \u201cthe more a statute promotes the traditional aims of retribution and deterrence, the more likely the statute is punitive....\u201d) \u201cA civil sanction will be deemed ... punishment in the constitutional sense only if the sanction \u2018may not fairly be characterized as remedial, but <em>only </em>as a deterrent or retribution.\u2019\u201d <em>Frazier v. Montana State Dept. of Corrects., </em>277 Mont. 82, 86, 920 P.2d 93, 96 (1996) <em>(quoting Bae v. Shalala, </em>44 F.3d 489, 493 (7th Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks omitted)). \u201c[A] civil penalty is \u2018punishment\u2019... if it \u2018cannot fairly be said solely to serve a remedial purpose, but rather can only be explained as also serving either retributive or deterrent purposes.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Nelson, </em>275 Mont. 86, 91, 910 P.2d 247, 250 (1996) <em>(quoting United States v. Halper, </em>490 U.S. 435, 448, 109 S. Ct. 1892, 1901-02 (1989)). The Court\u2019s decisions spanning over two decades establish retribution is one of the components of punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">\u00b613 <em>\u201cStare decisis </em>is the preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Payne v. Tennessee, </em>501 U.S. 808, 827, 111 S. Ct. 2597, 2609 (1991). <em>\u201c[SJtare decisis </em>is a fundamental doctrine which reflects our concerns for stability, predictability and equal treatment.\u201d <em>State v. Gatts, </em>279 Mont. 42, 51, 928 P.2d 114, 119 (1996) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). \u201cIt is of fundamental and central importance to the rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>law.\u201d <em>Gatts, </em>279 Mont. at 51, 928 P.2d at 119 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The Court follows prior precedents and holds a judge may consider retribution because prior precedent deems retribution a component of punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">\u00b614 Nevertheless, it is important to note that this is not a case where the only basis for the sentence is retribution. The trial court judge did not say there was little need for either general or specific deterrence and that there was only the slimmest chance for the defendant to reoffend. Instead, the judgment and commitment of the sentencing judge reflected retribution as only the third basis for the sentence. The other bases were \u201cthe likelihood of defendant\u2019s rehabilitation is minimal, [and] the defendant poses a grave risk to society.\u201d Kirkbride had a juvenile criminal record and spent six months at Pine Hills Youth Correctional Facility until he turned 18. He was kicked out of Job Corps and stole property from his parents a few days before Raftery\u2019s homicide to get money for drugs. Based on a psychological examination, the sentencing judge found that \u201cthe defendant lacks conscience, and ... his sociopathic personality will not change over time.\u201d The psychologist had rarely, if ever, seen a young man with a worse chemical dependency problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">\u00b615  Kirkbride also asserts the content of the PSI renders his sentence illegal because the PSI referred to Raftery as a Montana lawyer and Montana Supreme Court law clerk. Kirkbride further argues nothing in \u00a7 46-18-101(2), MCA, or \u00a7 46-18-101(3), MCA, indicates Montana sentencing should be affected by the victim\u2019s relationship to the law. While the PSI noted Raftery\u2019s status as a lawyer and law clerk, the PSI also stated, the crime \u201cwould be no less heinous if Mr. Raftery were a convenience store clerk.\u201d Moreover, the Judgment and Commitment of Kirkbride\u2019s sentencing judge does not refer to Raftery\u2019s status as a lawyer or law clerk. Therefore, the PSI did not make the sentence illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">\u00b616 <em>Issue 2. Did the District Court err by imposing a restriction on Kirkbride\u2019s parole eligibility for fifty-five (55) years?</em></p>\n<p id=\"ARP\">Judges may impose partial parole restrictions</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">\u00b617 Section 46-18-202(2), MCA, in pertinent part, says, \u201cthe sentencing judge may also impose the restriction that the offender is ineligible for parole.\u201d Kirkbride argues the phrase \u201cis ineligible for parole\u201d only allows the sentencing judge to restrict parole for all of a sentence or none of it. The Court disagrees. Recently, the Court described the task of statutory interpretation as \u201csimply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained in the statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>not to insert what is omitted or to omit what is inserted.\u201d <em>State v. Ashmore, </em>2008 MT <em>14, </em>\u00b6 12, 341 Mont. 131, \u00b6 12, 176 P.3d 1022, \u00b6 12 <em>(quoting </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">\u00b618 The Court has, on prior occasion, examined other parts of Title 46, chapter 18 in order to determine the meaning of \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA. <em>Gratzer v. Mahoney, </em>2006 MT 282, \u00b6\u00b6 4-7, 334 Mont. 297, \u00b6\u00b6 4-7, 150 P.3d 343, \u00b6\u00b6 4-7 (examining \u00a7 46-23-103(4), MCA (1981), and \u00a7 46-23-1001(3), MCA (1981), in order to determine the meaning of \u201cterm\u201d contained in \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA (1981)). Section 46-18-202(2), MCA, is not the only provision of Title 46, chapter 18 dealing with the restrictions that sentencing judges may put on sentences. For example, the provision directly preceding \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, empowers trial court judges to attach to sentences \u201cany other limitation reasonably related to the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society.\u201d Section 46-18-202(l)(f), MCA. It is incredible to interpret \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, as imposing an all or nothing limitation on parole restrictions based on the phrase \u201cis ineligible for parole\u201d when the prior section gives the judge great discretion that is limited only by reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\u00b619 Kirkbride correctly argues <em>State v. Thomas, </em>285 Mont. 112, 121-23, 946 P.2d 140, 145-47 (1997), arose on the knowing and voluntary nature of a guilty plea and did not address the lawfulness of partial parole restrictions. However, in order to conclude the guilty plea was lawful, the Montana Supreme Court deemed the partial parole restriction imposed under \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, a \u201cdiscretionary parole restriction.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>285 Mont. at 122, 946 P.2d at 146. It is implausible to interpret \u201ca discretionary parole restriction\u201d as allowing only enough discretion to hand down zan all or nothing parole restriction. Such a construct could be used to greatly diminish the discretion given to trial court judges who have given sentences that are the subject of future appeals before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\u00b620 Moreover, giving the trial court judge discretion is one of Montana\u2019s sentencing policies. <em>See e.g. </em>\u00a7 46-18-101(3)(d), MCA (\u201c[sentencing practices must permit judicial discretion to consider aggravating and mitigating circumstances\u201d). The Court is unwilling to allow the phrase \u201cineligible for parole\u201d to limit sentencing judges to all or nothing parole restrictions. To do otherwise would be bad public policy as one of Montana\u2019s sentencing policies would be greatly diminished.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">\u00b621  The passage of time and the actions, or more appropriately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>inactions, of Montana\u2019s legislature provide a final reason to hold partial parole restrictions lawful. Montana sentences containing partial parole restrictions have been upheld against other challenges at least since 1988. <em>See e.g. State v. Wirtala, </em>231 Mont. 264, 752 P.2d 177 (1988), <em>overruled on other grounds, State v. Lane, </em>1998 MT 76, \u00b6 41, 288 Mont. 286, \u00b6 41, 957 P.2d 9, \u00b6 41. Montana\u2019s legislature has convened every two years since. The legislature is presumed to know how the Court has interpreted its statutes. <em>Sampson v. Nat\u2019l Farmers Union Prop. &amp; Cas. Co., </em>2006 MT 241, \u00b6 20, 333 Mont. 541, \u00b6 20, 144 P.3d 797, \u00b6 20. Therefore, if the Montana legislature disapproved of partial parole restrictions, it could have changed the text of \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, in order to ban such partial restrictions. Since the text of \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, is unchanged, the Court presumes the legislature approves of partial parole restrictions. Therefore, the Court holds partial parole restrictions do not offend \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\u00b622 The Court holds an illegal sentence did not result from the sentencing judge partially basing the sentence on the need of the victim\u2019s family for retribution. Multiple decisions of the Montana Supreme Court establish retribution as a component of punishment. The content of the PSI did not render Kirkbride\u2019s sentence illegal. An illegal sentence did not result from the imposition of a partial parole restriction. The phrase \u201cis ineligible for parole\u201d does not limit a sentencing judge\u2019s discretion to impose all or nothing parole restrictions. To hold otherwise would harm Montana\u2019s sentencing policy of promoting discretion. Furthermore, partial parole restrictions have been a part of Montana Supreme Court decisions since 1988, and the Montana legislature has not altered the text of the statute. Therefore, the Court presumes the Montana legislature concluded partial parole restrictions do not offend \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA. The sentence of the trial court is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b435-6\">DISTRICT COURT JUDGE WATTERS sitting for CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, DISTRICT COURT JUDGE GUSTAFSON sitting for JUSTICE COTTER, DISTRICT COURT JUDGE FAGG sitting for JUSTICE RICE and DISTRICT COURT JUDGE BAUGH sitting for JUSTICE NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
