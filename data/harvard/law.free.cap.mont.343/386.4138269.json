Friedt filed an Application for Writ of Supervisory Control and To Stay Lower Court Proceedings. She alleged that the Billings Municipal Court had made a mistake of law causing a gross injustice in ordering Friedt\u2019s guilty pleas and sentence withdrawn, and that allowing the Municipal Court proceedings to continue would be fundamentally unfair and prejudicial. On April 16, we stayed the Municipal Court proceedings pending further order from this Court. We also ordered the Office of the Billings City Attorney, and permitted the Judge of the Billings Municipal Court, to file a summary response pursuant to M. R. App. P. 14(7)(b). Deputy City Attorney Curtis L. Bevolden timely filed a summary response on April 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u00b62 The relevant facts are undisputed. In December of 2007, Friedt was cited for the offenses of a stop sign violation, failing to carry proof of or exhibit insurance in vehicle (the \u201cno insurance\u201d charge) and failing to have her driver\u2019s license in her immediate possession. At her arraignment in Municipal Court on January 17, 2008, Friedt responded \u201cno\u201d when asked if she wished to consult an attorney, pled guilty to the stop sign violation and pled not guilty to the \u201cno insurance\u201d charge. The Municipal Court sentenced Friedt by imposing a fine of $50 plus a surcharge on the stop sign charge, dismissed the driver\u2019s license charge with a warning and set an omnibus hearing on the \u201cno insurance\u201d charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">\u00b63 On February 12, 2008, Friedt appeared at the omnibus hearing and pled guilty to the \u201cno insurance\u201d charge. The Municipal Court sentenced her to six months in jail, all suspended on the condition that she pay a $500 fine plus surcharge. The court allowed Friedt to perform community service in lieu of the fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\u00b64 On February 28, 2008, the Municipal Court, acting <em>sua sponte, </em>entered an order withdrawing Friedt\u2019s guilty pleas to the stop sign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>violation and the \u201cno insurance\u201d charge. The court noted that, on February 15, it had received an e-mail from Bevolden and, on February 20, had received a packet of correspondence from Moira Murphy D\u2019Alton, the owner of a fence allegedly damaged during the events leading to Friedt\u2019s citations. The subject of both Bevolden\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>e-mail and D\u2019Alton\u2019s correspondence packet was D\u2019Alton\u2019s request for restitution for the damaged fence. The correspondence packet indicated D\u2019Alton first communicated her request to Bevolden on December 31, 2007, and had written letters to the Billings Police Department, Bevolden and the Municipal Court from December of 2007 through February of 2008. Observing the address on D\u2019Alton\u2019s letters to the Municipal Court was incorrect, the court determined after consulting with court employees that the court had not received D\u2019Alton\u2019s previous letters, and restitution had not been requested by the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\u00b65 The Municipal Court noted it did not have any factual information regarding a potential restitution claim when Friedt entered her guilty pleas at the arraignment and omnibus hearing, and reasoned that \u00a7 46-18-201(5), MCA, requires a court to impose restitution if a victim has sustained a pecuniary loss. The court concluded that, because no mutual discovery regarding the restitution claim had been afforded to Friedt before either of her guilty pleas, the court \u201c[could not] find that the Defendant entered into a constitutionally sound, intelligent, knowing, voluntary plea of Guilty.\u201d The court further reasoned that Friedt was not afforded her right to counsel at her arraignment on the \u201cno insurance\u201d charge. The Municipal Court ordered that Friedt\u2019s guilty pleas be withdrawn, appointed defense counsel, and set an omnibus hearing, which apparently occurred on April 8, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u00b66 Friedt applied to this Court for a writ of supervisory control on April 9, 2008, and filed her affidavit in support. Friedt maintains she knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily pled guilty to the two offenses. She also points to her written and signed waivers of rights stating she was advised that the court would appoint counsel for her if she could not afford an attorney, and that she \u201cknowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waive[d] [her] right to be represented by an attorney.\u201d Friedt further asserts the Municipal Court\u2019s jurisdiction ended when it sentenced her. In this regard, she relies primarily on <em>State ex rel. Torres v. District Court, </em>265 Mont. 445, 450, 877 P.2d 1008, 1011 (1994) which states, among other things, that \u201conce a valid sentence has been pronounced, the court loses jurisdiction to vacate or modify the sentence, except as otherwise provided by statute.\u201d <em>See also State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number><em>v. Hirt, </em>2005 MT 285, \u00b6 19, 329 Mont. 267, \u00b6 19, 124 P.3d 147, \u00b6 19; <em>State v. Evert, </em>2004 MT 178, \u00b6 14, 322 Mont. 105, \u00b6 14, 93 P.3d 1254, \u00b6 14. Friedt argues that the Municipal Court is proceeding under a mistake of law, which would result in a gross injustice and unnecessary expenditures of time and resources if she were required to stand trial on charges to which she has pled guilty and on which she has been sentenced. She further asserts it would be fundamentally unfair and prejudicial to force her to face further proceedings if the Municipal Court lacks jurisdiction. Friedt asks this Court to exercise its supervisory control jurisdiction and remand with instructions to vacate the February 28, 2008, order.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\">\u00b67 In his summary response, Bevolden asserts that, because he was distracted at the February 12 omnibus hearing by \u201cactivity\u2019 including negotiations with several defendants and simultaneous proceedings in two courtrooms, he failed to raise any issue regarding restitution before Friedt was sentenced. He argues, however, that the Municipal Court had jurisdiction after imposing sentence under \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA, which provides in part that, following a verdict or finding of guilty, a court may grant a defendant a new trial without a motion if required in the interest of justice. He maintains the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d to the victim and the mandatory restitution provision in \u00a7 46-18-201(5), MCA, required the Municipal Court to remedy the situation <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u00b68 Bevolden\u2019s reliance on the provision for granting a new trial in \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA, is misplaced. \u201cThe granting of a new trial places the parties in the same position as if there had been no trial.\u201d Section 46-16-701, MCA. Here, no trial occurred. Moreover, the clear intent of the \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA, language is to grant a <em>defendant </em>a new trial if the interests of justice would be served. Nothing in the statute authorizes a new proceeding to benefit an alleged victim or a prosecutor who failed to timely raise a sentencing matter. We conclude \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA, has no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u00b69  We observe that \u00a7 46-16-105(2), MCA, provides that \u201c[a]t any time before judgment or, except when a claim of innocence is supported by evidence of a fundamental miscarriage of justice, within 1 year after judgment becomes final, the court may, for good cause shown, permit the plea of guilty or nolo contendere to be withdrawn and a plea of not guilty substituted.\u201d Nothing in the plain language of \u00a7 46-16-105(2), MCA, authorizes a court, in essence, to forcibly withdraw a defendant\u2019s plea <em>sua sponte </em>under any circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>\u00b610  Nor can we agree with the Municipal Court\u2019s possible reliance on \u00a7\u00a7 46-12-210(l)(a)(iv) and (l)(b), MCA, which provide, respectively, that a court must determine before accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere that the defendant understands the possibility of restitution \u201cwhen applicable,\u201d and the right to counsel. The Municipal Court apparently interpreted \u00a7 46-12-210(l)(a)(iv), MCA, as rendering a plea invalid if the court has failed to advise the defendant of potential restitution claims that the prosecution has failed to timely and properly assert-an interpretation we reject. Regarding advice of the right to counsel under \u00a7 46-12-210(l)(b), MCA, the audio record confirms that the Municipal Court failed to advise Friedt orally that she had the right to appointed counsel if she could not afford an attorney-instead asking only if Friedt wished to speak with an attorney at her January 17 arraignment and saying nothing regarding counsel at the February 12 hearing. As provided in \u00a7 46-12-210(2), MCA, however, the requirements for ascertaining a defendant\u2019s understanding of the matters set forth in \u00a7 46-12-210(1), MCA, \u201cmay be accomplished by the defendant filing a written acknowledgment of the information[.]\u201d Here, Friedt executed a written waiver of rights, including her right to appointed counsel, with respect to each of her guilty pleas. Moreover, Friedt maintains her guilty pleas were knowing, voluntary and intelligent. We conclude, based on the undisputed facts, that the Municipal Court erred in determining otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\u00b611  Supervisory control is an extraordinary remedy and is sometimes justified when urgency or emergency factors exist making the normal appeal process inadequate, when the case involves purely legal questions, and when one or more of the following circumstances exist: (a) the other court is proceeding under a mistake of law and is causing a gross injustice; (b) constitutional issues of state-wide importance are involved; (c) the other court has granted or denied a motion for substitution of a judge in a criminal case. M. R. App. P. 14(3). Applying these standards, we conclude the Municipal Court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>order withdrawing Friedt\u2019s guilty pleas-contrary to the undisputed facts of record and Friedt\u2019s characterization of her pleas-constitutes a mistake of law causing a gross injustice. Moreover, we conclude these unique facts render the normal appeal process inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u00b612 We observe that this case does not present an issue of whether the sentence here may be illegal. Likewise, it does not involve any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>remedies available to a prosecutor in the event an illegal sentence is imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-3\">\u00b6 13 IT IS ORDERED that Friedt\u2019s application for a writ of supervisory control is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">\u00b614 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this case is remanded to the Municipal Court with instructions to vacate the February 28, 2008, order withdrawing Friedt\u2019s guilty pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u00b615 The Clerk is directed to mail copies of this order to all counsel of record, to the Clerk of the Billings Municipal Court, and to the presiding judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">DATED this 13th day of May, 2008.</p>\n<judges id=\"b411-7\">/S/KARLA M. GRAY</judges>\n<judges id=\"AQU\">/S/ PATRICIA COTTER</judges>\n<judges id=\"Aup\">/S/JIM RICE</judges>\n<judges id=\"AhZg\">/S/BRIAN MORRIS</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"Adt\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"Ad2\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">\u00b616 I concur with all that is said in the Court\u2019s Opinion and Order except that in \u00b6 12. In my view, there was nothing illegal in the trial court\u2019s sentence prior to the court sua sponte withdrawing Friedt\u2019s guilty pleas, appointing defense counsel-which she had not requested-and setting an omnibus hearing. I was shocked at the prosecutor\u2019s and court\u2019s handling of this matter. While the Billings Municipal Court may be very busy, the \u201cactivity\u201d of the omnibus hearings, as the prosecutor describes it, is hardly the fault-or the problem-of defendants appearing before the court. If the prosecutor makes mistakes because of being distracted by negotiations or because he was in another courtroom, then the consequences of his error-or the system\u2019s failure-should not fall on the defendant. Friedt came to court as ordered; she entered a lawful plea after being advised of her rights; she was legally sentenced. She should not, again, be required to repeat this process to undo alleged mistakes made by the State in the first go-around. If the victim is owed damages, then she has civil remedies against Friedt. With that caveat, I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
