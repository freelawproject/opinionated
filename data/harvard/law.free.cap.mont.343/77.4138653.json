We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court err when it imposed an alcohol condition as part of Deshazo\u2019s sentence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">\u00b64 Ravalli County investigators obtained a search warrant for the home and property of Deshazo in August of 2006. Investigators discovered thirty-eight live marijuana plants growing on Deshazo\u2019s property. Some of the plants reached four feet in height. Investigators found a small potted marijuana plant, processed marijuana, and related drug paraphernalia inside Deshazo\u2019s home. Ravalli County officers arrested Deshazo. The officers found a marijuana pipe on Deshazo at the time of his arrest. Deshazo pled guilty to a single charge of producing or manufacturing dangerous drugs in violation of \u00a7 45-9-110(1X4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">\u00b65 The Department of Corrections submitted a pre-sentence report. The report detailed Deshazo\u2019s lengthy history of substance abuse. Deshazo revealed that, until the time of his arrest, he had used marijuana on a daily basis since the age of sixteen. Deshazo was thirty-four years old at the time of the report. Deshazo also admitted that he previously had used cocaine, methamphetamine, hallucinogenic mushrooms, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">\u00b66 Deshazo asserted that he does not abuse alcohol. He stated that he limited his alcohol consumption to an occasional drink on holidays. Deshazo completed chemical dependency treatment in November of 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-12\">\u00b67 The District Court held a sentencing hearing on February 28, 2007. The State conceded at the hearing that alcohol did not have a direct connection to Deshazo\u2019s underlying offense. The District Court imposed a deferred sentence for a period of three years subject to conditions. The court\u2019s sentence included a provision prohibiting Deshazo from possessing or consuming intoxicants, including alcohol. The condition also prohibited Deshazo from entering any place where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>intoxicants constitute the chief items of sale. Deshazo appeals on the sole ground that the alcohol restriction constitutes an impermissible condition of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u00b68 We recently have determined that we will review some criminal sentences for both legality and abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Ashby, </em>2008 MT 83, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, 342 Mont. 187, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, 179 P.3d 1164, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. We noted in <em>Ashby </em>that the sentencing statutes authorize conditions of probation that constitute \u201creasonable restrictions\u201d necessary for either an offender\u2019s rehabilitation or for the protection of the victim or society. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 9 (citing \u00a7 46-18-201(4), MCA). We confirmed in <em>Ashby, </em>however, that a sentence always must fall within statutory parameters. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 8. We first review a condition of probation for legality. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 9. We then will review a condition of probation for an abuse of discretion. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">\u00b69 Deshazo argues that the alcohol restriction included by the District Court constitutes an illegal condition. He asserts that the fact that alcohol did not relate or contribute to his underlying offense precluded the District Court from including the alcohol restriction as a condition of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">\u00b610 We recently have revisited the relationship between a sentencing condition and a defendant in our decision in <em>Ashby. Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15. We previously had required a sentence or condition to have a correlation or connection with the underlying offense. <em>State v. Ommundson, </em>1999 MT 16, \u00b6 11, 293 Mont. 133, \u00b6 11, 974 P.2d 620, \u00b6 11. We expanded in <em>Ashby </em>the rule set forth in <em>Ommundson, </em>allowing judges to impose sentencing conditions that relate either to the underlying offense or to the offender. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">\u00b611  We also have determined that a sufficient nexus exists between alcohol restrictions and drug-related offenses. <em>State v. Winkel, </em>2008 MT 89, \u00b6 14, 342 Mont. 267, \u00b6 14, 182 P.3d 54, \u00b6 14. We concluded in <em>Winkel </em>that a condition prohibiting the possession or ingestion of intoxicants would serve to rehabilitate a person convicted of possession of a dangerous drug and possession of drug paraphernalia. <em>Winkel, </em>\u00b6 14. This Court found more support for the alcohol restriction in light of Winkel\u2019s extensive history of substance abuse. <em>Winkel, </em>\u00b6 15. We noted that Winkel began using drugs at an early age, had admitted to regular substance abuse, and had tried a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>variety of illegal substances. <em>Winkel, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">\u00b612  Like the defendant in <em>Winkel, </em>Deshazo faced the imposition of a sentence after pleading guilty to a serious drug-related charge. The pre-sentence report revealed that Deshazo had started using marijuana at an early age, had admitted to using marijuana on a daily basis for an extended period of time, and had used a variety of illegal substances. The District Court included the alcohol restriction in an attempt to aid in Deshazo\u2019s rehabilitation given Deshazo\u2019s addictive tendencies. We conclude that the alcohol condition included in Deshazo\u2019s sentence had a sufficient nexus to both the underlying offense and to Deshazo. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">\u00b613 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b100-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
