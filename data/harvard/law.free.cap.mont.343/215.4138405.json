(Mother) appeals from an order of the Fifth Judicial District Court, Beaverhead County, transferring venue in this custody and parenting plan case to Gallatin County, the home county of J.M.B. (Father). We reverse and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in transferring venue to Gallatin County.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">\u00b63 Mother and Father are the parents of B.C.B.W. (Daughter), who was bom in 2002 and was four years old at the time the underlying case commenced. The parents never married, and Mother and Daughter lived in Billings, Yellowstone County, Montana, from the time of Daughter\u2019s birth. Father lived with them for several months and then moved to Bozeman, Gallatin County, Montana. Daughter\u2019s paternal grandmother, Denise, resides in Beaverhead County, Montana, and took Daughter there from Billings on December 5,2006, apparently at Mother\u2019s request to facilitate her move to a new residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">\u00b64 Father petitioned the District Court for custody of Daughter, and a parenting plan, on December 18, 2006, and filed his proposed parenting plan the same day. The petition alleged Daughter\u2019s residence was in Beaverhead County at that time. Father moved for temporary orders of custody and protection of Daughter the same day, and filed supporting affidavits alleging child abuse of Daughter by Mother. The District Court entered its temporary order of custody to Father on December 19, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">\u00b65 On December 29, 2006, Mother moved for a change of venue to Yellowstone County and filed a supporting brief. She alleged that Daughter resided in Yellowstone County, neither of the parents lived in Beaverhead County and the facts upon which Father was seeking relief arose in Yellowstone County. The parties fully briefed the motion, and the District Court filed its Order Transferring Venue to Gallatin County, Father\u2019s county of residence, on March 13, 2007. Recognizing Father\u2019s acknowledgement that venue statutes required his petition to be heard in Yellowstone County, the court based its transfer of venue to Gallatin County on Father\u2019s allegations of child abuse. Mother appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b237-3\">\u00b66 The determination of proper venue is a question of law involving the application of Montana\u2019s venue statutes to the pleaded facts. Our review of a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion to change venue is plenary; we merely determine whether the court\u2019s decision is legally correct. <em>Circle S Seeds of Montana, Inc. v. Montana Merchandising, Inc, </em>2006 MT 311, \u00b6 5, 335 Mont. 16, \u00b6 5, 157 P.3d 671, \u00b6 5 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court err in transferring venue to Gallatin County?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u00b68 Mother contends that, under \u00a7\u00a7 25-2-118(3) and 40-4-211, MCA, Yellowstone County is the proper venue for Father\u2019s custody and parenting plan action. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">\u00b69 [1] \u201cThe proper place of trial for an action brought pursuant to Title 40, chapter 4, is the county in which the petitioner or the respondent has resided during the 90 days preceding the filing of the action.\u201d Section 25-2-118(3), MCA. Under this general venue statute, if Father\u2019s proceeding was brought under Title 40, chapter 4, both Gallatin and Yellowstone Counties would be proper places for trial. Father did not file in either of those counties and, however, as a result, he waived his right to have the matter tried in the county of his residence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 25-2-201(1), MCA; <em>Ford v. Montana Dept. of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, </em>208 Mont. 132, 136, 676 P.2d 207, 209 (1984); <em>Seifert v. Gehle, </em>133 Mont. 320, 322-23, 323 P.2d 269, 270 (1958). We conclude Mother was entitled to a change of venue to Yellowstone County pursuant to \u00a7 25-2-118(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">\u00b610 More importantly, however, a specific venue statute exists with regard to venue in a parenting plan proceeding. Pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-211(4), MCA, a parenting plan proceeding must be initiated in the district court in the county where the child is permanently resident or found. Daughter was not permanently resident or permanently found in Beaverhead County, where Father filed his petition. Daughter permanently resided in Yellowstone County and was temporarily found in Beaverhead County in December of 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">\u00b611 In this latter regard, Father argues that \u00a7 40-4-211(4), MCA, is not the only specific venue statute applicable here. He asserts that his proceeding is a paternity proceeding in addition to a parenting procedure. He posits that the venue provision contained in \u00a7 40-6-109, MCA, applies. This contention is without merit and also otherwise flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>\u00b612 Section 40-6-109, MCA, is contained within Montana\u2019s Uniform Parentage Act (Act). <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-6-101, MCA. That Act governs the establishment of parent and child relationships outside of marriage, paternity proceedings and other matters relating to such relationships. <em>See generally </em>\u00a7\u00a7 40-6-102 through -131, MCA. A person bringing a paternity action seeks a judicial determination of the existence of the father and child relationship. <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-6-107, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b613 Section 40-6-109(3), MCA, provides that an action brought under the Act may be brought in the county in which the child or the alleged father resides. The threshold question, therefore, is whether Father\u2019s petition was \u201cbrought under the Act.\u201d He cites to the first two paragraphs of his petition, but they provide no support for his position. Those paragraphs merely state that he is the natural father-and Mother is the natural mother-of Daughter, and go on to describe their respective ages, occupations, residence addresses and domiciles.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b614 More tellingly, the caption of Father\u2019s petition is \u201cIn re the Custody and Parenting Plan of\u2019 Daughter. While the caption would not control the contents of the petition if the two were at odds, nothing in Father\u2019s petition supports his argument that this was a paternity action. Indeed, the relief sought is an award of primary care, custody and control of Daughter, a determination that Father\u2019s parenting plan is in Daughter\u2019s best interests and adoption of that plan, and a determination of child support. We are not persuaded that Father\u2019s petition was, even in part, a paternity action.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b615 Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Father\u2019s petition sought a paternity determination, however, venue for such an action would be in Yellowstone County, where Daughter resides, or in Gallatin County, where Father resides. <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-6-109(3), MCA. He chose to file the petition in Beaverhead County, an improper county. Thus, \u00a7 25-2-201(1), MCA, <em>Ford </em>and <em>Seifert </em>again would entitle Mother to a change of venue to Yellowstone County.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u00b616 Coming full circle, we return to the District Court\u2019s order transferring venue and observe that the order cites to not a single venue statute or other legal authority in support of its determination that the \u201cproper venue is Father\u2019s home county [and t]hat county is Gallatin.\u201d The court\u2019s decision rested on its concern that Mother had not refuted Father\u2019s allegations of child abuse and that its primary goal was to protect the child by \u201cnot requiring the child to return to Mother\u2019s home in Yellowstone County.\u201d The District Court\u2019s concerns are understandable. However, they are not relevant to determining proper venue as a matter of law. Absent proper venue, the allegations of abuse and other matters pertinent to Father\u2019s petition cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>addressed. Moreover, transferring venue of the proceeding to Yellowstone County would not have required returning Daughter to Mother\u2019s home in light of the District Court\u2019s award of temporary custody to Father.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\">\u00b617 Father advances here-as he did in the District <em>Court-Stoneman v. Drollinger, </em>2003 MT 25, 314 Mont. 139, 64 P.3d 997, a case involving the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) which is found in Title 40, chapter 7 of the MCA. The issue in <em>Stoneman </em>\u2014 which had a long history in Montana courts-was whether the trial court erred in denying the former wife\u2019s motion to decline to exercise jurisdiction as an inconvenient forum under the UCCJEA. <em>Stoneman, </em>\u00b6 2. The background included repeated guilty pleas to partner and family member assault by Stoneman, several court-issued orders of protection and violations thereof, and other determinations of violent behavior by Stoneman. <em>Stoneman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4, 27.</p>\n<p id=\"ACS\">\u00b618 The trial court in <em>Stoneman </em>acknowledged the well-documented history of domestic violence, but denied the ex-wife\u2019s motion to decline jurisdiction in favor of Washington where she and the children had been living. It did not consider which forum could best protect them. <em>Stoneman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4, 30, 34. On appeal, we ultimately held-after considering all the UCCJEA factors-that Washington was the more appropriate forum for determining a visitation plan for Stoneman and the children. We directed the Montana trial court to decline jurisdiction as an inconvenient forum. <em>Stoneman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 42-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b619 <em>Stoneman </em>has no application here. In the present case, no violent or abusive conduct by Mother had been judicially determined in any court prior to her motion to change venue. Nor was the UCCJEA, a motion regarding jurisdiction or even a motion to change venue on <em>forum non conveniens </em>at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u00b620  We hold the District Court erred as a matter of law in transferring venue to Gallatin County and in denying Mother\u2019s motion to change venue to Yellowstone County. This case must be remanded to the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County, for the purpose of that court\u2019s immediate remand to the Fifth Judicial District Court, Beaverhead County. Upon the occurrence of that event, we direct the Beaverhead County District Court to immediately vacate its order transferring venue to Gallatin County, and to enter an order granting Mother\u2019s motion to change venue to Yellowstone County. \u00b621 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b239-6\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, COTTER and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
