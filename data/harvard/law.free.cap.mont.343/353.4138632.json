Billion, Inc. (Billion) appeals from the judgment entered by the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County, upon a jury verdict in favor of Rob Hager (Hager). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it submitted an instruction to the jury that referred to Billion\u2019s employee handbook ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aly\">\u00b64 Did sufficient evidence exist to support the jury\u2019s award for damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">\u00b65 Hager started working for Billion in March of 1985 as the manager of Billion Auto Body. Billion converted the auto body shop (the shop) to take an assembly line-type approach to servicing vehicles in the spring of 2004. Billion hired an additional man, Keith Stone (Stone), to serve as the shop\u2019s estimator in April of 2004, and to facilitate the shop\u2019s new direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-13\">\u00b66 Billion divided the shop\u2019s management during the summer of 2004. Billion promoted Stone from his position as an estimator to the shop\u2019s \u201cProduction Manager.\u201d Hager became the shop\u2019s \u201cSales Manager.\u201d Hager received a \u201cpay plan\u201d in May of 2004 that set his salary at $6,000 per month through December of 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-14\">\u00b67 Billion provided Hager a document entitled \u201cRob Hager Job Responsibilities\u201d in the early fall of 2004. The document listed fifteen duties relating to the sales manager\u2019s responsibility to \u201cgrow the sales, keep customers happy, and maintain department profitability.\u201d Hager met with Billion\u2019s president, Joe Billion, in September of 2004. Hager received another copy of the job responsibilities document at this meeting. This second copy included assessment scores assigned by Joe Billion to each of the fifteen listed duties. Hager received an \u201cF\u201d on the assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-15\">\u00b68 Billion re-assigned Hager from \u201cSales Manager\u201d to \u201cBody Shop Estimator\u201d shortly after Hager\u2019s 2004 September meeting with Joe Billion. Hager received a revised \u201cpay plan,\u201d effective October 1,2004, that set his salary at $3,000 per month. Hager resigned from Billion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>January of 2005. Hager found a replacement position as a service writer with Big Sky R.V.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u00b69 Hager filed a complaint against Billion on June 21, 2005. The complaint alleged that Billion had discharged Hager in violation of the Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act (the Act). Hager alleged that Billion had created an intolerable work environment for Hager in violation of the Act. The parties unsuccessfully attempted mediation, and a four-day jury trial commenced on June 4, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">\u00b610 Hager testified at trial. Hager discussed the J.C. Billion employee handbook. Billion did not object to the admission of the handbook into evidence. The handbook provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">When an employee ... is in violation of work rules, but not subject to immediate discharge, the following progressive disciplinary action shall normally be taken:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">1. First occasion-V erbal warning, or if more serious, a written warning may be immediately given.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-9\">2. Second Occasion-Written warning (if not given on first occurrence).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-10\">3. Third Occasion-Discharge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-11\">All employees must realize that written warnings are reserved for the most serious occasions. The next step, after a written warning, is termination of your employment. Remember, the verbal warning step may be skipped in certain situations, if the offense is serious. (Emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">Hager asserted that he had received no verbal or written warnings before his demotion and wage reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">\u00b611 Joe Billion also testified at trial. Joe Billion confirmed that he had assessed Hager through the \u201cJob Responsibilities\u201d document. Joe Billion testified that Hager had not complied with the assessment plan and that Hager had become lazy and insubordinate. Joe Billion stated that Hager\u2019s conduct constituted a \u201cviolation of the work rules.\u201d Joe Billion asserted that he had demoted Hager to the shop\u2019s estimator as a result of his bad attitude and his poor performance evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">\u00b612 Hager also testified at trial regarding his alleged damages. Hager summarized his calculations of the differences between his salary at J.C. Billion before his wage reduction and his current salary at Big Sky R.V. Hager also introduced as an exhibit a statement from Billion that listed the gross salary and benefits that Billion had paid to Hager from 1994 through January 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-15\">\u00b613 The District Court settled the jury instructions at the close of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>evidence. The parties discussed Hager\u2019s proposed instruction concerning wrongful discharge. Hager\u2019s proposed instruction provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS9K\">It is wrongful for an employer to discharge an employee if: the discharge was not for good cause and the employee had completed the employer\u2019s probationary period of employment; or the employer violated the express provisions of its own written personnel policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Billion objected. Billion asserted that the instruction\u2019s clause concerning an employer\u2019s compliance with a written personnel policy had no application to Hager\u2019s case. Hager asserted that the evidence presented at trial raised the issue of Billion\u2019s failure to comply with its personnel policy. Hager noted Billion\u2019s determination that Hager had violated the rules. Hager also noted the fact that Billion had imposed no verbal or written warnings. Hager moved the court to amend the pleadings to conform to the evidence. The court granted Hager\u2019s motion over Billion\u2019s objection. The court accepted Hager\u2019s instruction concerning wrongful discharge in its entirety over Billion\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"AE2\">\u00b614 The jury returned a verdict in Hager\u2019s favor and awarded him $60,000 in damages. Billion appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\u00b615 We review a district court\u2019s jury instructions for an abuse of discretion. <em>Murphy Homes, Inc. v. Muller, </em>2007 MT 140, \u00b6 74, 337 Mont. 411, \u00b6 74, 162 P.3d 106, \u00b6 74. We consider the instruction in its entirety, as well as in connection with the other instructions given and the evidence introduced at trial. <em>Murphy Homes, Inc., </em>\u00b6 74. The party assigning error to a district court\u2019s jury instruction must demonstrate prejudice in order to prevail on appeal. <em>Murphy Homes, Inc., </em>\u00b6 74. Prejudice does not exist if the jury instructions in their entirety state the applicable law of the case. <em>Murphy Homes, Inc., </em>\u00b6 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">\u00b616 We review a jury\u2019s award of compensatory damages to determine if substantial credible evidence exists to support the jury\u2019s award. <em>Jenks v. Bertelsen, </em>2004 MT 50, \u00b6 30, 320 Mont. 139, \u00b6 30, 86 P.3d 24, \u00b6 30. We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>Jenks, </em>\u00b6 30. Substantial evidence consists of \u201cevidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion; it consists of more than a mere scintilla of evidence but may be somewhat less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Johnston v. Palmer, </em>2007 MT 99, \u00b6 26, 337 Mont. 101, \u00b6 26, 158 P.3d 998, \u00b6 26 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>DISCUSSION ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">\u00b617 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it submitted an instruction to the jury that referred to Billion\u2019s employee handbook ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"A2H\">\u00b618 Billion argues that the second half of the wrongful discharge instruction had no relation to Hager\u2019s wrongful discharge claim. Billion argues that nothing in the employee handbook required Billion to follow the progressive disciplinary measures before making changes in Hager\u2019s employment conditions. Hager asserts that the changes that Billion made to Hager\u2019s employment conditions constituted a \u201cdischarge.\u201d Hager argues that Billion had to follow its disciplinary process before it could effect this \u201cdischarge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\u00b619 Billion argues on appeal only that the District Court erred by submitting to the jury the second half of Hager\u2019s wrongful discharge instruction. Billion does not fault the court for granting Hager\u2019s motion to amend the pleading to conform to the evidence presented at trial. We normally will review on appeal only those issues raised by the parties. <em>Armstrong v. </em>State, 1999 MT 261, \u00b6 4, 296 Mont. 361, \u00b6 4, 989 P.2d 364, \u00b6 4. We will review Billion\u2019s argument only with respect to the District Court\u2019s decision to submit to the jury the wrongful discharge instruction in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">\u00b620 The District Court\u2019s wrongful discharge instructions tracked the language from \u00a7 39-2-903, MCA, and \u00a7 39-2-904, MCA. Section 39-2-903(2), MCA, provides that the term discharge includes a constructive discharge. Section 39-2-903(1), MCA, defines constructive discharge as the voluntary termination of employment due to an employer-created situation that a reasonable person would consider intolerable. Finally, \u00a7 39-2-904, MCA, provides that a discharge is wrongful if the discharge \u201cwas not for good cause ...,\u201d or if \u201cthe employer violated the express provisions of its own written personal policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">\u00b621 Joe Billion testified that Hager\u2019s actions and conduct had constituted a violation of the work rules. Joe Billion stated that Hager\u2019s conduct had prompted Billion to demote Hager and to reduce his wage. Hager presented to the jury the verbal and written warning procedures that Billion \u201cnormally\u2019 undertook when an employee stood in violation of the work rules. Billion did not object to this evidence. Hager testified that he had received no verbal or written warnings before his demotion and wage reduction. Hager amended his pleadings to conform to all of this evidence at the end of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">\u00b622  The District Court properly charged the jury with determining whether Hager\u2019s demotion and wage reduction constituted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>\u201cdischarge.\u201d The court also charged the jury with deciding, in the event that the jury determined that a discharge had occurred, whether this discharge took place without good cause, or in violation of Billion\u2019s personnel policy. The District Court\u2019s instructions properly stated the applicable law in light of the evidence presented at trial and Hager\u2019s amended claims. <em>Murphy Homes, Inc., </em>\u00b6 74. The District Court did not abuse its discretion by giving a wrongful discharge instruction that referred to an employer\u2019s violation of its written personnel policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u00b623 <em>Did sufficient evidence exist to support the jury\u2019s award for damages?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">\u00b624 Billion asserts that insufficient evidence existed to support the jury\u2019s calculations concerning Hager\u2019s lost wages. Billion argues that Hager\u2019s failure to submit into evidence tax returns or Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form W-2 precluded the jury from assessing damages for lost wages. Billion specifically cites Hager\u2019s failure to introduce any evidence demonstrating the \u201cgross amount of wages that had been reported to the Internal Revenue Service on form W-2.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\u00b625 Hager alleged that his demotion and salary reduction constituted a wrongful discharge. Hager sought to recover lost wages, lost vacation benefits, and lost bonuses under the available remedies set forth in the Act. Billion does not challenge Hager\u2019s claims with respect to lost vacation benefits and lost bonuses. Accordingly, we confine our review to the issue of lost wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">\u00b626  Section 39-2-903(6), MCA, provides that lost wages consist of the \u201cgross amount of wages that would have been reported to the internal revenue service as gross income on Form W-2 ....\u201d The statute does not restrict a lost wage calculation to amounts obtained directly from a Form W-2 or any other tax document. The court\u2019s instruction followed the statutory definition of lost wages and confined the calculation of lost wages to amounts that \u201cwould have been reported ...\u201d on Form W-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">\u00b627 Billion misstates the statute. Billion argues that the statute requires Hager to establish his lost wages with evidence of wage amounts \u201cthat <em>had been </em>reported ...\u201d to the IRS. Hager could not establish his lost wages, of course, by contrasting Form W-2\u2019s from his new employment at Big Sky R.V. with Form W-2\u2019s from Billion. Hager no longer worked for, or received, Form W-2\u2019s from Billion.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">\u00b628  Hager testified concerning his \u201cannual salary\u201d during his employment at Billion. Hager derived this amount from the statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>provided by Billion during discovery and from the last \u201cpay plan\u201d that he had received before his demotion. Hager submitted Billion\u2019s statement and the \u201cpay plan\u201d as trial exhibits. Hager further testified that he had calculated his lost wages by subtracting the salary from his new job at Big Sky R.V., \u201cbased off my W-2 ...,\u201d from his annual salary at Billion. Hager provided testimonial evidence regarding the gross amount of wages that \u201cwould have been reported ...\u201d to the IRS. Hager\u2019s testimony regarding his lost wages constitutes substantial credible evidence to support the damages award. <em>Johnston, </em>\u00b6 26. We conclude that sufficient evidence existed to support the jury\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayu\">\u00b629 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b379-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
