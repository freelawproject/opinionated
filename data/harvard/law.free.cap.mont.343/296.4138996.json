Strange (John), appeals an order of the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, granting Appellee Roselyn Strange\u2019s (Rose) motion to dismiss. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">\u00b62 The only issue raised on appeal is whether the District Court erred by ruling that Montana was an improper venue for the probate of John\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">\u00b63 John and Rose were married October 6, 2001, in Pima County, Arizona, and resided in Arizona until John\u2019s death on March 17,2005, at the age of eighty-nine. At the time of his death, John owned real property in Arizona and Pennsylvania. John never resided in Montana, but periodically visited his son, Alan, in Billings. John left a small amount of personal property in Montana with Alan, including fishing gear, a rifle, and various tools, all of which were of very little value. In addition, Alan opened an account with Putnam Investments for John, which Alan managed in Montana under a power of attorney executed by John after he suffered a stroke and heart attack in the fall of 1999. The balance of that account was $8.70 approximately six weeks after John\u2019s death. There is no evidence in the record of the Putnam account\u2019s value at the time of John\u2019s death. John, Alan, and Alan\u2019s brother, John P. Strange, Jr. (John Jr.), also shared a RBC Dain Rauscher account in joint tenancy in Montana. Upon John\u2019s death, however, that account automatically became the property of Alan and John Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">\u00b64 On August 8,2006, Alan filed an Application for Informal Probate of Will and Appointment of Personal Representative with the District Court, having been named as co-personal representative of his father\u2019s estate along with John Jr. John Jr. waived appointment and consented to Alan\u2019s appointment as sole Personal Representative of John\u2019s estate. On December 13, 2006, Rose filed a motion to dismiss Alan\u2019s application, arguing the District Court lacked both venue and jurisdiction -under \u00a7\u00a7 72-3-112 and 72-1-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-13\">\u00b65 The District Court concluded that it had jurisdiction over Alan, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>but determined that venue was not proper in Montana because John\u2019s Montana assets did not establish a \u201csignificant connection\u201d to Montana. The court also observed that Montana would be an inappropriate forum since Arizona\u2019s elective share laws would apply to Rose\u2019s share of John\u2019s estate. Accordingly, the District Court granted Rose\u2019s motion to dismiss on the basis of venue. Alan appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\u00b66 The District Court\u2019s conclusion that it lacked venue over John\u2019s probate proceeding was based on the court\u2019s interpretation and construction of the Uniform Probate Code\u2019s venue provision. \u201cInterpretation and construction of a rule of procedure, like interpretation and construction of a statute, is a matter of law, which we review de novo, determining whether the court\u2019s interpretation and construction of the rule is correct.\u201d <em>See Miller v. Eighteenth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>2007 MT 149, \u00b6 22, 337 Mont. 488, \u00b6 22, 162 P.3d 121, \u00b6 22; <em>Madrid v. Zenchiku Land &amp; Livestock, </em>2002 MT 172, \u00b6 5, 310 Mont. 491, \u00b6 5, 51 P.3d 1137, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">\u00b67 Did the District Court err by ruling that Montana was an improper venue for the probate of John\u2019s estate?</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">\u00b68 Although it is not an issue on appeal, we first observe that the District Court concluded it had jurisdiction over the probate of John\u2019s estate. Section 72-1-201(2), MCA (2005), provides that the Uniform Probate Code, as adopted by the Montana Legislature, applies to \u201cthe property of nonresidents located in this state or property coming into the control of a fiduciary who is subject to the laws of this state[.]\u201d The District Court concluded it had jurisdiction over Alan, as John\u2019s Personal Representative, because Alan acquired fiduciary control over John\u2019s property and was a Montana resident subject to the laws of this state. As such, the District Court concluded it had \u201cjurisdiction to apply provisions of Montana\u2019s Uniform Probate Code to John\u2019s estate.\u201d Neither John nor Rose challenges the District Court\u2019s conclusion regarding jurisdiction, which we accept as conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">\u00b69 With regard to Rose\u2019s allegation that Montana was not the proper venue, however, the District Court applied \u00a7 72-3-112, MCA (2005), and determined that Montana was not a proper venue in which to probate John\u2019s estate. Section 72-3-112, MCA (2005), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-10\">(1) Venue for the first informal or formal testacy or appointment proceedings after a decedent\u2019s death is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>(a) in the county where the decedent had his domicile at the time of his death; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-4\">(b) <em>if the decedent was not domiciled in this state, in any county where property of the decedent was located at the time of his death.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">(Emphasis added.) The District Court applied subsection (l)(b), but nonetheless concluded that venue was not proper in Montana despite the fishing gear, rifle, and assorted tools John left in Montana and his Montana Putnam Investment account.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court based its decision on the fact that the small balance in John\u2019s Montana investment account was \u201cnot a significant enough connection to Montana such that venue is proper here,\u201d and his assets in Montana were \u201cde minimus and given the overall [value] of John\u2019s estate, certainly do not establish a significant connection to the State of Montana to maintain venue when there is objection to such.\u201d By this reasoning, the District Court essentially injected an additional requirement into Montana\u2019s probate statute regarding venue: not only must a decedent have property in the county, but that property must be substantive and have a \u201csignificant connection\u201d to Montana. We must conclude that the imposition of this additional requirement was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\u00b610 The general nature of the probate code allows for multiple probate proceedings to be initiated in the various states where a decedent had property. Contrary to the rule in civil actions, there is no \u201csingle forum\u201d requirement under the Uniform Probate Code. Instead, our statutes allow for an initial filing in Montana if a decedent owned property here, \u00a7 72-1-201(2), MCA, followed by ancillary probate proceedings in other jurisdictions when necessary. <em>See e.g. In re Estate of Firebaugh, </em>271 Mont. 418, 422, 897 P.2d 1088, 1091 (1995) (deferring to the jurisdiction of the State of Kansas for disposition of real property located in Kansas by ancillary probate).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">\u00b611  The venue statute does not require that a decedent have a certain type or amount of property in Montana. Rather, \u201c[i]f the decedent\u2019s domicile was not in the state, venue is proper ... in any county where he had <em>assets.\u201d </em>Official cmt., \u00a7 72-3-112, MCA (emphasis added). As used in \u00a7 72-3-112, MCA, venue pertains to the propriety of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>a given <em>county </em>in Montana for probating a decedent\u2019s estate; issues of venue do not include the propriety of Montana as a <em>state </em>to probate a decedent\u2019s estate. The question of whether Montana is the proper state is governed by Montana\u2019s territorial jurisdiction statute, not the venue statute. <em>See </em>\u00a7 72-1-201(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\u00b612  Once the District Court concluded that jurisdiction was proper in Montana, the only venue issue before the court should have been whether Yellowstone County was the proper county, as opposed to another county in Montana. In addition to the Putnam Investment account, the undisputed facts clearly showed that John owned items of personal property located in Yellowstone County. Applying \u00a7 72-3-112(l)(b), MCA, to those facts, it is clear that John held \u201cproperty\u201d in Yellowstone County, and no evidence was presented that he had property elsewhere in Montana. Regardless of whether John\u2019s Montana property was \u201cde minimus,\u201d the District Court should have concluded that venue was proper in Yellowstone County. There is no statutory requirement that a decedent\u2019s Montana property have a \u201csignificant connection\u201d to Montana. Accordingly, the District Court erred by granting Rose\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">\u00b613 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b320-6\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-8\"> Rose argues that the fishing gear, rifle, and tools, as well as the Putnam Investment account, were not subject to probate because the personal property were inter vivos gifts to Alan and the investment account was not located in Montana, but rather Boston, Massachusetts. However, Rose did not make these arguments at the District Court level. Accordingly, we decline to address those arguments on appeal. <em>See Day v. Payne, </em>280 Mont. 273, 276-77, 929 P.2d 864, 866 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
