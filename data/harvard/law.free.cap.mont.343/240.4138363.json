R. Civ. P. 59 motion for a new trial. We affirm and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err by granting a new trial pursuant to \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA, which specifies the grounds for a new jury trial, rather than \u00a7 25-11-103, MCA, which specifies the grounds for a new bench trial, and did its order fail to state the grounds for granting a new trial with sufficient particularity under Rule 59?</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">\u00b64 2. Are beneficiaries of a trust entitled to notice of entry of judgment of an order approving a trust accounting, pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 77(d), and does a failure to provide such notice toll the time limit for filing post-judgment motions?</p>\n<p id=\"b261-13\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err by failing to apply the three-year statute of limitations applicable to trust proceedings under \u00a7 72-34-511, MCA, or alternatively, by failing to apply the doctrine of laches? \u00b66 4. Did the District Comb\u2019s granting of a new trial violate \u00a7 72-35-206, MCA, which provides that final trust orders are \u201cconclusive on all persons,\u201d and therefore preempts motions under M. R. Civ. P. 52 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>59?</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b67 5. Did the District Court err by enforcing the \u201cprudent man rule\u201d for a period of time during which no such rule existed under the Montana Code?</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u00b68 Appellees Zona Kami (Zona) and Rose Ployhar (Rose) are two beneficiaries of a trust (Trust B) created by their grandfather, DeWitt C. Dunham, in a will executed on October 3, 1966. Dunham left over one million dollars in Trust B when he died, designating Wells Fargo\u2019s predecessor, Norwest Bank Montana, as trustee (collectively, the Bank). The life beneficiary of Trust B was Dunham\u2019s only child, Mary Ann Mushel (Mary Ann), who was to receive income from the trust for her life. Dunham\u2019s four granddaughters, including Zona and Rose, were made discretionary income beneficiaries under Trust B during Mary Ann\u2019s life and will become vested remainder beneficiaries upon Mary Ann\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">\u00b69 Under the terms of Trust B, Mary Ann had the right to receive $15,000 annually, as well as additional payments of up to $10,000 annually simply upon her request. In addition, the Bank was permitted, in its sole discretion, to pay Mary Ann such additional sums as it deemed necessary for her care, support, maintenance, and general welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">\u00b610 Under the stern instruction of Mary Ann, the Bank invested virtually the trust\u2019s entire principal in bonds to produce a higher current income which would be available to Mary Ann. For example, between 1978 and 1995, 98.1 percent of the Trust B assets were invested in bonds and notes and the remaining 1.9 percent was held in cash or cash equivalents. Throughout this time, the Bank was cognizant that investment in stock equities was an appropriate way to benefit the financial interests of, and fulfill its duty to, the remainder beneficiaries. Nonetheless, heeding the stem instructions ofMaryAnn, the Bank continuously declined to do so. Investing the trust assets exclusively in bonds resulted in Trust B missing the opportunity to participate in the long and sustained growth in equity values in the stock market during these years.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">\u00b611 The Bank did not inform Zona and Rose of their rights under the trust as remainder beneficiaries. In communications sent from the Bank\u2019s attorneys and trust officers to Zona and Rose, Trust B was commonly characterized as solely \u201cfor the benefit of Mary Ann.\u201d Both Mary Ann and the Bank led Zona and Rose to believe that any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>payments they received from the trust were made at the discretion of Mary Ann. Although the Bank notified Zona and Rose that the trust assets were invested almost exclusively in bonds, the Bank did not explain to Zona and Rose the consequences of that investment strategy on their interests and expectations-expectations which they were largely uninformed about anyway. The Bank\u2019s trust officer wrote to Zona and Rose in 1977 asking them to consent to investment of 100 percent of the trust\u2019s assets in bonds, but he later acknowledged that he did not advise them that doing so would disadvantage their financial position. In a 1977 letter to Mary Ann, the Bank cautioned Mary Ann that \u201ca trustee has a duty both to the income beneficiary and to the remaindermen of the trust. We must be impartial as between these two classes of beneficiaries.\u201d However, although the Bank recommended to Mary Ann at that time that investments be made in common stocks, it never did so, and its acknowledged duty of impartiality was not reflected in investment decisions made thereafter. In 1997, the trust officer wrote to Zona and Rose again asking them to agree to the trust\u2019s exclusive investments in bonds, and he later explained that he did so to prevent the Bank from incurring liability for not investing in stocks. The letter to Zona and Rose stated that Mary Ann \u201chas always been very adamant that the investment objective for the account be 100 percent bonds. Our auditors feel that we should have something in writing from the remaindermen agreeing to this investment objective.\u201d While Mary Ann did eventually indicate to her daughters that the Bank considered stocks to be in their best interests, the Bank itself never told Zona and Rose that investing exclusively in bonds was not in their best interest as remainder beneficiaries, and did nothing affirmatively to protect their financial position. In response to Mary Ann\u2019s instruction that \u201cthe trust was none of their business,\u201d Zona and Rose wrote letters back to the Bank consenting to the investment strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">\u00b612 In 1995, the Bank presented its Fourth Accounting of Trust B to the District Court for approval, encompassing a lengthy period of managing the trust assets from 1978 to 1995. Prior to the hearing, the Bank\u2019s attorney notified Zona and Rose that they could attend the hearing, but that their presence was not required. Zona and Rose were given no explanation about the nature of this proceeding or the implications of failing to attend. The Bank\u2019s Petition for Fourth Accounting requested the District Court to determine that all of the acts of the Bank in managing Trust B were \u201cvalid and proper\u201d and stated that \u201cthe facts and matters contained [in the petition] are true, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>accurate, and complete to the best of [the Bank\u2019s representative\u2019s] knowledge and belief.\u201d However, the Bank did not advise the District Court of the disadvantageous nature of its investment strategy for the remainder beneficiaries over this lengthy period. The District Court approved the Fourth Accounting on December 6, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\u00b613 Eventually, Zona and Rose came to realize that something was not right, and hired an attorney to meet with the Bank\u2019s trust officer and discuss the Bank\u2019s handling of the trust. At the meeting, it was pointed out that if 40 percent of the assets had been invested in the stock market during the trust\u2019s life, Trust B\u2019s assets would then have been worth approximately ten million dollars. Instead, the trust assets were worth three million dollars. Wells Fargo was removed as trustee in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u00b614 In February 2006, Zona and Rose filed a motion, pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 59, seeking a new trial on the District Court\u2019s approval of the Bank\u2019s Third Accounting of Trust B, which covered the trust period between 1974 and 1978, and the Bank\u2019s Fourth Accounting of Trust B, which covered the period between 1978 and 1995. The District Court conducted proceedings from April 10 to 14, 2006, concerning Zona\u2019s and Rose\u2019s allegations against the Bank, and on April 21,2006, issued a preliminary order granting Zona and Rose\u2019s motion for a new trial with respect to the Fourth Accounting only. The District Court indicated it was issuing a preliminary order to comply with the sixty-day deadline to rule on the Rule 59 motion, and indicated it would discuss its rationale in greater detail in a supplemental order to be issued later. However, the District Court provided a brief discussion of its reasoning \u201c[f]or purposes of satisfying Rule 59(f),\u201d concluding that \u00a7 25-11-102(6), MCA, provided adequate grounds for a new trial, and also noting that its order should not \u201cbe taken as an affirmative finding that other subsections of [\u00a7 25-11-102, MCA], may not also be applicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u00b615 The District Court eventually issued very detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law on July 13,2006. However, in an order entered on September 13,2006, this Court held the District Court was without jurisdiction to issue such findings because the present appeal had already been filed and thus, the July 13, 2006, order was void. <em>See </em>September 13,2006, Order Granting Appellees\u2019 Motion to Dismiss the Bank\u2019s second appeal, Cause No. 06-0375. As such, the only rationale validly before this Court is that which is set forth in the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Court\u2019s April 21, 2006, order, from which the Bank appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u00b616 1. Did the District Court err by granting a new trial pursuant to \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA, which specifies the grounds for a new jury trial, rather than \u00a7 25-11-103, MCA, which specifies the grounds for a new bench trial, and did its order fail to state the grounds for granting a new trial with sufficient particularity under Rule 59?</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u00b617 Anew trial maybe granted \u201cfor any of the reasons provided by the statutes of the State of Montana.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 59(a). The statutory basis cited by the District Court in granting a new trial on the Fourth Accounting was \u00a7 25-11-102(6), MCA. Section 25-11-102, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">The former verdict or other decision may be vacated and a new trial granted on the application of the party aggrieved for any of the following causes materially affecting the substantial rights of such party:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">(1) irregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury, or adverse party or any order of the court or abuse of discretion by which either party was prevented from having a fair trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">(2) misconduct of the jury....;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-10\">(3) accident or surprise which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-11\">(4) newly discovered evidence material for the party making the application which he could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced at the trial;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-12\">(5) excessive damages appearing to have been given under the influence of passion or prejudice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-13\">(6) insufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict or other decision or that it is against law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-14\">(7) error in law occurring at the trial and excepted to by the party making the application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-15\">When it based its decision on subsection (6), the District Court apparently failed to realize that only subsections (1), (3), and (4) of that statute provide a basis on which a new bench trial can be granted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Pursuant to \u00a7 25-11-103, MCA, \u201c[n]o new trial may be granted in cases tried by the court without a jury, except on the grounds mentioned in subsections (1), (3), and (4) of25-11-102.\u201d As such, the Bank argues the District Court\u2019s order granting a new trial violates \u00a7 25-11-103, MCA, and should be reversed. In response, Zona and Rose argue that the Bank failed to contest the application of \u00a7 25-11-102(6), MCA, at the District Court level and is barred from raising the issue for the first time on appeal, or alternatively, that this Court should affirm the District Court on the basis of subsections (1), (3), or (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\u00b618 Although the Bank is correct that the District Court erred by citing \u00a7 25-11-102(6), MCA, as a basis for a new trial here, we nonetheless agree with Zona and Rose\u2019s contention that sufficient grounds for a new trial also existed under subsection (4) of the statute. Indeed, the District Court expressly noted that a new trial could also be warranted under other subsections of the statute. The District Court observed that the Fourth Accounting \u201craises an issue as to compliance with the \u2018prudent man rule\u2019 which was not addressed in the Order [Approving the Fourth Accounting],\u201d noting that all of the trust assets were held in fixed income securities or cash for sixteen years. It further noted evidence that the trust officers themselves believed trust assets should have been invested in equities-information discovered after the original hearing. Further, it is apparent that the Bank engaged in misrepresentations and/or inadequate advisements to Zona and Rose about their rights and interests under the trust. For example, the Bank represented Trust B as existing for the benefit of Mary Ann, and led Zona and Rose to believe that any distribution they received under the trust was simply because Mary Ann had approved it. Zona and Rose were not informed of the rights held in their own stead. Moreover, the Bank\u2019s investment strategy did not reflect Zona\u2019s and Rose\u2019s financial interests, and the Bank did not discuss with them the consequences of investing only in bonds. The District Court was not provided with this information at the time of the Fourth Accounting. Likewise, it appears that Zona and Rose had not been apprised of their remainder interest in the trust at any time prior to that accounting, and were provided little, if any, information about the nature of the hearing on that accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u00b619 This newly discovered material evidence satisfied, at a minimum, \u00a7 25-11-102(4), MCA, and warranted a new trial. Although the District Court relied on the wrong subsection in support of its holding, it reached a proper result. \u201cWe will not reverse a district court when it reaches the right result, even if it reached that result for the wrong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>reason.\u201d <em>Wells Fargo Bank v. Talmage, </em>2007 MT 45, \u00b6 23, 336 Mont. 125, \u00b6 23, 152 P.3d 1275, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">\u00b620 The Bank also argues that we should reverse the District Court because its order failed to specify the grounds for granting a new trial with sufficient particularity. Rule 59(f) of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure requires that \u201c[a]ny order of the court granting a new trial, shall specify the grounds therefor with sufficient particularity as to apprise the parties and the appellate court of the rationale underlying the ruling ....\u201d According to the Bank, the Rule 59(f) requirement serves two purposes: to prevent this Court from having to second guess the District Court\u2019s reasoning, and to ensure that the District Court engages in disciplined reasoning when considering the claims before it. <em>See Shannon v. Hulett, </em>202 Mont. 205, 206-07, 656 P.2d 825, 826 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b621 We conclude that both purposes were served by the District Court\u2019s first order. The only reason a more detailed explanation is not part of the record is because the District Court incorrectly assumed that its subsequent findings of fact and conclusions of law, which were very detailed, would become a part of its original order. However, the court\u2019s rationale, set forth in its initial three-page order, was sufficient, even given the District Court\u2019s erroneous reliance on \u00a7 25-11-102(6), MCA, as the statutory basis for granting a new trial. The District Court expressed skepticism about the Bank\u2019s compliance with the \u201cprudent man rule\u201d and mentioned the fact that all of the trust assets were held in fixed income securities or cash for sixteen years. In addition, the District Court noted that \u201ctestimony and documents produced during the bifurcated trial held April 10 to 14,2006 indicate that trust officers themselves believed that a significant portion of the trust assets should have been invested in equity securities, that is, the trust assets should have been invested in a diversified portfolio.\u201d The court concluded that the Fourth Accounting raised questions about the Bank\u2019s actions \u201con its face.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u00b622  Although not as comprehensive as its supplemental findings of fact and conclusions of law which were later voided by this Court, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s rationale was sufficient to satisfy M. R. Civ. P. 59(f). The District Court explained its reasons for granting a new trial \u201cwith sufficient particularity as to apprise the parties and [this Court] of the rationale underlying the ruling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\u00b623 2. Are beneficiaries of a trust entitled to notice of entry of judgment, pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 77, and does a failure to provide such notice toll the time limit for filing post-judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>motions?</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u00b624 The Bank argues that Zona and Rose\u2019s motion for a new trial, made eleven years after the District Court\u2019s order, was untimely and, therefore, the District Court could not reopen the 1995 trust accounting. Rule 59(b) of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure requires that a motion for a new trial be filed within ten days of service of the notice of entry of judgment pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 77(d). However, Zona and Rose never received notice of the District Court\u2019s entry of the December 6, 1995 Order Approving the Fourth Accounting. According to the Bank, Zona and Rose were not entitled to receive notice of entry of the District Court\u2019s order because they did not \u201cappear\u201d at the hearing on the Fourth Accounting. M. R. Civ. P. 77(d) requires service of a notice of entry of judgment or order upon \u201call parties who have made an appearance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\u00b625 In response, Zona and Rose argue they were entitled to receive notice of the District Court\u2019s entry of the order because they were \u201cindispensable parties\u201d who had \u201cappeared, as a matter of law,\u201d and the Bank\u2019s failure to notify them of such entry tolled the ten-day period for filing their Rule 59 motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\u00b626 Although this Court has not previously addressed whether notice of entry of judgment must be made to trust beneficiaries after a formal trust proceeding, we have previously held that such notice must be given to devisees at the conclusion of formal probate proceedings. In <em>Matter of Estate of Holmes, </em>183 Mont. 290, 599 P.2d 344 (1979), the decedent\u2019s will devised all of his property to the Shriners Hospital and specifically stated that no provision be made for his immediate family. After Holmes\u2019 death, a hearing was set on the personal representative\u2019s petition to admit the will to probate, and notice of the hearing was sent to the Shriners. However, the Shriners did not attend the hearing, and were not served with notice of entry of the order entered by the court. That order declared two-thirds of the devise void under Montana\u2019s Mortmain Statute (now repealed) in response to objections from Holmes\u2019 son, who was left out of the will. The Shriners were notified of this voidance by a letter from Holmes\u2019 personal representative, and the Shriners appealed the matter to this Court, challenging the validity of the statute. <em>Estate of Holmes, </em>183 Mont. at 292, 599 P.2d at 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">\u00b627 On appeal, Holmes\u2019 son argued that the Shriners could not challenge the statute because they had not appeared before the District Court. In response, the Shriners argued they had not received proper notice of the challenge to the will, and thus had challenged the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>statute at the first opportunity they were afforded, which happened to be on appeal. We first observed that Shriners were entitled to notice of the Holmes\u2019 son\u2019s objection to the petition for probate because they were devisees entitled to such notice pursuant to the Montana Uniform Probate Code. Applicable to the present action, however, was our second observation, in which we held that a devisee is also a \u201cparty\u201d under M. R. Civ. P 77(d) and is entitled to notice of entry of judgment so long as they are not in default for failure to appear. <em>Estate of Holmes, </em>183 Mont. at 294-95, 599 P.2d at 346. We based this decision, in part, on the California Court of Appeals\u2019 holding that named beneficiaries in a testamentary trust are indispensable parties to litigation of that trust. <em>See Estate of Reed, </em>259 Cal. App. 2d 14, 21 (1968) (\u201cAs a beneficiary under the trust created under said will in his favor, he has the right, as a party beneficially interested, to appear and contest said account, or to participate in any other proceeding affecting the property of said estate ....\u201d) (citation omitted). Thus, we held that, pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 77(d), \u201cnamed devisees in wills who are not in default for failure to appear are entitled to notice of the entry of an order in formal probate proceedings.\u201d <em>Estate of Holmes, </em>183 Mont. at 294, 599 P.2d at 346. We also held that \u201c[t]his rule applies regardless of actual notice of the entry of the order by the party seeking to appeal the order\u201d and that, because no notice of entry of judgment had been served, \u201cthe time for appealing ... has not yet begun to run.\u201d <em>Estate of Holmes, </em>183 Mont. at 295, 599 P.2d at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u00b628 Similarly, in <em>Estate of Spencer, </em>2002 MT 304, \u00b6 16, 313 Mont. 40, \u00b6 16, 59 P.3d 1160, \u00b6 16, we addressed the issue of whether a bank, which had filed a creditor\u2019s claim against an estate during informal probate, was entitled to notice of hearing when formal proceedings were later initiated for adjudication of heirs and settlement of the estate, and whether it was entitled to notice of entry of the subsequent district court order under M. R. Civ. P. 77. We concluded that the bank was an \u201cinterested person\u201d as defined by the probate code and thus entitled to notice of both. <em>Estate of Spencer, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16, 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u00b629  Here, the beneficiaries were entitled to notice of the trust proceeding, specifically the hearing on the Fourth Accounting, pursuant to \u00a7 72-35-306, MCA (1995). Their interest was certainly not lesser than the interest of the devisee in <em>Holmes </em>and the creditor in <em>Spencer, </em>and just as the parties in those cases were entitled to notice of the entry of orders in formal probate proceedings, Zona and Rose, as named beneficiaries of the trust, are likewise indispensable \u201cparties\u201d who must be served with notice of entry of a judgment or order in trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>proceedings. Of course, the ultimate appealability of trust orders may depend on the resolution of such issues as statute of limitations and laches, as we discuss herein under Issue 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b630 The Bank argues that our holding in <em>Holmes, </em>and our subsequent holding in <em>Spencer, </em>which cited <em>Holmes, </em>is inapplicable because in <em>Holmes </em>we applied a different version of Rule 77(d). The preamendment version of Rule 77(d) provided that notice of entry was to be served \u201cupon each party who is not in default for failure to appear.\u201d The version of Rule 77(d) applicable to the present action requires service of the notice \u201cupon all parties who have made an appearance.\u201d The Bank contends the new rule removed the requirement that notice be given to a party who has not appeared and is not yet in default, such as Zona and Rose, and requires notice only to parties who have appeared, which it contends Zona and Rose did not do. However, we clearly held in <em>Holmes </em>that devisees, and now we now hold the same for trust beneficiaries, are indispensable parties to their respective formal statutory proceedings who must receive notice of the proceedings and notice of entry of the order. In essence, these indispensable parties are considered to have \u201cappeared\u201d as a matter of law. In 1999, subsequent to the proceeding at issue here, the Legislature amended \u00a7 72-34-306, MCA, to require notices of hearing in trust proceedings to state that \u201cfailure to appear and object bars any further claims against the trustee[,]\u201d thereby addressing a default mechanism within the trust statutes which did not exist at the time of the hearing herein. <em>See </em>1999 Mont. Laws 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b631  Because no notice of entry of order was served upon Zona and Rose, the ten-day limit for filing their Rule 59 motion for a new trial had not expired when their motion was filed with the District Court, and was not untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u00b632 3. Did the District Court err by failing to apply the three-year statute of limitations applicable to trust proceedings under \u00a7 72-34-511, MCA, or alternatively, by failing to apply the doctrine of laches?</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\u00b633 The Bank argues that \u00a7 72-34-511, MCA, bars Zona and Rose from reopening the Fourth Accounting, for the purpose of alleging breach of trust, because the accounting adequately disclosed the existence of their claim and more than three years have since passed. Section 72-4-511(1), MCA, provides in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">[i]f a beneficiary has received an interim or final account in writing ... that adequately discloses the existence of a claim against the trustee for breach of trust, the claim is barred as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>that beneficiary unless a proceeding to assert the claim is commenced within 3 years after receipt of the account or report. An account or report adequately discloses the existence of a claim if it provides sufficient information so that the beneficiary knows of the claim or reasonably should have inquired into the existence of the claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">According to the Bank, the three-year period of limitation began to run when Zona and Rose received the Fourth Accounting from the Bank, which stated that Trust B was invested in 98.1 percent bonds and notes, and the rest in cash. Alternatively, the Bank argues that the doctrine of laches barred reopening the Fourth Accounting due to Zona and Rose\u2019s unjustified delay, and that allowing them to assert that right at this time would be inequitable to the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u00b634 In response, Zona and Rose argue that the rules governing post-hearing motions are governed by M. R. Civ. P. 52, 59 and 60, and the statute of limitations does not apply to those. Instead, Zona and Rose contend, the doctrine of \u201cextrinsic fraud\u201d applies here, which has been used in other states to set aside years of fraudulent court accountings without reference to a statute of limitations. More specifically, Zona and Rose argue the Bank fraudulently failed to disclose the existence of Zona and Rose\u2019s claim for breach of trust. With respect to the Bank\u2019s laches argument, Zona and Rose argue that the Bank made no showing of prejudice or inequity, as we required in <em>Cole v. State ex rel. Brown, </em>2002 MT 32, \u00b6 25, 308 Mont. 265, \u00b6 25, 42 P.3d 760, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\u00b635 The statute of limitations and laches arguments both require resolution of contested factual issues which this Court cannot address. Findings of fact with respect to factual issues underlying the statute of limitations and laches defenses are absent from the record, because the District Court\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law and supplemental order addressing these issues were voided by this Court and because these issues were not addressed in the District Court\u2019s first order. Consequently, this Court must decline to address these issues and allow them to be addressed on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">\u00b636 4. Did the District Court\u2019s granting of a new trial violate \u00a7 72-35-206, MCA, which provides that final trust orders are \u201cconclusive on all persons\u201d and therefore preempts motions under M. R. Civ. P. 52?</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">\u00b637 The Bank argues that the District Court erred in granting a new trial because the order approving the Fourth Accounting was \u201cconclusive on all persons\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 72-35-206(2), MCA, and thus could not be reopened by the District Court on Zona and Rose\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>for a new trial. Section 72-35-206(2), MCA, provides that \u201c[i]f it appears to the satisfaction of the court that notice [of formal trust proceedings] has been regularly given or that the party entitled to notice has waived, the court shall so find in its order. When the order becomes final, it is conclusive on all persons, whether or not in being.\u201d The basis for the Bank\u2019s argument rests on its assumption that the District Court\u2019s order approving the Fourth Accounting \u201cbecame final,\u201d and thus was \u201cconclusive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u00b638  However, an order becomes final only when the time to appeal has expired. <em>In re Marriage of Nordberg, </em>265 Mont. 352, 356, 877 P.2d 987, 990 (1994). We held under Issue 2 herein that the time to appeal from the Fourth Accounting had not expired at the time Zona and Rose moved for a new trial. Because the time to appeal had not expired when Zona and Rose moved for a new trial, the District Court\u2019s order had not \u201cbecome final,\u201d and had not yet become \u201cconclusive on all parties.\u201d Thus, the accounting was subject to a post-judgment motion. \u00b639 The Bank offers an argument that the Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply to trust proceedings, citing Rule 81(a)\u2019s instruction that statutory proceedings are excepted from application of the rules \u201cinsofar as they are inconsistent or in conflict with the procedure and practice provided by these rules,\u201d and to our holding in <em>Spencer </em>that the rules \u201cd[o] not interject [themselves] into other statutory schemes which provide different procedural requirements.\u201d <em>Spencer, </em>\u00b6 13. The Bank argues therefrom that applying Rules 52 and 59 would be inconsistent or in conflict with the conclusiveness provision within \u00a7 72-35-206(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u00b640 However, <em>Spencer\u2019s </em>rejection of the application of the Rules of Civil Procedure was in regard to an informal probate proceeding, which is conducted by the clerk of court. <em>Spencer </em>clearly applied the rules to analogous formal probate proceedings. <em>Spencer, </em>\u00b6 16. Here, Rules 52 and 59 supply an appropriate mechanism for filing a motion after entry of a trust order requesting a new hearing or trial. Though \u00a7 72-35-206(2), MCA, deems a trust order \u201cconclusive on all persons, whether or not in being,\u201d that occurs only \u201c[w]hen the order becomes final.\u201d As discussed above, to become \u201cfinal,\u201d a trust order must be subjected to post-hearing proceedings, including appeal to this Court and appropriate motions to the district court for a new hearing or trial.</p>\n<p id=\"AkC\">\u00b641 5. Did the District Court err by enforcing the \u201cprudent man rule\u201d for a period of time during which no such rule existed under the Montana Code?</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\u00b642 The Bank\u2019s final allegation of error is that the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>improperly applied the \u201cprudent man\u201d investment rule despite the fact that the Legislature did not pass a statutory \u201cprudent man rule\u201d until 1974, which was after the trust assets had been placed with the Bank. However, as Zona and Rose point out, the District Court stated that it had not \u201cdetermine [d] whether the \u2018prudent man rule\u2019 was actually breached by the investment stategy of the Bank.\u201d Notably, the District Court held that further proceedings were required to make such a determination. Without a factual record and conclusions of law before this Court concerning the Bank\u2019s alleged breach of the \u201cprudent man rule,\u201d we cannot address that issue and remand it for farther proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u00b643 Although a district court\u2019s decision whether to grant a new trial is normally subject to review under an abuse of discretion standard, <em>Jenks v. Bertelson, </em>2004 MT 50, \u00b6 12, 320 Mont. 139, \u00b6 12, 86 P.3d 24, \u00b6 12, the issues raised here require us to determine whether the District Court\u2019s actions were lawful under the statutes, not whether discretion was appropriately exercised. We hold that the District Court\u2019s actions were lawful, and affirm on Issues one, two and four. Issues three and five are reserved for the District Court\u2019s determination on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\u00b644 Affirmed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b273-7\">JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-16\"> The unique procedural posture of this case requires that we draw the necessary facts from the record, rather than from the District Court\u2019s order.
