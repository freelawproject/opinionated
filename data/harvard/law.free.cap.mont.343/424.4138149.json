She also appeals the District Court\u2019s failure to continue the trial and the court\u2019s admission of certain evidence concerning McCormack\u2019s medical expenses. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it prevented Andres from cross-examining McCormack and her medical providers about McCormack\u2019s previous injuries and impairment ratings?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">\u00b64 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it prevented Andres from soliciting statements made by McCormack\u2019s orthopedic physician concerning McCormack\u2019s brain injury?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">\u00b65 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it did not continue the trial date?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">\u00b66 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by admitting into evidence McCormack\u2019s summary of medical expenses?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b445-15\">\u00b67 Andres\u2019s Ford F-350 pickup collided with McCormack\u2019s Chevrolet Corsica on the stretch of Interstate 90 (1-90) that lies between Belgrade and Bozeman. McCormack had slowed her vehicle to approximately 55 miles per hour as she passed a vehicle fire on the shoulder of 1-90. Andres\u2019s pickup struck McCormack\u2019s vehicle while traveling at approximately 75 miles per hour. Andres\u2019s pickup crushed the back end of McCormack\u2019s car and completely eliminated the rear passenger compartment. Andres admitted that her negligence caused the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>collision. McCormack sustained injuries to her brain, neck, and back as a result of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">\u00b68 Andres deposed McCormack in December of 2005. McCormack revealed that in 1993 she had sustained a whiplash injury in a car accident. McCormack said that she had applied for Social Security disability compensation following the 1993 car accident. McCormack also informed Andres that she had injured her neck and upper back while lifting a computer at work in 1996. McCormack had filed a worker\u2019s compensation claim for the 1996 work injury. McCormack further revealed that she had sustained head, neck, and back injuries in a car accident in 1999. Andres requested the medical records, attorney\u2019s files, and settlement documents related to McCormack\u2019s prior incidents in January of 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u00b69 The District Court ordered the parties to complete discovery by September 1, 2006. Andres deposed Dr. Sherry Reid, a neurologist treating McCormack, in January of 2006. Andres deposed McCormack\u2019s orthopedic physician, Dr. John Vallin, in May of 2006. Dr. Vallin made several statements concerning McCormack\u2019s brain injury in response to questions posed by Andres\u2019s counsel. McCormack\u2019s counsel later asked if Dr. Vallin had treated McCormack \u201cfor her back pain and not her head injury; is that correct?\u201d Dr. Vallin responded, \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u00b610 Andres deposed Dr. Jeff Cory, a neuropsychologist treating McCormack, in July of 2006. Dr. Cory testified that he had discussed with McCormack her 1993 car accident in assessing her current brain injury. He stated that the 1993 incident did not affect his diagnosis. Andres\u2019s counsel asked Dr. Cory whether McCormack had informed him of her involvement in the 1999 car accident. Dr. Cory responded that McCormack had not told him of the accident. Andres\u2019s counsel then asked if that would \u201chave been a significant history for you to consider ...?\u201d Dr. Cory responded \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">\u00b611 McCormack provided the medical records relating to her 1999 car accident in March of 2006. McCormack provided records pertaining to her 1993 car accident, her application and denial for Social Security disability compensation, and her 1996 work injury on August 31, 2006-one day before the close of discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">\u00b612 The documents provided by McCormack on the last day of discovery included a medical report issued by Dr. Bruce Johnson (the Johnson Report) concerning her 1996 work injury. The Johnson Report concluded that McCormack had suffered a permanent neurologic impairment of 30% of her normal total function. The Johnson Report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>also stated that McCormack had suffered a permanent psychiatric impairment of 22.5% of her normal total function.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">\u00b613 McCormack filed a motion in limine to preclude Andres from presenting at trial certain statements regarding her brain injury, as well as evidence relating to her 1993 car accident and 1996 work injury. The District Court responded with an order prohibiting Andres from soliciting testimony from McCormack\u2019s orthopedic physician regarding McCormack\u2019s brain injury. The District Court\u2019s order also precluded Andres from introducing evidence relating to McCormack\u2019s 1993 car accident, her corresponding Social Security disability claim, and her 1996 work injury and corresponding worker\u2019s compensation claim. Andres filed a motion for reconsideration of the court\u2019s order granting McCormack\u2019s motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\u00b6 14 The District Court held a hearing approximately two weeks before trial on Andres\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Andres asserted at the hearing that she did not receive the Johnson Report until after she had deposed Dr. Cory and Dr. Reid. The court asked Andres\u2019s counsel how he would hope to proceed in light of these circumstances. Andres\u2019s counsel said that he \u201cwould be glad if the Court were to vacate trial and I would be glad to travel....\u201d The court stated \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to vacate the trial. Can you fit it in?\u201d Andres\u2019s counsel then asserted that he would have tried to depose Dr. Johnson if he had received the Johnson Report with more time. He stated, \u201cBut with the close of discovery the day after, and probably the day I received [the Johnson Report], my hands were tied as far as that. So I said, fine, I will live with that. I\u2019ll just cross-examine Dr. Cory, Dr. Reid, or any of the other experts saying, how would this-would this affect your opinion ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">\u00b615 Andres also argued at the hearing on the motion for reconsideration that the District Court should allow her to question Margot Hart (Hart), McCormack\u2019s vocational expert, about statements made by McCormack\u2019s orthopedic physician, Dr. Vallin, regarding McCormack\u2019s brain injury. Hart had conducted a rehabilitation assessment and had made a life care plan for McCormack. Hart filed an addendum to the assessment after Andres had taken Hart\u2019s deposition. The addendum referenced Dr. Vallin and included statements that he had made concerning McCormack\u2019s brain injury. \u00b616 The District Court agreed at the hearing on the motion for reconsideration to reopen discovery for the limited purpose of determining whether the Johnson Report would have had any effect on the diagnoses or opinions of Dr. Cory or Dr. Reid. The District Court also agreed that Andres could cross-examine Hart about McCormack\u2019s brain injury if Hart \u201copens the door to either [Dr. Vallin\u2019s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>correspondence or any opinion that she may have attributed to [Dr. Vallin] in regard to the brain injury ...\u201d during direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"AaOH\">\u00b617 Andres deposed Dr. Cory a second time after the hearing on the motion for reconsideration. Andres\u2019s counsel asked Dr. Cory if the permanent impairment ratings from the Johnson Report indicated that McCormack\u2019s symptoms from the 1996 injury \u201cwould continue being an impairment for the rest of Ms. McCormack\u2019s life...?\u201d Dr. Cory stated that he \u201cwould disagree with that... [and] if you read the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders No. IV, you won\u2019t find ... that either of these disorders are lifelong or permanent by nature ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AHN\">\u00b618 Andres also deposed Dr. Reid a second time after the hearing on the motion for reconsideration. Andres\u2019s counsel confirmed that McCormack previously had failed to inform Dr. Reid of having suffered the symptoms listed in the Johnson Report at any time before the most recent accident. Andres\u2019s counsel asked Dr. Reid if such a history \u201cis important for you not only for treatment but in formulating an opinion or diagnosis [as to] what was causing those symptoms?\u201d Dr. Reid responded that \u201cIt would be important to know that.\u201d McCormack\u2019s counsel asked Dr. Reid if there is \u201canything in [the Johnson Report] that would change any of your opinions ...?\u201d Dr. Reid responded \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ABj\">\u00b619 The District Court issued an order the day before trial denying Andres\u2019s motion for reconsideration. The court also granted a motion filed one day earlier by McCormack to preclude evidence at trial regarding the 1999 car accident. The case proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">\u00b620 McCormack testified at trial. McCormack identified a one-page document as a summary of all of her medical expenses up to the date of trial related to the recent car accident. Andres objected. Andres asserted that McCormack could not testify to the necessity and reasonableness of the expenses. Andres argued that McCormack\u2019s medical providers had to establish the necessary foundation for admitting the summary. The court overruled the objection and admitted the summary into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">\u00b621 The jury awarded McCormack $361,684 in compensatory damages. Andres appeals the District Court\u2019s orders granting McCormack\u2019s motions in limine. Andres also appeals the District Court\u2019s failure to continue the date of trial and the court\u2019s admission of the medical expense summary.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">\u00b622  District courts possess broad discretion when determining the admissibility of evidence. <em>Seltzer v. Morton, </em>2007 MT 62, \u00b6 65, 336 Mont. 225, \u00b6 65, 154 P.3d 561, \u00b6 65. A court may exclude relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>evidence if the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, needless presentation of cumulative evidence, waste of time, undue delay, or misleading of the jury substantially outweighs the evidence\u2019s probative value. <em>Henricksen v. State, </em>2004 MT 20, \u00b6 64, 319 Mont. 307, \u00b6 64, 84 P.3d 38, \u00b6 64. We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>Seltzer, </em>\u00b6 65. A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or so exceeds the bounds of reason as to work a substantial injustice. <em>Peterson v. Doctors\u2019 Co., </em>2007 MT 264, \u00b6 31, 339 Mont. 354, \u00b6 31, 170 P.3d 459, \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">\u00b623 We review a district court\u2019s decision to continue a trial for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Ibarra-Salas, </em>2007 MT 173, \u00b6 13, 338 Mont. 191, \u00b6 13, 164 P.3d 898, \u00b6 13. We will not overturn a court\u2019s decision to deny a motion for a continuance absent a showing of both an abuse of discretion and prejudice to the complaining party. <em>IbarraSalas, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">DISCUSSION ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\u00b624 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it prevented Andres from cross-examining McCormack and her medical providers about McCormack\u2019s previous injuries and impairment ratings ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\u00b625 Andres asserts that the District Court should have allowed her to cross-examine McCormack and her medical providers about the injuries that McCormack previously had suffered from the car accidents in 1993 and 1999 and the work related incident in 1996. Andres also faults the District Court for precluding evidence that McCormack had submitted a claim for Social Security disability benefits as a result of the 1993 car accident. Andres argues that the jury would have apportioned the damages for the injuries stemming from this accident after learning of McCormack\u2019s previous injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"AEx\">\u00b626  A defendant must establish a \u201cmore probable than not causal link ...\u201d before a court will allow it to present alternate causation evidence. <em>Henricksen, </em>\u00b6 70. The party seeking to introduce alternate causation evidence must demonstrate a causal connection between the present symptoms complained of and a prior accident. <em>Henricksen, </em>\u00b6 70. Mere speculation constitutes an insufficient basis for admitting alternate causation evidence. <em>Henricksen, </em>\u00b6 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">\u00b627 The District Court determined that Andres had failed to present any evidence connecting McCormack\u2019s present injuries and the 1993 car wreck and the related Social Security claim. The court cited Dr. Cory\u2019s statements that the 1993 accident did not affect his diagnosis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>of McCormack\u2019s present injuries. The District Court also determined that Andres had failed to question McCormack or other pertinent witnesses as to the relevance of the Social Security claim that stemmed from the 1993 accident. The court determined that Andres had failed to affirmatively demonstrate a causal connection between these incidents and McCormack\u2019s present injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u00b628 The hearing on the motion for reconsideration revealed that Andres did not have access to the Johnson Report, which detailed McCormack\u2019s 1996 work incident injuries, until after Andres had deposed McCormack\u2019s medical providers. The District Court provided Andres with the opportunity to depose for a second time both Dr. Cory and Dr. Reid. Dr. Cory testified that the injuries listed in the Johnson Report were not permanent by nature. Dr. Reid specifically testified that nothing in the Johnson Report changed her opinions and diagnosis of McCormack\u2019s present injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\u00b629 The District Court noted that Andres likely had established the fact that McCormack\u2019s medical providers deemed important the Johnson Report. The District Court concluded that demonstrating the importance of the report, however, did not equate to a demonstration that a \u201cmore probable than not\u201d causal connection existed between the 1996 work incident and McCormack\u2019s present injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">\u00b630 Finally, the District Court determined that Andres had failed to establish a causal connection between McCormack\u2019s present injuries and the 1999 car accident. The District Court made a conscientious decision to exclude evidence of McCormack\u2019s previous accidents after providing to Andres the opportunity to establish a probable alternate cause of McCormack\u2019s claimed injuries. The court\u2019s decision to prohibit Andres from soliciting alternate causation evidence did not constitute an abuse of discretion under these circumstances. <em>Peterson, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">\u00b631 Andres also argues that the District Court should have allowed her to use evidence of the prior accidents on cross-examination to impeach McCormack. Andres cites the fact that McCormack initially did not disclose all of her past medical information to her doctors as a basis for attacking McCormack\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">\u00b632 The District Court determined in its initial order that Andres had failed to provide any evidence demonstrating dishonest conduct committed by McCormack. Andres did not raise the issue of McCormack\u2019s credibility in its motion to reconsider. Andres also failed to raise McCormack\u2019s credibility at the hearing on the motion to reconsider. Accordingly, the District Court did not address the issue of McCormack\u2019s credibility in its final order granting McCormack\u2019s motions. Andres abandoned her argument regarding McCormack\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>credibility before the District Court and we need not consider it on appeal. <em>See e.g. State v. Minez, </em>2004 MT 115, \u00b6 31, 321 Mont. 148, \u00b6 31, 89 P.3d 966, \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u00b633 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it prevented Andres from soliciting statements made by McCormack\u2019s orthopedic physician concerning McCormack\u2019s brain injury ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">\u00b634 Andres asserts that the District Court improperly precluded evidence concerning McCormack\u2019s brain injury. She argues that the District Court should have allowed her to explore statements made by McCormack\u2019s orthopedic doctor, Dr. Vallin, concerning the brain injury. Andres further asserts that the vocational expert, Hart, made assessments based in part on Dr. Vallin\u2019s statements about the brain injury. Andres argues that the District Court should have allowed her to cross-examine Hart about Dr. Vallin\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\u00b635 District courts possess broad discretion when determining the boundaries of admissible evidence. <em>Seltzer, </em>\u00b6 65. McCormack\u2019s counsel asked Dr. Vallin during his deposition if he had seen McCormack \u201cfor her back pain and not her head injury; is that correct?\u201d Dr. Vallin responded, \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d The District Court noted that Dr. Vallin \u201cdid not evaluate [McCormack] for treatment of any brain injuries ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A-_\">\u00b636 The District Court learned at the hearing on the motion for reconsideration that the vocational expert, Hart, had filed an addendum to her initial rehabilitation assessment. The court learned that the addendum referenced Dr. Vallin and statements that Dr. Vallin had made concerning McCormack\u2019s brain injury. The District Court acknowledged the potential relevance of the references in the addendum. The court gave permission to Andres to elicit these statements from Hart during cross-examining if Hart \u201copens the door to either [Dr. Vallin\u2019s] correspondence or any opinion that [Hart] may have attributed to [Dr. Vallin] in regard to the brain injury ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">\u00b637 McCormack affirmatively demonstrated that Dr. Vallin treated her only for back pain. McCormack established that Dr. Vallin made only incidental and secondary observations concerning her brain injury. The District Court, in light of the scope of treatment provided by Dr. Vallin, set forth reasoned restrictions concerning both direct and indirect evidence of the doctor\u2019s statements regarding McCormack\u2019s brain injury. The record reveals that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in granting McCormack\u2019s motions in limine with regard to Dr. Vallin\u2019s statements. <em>Peterson, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">\u00b638 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it did not continue the trial date?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u00b639 Andres argues that the District Court improperly refused to continue the trial date in light of McCormack\u2019s last-minute disclosures. Andres contends that McCormack\u2019s last-minute disclosures and the day-before-trial ruling by the court to preclude certain evidence prejudiced Andres\u2019s ability to prepare adequately for trial. McCormack asserts that the District Court properly maintained the original trial date in light of Andres\u2019 failure to make a formal motion for a continuance and her failure to provide an affidavit in support of a motion to continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b640 McCormack supplied evidence of her previous car accidents early in discovery. McCormack supplied the Johnson Report and other materials on the last day of discovery. The hearing on Andres\u2019s motion for reconsideration took place two weeks before trial began.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\u00b641 The court asked Andres\u2019s counsel at the hearing for his proposed course of action in light of the fact that Andres had received some discovery materials after she had deposed a number of McCormack\u2019s medical providers. Andres\u2019s counsel stated, \u201cI would be glad if the Court were to vacate trial and I would be glad to travel....\u201d The court responded \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to vacate the trial. Can you fit it in?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AyD\">\u00b642 Andres asserts that her counsel\u2019s statements constituted a motion for a continuance. Andres further contends that the court\u2019s response rendered futile a formal motion for a continuance. The exchange between Andres\u2019s counsel and the court fails to rise to the level of an affirmative motion. The statement \u201cI would be glad if the Court were to vacate trial...\u201d does not constitute a motion for a continuance. <em>See </em>M. R. Civ. P. 7(b)(1); <em>see also Luppold v. Lewis, </em>172 Mont. 280, 294-95, 563 P.2d 538, 546 (1977) (citing <em>State ex rel. McVay v. District Court, </em>126 Mont. 382, 393, 251 P.2d 840, 846 (1953) for the proposition that a motion must provide both notice to a party interested in opposing the motion and an opportunity to oppose intelligently the motion). The court\u2019s indication that it \u201c[did not] want to vacate the trial\u201d similarly does not demonstrate that the court held a predetermined position with regard to a formal motion for a continuance. We generally decline to consider on appeal arguments that the District Court did not have an opportunity to consider. <em>Prosser v. Kennedy </em>Enterprises, <em>Inc., </em>2008 MT 87, \u00b6 35, 342 Mont. 209, \u00b6 35, 179 P.3d 1178, \u00b6 35. Andres failed to provide the District Court with the opportunity to rule on a motion for a continuance. We decline to review a decision that the District Court did not make.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>ISSUE FOUR</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u00b643 <em>Did the District'Court abuse its discretion by admitting into evidence McCormack\u2019s summary of medical expenses ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u00b644 Andres faults the District Court for admitting into evidence McCormack\u2019s summary of medical expenses. Andres asserts that McCormack\u2019s medical providers had to lay the foundation for the admission of the one-page summary.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">\u00b645  We do not require a plaintiff to establish with certainty the causal connection between her accident and her injuries. <em>Moralli v. Lake County, </em>255 Mont. 23, 30, 839 P.2d 1287, 1291 (1992). We confirmed in <em>Moralli </em>that a plaintiff need not provide medical expert testimony where the nature of an injury allows a layperson to see plainly or infer the cause of the injury. <em>Moralli, </em>255 Mont. at 29, 839 P.2d at 1291 (citing <em>Cain v. Stevenson, </em>218 Mont. 101, 706 P.2d 128 (1985)). We determined in <em>Moralli </em>that a plaintiff suffering from injuries caused by a slip and fall in a public facility could testify competently to her past and present conditions. <em>Moralli, </em>255 Mont. at 30, 839 P.2d at 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">\u00b646  The one-page exhibit introduced by McCormack comprised a summary of the medical expenses that she had incurred as of the date of trial. McCormack testified that the summary reflected accurately her medical expenses stemming from the accident. Like the plaintiffs injuries in <em>Moralli, </em>the back and brain injuries that McCormack sustained comprised the type of injuries that a layperson could infer had occurred as a result of a car accident. McCormack could testify competently to these injuries. McCormack also could testify competently to the past expenses that she had incurred as a result of her injuries. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the one-page summary of medical expenses. <em>Peterson, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">\u00b647 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b453-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
