R. App. P. 44. The issue of law submitted by the Ninth Circuit for decision by this Court concerned whether \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, as amended, comports with five separate provisions of the 1972 Montana Constitution. We accepted the certified question of the Ninth Circuit on March 21, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-16\">\u00b62 The Ninth Circuit\u2019s request represents far from our first experience with this issue. The Honorable Richard F. Cebull, United States District Judge of the District of Montana, Billings Division, filed with this Court a similar certification order pursuant to M. R. App. P. 44 on November 21, 2002. Judge Cebull\u2019s order concerned the very same case at issue here. We accepted Judge Cebull\u2019s certified question on November 26, 2002. We set a briefing schedule and invited briefs amicus curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-17\">\u00b63 The parties and amicus curiae filed briefs and we heard oral argument on September 23, 2003. Two days later, on September 25, 2003, we determined that we improvidently had accepted the certification: \u201cSimply put, we do not have sufficient facts before us upon which we can render a precedential opinion on the substantial and significant constitutional questions posed.\u201d <em>Brady v. PPL </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number><em>Montana, LLC, </em>2003 MT 262, \u00b6 3, 317 Mont. 425, \u00b6 3, 77 P.3d 523, \u00b6 3. We were unwilling to interpret these constitutional issues in a vacuum. <em>Brady, </em>\u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">\u00b64 We likewise set a briefing schedule and invited briefs to be filed by amicus curiae following our acceptance of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s certified question. The parties and amicus curiae filed briefs and we heard oral argument on this matter on March 5, 2008. We remain constrained, pursuant to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s certification order and our acceptance of that certification order, by the paucity of facts upon which we can render a precedential opinion on the constitutional questions posed. In fact, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s order declares that \u201cthe facts in this case are immaterial\u201d to resolving the facial challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\u00b65 We remain unwilling to address these constitutional issues in a relative vacuum. We once again reluctantly reach the conclusion that we improvidently accepted the Ninth Circuit\u2019s certified question. We face a similar factual vacuum in which to evaluate the importance of substantial constitutional questions presented similar to the one that we did in <em>Brady.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">\u00b66 We regret the significant time, effort, and money spent on this matter by the parties, amicus curiae, and this Court. We deem it irresponsible, however, to start down the path of addressing constitutional questions of this nature in a relative factual vacuum.</p>\n<p id=\"AvH\">\u00b67 THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this matter is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\u00b68 The Clerk of this Court is instructed to mail a true copy of this Order to all counsel of record and to the Clerk of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">DATED this 20th day of May 2008.</p>\n<judges id=\"b426-9\">/S/BRIAN MORRIS</judges>\n<judges id=\"b426-10\">/S/JAMES C.

PPL Montana, LLC, </em>478 F.3d 1015 (9th Cir. 2007). While nothing more is required, I feel obligated to provide some explanation for my vote to the Court of Appeals, the Bradys, and counsel-particularly since this is the third time we are declining to answer a certifying court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>questions in this case. <em>See Brady, </em>478 F.3d at 1017 (noting that the United States District Court for the District of Montana has twice sought certification of the state constitutional issues raised in this case, but each time this Court declined to answer the question, citing a paucity of facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">\u00b610 My decision to join in dismissing this cause without prejudice to the merits is purely a pragmatic one. I entertain grave reservations about the constitutionality of \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, for various reasons, not the least of which is whether it can withstand scrutiny under Article II, Sections 16 and 17 of the Montana Constitution-respectively, Montana\u2019s fundamental guarantees of access to the courts and to due process of law. However, since those of us who would resolve these constitutional issues would do so in conflicting ways, I believe it is more prudent to decline to answer the questions than it would be to offer plurality opinions in the context of a facial challenge and thereby possibly foreclose a later as-applied challenge based on different facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u00b611 With that, and my apologies to the Court of Appeals, the Bradys, and counsel, I concur.</p>\n<judges id=\"b427-6\">JUSTICE COTTER joins in the Concurrence of JUSTICE NELSON.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b427-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"AbN\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">\u00b612 I dissent from the Court\u2019s unwillingness to answer the question which is again before us. We accepted the certified question from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on March 21, 2007. We knew then-as we had known previously-that the question involved facial challenges to \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, based on five separate provisions of the 1972 Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">\u00b613 Facial challenges, unlike as applied challenges, do not depend on the facts of a particular case. <em>See e.g. MEIC v. Dept. of Environmental Quality, </em>1999 MT 248, \u00b6 80, 296 Mont. 207, \u00b6 80, 988 P.2d 1236, \u00b6 80; <em>Associated Press, Inc. v. Department of Revenue, </em>2000 MT 160, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28, 300 Mont. 233, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28, 4 P.3d 5, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28; <em>Roosevelt v. Montana Dept. of Revenue, </em>1999 MT 30, \u00b6\u00b6 51-52, 293 Mont. 240, \u00b6\u00b6 51-52, 975 P.2d 295, \u00b6\u00b6 51-52. Having agreed to resolve the facial challenges presented, it is my view that we should do so without further delay.</p>\n<p id=\"AS3\">\u00b614 Had this case been commenced and remained in Montana\u2019s state courts, rather than going to the federal courts on diversity grounds, this Court would be facing the same five facial challenges to the statute. There can be no doubt that we would not-indeed, we could not, given the extent of our jurisdiction-simply refuse to determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>facial challenges. It is totally beyond my ken that this Court-after a delay of 14 months and a significant outpouring of resources-now decides yet again that it will not decide the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\u00b615 The incident at issue in this case occurred in the summer of2001. Nearly seven years later, it remains unresolved and goes back to the Ninth Circuit for yet more delay while that court resolves the question. The blame for much of the delay in this case falls squarely on this Court, and apologies cannot undo the damage. I concurred in our 2003 <em>Brady </em>decision to decline to resolve the question we had accepted which, as here, came after significant delay and cost to all concerned. I cannot in good conscience do so again.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\u00b616 Given the availability of diversity jurisdiction, one can only wonder how many questions of Montana constitutional law the federal courts will decide in the first instance after the Court\u2019s decision here. One can only wonder why this Court, so committed to Montana\u2019s constitution and the development of Montana constitutional law, today shies away from resolving facial challenges to a Montana statute under the 1972 Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\u00b617 I dissent from the Court\u2019s opinion. Regardless of what the appropriate legal resolution would be, I would resolve the certified question.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b428-7\">JUSTICE WARNER</author>\n<p id=\"A8v\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">\u00b618 I agree with the dissent of Chief Justice Gray. There is no need for a further record at this stage of the proceedings-it is sufficient to determine the question of whether \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, can withstand the facial constitutional challenges by plaintiff Brady.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">\u00b619 Article II, Section 16 of the Montana Constitution states that there is an exception to the right to full legal redress for an injury that is covered by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Laws. The legislature has provided the scope of such an exception in \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA. Brady makes facial challenges, not as applied challenges, to the statute and I would conclude that the statute passes constitutional muster. Therefore, I dissent from the decision of the Court not to answer the questions posed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b428-10\">JUSTICE RICE joins in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
