We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">\u00b62 On August 18, 1993, the State charged Whitlow, by Information, with one felony count of aggravated kidnapping, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-303, MCA, and one felony count of sexual intercourse without consent, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA. These charges stemmed from the July 8, 1993 kidnapping of a six-year-old girl in Pinesdale, Montana. Additional facts underlying these charges, but not pertinent to the instant appeal, are set out in <em>State v. Whitlow, </em>285 Mont 430, 949 P.2d 239 (1997) <em>(\u201cWhitlow </em>7\u201d). The matter proceeded to trial on January 24, 1994, lasting six days, and the jury found Whitlow guilty on both counts. The District Court sentenced Whitlow to forty years on the count of sexual intercourse without consent, ten years on the count of aggravated kidnapping, ten years under \u00a7 46-18-221, MCA, for the use of a weapon in the commission of an offense, and an additional sixty years on the aggravated kidnapping sentence after finding Whitlow to be a persistent felony offender. Whitlow filed a direct appeal to this Court raising several issues. We denied Whitlow\u2019s claims and affirmed his conviction in <em>Whitlow </em>7.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">\u00b63 Subsequently, Whitlow filed a petition for postconviction relief with the District Court on March 17, 1999. Whitlow asserted that his trial counsel, James G. Shockley, had failed during voir dire to determine whether two jurors, J.B. and E.F., were biased against Whitlow. Whitlow claimed that J.B. and E.F. demonstrated bias <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>against him based on answers they gave to the prosecutor\u2019s voir dire questions and that Shockley, therefore, should have asked them followup questions. Whitlow argued that Shockley rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to investigate this bias. In support of Whitlow\u2019s petition, Shockley provided an affidavit which stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-4\">3. I can recall no particular tactical reason for not questioning Jurors ... [J.B.], or [E.F.] about the matters referred to in Mr. Whitlow\u2019s Petition and cannot recall anyway that this failure was part of my trial strategy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-5\">4. I also do not recall exercising any particular tactical decision when I did not excuse any of these [two] jurors for cause or exercise peremptory challenges in order to excuse them from the trial jury. At the time I obviously thought that they were not biased, but after reading the draft of the Memorandum of the Petitioner it appears that I should have asked more questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">5.1 do remember tactical reasons for seating some jurors, but the aforementioned jurors are not among them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">\u00b64 The State filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that Whitlow\u2019s petition was barred under \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, as Whitlow could have raised his claims on direct appeal. The District Court granted the State\u2019s motion, and we reversed. <em>See State v. Whitlow, </em>2001 MT 208, 306 Mont. 339, 33 P.3d 877 <em>(\u201cWhitlow II). </em>We held that Whitlow\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim \u201ccould not have reasonably been raised on direct appeal because his allegations of ineffectiveness cannot be documented from the record in the underlying case.\u201d <em>Whitlow II, </em>\u00b6 22. We observed that \u201cin order to establish that his trial counsel\u2019s decision not to question or challenge prospective jurors was not the product of sound trial strategy, Whitlow would have to go beyond the trial record.\u201d <em>Whitlow II, </em>\u00b6 21. Accordingly, we remanded Whitlow\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">\u00b65 On May 9,2002, the District Court held an evidentiary hearing on Whitlow\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Shockley was the only witness called. The parties also introduced a number of exhibits at the hearing, including Shockley\u2019s voir dire notes, Shockley\u2019s billing records for the case, Shockley\u2019s affidavit in support of Whitlow\u2019s postconviction relief petition, and several letters from Shockley addressed to various persons discussing possible grounds for relief on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>direct appeal and in postconviction proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After receiving post-hearing briefing from both parties, the District Court issued its Opinion and Order on December 30,2004, denying Whitlow\u2019s petition for postconviction relief. The court concluded that Whitlow had failed to establish that Shockley\u2019s conduct during voir dire fell below an objective standard of reasonableness in regard to jurors J.B. and E.F. Accordingly, the court denied his petition. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">\u00b66 Further facts are set forth below where relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\u00b67 The issues on appeal are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">1. Did Shockley render ineffective assistance of counsel during jury selection by failing to ask follow-up questions of J.B. and E.F.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-8\">2. Does an error by defense counsel during jury selection concerning the impartiality of a juror constitute structural error?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">\u00b68 Because we conclude that Issue 1 is dispositive, we do not address Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">\u00b69 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a postconviction relief petition to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Hartinger v. State, </em>2007 MT 141, \u00b6 19, 337 Mont. 432, \u00b6 19, 162 P.3d 95, \u00b6 19. Ineffective assistance of counsel claims, however, constitute mixed questions of law and fact for which our review is de novo. <em>State v. Racz, </em>2007 MT 244, \u00b6 13, 339 Mont. 218, \u00b6 13, 168 P.3d 685, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b113-13\">\u00b610 The right to counsel in criminal prosecutions is guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and by Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. In order to analyze ineffective assistance of counsel claims, we have adopted the two-part test articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-14\">First, the defendant must show that counsel's performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064. In short, a defendant must prove (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Racz, </em>\u00b6 22. \u00b611 A defendant must satisfy both prongs of this test in order to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>Adams v. State, </em>2007 MT <em>35, </em>\u00b6 <em>22, 336 </em>Mont. 63, \u00b6 22, 153 P.3d 601, \u00b6 22. Thus, if an insufficient showing is made regarding one prong of the test, there is no need to address the other prong. <em>Adams, </em>\u00b6 22; <em>see also Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S. Ct. at 2069 (\u201c[T]here is no reason for a court deciding an ineffective assistance claim to approach the inquiry in the same order or even to address both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.\u201d). In the case at hand, we conclude that Whitlow has made an insufficient showing on the first prong (the performance inquiry); thus, that prong is dispositive and renders an inquiry into the question of prejudice unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\u00b612 Before addressing the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments, it is necessary, as a preliminary matter, to clarify the proper standard for evaluating defense counsel\u2019s performance. Whitlow suggests that we must determine whether defense counsel acted out of ignorance or neglect. <em>See e.g. State v. Hendricks, </em>2003 MT 223, \u00b6 7, 317 Mont. 177, \u00b6 7, 75 P.3d 1268, \u00b6 7 (\u201cIn order to constitute ineffective assistance, counsel's conduct must flow from ignorance or neglect rather than from strategic decisions and trial tactics.\u201d); <em>see also Bone v. State, </em>284 Mont. 293, 303, 944 P.2d 734, 740 (1997) (\u201cNon-strategic decisions ... that stem from neglect or ignorance, are accorded no deference.\u201d) (alteration, citation, and internal quotation marks omitted)). The State, on the other hand, suggests that we must determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was objectively reasonable. <em>See e.g. State v. St. Germain, </em>2007 MT 28, \u00b6 33, 336 Mont. 17, \u00b6 33, 153 P.3d 591, \u00b6 33 (\u201cThe defendant bears the burden to show that his counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d). The District Court applied this latter standard. For the reasons which follow, we agree with the State that the proper measure of counsel's performance is objective reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>\u00b613 We first articulated the \u201cignorance or neglect\u201d test in <em>State v. Morigeau, </em>202 Mont. 36, 656 P.2d 185 (1982), stating that \u201c[t]o sustain a claim of ineffective assistance, a criminal defendant must show that the error allegedly committed by his lawyer resulted in prejudice to him and stemmed from neglect or ignorance rather than from informed, professional deliberation.\u201d <em>Morigeau, </em>202 Mont. at 44, 656 P.2d at 189 (italics omitted) (citing <em>United States v. Bosch, </em>584 F.2d 1113, 1121 (1st Cir. 1978), in turn citing <em>Marzullo v. Maryland, </em>561 F.2d 540, 544 (4th Cir. 1977)); <em>accord State v. Hall, </em>203 Mont. 528, 539, 662 P.2d 1306, 1311 (1983); <em>State v. Henricks, </em>206 Mont. 469, 476, 672 P.2d 20, 24-25 (1983). However, about a year and a half after we decided Morigeau, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Strickland, </em>wherein the Court articulated a reasonableness approach. Soon thereafter, we adopted <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>two-part test. <em>See State v. Boyer, </em>215 Mont. 143, 147, 695 P.2d 829, 831 (1985); <em>State v. Grant, </em>217 Mont. 357, 360, 704 P.2d 1064, 1065-66 (1985). Yet, in so doing, we did not address the continued vitality of the \u201cignorance or neglect\u201d test previously articulated in <em>Morigeau. </em>As a result, this test has been repeated in a number of subsequent cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">\u00b614 In explaining the first prong of the two-part test adopted in <em>Strickland </em>\u2014 namely, whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient-the Supreme Court stated that \u201c[w]hen a convicted defendant complains of the ineffectiveness of counsel\u2019s assistance, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687-88, 104 S. Ct. at 2064. In other words, \u201c[t]he proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S. Ct. at 2065. The Supreme Court stated that \u201c[m]ore specific guidelines are not appropriate\u201d and that there is no \u201cchecklist\u201d for judicial evaluation of attorney performance. Rather, in any case presenting an ineffectiveness claim, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>performance inquiry must be \u201cwhether counsel\u2019s assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S. Ct. at 2064, 2065.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">\u00b615 Furthermore, the Supreme Court cautioned that in scrutinizing counsel\u2019s performance, every effort must be made \u201cto eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel's perspective at the time.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065. The reviewing court \u201cmust indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,\u201d and the defendant \u201cmust overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">\u00b616 Summarizing the pertinent inquiry under the first prong, the Supreme Court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-6\">[A] court deciding an actual ineffectiveness claim must judge the reasonableness of counsel's challenged conduct on the facts of the particular case, viewed as of the time of counsel\u2019s conduct. A convicted defendant making a claim of ineffective assistance must identify the acts or omissions of counsel that are alleged not to have been the result of reasonable professional judgment. <em>The court must then determine whether, in light of all the circumstances, the identified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance. </em>In making that determination, the court should keep in mind that counsel\u2019s function, as elaborated in prevailing professional norms, is to make the adversarial testing process work in the particular case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFl\"><em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2066 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">\u00b617 The \u201cignorance or neglect\u201d test is not consistent with this objectively-reasonable-under-the-circumstances inquiry. The Supreme Court indicated that the pertinent distinction is between reasonable and unreasonable professional judgment or, stated differently, between conduct which falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance and conduct which falls outside that range. The \u201cignorance or neglect\u201d test, however, contemplates a compartmentalization of counsel\u2019s challenged acts and omissions as either strategic decisions/trial tactics on one hand or ignorance/neglect on the other. Such categorizing does not facilitate a meaningful evaluation of conduct that lies somewhere between \u201cstrategic/tactical\u201d and \u201cignorant/neglectful.\u201d Moreover, this approach affords little insight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>into whether counsel\u2019s conduct was \u201creasonable\u201d under then-existing circumstances and prevailing professional norms. Indeed, the premise underlying the \u201cignorance or neglect\u201d test-namely, that categorizing counsel\u2019s conduct as either strategic/tactical or ignorant/neglectful determines whether the defendant received constitutionally effective representation-is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">\u00b618 In this regard, it is noteworthy that the court in <em>Marzullo </em>(from which our \u201cignorance or neglect\u201d test derives<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>) acknowledged that \u201c[s]ometimes, the denial of effective assistance of counsel does not result from neglect, ignorance, or any other fault of defense counsel. For example, a trial court may deprive an accused of effective representation by making a tardy appointment of counsel.\u201d <em>Marzullo, </em>561 F.2d at 544 n. 8. Furthermore, the fact that counsel\u2019s challenged conduct may be categorized as \u201cstrategic\u201d or \u201ctactical\u201d does not necessarily mean that the conduct was objectively reasonable. For example, the Supreme Court observed in <em>Strickland </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-5\">strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable <em>precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation. </em>In other words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-6\"><em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690-91, 104 S. Ct. at 2066 (emphasis added). It is possible, therefore, for a strategic choice to be unreasonable-e.g., because it was made after less than complete investigation, and prevailing professional norms would have required further investigation. <em>See also e.g. Lawhorn v. Allen, </em>519 F.3d 1272, 1295, (11th Cir. 2008) (\u201cTactical or strategic decisions based on a misunderstanding of the law are unreasonable.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Along these same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>lines, the fact that counsel\u2019s challenged conduct was based on incomplete information does not mean that the conduct was per se unreasonable. <em>Cf. Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S. Ct. at 2066 (\u201c[W]hen a defendant has given counsel reason to believe that pursuing certain investigations would be fruitless or even harmful, counsel\u2019s failure to pursue those investigations may not later be challenged as unreasonable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">\u00b619 The point is that rigid categorization of counsel\u2019s performance as strategic/tactical or ignorant/neglectful is not an adequate measure of that performance. The question is not merely whether counsel\u2019s conduct flowed from strategic decisions and trial tactics but, rather, whether it was based on \u201creasonable\u201d or \u201csound\u201d professional judgment. <em>See e.g. Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 505, 123 S. Ct. 1690, 1694 (2003); <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065; <em>see also Jones v. Wood, </em>114 F.3d 1002, 1010 (9th Cir. 1997) (\u201cEven if [counsel\u2019s] decision could be considered one of strategy, that does not render it immune from attack-it must be a <em>reasonable </em>strategy.\u201d); <em>State v. Harris, </em>2001 MT 231, \u00b6 22, 306 Mont. 525, \u00b6 22, 36 P.3d 372, \u00b6 22 (\u201cWhen a tactical or strategic reason for defense counsel\u2019s alleged deficient performance is apparent in the record on appeal or proffered by counsel in post-conviction proceedings, the court must evaluate whether this underlying reason is \u2018reasonable\u2019 .. ..\u201d). The \u201cignorance or neglect\u201d test does not facilitate such analysis, as it is detached from the relevant benchmark by which counsel\u2019s conduct must be judged (prevailing professional norms) and the necessity of evaluating the reasonableness of that conduct in light of the surrounding circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u00b620  For these reasons, we conclude that the reasonableness standard articulated in <em>Strickland </em>is the superior and correct approach for evaluating counsel\u2019s performance, and we reaffirm our cases which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>recognize that approach.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See e.g. State v. St. Germain, </em>2007 MT <em>28, </em>\u00b6 33, 336 Mont. 17, \u00b6 33, 153 P.3d 591, \u00b6 33; <em>State v. Meza, </em>2006 MT 210, \u00b6 27, 333 Mont. 305, \u00b6 27, 143 P.3d 422, \u00b6 27; <em>State v. Jefferson, </em>2003 MT 90, \u00b6\u00b6 43, 48, 315 Mont. 146, \u00b6\u00b6 43, 48, 69 P.3d 641, \u00b6\u00b6 43, 48; <em>State v. Hanson, </em>283 Mont. 316, 327, 940 P.2d 1166, 1173-74 (1997); <em>State v. Denny, </em>262 Mont. 248, 252-53, 865 P.2d 226, 228-29 (1993). The pertinent inquiry, therefore, is not simply whether counsel\u2019s conduct flowed from ignorance or neglect-though this is certainly a relevant consideration in the analysis, <em>see e.g. Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 395, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 1514 (2000) (observing that trial counsel's representation fell short of professional standards because counsel failed to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant\u2019s background, not because of any strategic calculation, but because counsel incorrectly thought that state law barred access to the relevant records). Rather, the question which must be answered is whether counsel\u2019s conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness measured under prevailing professional norms and in light of the surrounding circumstances. We overrule <em>Morigeau </em>and its progeny to the extent those cases hold that the measure of counsel\u2019s conduct is whether it stemmed from ignorance or neglect. <em>See </em>\u00b6 13 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">\u00b621 In addition, we emphasize the point made in <em>Strickland </em>and noted in a number of our own cases that a reviewing court \u201cmust indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance\u201d and the defendant \u201cmust overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also State v. Hamilton, </em>2007 MT 223, \u00b6 16, 339 Mont. 92, \u00b6 16, 167 P.3d 906, \u00b6 16 (\u201cThere is a strong presumption with regard to the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test that trial counsel\u2019s performance was based on sound trial strategy and falls within the broad range of reasonable professional conduct.\u201d); <em>accord State v. Tennell, </em>2007 MT 266, \u00b6 16, 339 Mont. 381, \u00b6 16, 170 P.3d 965, \u00b6 16; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number><em>State v.

The strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance and was based on sound trial strategy still remains. This presumption likewise undergirds the long-standing appellate standard that a petitioner seeking to reverse a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel bears \u201ca heavy burden.\u201d <em>See Brown v. State, </em>277 Mont. 430, 434, 922 P.2d 1146, 1148 (1996); <em>Schaff v. State, </em>2003 MT 187, \u00b6 18, 316 Mont. 453, \u00b6 18, 73 P.3d 806, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">\u00b622 With these principles in mind, we now turn to the question of whether Shockley rendered deficient performance during voir dire by failing to ask follow-up questions of jurors J.B. and E.F. Whitlow\u2019s specific contentions as to J.B. and E.F. will be considered in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">A. Juror J.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\u00b623 During voir dire questioning by the prosecutor, the following exchange occurred between J.B. and the prosecutor, George Corn:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">[J.B.]:... When you were asking me if I could be impartial, I\u2019m going to try to be impartial, but one of my daughters goes with one of my [sic] boys out of Pinesdale, so I have heard about this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">MR. CORN: Do you realize that what you might have heard, [J.B.], is not evidence in thi[s] case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-9\">[J.B.]: Right, right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-10\">MR. CORN: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-11\">[J.B.]: And I have read everything that they put [in] the paper. I just don\u2019t know how partial-you know-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-12\">MR. CORN: And you have to tell me and make that decision yourself. If the Judge instructs-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-13\">[J.B.]: I\u2019ll try.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-14\">MR. CORN: -you under oath?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-15\">[J.B.]: I do have three little girls, so it\u2019s hard to be impartial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-16\">MR. CORN: All right. Well, I\u2019m going to let you wrestle with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-17\">[J.B.], have you heard the questions that I have asked of the other jurors?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-18\">[J.B.]: I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-19\">MR. CORN: Is there anything I touched upon-and I\u2019ve been over a fair amount of material-but unless there\u2019s something specific-or was there anything that I touched upon that you need to discuss with me at this point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>[J.B.]: No, I read it when it happened, that\u2019s the last I heard of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-4\">MR. CORN: Have you-Based on what you read, is there anything that you read about that that would prevent you from reserving judgment in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">[J.B.]: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The prosecutor also asked J.B. several other isolated questions about previous jury duty, whether J.B. knew any of the witnesses, and the burden of proof in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">\u00b624 After the prosecutor completed his voir dire questioning of the potential jurors, Shockley began his questioning and asked the potential jurors a series of four questions dealing with sexual abuse, mental health treatment and association with the mental health profession, and whether any of the potential jurors were aware of anything else about the case that might prejudice them against Whitlow. Out of respect for the sensitive nature of the questions, Shockley then conducted individual interviews (in the judge\u2019s chambers) of each juror who responded affirmatively to any of the questions. J.B. was among the jurors who replied affirmatively to one of Shockley\u2019s questions, and Shockley proceeded to question J.B. in the judge\u2019s chambers as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-8\">THE COURT: [J.B.], which of those questions applied to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\">[J.B.]: The mental health professional. I went through a divorce, and for a reality check, I went in twice, and my daughter went in twice. My son and I had a little trouble; he had an anger problem and went back to live with his mother, and before he could come home, he had to go see a professional to get his anger under control, went in about five or six times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-10\">MR. SHOCKLEY: It happens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-11\">[J.B.]: Yeah. Well, good enough, so the Marine Corps will let him in in five more months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-12\">MR. SHOCKLEY: I spent 25 years in the Marine Corps. I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s that high of a standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-13\">[J.B.]: Got him straightened out just in time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-14\">MR. CORN: I don\u2019t have any more questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-15\">THE COURT: Anything about any of those experiences that would tend to make you regard testimony from a psychologist or therapist differently than anyone else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-16\">[J.B.]: No. More of a listening session for him than anything else. There was no real direction. They just felt that if he needed to talk, to come on back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>MR. SHOCKLEY: The magic question is-I think it\u2019s magic-would you give more credence to a psychologist because he\u2019s an expert witness than you would to a regular witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-4\">[J.B.]: I guess I\u2019d have to hear the testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">MR. SHOCKLEY: But just because they\u2019re a psychologist, are they more believable than a guy off the street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">[J.B.]: I don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">MR. SHOCKLEY: Okay, that\u2019s good enough for me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Towards the end of voir dire, Shockley asked the jury pool, \u201cIs there anyone here that doesn\u2019t think they can be objective, and their emotions are just too great about this issue to give Mr. Whitlow a fair trial?\u201d None of the jurors, including J.B., replied affirmatively to this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">\u00b625 At the postconviction evidentiary hearing, Shockley stated that he thought mentioning to J.B. that he (Shockley) had been in the Marine Corps might be a plus and that it was a good trial tactic to ingratiate himself with J.B. In addition, Shockley testified that he had received and reviewed the jury questionnaires prior to the jury selection process. Shockley explained, in reference to his review of the questionnaires, \u2018What I would want to do is get people who are likely to be open-minded and receptive to my evidence and hopefully inclined towards my client.\u201d Shockley also stated that as a general rule, he would observe jurors\u2019 body language, tone of voice, and general demeanor during the opposing counsel\u2019s questioning of the jury pool. Shockley testified that he almost certainly did this during Whitlow\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">\u00b626 Shockley also prepared voir dire notes in which he made comments on each of the jurors, including information about children, profession, or general demeanor. Shockley testified that it was his practice to review the juror questionnaires and then make notes on each juror before he went to court. Shockley further testified that he added additional notes on the sheet during voir dire. With respect to Whitlow\u2019s trial specifically, Shockley wrote, in the left-hand margin of the notes, comments about each of the jurors, including \u201clike,\u201d \u201cno,\u201d \u201cnot like,\u201d \u201cbad,\u201d \u201cgood,\u201d \u201ca lot like,\u201d and other similar comments. Several of these comments were underlined up to three or four times for emphasis. Most, but not all of the jurors received such comments. Shockley stated that he believed he wrote these comments during voir dire. For J.B., Shockley wrote the comments \u201cNo kids,\u201d \u201cBeen Juror,\u201d \u201cSlight hear [sic] Problem.\u201d Shockley also wrote under a second entry for J.B. \u201cHad kids.\u201d But Shockley did not write any comments such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>\u201clike,\u201d \u201cnot like,\u201d \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d for J.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">\u00b627 Whitlow claims that when Shockley allowed J.B. to serve on the jury despite J.B.\u2019s \u201cmultiple concerns about his ability to be impartial,\u201d Shockley\u2019s advocacy for Whitlow was deficient. Whitlow argues that J.B. raised questions about his ability to be impartial due to what he had read in the paper and the fact that he had three little girls. Whitlow contends that J.B. demonstrated bias and that Shockley failed to make any further inquiry into J.B.\u2019s bias. Whitlow notes that although the prosecution left J.B. to \u201cwrestle\u201d with the issue of whether he could be impartial, Shockley never followed up regarding the outcome of this \u201cwrestling match.\u201d Whitlow also points to Shockley\u2019s testimony at the evidentiary hearing that he did not recall why he did not ask any follow-up questions of J.B. or why he left J.B. on the jury. When asked by Shockley\u2019s postconviction counsel whether, \u201cin hindsight,\u201d he would have asked J.B. further questions, Shockley replied, \u201cI think it would have been a good idea.\u201d Likewise, Shockley\u2019s affidavit in support of Whitlow\u2019s petition for postconviction relief stated that \u201cafter reading the draft of the Memorandum of the Petitioner, it appears that I should have asked more questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u00b628 The State counters by arguing that J.B.\u2019s responses to the prosecutor\u2019s questions did not indicate partiality on J.B.\u2019s part and, thus, that Shockley did not have any reason to ask J.B. follow-up questions. The State further claims that Whitlow\u2019s arguments and Shockley\u2019s testimony do not rebut the presumption that Shockley\u2019s performance was reasonable. Accordingly, the State maintains that Whitlow failed to satisfy the first prong of <em>Strickland. </em>Prior to evaluating whether Shockley\u2019s performance was reasonable, we begin by examining the purpose of voir dire and challenges to a juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\u00b629  Defense counsel has a duty to ensure a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial by a panel of impartial jurors. <em>State v. Lamere, </em>2005 MT 118, \u00b6 15, 327 Mont. 115, \u00b6 15, 112 P.3d 1005, \u00b6 15. \u201cThe purpose of voir dire in a criminal proceeding is to determine the existence of a prospective juror\u2019s partiality, that is, his or her bias and prejudice.\u201d <em>State v. Herrman, </em>2003 MT 149, \u00b6 23, 316 Mont. 198, \u00b6 23, 70 P.3d 738, \u00b6 23. Adequate questioning enables counsel to exercise his or her peremptory challenges intelligently. <em>Herrman, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>Lamere, </em>\u00b6 15. Adequate questioning also enables counsel to properly raise a challenge for cause pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA. <em>Lamere, </em>\u00b6 15. \u00b630 Section 46-16-115, MCA, enumerates the grounds on which a juror may be excused for cause. Most relevant to this appeal, \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA, provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>A challenge for cause may be taken for all or any of the following reasons or for any other reason that the court determines: ... having a state of mind in reference to the case or to either of the parties that would prevent the juror from acting with entire impartiality and without prejudice to the substantial rights of either party. [Paragraph breaks omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">\u201cAs the right to trial by an impartial jury is principally secured through the system of challenges exercised during voir dire, it is incumbent on defense counsel to develop information in the record that demonstrates a juror\u2019s bias as to a party or an issue in the case.\u201d <em>Lamere, </em>\u00b6 15. If voir dire examination raises a serious question about a prospective juror\u2019s ability to be fair and impartial, then dismissal for cause is favored. <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 58, \u00b6 10, 320 Mont. 211, \u00b6 10, 89 P.3d 947, \u00b6 10. \u201cDisqualification based on a juror\u2019s alleged prejudice is necessary only where jurors form fixed opinions on the guilt or innocence of the defendant which they would not be able to lay aside and render a verdict based solely on the evidence presented in court.\u201d <em>State v. Freshment, </em>2002 MT 61, \u00b6 12, 309 Mont. 154, \u00b6 12, 43 P.3d 968, \u00b6 12 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u00b631 Examining Shockley\u2019s conduct in light of the purposes of voir dire and the circumstances surrounding voir dire at Whitlow\u2019s trial, we conclude that Whitlow has not shown Shockley\u2019s performance to be deficient with respect to J.B.. Contrary to Whitlow\u2019s assertions, Shockley did essentially follow-up with J.B. by questioning him about both his and his son\u2019s mental health treatment and by asking him, along with the other jurors, whether there was anything that could keep him from being objective. Shockley testified that he observed the jurors during voir dire questioning, that he reviewed the questionnaire forms for all the jurors, that he took detailed notes on each of the jurors including J.B., and that he attempted to establish some rapport with J.B. based on J.B.\u2019s son entering the Marine Corps. In addition, it is clear that there were other jurors who were of greater concern to Shockley in terms of being biased against Whitlow, as evidenced by Shockley\u2019s comments in his voir dire notes and his questioning during voir dire. Shockley himself stated in his affidavit that he did not believe that J.B. was biased at the time of voir dire and that it was only upon reflection several years later that he changed his mind. Yet, \u201c[a] fair assessment\u201d of Shockley\u2019s performance \u201crequires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number><em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065. The circumstances surrounding Shockley\u2019s evaluation of J.B. do not establish that his original assessment of J.B. was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">\u00b632 More to the point, Whitlow has failed to demonstrate that Shockley\u2019s conduct in evaluating J.B. fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. The Supreme Court made clear in <em>Strickland </em>that \u201c[t]he proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S. Ct. at 2065. Whitlow, however, has offered no legal authority or expert testimony concerning the prevailing professional norms applicable to Shockley\u2019s evaluation of J.B. <em>Cf. Yarborough v. Gentry, </em>540 U.S. 1, 7-8, 124 S. Ct. 1, 5 (2003) (per curiam). Rather, Whitlow has offered only Shockley\u2019s testimony that, in hindsight, he would have asked further questions of J.B. and he could not recall any tactical reason for not asking J.B. additional questions. Yet, \u201ceven if an omission is inadvertent, relief is not automatic. The Sixth Amendment guarantees reasonable competence, not perfect advocacy judged with the benefit of hindsight.\u201d <em>Yarborough, </em>540 U.S. at 8, 124 S. Ct. at 6. As explained above, the pertinent question is whether, \u201cin light of all the circumstances,\u201d Shockley\u2019s decision not to ask additional questions of J.B. fell outside \u201cthe wide range of professionally competent assistance.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690, 104 S. Ct. at 2066. Again, there is a strong presumption that Shockley\u2019s conduct fell within this range, <em>see Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065; <em>State v. Hamilton, </em>2007 MT 223, \u00b6 16, 339 Mont. 92, \u00b6 16, 167 P.3d 906, \u00b6 16, and we conclude that Whitlow has not overcome this presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"Aux\">\u00b633  In sum, there is a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance and was based on sound trial strategy. In order to overcome this presumption, the convicted defendant making a claim of ineffective assistance must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness measured under prevailing professional norms. Here, Whitlow has failed to make this showing in his presentation to the Court. Accordingly, we hold that Whitlow has not demonstrated that Shockley\u2019s performance during voir dire with respect to J.B. was constitutionally deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">B. Juror E.F.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u00b634 During voir dire, the prosecutor asked E.F. whether he had heard anything about the case. The following exchange ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">MR. CORN: ... [Wje\u2019ll start with you, [E.F.]. Have you heard anything about the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>[E.F.]: Yes, I read about it in the papers and discussed it with the family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\">MR. CORN: That was about six months ago or seven months ago?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">[E.F.]: That was after the incident occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">MR. CORN: Is there anything that you recall from your-from that time that would prevent you from reserving judgment until all the evidence came in in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">[E.F.]: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Whitlow claims that Shockley rendered ineffective assistance of counsel when he failed to inquire into E.F.\u2019s statement that he discussed the incident with \u201cthe family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">\u00b635 As a threshold matter, there is some confusion as to whether \u201cthe family\u201d referred to E.F.\u2019s family or to the victim\u2019s family. In his petition for postconviction relief, Whitlow misquoted the voir dire transcript and then claimed that Shockley had failed to question E.F. about \u201cthe statement that [E.F.] had discussed the alleged rape and aggravated kidnaping [sic] with <em>the victim\u2019s </em>family\u201d (emphasis added). However, upon reading the transcript at the evidentiary hearing Shockley stated, \u201cThe way I read the transcript, he\u2019s talking about [E.F.]\u2019s own family.\u201d When asked whether he assumed it was E.F.\u2019s own family, Shockley replied, \u201cI don\u2019t recall, but if I was hearing this today, that\u2019s what I would have thought.\u201d Finally, as the State points out, during voir dire the prosecutor read off the names of several witnesses-including the victim and the victim\u2019s mother, aunts, and uncle-and asked the jurors whether they knew any of these individuals. E.F. never gave any indication that he knew the victim or her family. We agree with the State that this fact, along with the actual transcript of E.F.\u2019s questioning, demonstrates that E.F. was referring to his family, not the victim\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">\u00b636 Nonetheless, Whitlow asserts that even assuming E.F. was referring to his family, Shockley should have asked what E.F. said to them and what his family said in response. Whitlow claims that doing so \u201cwould have revealed any preconceptions or biases that [E.F.] brought to the courtroom.\u201d Whitlow claims that there was no tactical reason for leaving E.F. on the jury. In support of this, Whitlow provides Shockley\u2019s testimony in which Shockley acknowledged that it would have been reasonable for him to inquire into what E.F. said to his family and what they said to him. Also, when asked whether he had made a tactical decision about E.F., Shockley again replied, \u201cNot that I recall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>\u00b637 The State argues that Whitlow\u2019s claim is based on \u201cspeculation and pure hindsight\u201d and that Whitlow fails to demonstrate that Shockleys performance fell below the range of reasonable professional assistance. Furthermore, the State claims that even if Shockley had questioned E.F. further about the conversation with his family, E.F. would not have been subject to removal for cause because E.F. \u201cstated that what he learned about Whitlow\u2019s case would not prevent him from reserving judgment until all the evidence came in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">\u00b638  We agree with the State that Whitlow has failed to demonstrate that Shockleys conduct with respect to E.F. fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. He has not shown that under prevailing professional norms, it was unreasonable for Shockley not to ask further questions about what E.F. discussed with his family. Thus, Whitlow has failed to overcome the strong presumption that Shockley\u2019s conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065. We hold that Shockleys performance in voir dire with respect to E.F. has not been shown to be constitutionally deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u00b639 Because Whitlow has failed to demonstrate that Shockleys conduct with respect to both J.B. and E.F. fell below an objective standard of reasonableness measured under prevailing professional norms and in light of the surrounding circumstances, we need not address the prejudice prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S. Ct. at 2069; <em>Adams, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\u00b640 Whitlow has failed to demonstrate that Shockley\u2019s conduct with respect to voir dire questioning of Jurors J.B. and E.F. was deficient, as he has failed to overcome the presumption that the challenged acts and omissions fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. Accordingly, he has not satisfied the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test and, therefore, his ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">\u00b641 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b127-9\">JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-15\"> The recipients of Shockley\u2019s letters included Whitlow\u2019s appellate counsel in <em>Whitlow I, </em>Whitlow\u2019s appellate counsel for <em>Whitlow II </em>and the postconviction relief proceedings, and Whitlow himself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b115-5\"> <em>See e.g. State v.

As <em>Strickland, </em>makes clear, the issue is not whether counsel\u2019s challenged conduct may be characterized as \u201cstrategic\u201d or \u201ctactical\u201d; rather, it is whether that conduct-strategic, tactical, or otherwise-was \u201creasonable\u201d under prevailing professional norms and in light of surrounding circumstances. Accordingly, to the extent our cases may be read as precluding an ineffective assistance of counsel claim predicated on trial tactics and strategic decisions that were objectively unreasonable, those cases conflict with <em>Strickland </em>and, therefore, are overruled on this particular point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b119-5\"> Notably, although we have found many <em>pre-Strickland </em>decisions from the United States Courts of Appeals mentioning the ignorance or neglect test, see <em>e.g. United States v.
