Knutson and Judy Candee, personal representatives of the estate of Jesse Roberts, and Christy R. Knutson and Wayne G. Knutson as individuals (Knutsons). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">\u00b62 The Schroeders present the following issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">\u00b63 Whether the District Court properly determined that both property owners held fee simple title to one-half of a 30-foot wide former public roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">\u00b64 Whether the District Court properly determined that each party\u2019s use of the other\u2019s property had created in the Schroeders a revocable license to access an irrigation ditch on the Knutsons\u2019 property, but had created in the Knutsons a prescriptive easement to use the Schroeders\u2019 portion of the right-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">\u00b65 The parties own property in Crane, Montana, in Richland County. The Knutsons\u2019 land is situated directly north of the Schroeders\u2019 land. Marshall Street, a right-of-way planned for the original town of Crane, divides the two properties. Crane came into existence in 1910 when John A. Stewart (Stewart) donated the townsite property to the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>in a certificate of dedication. Stewart also owned all the land adjoining the townsite. Consequently, Stewart originally owned the land now owned by the Schroeders within the Crane townsite and the Knutsons\u2019 land just outside the Crane townsite.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">\u00b66 The Richland County Commissioners abandoned the northern 50 feet of Marshall Street in 1917 upon Stewart\u2019s petition. The County expressly reserved to the public use the right-of-way\u2019s remaining 30 feet. Stewart later sold the land north of Marshall Street to James M. Roberts in 1918, including the northern 50 feet of the original 80-foot wide right-of-way. The Richland County Commissioners abandoned the right-of-ways remaining 30 feet in 1919 upon a second petition filed by Stewart.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u00b67 The Schroeders, in 1991, acquired the property that abuts the 30-foot right-of-way to the south. The property abutting the right-of-way to the north has remained in the Roberts family. The Knutsons are the personal representatives of the estate of Jesse B. Roberts (Jesse). The Schroeders claim that in 1991 Jesse orally agreed to allow the Schroeders to use any part of his land to transport water from Jesse\u2019s irrigation ditch to the Schroeders\u2019 property and to maintain the irrigation ditch. The Schroeders allege that, in return, they allowed Jesse to use a roadway on the northwestern part of their property to drive around his house. The Knutsons have denied the Schroeders access, however, since April 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u00b68 Several significant events happened around the time of Jesse\u2019s death in 2004. The record does not establish conclusively whether these events took place shortly before, or shortly after, Jesse died. The Knutsons removed an encroaching building from the edge of the Schroeders\u2019 property at the request of the Schroeders\u2019 attorney. The parties also met to discuss their respective rights to use the other\u2019s land around the time of Jesse\u2019s death. The Knutsons offered to purchase the roadway on the northwestern portion of the Schroeders\u2019 property. The Knutsons also requested an express easement allowing them to continue to use the roadway on the northwestern part of the Schroeders\u2019 property to drive around Jesse\u2019s house. The Knutsons promised in return to grant orally to the Schroeders access to irrigation waters on the Knutsons\u2019 land. The Knutsons refused to negotiate further when the Schroeders requested an express easement. \u00b69 The Knutsons brought this action to quiet title to the northern 65 feet of the original 80-foot wide Marshall Street and to the disputed roadway giving them access to Jesse\u2019s house. The Schroeders alleged in a counterclaim that the Knutsons unlawfully continued to deprive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>the Schroeders of their use of an existing easement, or, in the alternative, a prescriptive easement, to access irrigation waters on the Knutsons\u2019 land. The District Court granted partial summary judgment on several issues. The District Court decided that the Schroeders\u2019 irrigation water access would constitute a revocable license if the Schroeders failed to establish an easement at trial. The District Court also determined that if the Schroeders established a prescriptive easement for the irrigation ditch at trial their subsequent actions incompatible with a prescriptive right had extinguished the servitude.</p>\n<p id=\"AD\">\u00b610 The Schroeders admitted during the bench trial that they had observed the Knutsons using the disputed roadway daily. The Schroeders also admitted that they had purchased their land with notice that the Knutsons used the disputed roadway on a daily basis. Testimony regarding the ditch showed that the ditch had not existed before Stewart had severed the unity of title to what is now the Knutsons\u2019 and Schroeders\u2019 property. The Schroeders failed to prove that they had ever expended any money on the ditch.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\u00b611 The District Court ruled in favor of the Knutsons. The court decided that Stewart, the Schroeders\u2019 predecessor in interest to the land south of Marshall Street, took fee simple title to the southern half of the remaining 30 feet of Marshall Street upon abandonment in 1919, pursuant to \u00a7 4530, R.C.M. (1907). Section 4530, R.C.M. (1907), now codified at \u00a7 70-16-202, MCA, provides that \u201c[a]n owner of land bounded by a road or street is presumed to own to the center thereof</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b612 Stewart originally owned both the properties to the north and to the south of Marshall Street. The parties agreed at trial that Stewart had acquired the northern 50 feet of Marshall Street when the County expressly abandoned it to him by resolution in 1917. The parties further agreed that Stewart had conveyed that 50-foot wide portion of Marshall Street to Roberts, the Knutsons\u2019 predecessor in interest, when Stewart deeded to him the land bordering the right-of-way to the north in 1918. As a result, Knutson now owned the entire 50-foot strip. The District Court determined that no contrary intent existed in the deed from Stewart to Roberts indicating that Stewart intended to convey anything more or less than that provided by \u00a7 4530, R.C.M. (1907).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\u00b613 The District Court also considered \u00a7 4626, R.C.M. (1907), now codified at \u00a7 70-20-307, MCA, that provides that \u201c[a] transfer of land, bounded by a highway, passes the title of the person whose estate is transferred to the soil of the highway in front of the center thereof, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>unless a different intent appears from the grant.\u201d The court concluded, therefore, that upon the 1919 abandonment of the remaining 30 feet of Marshall Street, the adjoining landowners to the north and south had acquired a fee simple interest in the right-of-way to the centerline. Each landowner had acquired 15 feet. The successors in interest of these landowners-the Knutsons and the Schroeders-now owned their respective 15-foot strips of Marshall Street after the 1919 abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b614 The District Court also decided that the Knutsons had failed to establish an express easement over the disputed roadway, but that they had established a prescriptive easement over the roadway by their 17 years of open and notorious, exclusive, adverse, continuous, and uninterrupted use of the roadway to drive around Jesse\u2019s house. The District Court concluded that the Schroeders had failed to demonstrate the existence of an easement over the Knutson\u2019s land for irrigation purposes. The Schroeders could at best have enjoyed a revocable license given the court\u2019s previous partial summary judgment. The Schroeders appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\u00b615 We review the findings of fact made by a district court sitting without a jury to determine if the court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous. <em>City of Bozeman v. Taylen, </em>2007 MT 256, \u00b6 15, 339 Mont. 274, \u00b6 15, 170 P.3d 939, \u00b6 15. A district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous if substantial credible evidence does not support them, if the trial court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves this Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Taylen, </em>\u00b6 15. We must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party when determining whether substantial credible evidence supports the district court\u2019s findings. <em>Taylen, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">\u00b616 <em>Whether the District Court properly determined that both property owners held fee simple title to one-half of a 30-foot wide former public roadway.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">\u00b6 17 The Schroeders contend that the District Court incorrectly applied \u00a7 4530, R.C.M. (1907). The Schroeders cite <em>City of Billings v. Pierce, </em>117 Mont. 255, 262, 161 P.2d 636, 639 (1945), for the proposition that a public road constitutes an easement vested in the public. The Schroeders contend that ensuing cases interpreting public roadways, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>including <em>McPherson v. Monegan, </em>120 Mont. 454, 187 P.2d 542 (1947), <em>Bailey v. Ravalli County, </em>201 Mont. 138, 653 P.2d 139 (1982), and <em>Herreid v. Hauck, </em>254 Mont. 496, 839 P.2d 571 (1992), have held that a landowner whose property adjoins a public roadway acquires a vested interest in one-half of the public roadway at the time the road is platted pursuant to the principle established in <em>Pierce.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b618 The Schroeders concede that the 1917 abandonment of the northern 50 feet and the express conveyance of those 50 feet from Stewart to Roberts reduced their interest in the roadway. The Schroeders argue, however, that, as owners of the property abutting Marshall Street to the south, they acquired a vested fee simple interest in one-half of the 80-foot wide road way at the time of platting according to <em>McPherson, Bailey, </em>and <em>Herreid. </em>The Schroeders claim that the District Court should have applied \u00a7 4530, R.C.M. (1907), to the entire original 80-foot wide roadway. The Schroeders contend that the effect of the 1917 abandonment and subsequent conveyance entitles them to the remaining 30 feet of roadway where they originally had been entitled to 40 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u00b619 We agree that \u201cthe street belongs as an appurtenance, to the contiguous property, and that the title to the latter carries with it a title to the former.\u201d <em>McPherson, </em>120 Mont. at 458, 187 P.2d at 544; <em>see also Bailey, </em>201 Mont. 138, 653 P.2d 139; <em>Herreid, </em>254 Mont. 496, 839 P.2d 571. Contrary to the Schroeders\u2019 assertions, however, <em>McPherson, Herreid, </em>and <em>Bailey </em>do not hold that a landowner acquires an interest in one-half of a roadway as originally platted regardless of earlier abandonments or conveyances affecting that roadway. The Schroeders cite no other authority that suggests that such an interest cannot be extinguished or modified by an earlier abandonment or conveyance. To the contrary, this Court long has recognized that \u201c\u00a3[aj highway which is lawfully vacated or abandoned ceases to be a highway and, insofar as the public has a mere easement of way, the title reverts to the owners of the fee discharged from the servitude.\u2019\u201d <em>Herreid, </em>254 Mont. at 499, 839 P.2d at 573 (quoting <em>Bailey, </em>201 Mont. at 146, 653 P.2d at 143).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">\u00b620 The Schroeders urge us to apply \u00a7 4530, R.C.M. (1907), to a roadway that no longer existed at the time that the Schroeders allege that they should have acquired the southern 30 feet by abandonment. The 80-foot wide public roadway ceased to exist in 1917 when the County abandoned the northern 50 feet to Stewart, as the Schroeders have conceded at trial and on appeal. The title to that 50-foot portion of road reverted to Stewart in fee simple, discharging him from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>public\u2019s easement. <em>Herreid, </em>254 Mont. at 499, 839 P.2d at 573 (quoting <em>Bailey, </em>201 Mont. at 146, 653 P.2d at 143). Marshall Street consisted of a 30-foot wide public roadway in 1919 when the Richland County Commissioners abandoned the remaining roadway to Roberts in the north and to Stewart in the south.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">\u00b621  The District Court correctly applied \u00a7 4530, R.C.M. (1907), to the 30-foot wide public roadway as it existed in 1919. The District Court correctly concluded that the landowners adjoining Marshall Street each gained title to one-half of that 30-foot roadway upon the 1919 abandonment. The Knutsons own the northern 65 feet of the former Marshall Street, while the Schroeders own the southern 15 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\n<em>\u00b622 Whether the District Court properly determined that each party\u2019s use of the other\u2019s property had created in the Schroeders a revocable license to access an irrigation ditch on the Knutsons\u2019 property, but had created in the Knutsons a prescriptive easement to use the Schroeders\u2019 portion of the right-of-way.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u00b623 The Schroeders claim that the District Court erred when it determined that the Knutsons had acquired a prescriptive easement across the Schroeders\u2019 land to drive around Jesse\u2019s house. The Schroeders assert several bases for this claim. The Schroeders first claim that substantial credible evidence did not support the basic elements of a prescriptive easement. A party seeking to establish a prescriptive easement must show open, notorious, exclusive, adverse, continuous and uninterrupted use for the five-year statutory period by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Brimstone Min., Inc. v. Glaus, </em>2003 MT 236, \u00b6 21, 317 Mont. 236, \u00b6 21, 77 P.3d 175, \u00b6 21. The Schroeders contend that Knutsons did not use the property in an adverse manner because the Knutsons claim that the Schroeders consented to Jesse\u2019s use of their property and that Jesse and the Schroeders had agreed to an exchange of easements in 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">\u00b624 The District Court did not consider the alleged exchange of easements between Jesse and the Schroeders in 1991 in rendering its decision. The Knutsons argue that the District Court excluded this evidence because no substantial credible evidence existed to support that the meeting had ever taken place. The Knutsons point out that the Schroeders provided inconsistent testimony throughout the proceeding regarding when they had negotiated their agreement with Jesse, and whether such an agreement had been arranged at all. The Knutsons further note that Jesse\u2019s heirs testified that they had never heard of the arrangement. The District Court relied upon this evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>to conclude that the Knutsons used the disputed property in an adverse manner, rather than with the Schroeders\u2019 permission. When viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the Knutsons, we agree that the District Court based its conclusion that the Knutsons demonstrated hostile use of the Schroeders\u2019 land upon clear and convincing, and substantial credible evidence. <em>Brimstone Min. </em>Inc., \u00b6 21; <em>Taylen, </em>\u00b6 15. The District Court\u2019s conclusion does not constitute clear error. <em>Taylen, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u00b625 The Schroeders also assert that the Knutsons acted in a manner incompatible with a claim for a prescriptive easement pursuant to \u00a7 71-17-111(3), MCA. The Schroeders claim that the Knutsons acted incompatibly with their prescriptive easement claim when they tore down an encroaching building in the disputed area at the request of the Schroeders\u2019 attorney. The Schroeders further allege that the Knutsons acted incompatibly when they attempted to purchase the property over which they claimed a prescriptive easement. The Schroeders finally contend that the Knutsons acted incompatibly when they attempted to negotiate an exchange of easements with the Schroeders after Jesse died.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u00b626 The District Court made specific findings regarding whether the Knutsons acted in a manner incompatible with a claim for a prescriptive easement. Section 70-17-lll(l)(c), MCA, provides that a servitude is extinguished \u201cby the performance of any act upon either tenement by the owner of the servitude or with the owner\u2019s assent that is incompatible with its nature or exercise.\u201d The District Court determined that the Knutsons\u2019 tearing down of an encroaching building in the disputed area, the attempted purchase of the easement, and the attempt to negotiate the purchase of an easement did not constitute acts incompatible with the prescriptive easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u00b627  The District Court noted that all of those events occurred either shortly before, or shortly after, Jesse\u2019s death-the evidence did not establish clearly the exact timing. The District Court determined that, regardless of the timing, those acts on the part of the Knutsons could not have demonstrated their intent to abandon the prescriptive easement because the Knutsons were not authorized to act either on Jesse\u2019s behalf or on behalf of Jesse\u2019s estate. The evidence established that the Knutsons were not Jesse\u2019s agents before his death. The evidence also established that the Knutsons were not yet appointed personal representatives of Jesse\u2019s estate during the period shortly after Jesse\u2019s death. Once again, when viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the Knutsons, we agree that the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>based its conclusion that the Knutsons did not act in a manner incompatible with their prescriptive easement upon substantial credible evidence. The District Court\u2019s conclusion did not constitute clear error. <em>Taylen, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\u00b628  The Schroeders finally argue that their 1991 agreement with Jesse regarding his use of the Schroeders\u2019 property and the Schroeders\u2019 use of Jesse\u2019s property constituted an exchange of easements supported by consideration. The Schroeders contend that this exchange converted what had been a revocable license to an enforceable easement to use the Knutsons\u2019 property for irrigation purposes. We have determined above that the District Court properly refused to consider the Schroeders\u2019 claim of the existence of a 1991 agreement between Jesse and the Schroeders based on the Schroeders\u2019 inconsistent testimony on that issue. The Schroeders have not demonstrated on appeal why the District Court\u2019s refusal to consider this alleged agreement constituted clear error. <em>Taylen, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b629 We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b109-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
