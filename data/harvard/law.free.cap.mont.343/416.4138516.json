Judd (Judd) appeals from an order of the First Judicial District Court, Broadwater County, granting a motion for summary judgment filed on behalf of the Burlington Northern and Sante Fe Railway Company and its attorneys James E. Roberts, Jon M. Moyers, and David P. Legare. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-16\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b437-17\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court correctly determine as a matter of law that </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number><em>BNSF had probable cause to bring an indemnification action against Judd?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">\u00b64 <em>Did the District Court correctly determine that Judd\u2019s complaint failed to allege an ulterior motive necessary to support his abuse of process claim?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u00b65 <em>Did the District Court correctly determine that Judd\u2019s claim for emotional distress must fail either as a remedy for his underlying claims or as an independent action ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\u00b66 We will refer in this opinion to the Burlington Northern and Sante Fe Railway Company and its attorneys collectively as \u201cBNSF\u201d for purposes of clarity. Judd owned and operated a weed spraying business known as \u201cJudd\u2019s Services.\u201d BNSF and Judd entered into a \u201cvegetation control contract.\u201d The contract called for Judd to spray for noxious weeds and to conduct pre-emergent spraying on BNSF land. Judd and BNSF entered into the contract on December 31,1996, for a five year period set to expire on December 31, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">\u00b67 The contract contained an indemnification clause. The clause provided that Judd would indemnify BNSF for claims brought against BNSF that arose from Judd\u2019s acts, omissions, or failure to perform under the contract. The clause covered injuries to BNSF employees. The clause maintained Judd\u2019s obligation to indemnify BNSF even where the injury \u201cwas occasioned by or contributed to by the negligence\u201d of BNSF or its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">\u00b68 John Ransdell (Ransdell), a BNSF employee, stepped into a hole and injured his back while working at the rail yard located in Great Falls, Montana, in June of 1999. Ransdell reported the cause of his injury as a \u201chole in [the] ground covered by high grass\u201d on an injury report. Ransdell filed a Federal Employer\u2019s Liability Act (FELA) lawsuit against BNSF in March of 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">\u00b69 BNSF hired Neil Consultants, Inc., in August of 2000 to conduct a site investigation and topographic survey of the location of the hole. The survey concluded that the hole lay on BNSF property. BNSF and Ransdell settled the FELA suit for $485,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">\u00b610 BNSF sued Judd in United States District Court seeking indemnification under the vegetation control contract. BNSF alleged that Judd\u2019s failure to spray the weeds obscured the hole that caused Ransdell\u2019s injuries. Judd moved for summary judgment. The court denied Judd\u2019s motion. The court determined that factual disputes existed regarding Judd\u2019s duty to spray the area surrounding the hole, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>whether Judd had sprayed in that area, and whether BNSF had an obligation to direct Judd to spray in that area. The case proceeded to a jury trial. The jury returned its verdict in Judd\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-3\">\u00b611 Judd filed suit against BNSF in the First Judicial District Court, Broadwater County. Judd alleged that the indemnity action filed by BNSF constituted a malicious prosecution and an abuse of process. Judd\u2019s complaint also contained a claim against BNSF for the infliction of emotional distress. BNSF filed a motion for summary judgment. The District Court granted BNSF\u2019s motion. Judd appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">\u00b612 We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Hughes v. Lynch, </em>2007 MT 177, \u00b6 7, 338 Mont. 214, \u00b6 7, 164 P.3d 913, \u00b6 7. We use the same criteria applied by the district court under M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Hughes, </em>\u00b6 7. We will affirm a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment where no genuine issues of fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Hughes, </em>\u00b6 7. We review conclusions of law for correctness. <em>Hughes, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">DISCUSSION ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">\u00b613 <em>Did the District Court correctly determine as a matter of law that BNSF had probable cause to bring an indemnification action against Judd?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">\u00b614 Judd argues that the District Court granted BNSF\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the malicious prosecution claim contrary to Montana law. Judd asserts that a court must present to the jury the determination of the probable cause element of a malicious prosecution claim. BNSF contends that Montana law allows a district court to determine the existence of the probable cause element.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">\u00b615 A successful malicious prosecution claim requires a plaintiff to demonstrate that: (1) the defendant instigated, prosecuted, or continued a judicial proceeding; (2) the defendant pursued the proceeding against the plaintiff; (3) the defendant acted without probable cause; (4) the defendant acted with malice; (5) the judicial proceeding terminated favorably for the plaintiff; and (6) the plaintiff suffered damage. <em>Hughes, </em>\u00b6 12. A court may enter judgment for the defendant as a matter of law if the plaintiff fails to establish any of the above elements by prima facie evidence. <em>Hughes, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">\u00b616 We adopted <em>inHughes </em>the probable cause standard for a malicious prosecution claim set forth in \u00a7 675 of the Restatement (Second) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Torts. <em>Hughes, </em>\u00b6 16. We stated in <em>Hughes </em>that probable cause exists to initiate a civil suit when a party reasonably believes that facts exist and either: (1) the party correctly or reasonably believes that the facts support a valid claim under the applicable law; or (2) the party takes this position in reliance upon the advice of counsel, sought in good faith and received after a full disclosure of all relevant facts within the party\u2019s knowledge and information. <em>Hughes, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">\u00b617 BNSF had contracted with Judd for weed and grass spraying services. The vegetation control contract required Judd to conduct preemergent spraying. The contract\u2019s indemnification clause provided that Judd would indemnify BNSF for claims that arose from Judd\u2019s omissions or failure to perform under contract. The clause required Judd to indemnify BNSF even if the injury \u201cwas occasioned by or contributed to by the negligence\u201d of BNSF.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\u00b618 Ransdell filed suit against BNSF after Ransdell stepped into a hole and sustained injuries. Ransdell reported that high grass covered the hole. BNSF had a topographical survey conducted of the location of the hole. The survey indicated that the hole lay on BNSF property.</p>\n<p id=\"A8m\">\u00b619 BNSF argued in its indemnification action that the hole would not have become a hazard if Judd had sprayed properly the area surrounding the hole. The vegetation control contract provided a sufficient basis for BNSF reasonably to believe that Judd had to indemnify BNSF for any injuries occasioned by Judd\u2019s failure to eliminate tall grasses and weeds from BNSF property. The topographic survey provided a sufficient basis for BNSF reasonably to believe that the hole that caused Ransdell\u2019s injuries lay on BNSF property. A valid claim under the contract could have existed if BNSF could have proven these facts at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\u00b620 Judd argues that our decision in <em>Hughes </em>allows a district court to determine that probable cause existed as a matter of law only when a litigant\u2019s belief in that probable cause stems from an independent report or investigation of the matter. Our decision in <em>Hughes </em>contains no such requirement. We set no limitations in <em>Hughes </em>on the grounds upon which a plaintiff might rely when forming a belief that probable cause exists. We require only a reasonable belief in the existence of facts and a reasonable belief that those facts support a valid claim. <em>Hughes, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\u00b621  BNSF provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that it reasonably believed that Ransdell fell into the hole on BNSF property as a result of the fact that tall grasses had concealed the hole. BNSF also provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that it reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>believed that the circumstances surrounding Ransdell\u2019s injuries supported a valid claim under the indemnification clause of the vegetation control contract. Judd proffered evidence successfully to undermine BNSF\u2019s indemnification claim at the trial of the indemnification claim in federal court. Judd again proffered evidence to attack the merits of BNSF\u2019s indemnification claim in support of his motion for summary judgment in this matter. Judd proffered no evidence, however, that demonstrated that BNSF held an unreasonable belief with regard to either the existence of the necessary facts or the legal support for BNSF\u2019s indemnification claim. <em>Hughes,</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aqg\">\u00b6 16. The District Court correctly determined as a matter of law that Judd could not prove that BNSF lacked probable cause when it filed its indemnification claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">\u00b622 <em>Did the District Court correctly determine that Judd\u2019s complaint failed to allege an ulterior motive necessary to support his abuse of process claim?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\u00b623 Judd argues that BNSF committed an abuse of process when BNSF brought the indemnification claim. Judd asserts that no causal connection existed between Judd\u2019s duty to spray grasses and weeds and the existence of the hole in the ground. Judd contends that BNSF used the indemnity suit in an attempt \u201cto shift its loss\u201d to Judd, despite the fact that Judd had no duty to keep BNSF property safe.</p>\n<p id=\"AfW\">\u00b624 Judd misapprehends the nature of an abuse of process claim. We have articulated two elements that a plaintiff must prove in order to succeed on an abuse of process claim: (1) an ulterior purpose; and (2) a willful act in the use of the process not proper in the regular course of the proceeding. <em>Seltzer v. Morton, </em>2007 MT 62, \u00b6 57, 336 Mont. 225, \u00b6 57, 154 P.3d 561, \u00b6 57. A plaintiff must establish that the defendant attempted \u201c \u2018to use process to coerce the [plaintiffl to do some collateral thing which [the plaintiff] could not be legally and regularly compelled to do.\u2019 \u201d <em>Seltzer, </em>\u00b6 57 (quoting <em>Brault v. Smith, </em>209 Mont. 21, 29, 679 P.2d 236, 240 (1984)). We have characterized the occurrence of an abuse of process as a situation where \u201cprocess [is] put to a use perverted beyond its intended purpose.\u201d <em>Brault, </em>209 Mont. at 29, 679 P.2d at 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\u00b625  Judd proffered no evidence to the District Court to demonstrate that BNSF had used the indemnity action for an ulterior purpose or to coerce Judd to perform a collateral act. Judd notes that BNSF suffered a loss in its settlement with Ransdell. Judd contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>that BNSF used the indemnity suit in an attempt to \u201cshift its loss\u201d to Judd by pursuing a claim under the vegetation control contract. Judd fails to recognize that the intent to shift one\u2019s losses to another constitutes the essential purpose of an indemnification claim. <em>Durden v. Hydro Flame Corp., </em>1999 MT 186, \u00b6 25, 295 Mont. 318, \u00b6 25, 983 P.2d 943, \u00b6 25. Judd\u2019s own contentions undermine his claim thatBNSF initiated and pursued the indemnification suit for an improper purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">\u00b626 Judd correctly characterizes BNSF\u2019s lawsuit as an attempt to force Judd to indemnify BNSF for its loss. BNSF applied this force, however, in a legal and regular manner. BNSF alleged facts that demonstrated that it brought the indemnification claim for the legitimate purpose of attaining all available recourse under its contract with Judd. The District Court correctly determined that Judd\u2019s allegations demonstrated that BNSF did not commit an abuse of process. <em>Seltzer, </em>\u00b6 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">\u00b627 <em>Did the District Court correctly determine that Judd\u2019s claim for emotional distress must fail either as a remedy for his underlying claims or as an independent action?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">\u00b628 Judd argues that the District Court failed to address his claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. BNSF counters that the court correctly granted BNSF\u2019s motion for summary judgment with respect to Judd\u2019s claims for emotional distress as a remedy due to the failure of Judd\u2019s underlying claims. BNSF also contends that the court correctly determined that no independent action for the intentional infliction of emotional distress existed. BNSF argues that a party may assert an independent action for the intentional infliction of emotional distress only when the intentional act is unlawful or improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">\u00b629  We need not reach an issue concerning a plaintiffs alleged damages when we affirm a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant. <em>See Shiplet v. First Sec. Bank of Livingston, </em>234 Mont. 166, 174, 762 P.2d 242, 247 (1988) (overruled on other grounds by <em>Sacco v. High Country Independent Press, </em>271 Mont. 209, 896 P.2d 411 (1995)). Judd\u2019s claim for emotional distress damages as a remedy for his \u25a0underlying claims of malicious prosecution and abuse of process must fail in light of our conclusion that the District Court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of BNSF with respect to those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">\u00b630  Judd contends that an independent action for the intentional</p>\n<p id=\"b443-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>infliction of emotional distress exists in light of BNSF\u2019s intentional act of prosecuting an indemnification claim against Judd. We previously have stated that an actor does not engage in outrageous or extreme conduct simply by exercising a legal right. <em>Lachenmaier v. First Bank Systems, Inc., </em>246 Mont. 26, 35, 803 P.2d 614, 619-20 (1990). We quoted in <em>Lachenmaier </em>comment g of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 46. <em>Lachenmaier, </em>246 Mont. at 35, 803 P.2d at 620. Comment g addresses privileged actions and provides: \u201c \u2018The actor is never liable [\u00b6]... where] he has done no more than to insist upon his legal rights in a permissible way, even though he is well aware that such insistence is certain to cause emotional distress.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lachenmaier, </em>246 Mont, at 35, 803 P.2d at 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\">\u00b631  We revised our approach to intentional infliction of emotional distress claims in our decision in <em>Sacco. </em>We eliminated in <em>Sacco </em>the need to demonstrate \u201coutrageous\u201d conduct when advancing a claim for the intentional infliction of emotional distress. <em>Sacco, </em>271 Mon., at 237, 896 P.2d at 427-28. Our decision in <em>Sacco </em>left intact, however, the principle that a privileged action cannot become the basis for such a claim. Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 46, cmt. g (1965). The District Court properly granted summary judgment in favor of BNSF with respect to Judd\u2019s claims for emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">\u00b632 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b443-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES RICE, NELSON and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
