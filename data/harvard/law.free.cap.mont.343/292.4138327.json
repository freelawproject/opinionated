We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issue as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">\u00b63 Did the District Court impose an illegal sentence on Novak?</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">\u00b64 Novak was charged with criminal distribution of dangerous drugs in violation of \u00a7 45-9-101(4), MCA, for selling 0.06 grams of crystal methamphetamine to an undercover informant. Novak pled guilty by <em>Alford </em>plea. Prior to the sentencing hearing, the District Court determined that, as a result of his impaired mental capacity at the time of the crime, Novak was eligible for a statutory exception to the mandatory minimum sentence. However, the District Court chose to sentence Novak to ten years, with six suspended, which is more than the mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b313-14\">\u00b65 We review a criminal sentence for legality only; our review is confined to whether the sentence falls within the parameters prescribed by statute. <em>State v. Rogers, </em>2007 MT 227, \u00b6 20, 339 Mont. 132, \u00b6 20, 168 P.3d 669, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-15\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b313-16\">\u00b66 Did the District Court impose an illegal sentence on Novak?</p>\n<p id=\"b313-17\">\u00b67 A conviction of criminal distribution of dangerous drugs carries a mandatory minimum prison sentence of one year, and a maximum of life. Section 45-9-101(4), MCA. The District Court committed Novak to the custody of the Department of Corrections for ten years, and suspended six years of the sentence. This sentence falls squarely within the statutory range set forth by \u00a7 45-9-101(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-18\">\u00b68  However, Novak argues that because the District Court determined he was eligible for an exception to the statutory minimum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>sentence due to his impaired mental capacity, \u00a7 46-18-222(2), MCA, the District Court erred by choosing not to apply the exception. Novak is not the first to make this argument, and we have rejected it each time we have addressed it in the past. <em>Rogers, </em>\u00b6 39; <em>State v. Legg, </em>2004 MT 26, \u00b6 49, 319 Mont. 362, \u00b6 49, 84 P.3d 648, \u00b6 49; <em>State v. Keith, </em>2000 MT 23, \u00b6 23, 298 Mont. 165, \u00b6 23, 995 P.2d 966, \u00b6 23; <em>State v. Zabawa, </em>279 Mont. 307, 317, 928 P.2d 151, 157 (1996). This Court \u201chas consistently held that the exceptions set forth at \u00a7 46-18-222, MCA, do not apply in cases in which the district court sentences the offender to more than the minimum sentence.\u201d <em>Rogers, </em>\u00b6 39 (citation omitted). In other words, the fact that the court determined that Novak was eligible for an exception to the mandatory minimum sentence does not mean that he is entitled to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">\u00b69 Next, Novak argues that the District Court\u2019s sentence fails to comply with \u00a7 46-18-225, MCA, the non-violent felony offender provision. This section requires judges to first consider alternatives to imprisonment, such as a community corrections program or a prerelease program, for non-violent felony offenders. Section 46-18-225(1), MCA. Novak did not raise this objection below, and does not argue that any <em>Lenihan </em>exception applies. <em>State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 602 P.2d 997 (1979) (allowing appellate review of sentences where appellant alleges the sentence is illegal or exceeds statutory mandates, regardless of whether an objection was made at sentencing). Thus, we decline to address this issue for the first time now on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b610 Finally, Novak claims the District Court failed to adequately state the reasons for his sentence in open court. Section 46-18-115(6), MCA, provides that \u201c[i]n felony cases, the court shall specifically state all reasons for the sentence, including restrictions, conditions, or enhancements imposed, in open court on the record and in the written judgment.\u201d The transcript of the sentencing hearing undermines Novak\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u00b611 The District Court listed numerous reasons explaining the sentence it reached. First, the court found that Novak was \u201cnot a good candidate for community placement\u201d because he \u201chas a problem with following rules and complying with authority.\u201d Further, the court found, \u201cthere is no program in this community, including probation, that\u2019s going to provide him with what he needs in order to make what progress he can make.\u201d The court declined to place Novak in boot camp or on probation, because it found those placements would set up him for failure. The court also cited evidence of Novak\u2019s \u201cinability to follow the rules of release\u201d in the past, and his failure to appear before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>court on time for the sentencing hearing as reasons for placing him in a more restrictive environment, where he would be subject to stricter supervision. In sum, the court stated: \u201cThe Court feels that this is the best chance that the Defendant will have to obtain appropriate treatment and monitoring and supervision... so that he will be back in the community without an extensive delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">\u00b612  Contrary to Novak\u2019s assertion, we conclude that the District Court provided numerous reasons for the sentence it chose to impose. Thus, the court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence complies with the requirements of \u00a7 46-18-115(6), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u00b613  The sentence imposed by the District Court falls within the parameters of \u00a7 45-9-101(4), MCA. Novak has failed to demonstrate that the sentence is illegal. Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b315-7\">JUSTICES MORRIS, WARNER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
