The District Court imposed a sentence that included $7,082.42 in restitution. Breeding appeals, contending that the District Court did not have authority to impose restitution on him of more than $1,408.89 in this case. We agree and thus reverse the court\u2019s imposition of the excess $5,673.53 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">\u00b62 On January 5, 2004, Sherri Smith reported her 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee stolen from an alley in Bozeman, Montana. Apparently, she had started the vehicle to warm it up and had left the engine running and the doors unlocked while she finished up at work. Seizing on this opportunity, Ryan Seghetti, who had just come out of the Crystal Bar, hopped in the vehicle and drove off. Seghetti went to the home of an individual identified in the record simply as \u201cMatt,\u201d who lived in Belgrade. Breeding was at Matt\u2019s house when Seghetti arrived. Seghetti suggested that they all go for a drive, and Breeding and Matt agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">\u00b63 Seghetti eventually decided to take the Jeep off-road. While driving through a field, he hit a snow-covered haystack, causing significant body damage to the vehicle\u2019s front end. Seghetti then drove Matt back to his house, after which Seghetti suggested to Breeding that they drive to West Yellowstone or Big Sky. Breeding, however, proposed that they drive to California (where Breeding\u2019s father lived), and they decided to do that instead. Breeding was aware at this point that the Jeep had been stolen. Seghetti and Breeding took turns driving to San Diego, where Seghetti ultimately was stopped by police due to a broken left-turn signal. The Jeep was impounded and eventually returned to Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">\u00b64 The Bozeman police learned through their investigation that Seghetti and Breeding were involved in the theft. Indeed, Seghetti and Breeding both admitted as much during interviews with the police in April and December 2004. The State charged Breeding with felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>theft, in violation of \u00a7 45-6-301, MCA, on March 18, 2005. He initially pleaded not guilty, but the parties ultimately entered into a plea agreement under \u00a7 46-12-211(l)(c), MCA. Pursuant to the State\u2019s proposal, Breeding agreed to plead guilty to felony theft and the State agreed not to oppose a defense motion for his release on his own recognizance pending sentence. Furthermore, Breeding and the State agreed to recommend jointly that he be sentenced to the Department of Corrections (\u201cDOC\u201d) for a period of five years, all suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">\u00b65 The District Court accepted Breeding\u2019s guilty plea on December 19,2006, and ordered a presentence investigation. A probation/parole officer with the DOC conducted the investigation and filed a report (\u201cPSI\u201d) on February 1, 2007. Among other things, the PSI contained a recommendation that Breeding pay restitution for damage done to Smith\u2019s vehicle. Breeding objected to this recommendation in two presentencing memoranda and again at the sentencing hearing. He asserted that of the $7,382.42 requested by Smith, $5,673.53 derived exclusively from body damage to her Jeep. He argued that he could not be charged with the $5,673.53 because Seghetti was in exclusive control of the vehicle when it was damaged; because Breeding did not assist or encourage Seghetti in driving the Jeep recklessly into the field where Seghetti hit the haystack but, rather, tried to dissuade Seghetti from driving errantly and wildly; and because Breeding cannot be held liable for the damage simply by being present when it occurred. Relying on <em>State v. Beavers, </em>2000 MT 145, \u00b6 12, 300 Mont. 49, \u00b6 12, 3 P.3d 614, \u00b6 12, Breeding further argued that a defendant may not be ordered to pay restitution in excess of the damages caused by his criminal conduct. In this regard, Breeding emphasized that there were two distinct events related to the theft of the Jeep: first, Seghetti stole the vehicle, picked up Breeding and Matt, and then damaged it; and second, Breeding suggested that he and Seghetti drive to California in the vehicle, and Breeding participated in driving the vehicle to San Diego with knowledge that it had been stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\u00b66 The prosecutor responded that because Breeding engaged in a \u201cjoint venture\u201d with Seghetti to travel to California in the stolen Jeep, Breeding was \u201caccountable\u201d for Seghetti\u2019s actions (even though Breeding had pleaded guilty to theft, not accountability). The prosecutor also argued that \u201cwhile that Jeep was in his control, whether or not he was behind the driver wheel or not, he should be held responsible, jointly and severally, of course, for the damage caused to the vehicle.\u201d The prosecutor pointed out that the Jeep was in a damaged condition at the point Breeding and Seghetti drove it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>California, and he asserted that \u201cbut for\u201d Breeding\u2019s conduct of stealing the Jeep, \u201cthis vehicle would not have been injured and the victim would not be out an additional $5,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\u00b67 The District Court decided that Breeding could be charged with the damage to the Jeep, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">In this case, Mr. Breeding apparently did not actively participate at the initial theft of the vehicle involved. However, he did participate in that he joined the co-defendant [Seghetti] on a trip to California to visit Mr. Breeding\u2019s father and, at that time, he knew that the vehicle was stolen and he participated in driving the vehicle to California knowing that the vehicle was stolen. And while he was not driving at the time that the vehicle was damaged and did not necessarily encourage the conduct that resulted in the damage, the Court agrees with the State that participating in the offense does qualify Mr. Breeding as being jointly and severally responsible for the restitution for the damage in this case. The Court makes that determination after consideration of the arguments and legal principles identified by [defense counsel] in her brief. The Court agrees that it\u2019s maybe a more marginal case than sometimes and somewhat different than, for instance, the case cited of <em>[Sloan v. Fauque, </em>239 Mont. 383, 784 P.2d 895 (1989)]. However, the Court thinks that Mr. Breeding\u2019s knowledge that the vehicle was stolen and his active participation in taking the vehicle out of state to California does make him sufficiently responsible, and that his involvement was more than just that he was simply present when the damage occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">Therefore, the Court finds that he should be responsible for the full amount of restitution for the damage to the vehicle, as well as the other restitution expenses requested by the victim in this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\u00b68 The parties had agreed earlier that $300.00 of the $7,382.42 requested by Smith was for music tapes that were still in the Jeep. Therefore, the District Court reduced the $7,382.42 amount by $300.00 and imposed a restitution obligation of $7,082.42. The court stated that Breeding and Seghetti (who was sentenced in Cause No. DC-05-074) were jointly and severally responsible for this amount. Finally, the court imposed the agreed-to five-year suspended sentence. Breeding now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\u00b69 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court lacked authority to impose a restitution obligation on Breeding for the body damage to the Jeep.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\u00b610 With a criminal sentence (such as Breeding\u2019s suspended sentence) that is statutorily ineligible for review by the Sentence Review Division because it lacks at least one year of actual incarceration, our review is two-tiered: we review the sentence for both legality and abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Herd, </em>2004 MT 85, \u00b6\u00b6 16-23, 320 Mont. 490, \u00b6\u00b6 16-23, 87 P.3d 1017, \u00b6\u00b6 16-23. Our review for legality is confined to determining whether the sentencing court had statutory authority to impose the sentence, whether the sentence falls within the parameters set by the applicable sentencing statutes, and whether the court adhered to the affirmative mandates of the applicable sentencing statutes. <em>State v. Stephenson, </em>2008 MT 64, \u00b6 15, 342 Mont. 60, \u00b6 15, 179 P.3d 502, \u00b6 15. This determination is a question of law and, as such, our review is de novo. <em>Stephenson, </em>\u00b6 15. A sentencing court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>State v. Brotherton, </em>2008 MT 119, \u00b6 10, 342 Mont. 511, \u00b6 10, 182 P.3d 88, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>State v. Weaver, </em>2008 MT 86, \u00b6 9, 342 Mont. 196, \u00b6 9, 179 P.3d 534, \u00b6 9. Findings of fact are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial evidence, if the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record leaves us with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">\u00b612  A district court\u2019s authority to impose sentences in criminal cases is defined and constrained by statute, and a district court has no power to impose a sentence in the absence of specific statutory authority. <em>State v. Setters, </em>2001 MT 101, \u00b6 21, 305 Mont. 253, \u00b6 21, 25 P.3d 893, \u00b6 21. Under \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-201(5) and -241(1), MCA (2003), if a person has been found guilty of an offense and the sentencing judge finds that any \u201cvictim\u201d has sustained a \u201cpecuniary loss,\u201d the sentencing judge \u201cshall,\u201d as part of the sentence, require the offender to pay full restitution to the victim. A \u201cvictim\u201d is a person \u201cwho suffers loss of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>property, bodily injury, or death as a result of... the commission of an offense . . . .\u201d Section 46-18-243(2)(a)(i)(A), MCA (paragraph break omitted). \u201cPecuniary loss\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\">(a) all special damages, but not general damages, substantiated by evidence in the record, that a person could recover against the offender in a civil action arising out of the facts or events constituting the offender\u2019s criminal activities ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">(b) the full replacement cost of property taken, destroyed, harmed, or otherwise devalued as a result of the offender\u2019s criminal conduct;....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Section 46-18-243(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">\u00b613  Thus, a sentencing judge is not only authorized, but <em>required </em>to impose a restitution obligation on the offender if a person has suffered loss of property as a result of the commission of the offense. Correspondingly, this causal standard means that an offender is not responsible for restitution for offenses that he or she did not commit. <em>See State v. Beavers, </em>2000 MT 145, \u00b6\u00b6 9-11, 300 Mont. 49, \u00b6\u00b6 9-11, 3 P.3d 614, \u00b6\u00b6 9-11. The issue in the case at hand, therefore, is whether the damage to Smith\u2019s Jeep was a result of Breeding\u2019s offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">\u00b614 A person commits the offense of theft when he or she \u201cpurposely or knowingly obtains or exerts unauthorized control over property of the owner and . . . has the purpose of depriving the owner of the property,\u201d \u00a7 45-6-301(l)(a), MCA (paragraph break omitted), or \u201cpurposely or knowingly obtains control over stolen property knowing the property to have been stolen by another and . . . has the purpose of depriving the owner of the property,\u201d \u00a7 45-6-30l(3)(a), MCA (paragraph break omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">\u00b615 The facts underlying Breeding\u2019s plea of guilty to this offense all relate to his driving Smith\u2019s Jeep to San Diego. According to the State\u2019s probable cause affidavit in support of the Information, Seghetti admitted he was responsible for taking Smith\u2019s Jeep from the alley; Seghetti went to Belgrade, and he, Breeding, and Matt \u201cdrove around\u201d in the Jeep; Seghetti admitted to crashing the Jeep into a haystack; Breeding brought up the idea of traveling to San Diego in the Jeep, which the two proceeded to do; Breeding admitted that he went with Seghetti to San Diego, despite having knowledge that Seghetti stole the Jeep; and the two of them shared the driving. This recitation is consistent with the report of the investigating officer, who determined the following: Seghetti stole the Jeep from the alley in Bozeman and drove it to Matt\u2019s home in Belgrade, where he met Matt and Breeding; they rode around in the vehicle and were drunk; Seghetti admitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>wrecking the vehicle when he ran into a haystack in a field; Seghetti then dropped Matt off and told Breeding that he was going to take the vehicle to Big Sky or West Yellowstone; Breeding brought up the idea of taking the Jeep to San Diego, which they did; Breeding knew the car was stolen when he mentioned going to San Diego; and Breeding drove the vehicle at various times during the trip. At the conclusion of the report, the officer suggested that Breeding be prosecuted for felony theft on the following basis: \u201cBreeding admitted that he knew the vehicle was stolen when he obtained control of it by driving and used the vehicle for the trip to San Diego, CA.\u201d Likewise, according to the PSI, in response to the question, \u201cIn your own words, what did you do to get arrested on this charge?\u201d Breeding responded: \u201cI drove a stolen car when I was on my way to California to see my father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\u00b616 There is nothing in the record indicating that the charge against Breeding and the offense to which he pleaded guilty were based on any of the events that occurred prior to his suggesting that he and Seghetti drive the Jeep to California and his participating in that endeavor (by driving part of the distance). As noted by the District Court in its Reasons for Sentence, Breeding \u201cdid not actively participate at the initial theft of the vehicle,\u201d Breeding \u201cwas not driving at the time that the vehicle was damaged,\u201d and Breeding \u201cdid not necessarily encourage the conduct that resulted in the damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u00b617 The District found, and Breeding does not dispute, that he joined Seghetti on a trip to California and he knew, \u201cat that time,\u201d that the vehicle had been stolen but he nevertheless participated in driving it to California. However, there is no evidence that Breeding \u201cpurposely or knowingly\u201d obtained or exerted unauthorized control over the Jeep, with \u201cthe purpose of depriving [Smith] of the property,\u201d at any time prior to or contemporaneous with the vehicle\u2019s being damaged by Seghetti.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">\u00b618  In this regard, Breeding told the investigating officer that when Seghetti arrived at Matt\u2019s house, Breeding asked Seghetti where he had gotten the Jeep and Seghetti stated that it belonged to his (Seghetti\u2019s) uncle. Furthermore, Breeding stated that he did not learn that the vehicle had been stolen until he confronted Seghetti about damaging his uncle\u2019s Jeep by driving it into the haystack, at which point Seghetti revealed that, in fact, it was a stolen vehicle. The State did not refute these statements. For that matter, the State presented no evidence that Breeding\u2019s offense of theft-which was premised on his participating in driving the Jeep to California-was causally related to the earlier damage to the vehicle. The State was required to submit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>evidence to that effect before Breeding could be charged with paying restitution for this damage. <em>Cf. State v. Mikesell, </em>2004 MT 146, \u00b6 26, 321 Mont. 462, \u00b6 26, 91 P.3d 1273, \u00b6 26 (\u201cMikesell is entitled to have the restitution award supported by evidence.\u201d). Thus, there being no causal connection in the record between Breeding\u2019s commission of theft and the damage inflicted on the Jeep earlier by Seghetti, there is no basis for requiring Breeding to pay restitution for that damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u00b619 The District Court stated in its Reasons for Sentence \u201cthat Mr. Breeding\u2019s knowledge that the vehicle was stolen and his active participation in taking the vehicle out of state to California does make him sufficiently responsible, and that his involvement was more than just that he was simply present when the damage occurred.\u201d Notably, the court\u2019s observation that Breeding was not just simply present when the damage occurred is inconsistent with its earlier finding that Breeding \u201cdid not necessarily encourage the conduct that resulted in the damage.\u201d In any event, while an offender is liable for restitution for offenses to which he or she has admitted, has been found guilty, or has agreed to pay restitution, <em>see State v. Blanchard, </em>270 Mont. 11, 16, 889 P.2d 1180, 1183 (1995); <em>Beavers, </em>\u00b6 8, the only offense to which Breeding has admitted, has been found guilty, and has agreed to pay restitution is the theft that occurred when he participated in driving the Jeep to California. There is no statutory authority for imputing to Breeding the damage caused in the course of Seghetti\u2019s offense. Indeed, we have previously recognized that \u201c[a] defendant may not be ordered to pay restitution in excess of the damages caused by his criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Beavers, </em>\u00b6 12 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\u00b620 For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the District Court lacked authority to require Breeding to pay restitution for damage to the Jeep which did not occur as a result of his offense of theft. Accordingly, the restitution obligation on Breeding\u2019s sentence to cover the cost of the damage which occurred when Seghetti drove Smith\u2019s vehicle into a haystack ($5,673.53) is illegal and must be reversed. We remand with instructions to strike this portion of Breeding\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<judges id=\"b350-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER, COTTER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
