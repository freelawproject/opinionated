The said Charles Davis, Trustee, conveyed the said real estate to the defendant by warranty deed dated July 28, 1934 and recorded with the Registry of Deeds, County of Bristol, S. D. Book 752, Page 525, on August 11, 1934, said deed stating that the premises are conveyed subject to a balance of $530. on a mortgage to said Emil Fischer and 1934 taxes. The said defendant though he Imew of the existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>aforesaid mortgage, nevertheless conveyed the said premises to one Catherine G-audreau who had no knowledge thereof, by quitclaim deed dated August 13, 1934, and with the said Registry in Book 754, Page 7, on August 15, 1934, intentionally omitting any reference therein to the said mortgage and without informing the said grantee, Catherine Gaudreau, thereof before the consideration for said deed was paid by her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-3\">\u201cThe aforesaid mortgage to the plaintiff, dated May 20,1931, as aforementioned was recorded with the said Registry in Book 764, page 429, on May 31, 1935, but by decree of the Land Court for this Commonwealth dated February 12, 1936, the purchaser, Gaudreau held her title to the premises free and clear of the mortgage to the plaintiff. As a result of the defendant\u2019s act, the plaintiff has been, deprived of the security for the note upon which there remained a balance of $530. plus interest from August 11, 1934, at a rate of 7%. Annexed hereto and made a part hereof is the Land Court Decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">The trial judge found for the defendant. The plaintiff claims that the defendant was guilty of wanton and wilful misconduct toward her and especially stresses liability on the defendant\u2019s part by reason of Gen. Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 266 \u00a780 as ground of liability for the loss by the plaintiff of her mortgage security.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Said section 80 reads, \u201cWhoever conveys land, knowing that an encumbrance exists thereon, without informing the grantee, before the consideration is paid, of the existence and nature of such encumbrance, so far as he has knowledge thereof, shall be punished ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Aside from this statute, the defendant would not be liable to the plaintiff as mortgagee under the agreed facts and the statute itself does not create the liability here contended by the plaintiff. ' What is said in <em>Wyman v. Sullivan, </em>3 N. E. 2 (Mass.) 236, is applicable to the statute under consideration in the instant case. It was stated at page 238, \u201cMoreover, in this commonwealth, contrary to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>rule prevailing in many jurisdictions, violation of a criminal statute of this general class does not ordinarily in and of itself independently of the common law duties give rise to a civil cause of action. Such a statute has that effect only when by its express terms or by clear implication that appears to have been the legislative intent . . . (cases cited). In view of these cases, so far as there is in <em>Parker v. Barnard </em>anything inconsistent with what is now decided we are unable to follow it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\">The plaintiff relies upon <em>Parker v. Barnard, </em>135 Mass. 116, but her contention on that point is disposed of by the comment as to that case in the above quotation from <em>Wynn v. Sullivan. </em>There was no error in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Report dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
