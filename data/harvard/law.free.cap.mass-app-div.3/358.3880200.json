The trial judge did not act upon said requests and overruled the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">In connection with the answer in abatement, the respondent also filed three requests for rulings. The trial judge denied the first and allowed the second and third and dismissed the answer in abatement because it was filed subsequent to the filing of the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The respondent claiming to be aggrieved by the court\u2019s ruling and refusal to rule and by the dismissal of the answer in abatement and the overruling of the demurrer, the court reported the same to this Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">There has been no trial upon the merits of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">By the provisions of General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 249, \u00a71, the writ of <em>medita </em>must be \u2018 \u2018 sued out of and be returnable to the court in which the judgment was rendered.\u201d It follows that this proceeding was not one which the petitioner might have begun in the Superior Court within the meaning of General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7103.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Referring to a petition to vacate a judgment under General Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 250, \u00a714, it was said in <em>Hopkinton v. B. F. Sturtevant Company, </em>285. Mass. 272, 275:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-9\">\u201c Since by compulsion of the statute and not by voluntary election the petition was filed in the District Court where the judgment was entered, appeal from the action on the petition lay to the Superior Court. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">See. <em>also Beserosky v. Mason, </em>269 Mass. 325, 327. And in <em>Lynn Gas and Electric Company v. Creditors National </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number><em>Clearing House, </em>235 Mass. 114, 115, the same rule was applied to a writ of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\">For the same reasons, we are of opinion that the appeal from the action of the trial court in the matter now before us lay also to the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">The report is, therefore, dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
