This includes as well the value of the dresses and salvage\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\">The court allowed defendant\u2019s request 1 and denied requests 2 and 3. .</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Bequest 2 is as follows: \u201cWhere the value of the whole shipment is declared by the shipper to be $50.00 and recovery for total loss limited to $50.00 recovery for loss to part of the goods will be a proportional part of $50.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">According to the weight of authority, we think request 2 should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The United States courts and those of some states apply the \u201cratio\u201d rule, and that even in the case of shipments of non-homogeneous goods. <em>Western Transit Co. v. A. C. Leslie &amp; Co., </em>242 U. S. 44, <em>Kansas City So. Ry. v. </em>Carl, 227 U. S. 639; <em>Shelton v. Can. No. Ry. Co., </em>189 Fed. 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Some state courts allow the \u201ctrue value\u201d rule, in which the agreed value limits only the maximum recovery. <em>Cent. Ga. R.R. v. Broda, </em>190 Ala. 266; <em>Visanska v. So. Exp. Co., </em>92 S. C. 573; <em>Carleton v. N. Y. Cent. &amp;c. R.R., </em>64 N. Y. Misc. 51. cf. 40 Harv. L. R. 128. We know of no precedent in this state, in carrier cases, but the case of a \u201cvalued\u201d insurance policy would appear to be analogous. <em>Ins. Co. of N. A. v. Willey, </em>212 Mass. 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">When parties have based their obligations on an agreed value, that generally binds. <em>Cf. Connolly v. Sullivan, </em>173 Mass. 1, 21 Harv. L. R. 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">The present is not only a case of agreed limitation of recovery, which may be ineffective in cases of negligence, but of agreed valuation, forming part of the defendant\u2019s undertaking. The plaintiff, held to his own figure as to the sum. of the value of the parts, must show, to hold his find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>ing, that the value of the undamaged parts would not carry the total value above $50. This he obviously cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\">Bequest 3 was properly denied; it was not a request for a ruling of law, but an unwarranted attempt to dictate findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">There should be a reassessment of damages in accordance with this opinion, and it is\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">So ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
