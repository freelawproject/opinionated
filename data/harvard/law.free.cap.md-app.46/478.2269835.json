Pursuant to Md. Ann. Code, art. 27, \u00a7 643B (1979 Cum. Supp.), he was sentenced to a total of fifty years without the possibility of parole.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>After an appeal was taken by the defendant to this Court, the State noted a cross-appeal as authorized by Md. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 12-401 (1980), challenging the sentences imposed upon the defendant. The issues before us relate to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">1) The trial- court\u2019s acceptance of defendant\u2019s guilty pleas pursuant to Md. Rule 731;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">2) The trial court\u2019s refusal to allow defendant to withdraw his guilty pleas;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">3) The legality of consecutive sentences for the crimes of robbery with a deadly weapon and the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, when both crimes arise from the same incident;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">4) The applicability of the enhanced sentencing provisions of Md. Code Ann., art. 27, \u00a7 643B (1979 Cum. Supp.) to this case; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">5) The legality, under the provisions of Md. Ann. Code, art. 27, \u00a7 643B (1979 Cum. Supp.), of the sentences imposed upon defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">According to the statement of facts in support of the guilty pleas, the defendant, armed with a sawed-off shotgun, robbed a grocery store in Prince George\u2019s County of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>$1,663.94 on May 17,1978. Eight days later, armed with two pistols, defendant robbed another grocery store in the county of $4,200.00. During the course of the second robbery one of the guns discharged but no one was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Indictments were handed down on August 16, 1978 and November 15,1978 charging the defendant in the robberies. Warrants were issued for defendant\u2019s arrest. On May 7,1979 the State requested temporary custody of defendant from the Lorton Reformatory where he was incarcerated for a District of Columbia conviction. Defendant was returned to Maryland, and on June 21, 1979 he confessed to both robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The State filed a notice of mandatory sentencing pursuant to Md. Rule 734 (c) alleging that defendant had prior convictions for crimes of violence and at least one term of confinement in a correctional institution and, therefore, that it would seek the maximum mandatory sentence without the possibility of parole or suspension under Md. Ann. Code, art. 27, \u00a7 643B (1979 Cum. Supp.), <em>supra </em>n. 1. On August 7,1979 the defendant withdrew his not guilty plea and pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery with a deadly weapon and two counts of use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Prior to sentencing, defendant filed a motion to withdraw his guilty pleas. On October 11, 1979, the court considered and denied the motion. The court then sentenced defendant to twenty years for each of the robberies and five years for each of the handgun offenses; the sentences were all to run consecutively for a total of fifty years. In an amended commitment record it was recited that the sentences had been imposed under \u00a7 643B (c) and, therefore, were without possibility of suspension or parole. The sentences were made concurrent with a fifteen year to fife sentence the defendant was serving in the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">In the first of a two-pronged attack on his guilty plea, the defendant asserts that the trial court did not comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Md. Rule 731 because the record does not show that his pleas were \"fully voluntary where the questioning only concerned promises or threats made in order to obtain his guilty plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The record of the August 7,1979 proceedings, in which the pleas were entered, discloses that defendant, in a lengthy colloquy with the court, acknowledged that he was pleading guilty because he was, in fact, guilty; that no promises or threats had been made as an inducement for the pleas; that he could not be required or forced to plead guilty; and that he was voluntarily entering his pleas of guilty. The defendant also related that his education included two years of college and that he understood the nature and consequences of his pleas. Nothing in the record remotely suggests that the guilty pleas were anything but intelligently and voluntarily entered in accordance with Md. Rule 731. <em>Davis v. State, </em>278 Md. 103, 118, 361 A.2d 113, 121 (1976); <em>McCall v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 191, 195, 263 A.2d 19, 23 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Defendant cites <em>Fontana v. State, </em>42 Md. App. 203, 399 A.2d 950 (1979), in support of his contention that the trial court erred by denying his motion to withdraw his guilty pleas. In <em>Fontana, </em>we held that \"the right to withdraw a guilty plea is a discretionary matter which will not be overturned unless abused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 205, 399 A.2d at 951. The Rules permit the court to allow the withdrawal of the plea \"when justice requires.\u201d Md. Rule 731 (f) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">At the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion, he testified that \"[bjrutality and inhumane conditions at the Prince George\u2019s County Jail\u201d had prompted him to enter his pleas of guilty. The court found \"no real evidence\u201d to support defendant\u2019s assertion. Upon our review of the record, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">Defendant\u2019s next contention, that it is improper \"to enhance punishment twice because of the single factor of use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>of a weapon,\u201d need not long detain us. He recognizes in his brief that the issue was pending before the Court of Appeals. In the interim the Court has spoken. <em>Whack v. State, </em>288 Md. 137, 416 A.2d 265 (1980). There the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">\"The Legislature\u2019s concern about the use of a weapon to intimidate a robbery victim, and its additional concern when that weapon is a handgun, is certainly not unreasonable. When it expressly shows an intent to punish, under two separate statutory provisions, conduct involving those aggravating factors, the Fifth Amendment\u2019s double jeopardy prohibition has not heretofore been regarded as a bar.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 150, 416 A.2d at 271. In light of <em>Whack </em>there was no error in the imposition of consecutive sentences for the robbery and handgun offenses of which defendant was convicted. <em>See Stevenson v. State, </em>43 Md. App. 120, 131-32, 403 A.2d 812, 819 (1979), <em>aff'd, </em>287 Md. 504, 413 A.2d 1340 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">When a defendant has two prior convictions for crimes of violence and has served at least one term of confinement in a correctional institution as a result of such a conviction, then the State may seek mandatory sentencing under Md. Ann. Code, art. 27, \u00a7 643B (c) (1979 Cum. Supp.). <em>See </em>n. 1, <em>supra. </em>After due notice filed by the State, defendant was sentenced under the provisions of \u00a7 643B (c) to a total of fifty years without the possibility of parole. He now contends that the State did not establish a sufficient predicate for the mandatory sentencing because one of the prior convictions relied upon by the State, the third conviction listed below, was obtained under the Federal Youth Corrections Act (F.Y.C.A.), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5005-5026 (1976). He asserts that such adjudications of guilt are not \"convictions\u201d under \u00a7 643B.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>At the sentencing hearing the State submitted records to prove that defendant had prior convictions for crimes of violence, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">1) Robbery; January 4, 1973; Superior Court of the District of Columbia; 10 years under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010 (c) (1976).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">2) Attempted robbery; April 27, 1973; Superior Court of the District of Columbia; 10 years under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010 (c) (1976).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">3) Robbery with a deadly weapon; January 19, 1973; Superior Court of the District of Columbia; 10 years under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010 (c) (1976).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-9\">4) Robbery; August 12, 1971; Circuit Court for Montgomery County; 6 years \u2014 suspended and probation; reimposed for violation of probation on May 23, 1974; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-10\">5) Robbery with a deadly weapon; aggravated assault; two counts of carrying a pistol; April 25, 1979; Superior Court of the District of Columbia; 15 years to life for armed robbery; 3-9 years for assault, consecutive; 2-6 years on weapons offenses, concurrent with each other but consecutive to other sentences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">The court disregarded the most recent conviction because it was on appeal at the time of sentencing. In addition, the State concedes on appeal that the District of Columbia robbery and attempted robbery convictions are not necessarily crimes of violence as defined by \u00a7 643B (a) because robbery in the District of Columbia includes \"crimes accomplished by stealth and which do not involve violence or putting the victim in fear.\u201d <em>See </em>D.C. Code \u00a7 22-2901 (1973); <em>Butler v. State, </em>46 Md. App. 317, 323, 416 A.2d 773, 776 (1980). Defendant does not deny that the Montgomery County conviction for robbery is a prior conviction of a crime of violence for which he served a term of incarcertation in the Maryland State Penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>The sole question, therefore, under \u00a7 643B (c) is whether appellant\u2019s District of Columbia conviction on January 19, 1973 for armed robbery pursuant to the F.Y.C.A., 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010 (c) (1976), qualifies as a predicate \"prior conviction.\u201d He contends that \"[a] juvenile 'conviction\u2019 cannot be used as a basis for enhanced punishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Under federal law a \"juvenile\u201d is \"a person who has not attained his eighteenth birthday,\u201d or for the purpose of proceedings and disposition as a juvenile, one \"who has not attained his twenty-first birthday\u201d and who committed a violation of the criminal law of the United States prior to his eighteenth birthday. Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5031 (1976). Commitment shall not extend beyond the juvenile\u2019s twenty-first birthday. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5037. The adjudication of delinquency is not a criminal conviction. <em>See Fagerstrom v. United States, </em>311 F.2d 717, 720 (8th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">A youthful offender subject to the Federal Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5005-5026 (1976), on the other hand, is a person \"under the age of twenty-two years at the time of conviction.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5006 (d). The purpose of the F.Y.C.A. is to provide separate facilities for offenders under the age of twenty-one in order that they may be segregated from older, hardened criminals, thus improving their prospects of rehabilitation. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5011. <em>See generally Dorszynski v. United States, </em>418 U.S. 424, 431-36 (1974). Courts are authorized to impose indeterminate sentences wherein the parole commission determines the actual length of incarceration. 18 U.S.C. 5010 (b), (c), and (e). The statute does not otherwise change the legal status of a \"committed youth offender.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5006 (e). He is still convicted of a crime. <em>United States v. Ashley, </em>569 F.2d 975, 978 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 853 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">In construing an habitual offender statute and whether or not a conviction under the F.Y.C.A. may be used as a basis for sentencing, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">\"No purpose of the youth offender statute would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>served by refusing to treat appellant as a second offender. Section 5010 is designed to afford an opportunity for rehabilitation. Appellant did not take advantage of that opportunity. There is thus no rational basis for disregarding his previous conviction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-5\"><em>United States v. Wilson, </em>404 F.2d 531, 534 (2d Cir. 1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>394 U.S. 1003 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Here, the defendant was tried as an adult and convicted of armed robbery. The rationale of <em>Wilson </em>is compelling. We find no error in the trial court\u2019s consideration of defendant\u2019s District of Columbia conviction for armed robbery as a prior conviction of a crime of violence under \u00a7 643B. To conclude otherwise would contravene the Legislature\u2019s express intention to punish third offenders more severely. <em>See State v. Temoney, </em>45 Md. App. 569, 414 A.2d 240 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">The trial court sentenced defendant to twenty years on each of the robbery counts and five years on each of the handgun counts, and made the sentences consecutive, and without the possibility of parole under \u00a7 643B (c). Both the defendant and the State have appealed, alleging that the trial court committed error in interpreting the statute and in imposing the sentences. Subsection (c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-9\">\"(c) <em>Third conviction of crime of violence. </em>\u2014 Any person who (1) has been convicted on two separate occasions of a crime of violence where the convictions do not arise from a single incident, and (2) has served at least one term of confinement in a correctional institution as a result of a conviction of a crime of violence, shall be sentenced, on being convicted a third time of a crime of violence, to imprisonment for the term allowed by law, but, in any event, not less than 25 years. Neither the sentence nor any part of it may be suspended, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>person shall not be eligible for parole except in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 IB, \u00a7 11.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The State in its cross-appeal argues that \u00a7 643B (c) mandates that a twenty-five year sentence be imposed for <em>each </em>of the four separate crimes of violence as defined in \u00a7 643B (a), <em>i.e., </em>two \"robberies with a deadly weapon\u201d and two \"uses of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.\u201d As stated in its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">\"The State contends that this clause requires that the trial court impose the maximum sentence allowed by law for each subsequent conviction of a violent crime, but that a sentence of at least twenty-five years must be imposed when the maximum sentence allowed by law is less than twenty-five years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">In the State\u2019s view the defendant is subject to the imposition of sentences aggregating 100 years without the possibility of parole.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It does concede, however, that nothing in the section \"appears to prohibit the imposition of concurrent terms for those offenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">Defendant argues that the statute \"is meant to be applied once;.. . [that] it simply provides a minimum sentence for a third conviction of a crime of violence;\u201d and that nothing in the section mandates the imposition of a sentence beyond the twenty-five year minimum. In other words, it is defendant\u2019s position that only a single penalty of twenty-five years without parole or probation may be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Of course, in construing the statute we must observe its plain meaning and the \"natural import of its language....\u201d <em>State v. Fabritz, </em>276 Md. 416, 421, 348 A.2d 275, 278 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 942 (1976). The interpretation of this provision must be accomplished \" 'without resorting to subtle or forced construction....\u2019 \u201d <em>Howell v. State, </em>278 Md. 389, 393, 364 A.2d 797, 799 (1976), <em>quoting from Cearfoss v. State, </em>42 Md. 403, 407 (1875). In construing a penal statute and in resolving a dispute over the severity of the penalty, a presumption arises in favor of the lesser penalty over the greater one. <em>Wright v. State, </em>24 Md. App. 309, 319-20, 330 A.2d 482, 488 (1975). Finally, internal consistency between the various provisions of a statute must be maintained, and subsections must, therefore, be interpreted in the context of the entire statutory scheme. <em>Clark v. State, </em>2 Md. App. 756, 761, 237 A.2d 768, 770 (1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>394 U.S. 1001 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Applying these standards to \u00a7 643B (c), it is apparent that the subsection mandates the imposition of one, and only one, sentence of not less than twenty-five years upon proof of the requisite prior convictions arising from separate incidents and proof of a prior period of incarceration resulting from a crime of violence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reach this conclusion for several reasons. First, the plain language of the section does not purport to cover third or <em>subsequent </em>offenses. <em>Compare </em>Md. Ann. Code, art. 27, \u00a7 293 (1976) dealing with multiple offenders of the laws governing controlled dangerous substances: that section provides for an enhanced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>punishment for a \"second <em>or subsequent </em>offense\u201d (emphasis added). Second, \u00a7 643B (b) provides for a mandatory life sentence for the <em>fourth </em>conviction of a crime of violence, if the defendant has served three prior and separate terms of confinement. Common sense dictates that the sentence under \u00a7 643B (c) should be less severe than the mandatory life sentence under \u00a7 643B (b) wherein the predicates are more stringent. Yet, under the State\u2019s interpretation of the statute, the defendant here must be sentenced to four twenty-five year terms, which could be made to run consecutively to each other for a total sentence of 100 years without the possibility of parole, <em>i.e., </em>a life term could be achieved without meeting the prerequisites of \u00a7 643B (b), an obviously illogical result.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">In imposing sentence, the trial court viewed the armed robbery and related handgun offense as arising out of the same incident and, therefore, subject to the statutory minimum of \u00a7 643B (c). Defendant received consecutive sentences totalling twenty-five years under each of the two indictments, for an aggregate sentence of fifty years without the possibility of parole. This was error. Instead, the trial court should have sentenced defendant to a twenty-five year term without the possibility of parole under \u00a7 643B (c) only on the count in the first indictment of robbery with a deadly weapon, defendant\u2019s third qualifying conviction of a \"crime of violence.\u201d Normal sentences with the possibility of parole under the appropriate statutory authority should have been imposed on the remaining three counts. Of course, the sentences could be made to run consecutively to each other as was done below.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">In sum, our holding is that \u00a7 643B (c) permits the imposition of only one mandatory sentence without the possibility of parole. The draftmanship of the statute is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>patently inartful.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Any change, however, must be left to the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\n<em>Convictions affirmed; sentences vacated; case remanded for resentencing in accordance with this opinion; costs not to be reallocated as part of the judgment of this court pursuant to Md.

Ann. Code, art. 31B, \u00a7 11 (1979 Cum.

At trial, the State asked for a total sentence of seventy years without the possibility of parole. It computed this figure by adding up the normal maximum sentences for all four crimes; i.e., twenty years for each of the two robberies and fifteen years for each of the two handgun offenses. The State then applied the \u00a7 643B (c) twenty-five year minimum to the aggregate of seventy years and concluded that seventy years without the possibility of parole was required by the statute. On appeal, the State has abandoned this approach in favor of applying the twenty-five year minimum separately to each of the counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">Since we conclude that both interpretations urged by the State are incorrect, we do not decide what, if any, impact the State\u2019s change of position should make.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b510-6\">. The subsection requires that a defendant within its ambit be sentenced \"to the term allowed by law, but, in any event, not less than 25 years.\u201d \u00a7 643B (c). The State argues that \"this clause requires that the trial court impose the maximum sentence allowed by law for each subsequent conviction of a violent crime, but that a sentence of at least twenty-five years must be imposed when the maximum sentence allowed by law is less than twenty-five years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">In response to this argument, defendant contends that the State \"requires that one ignore the plain meaning of the words and supply a meaning not provided in the language of the statute.\u201d He views the statute as providing only a minimum sentence for a third conviction of a crime of violence, and nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">We need not decide the question in this appeal because the twenty-five year minimum sentence is the only possible sentence under \u00a7 643B (c), the normal maxima for the offenses all being less than twenty-five years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b511-7\">. Of course, there is one situation where a life sentence without the possibility of parole could be imposed under \u00a7 643B (c). When the \"term allowed by law\u201d for the offense is life imprisonment and the subsection\u2019s predicates have been satisfied, then a defendant could receive a legal no-parole life sentence under the subsection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b512-6\">. Although not urged upon us by defendant, we note that an absolutely literal reading of \u00a7 643B (c) would prevent the imposition of its mandatory sentence if the State were to prove more than two prior convictions for violent crimes. Such an interpretation of the section is unrealistic and not required by the declared legislative intent. Instead, we think that \u00a7 643B (c) is applicable upon proof of two prior convictions for violent crimes and the requisite term of confinement without regard to the existence of other equally qualifying convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">In addition, we note that unless a defendant\u2019s two prior convictions occur on \u201ctwo separate occasions\u201d the predicates of \u00a7 643B (c) have not been satisfied. This is true even when the two prior convictions arise from totally separate incidents. Thus, a defendant who is convicted at one trial of several crimes of violence may escape the mandatory sentence of \u00a7 643B (c). In contrast, however, the mandatory life sentence provision, \u00a7 643B (b), requires only \"three separate convictions.\u201d It does not require that the convictions be obtained on separate occasions. These discrepancies and variations are indicative of the need for legislative clarification of this statutory enactment. See McLee v. State, 46 Md.
