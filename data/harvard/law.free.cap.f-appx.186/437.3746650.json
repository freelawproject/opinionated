Bermudez sought an accelerated release based on his own method of calculation. Prior to filing this appeal, Bermudez was released from the BOP\u2019s custody and deported to Colombia. The issue Bermudez has raised on appeal has thus been rendered moot by his release. <em>See Bailey v. Southerland, </em>821 F.2d 277, 278 (5th Cir.1987). The fact that Bermudez seeks monetary damages on appeal does not continue to present a five case or controversy because he did not seek monetary relief before the district court. <em>See Benavides v. Housing Authority of the City of San Antonio, Tex., </em>238 F.3d 667, 670 n. 4 (5th Cir.2001) (refusing to grant relief not requested below); <em>Harris v. City of Houston, </em>151 F.3d 186, 190-91 (5th Cir.1998) (rejecting \u201cappellant\u2019s notion that we may fashion relief not requested below in order to keep a suit viable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b470-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
