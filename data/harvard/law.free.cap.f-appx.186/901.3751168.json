Diaz asserts the district court committed reversible error by rendering an unreasonable sentence because it did not reduce Diaz\u2019s sentence below the applicable Guidelines range. Diaz contends that in considering the nature of his offense and personal characteristics the district court should have imposed a lower sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Diaz\u2019s sentence is reasonable, and we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b934-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>We review a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence, in its entirety, for reasonableness in light of the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). The factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-4\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-5\"><em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">\u201c[Njothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). <em>Post-Booker, </em>the sentencing court still must calculate the Guidelines correctly. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174,1178 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">Here, the district court correctly calculated the Guidelines, considered the factors in \u00a7 3553 and Diaz\u2019s arguments, and imposed a reasonable sentence. Diaz does not assert the district court erred in its calculation of the Guidelines, and a review of the record does not reveal any error. In listening to Diaz\u2019s arguments and in reviewing the pre-sentence investigation report, the court considered the history and characteristics of Diaz. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). The court considered the nature of the offense and found Diaz was one of the \u201cmost active sellers\u201d in a conspiracy involving the sale of over 10 kilograms of heroin. <em>Id. </em>The court also considered the treatment available to Diaz and ordered him to participate in mental health and drug treatment, and furthermore, the court noted Diaz should be able to receive treatment for his Hepatitis C in prison. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Additionally, Diaz\u2019s sentence of 188 months\u2019 imprisonment was well below the statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(3); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)\u00ae and 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-12\">Accordingly, we conclude Diaz\u2019s sentence was reasonable in light of the record and the factors of \u00a7 3553(a). We affirm Diaz\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b933-9\">. The Government contends we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s decision not to impose a sentence below the applicable Guidelines range. This argument is without merit. We have recently held \"a <em>post-Booker </em>appeal based on the \u2018unreasonableness\u2019 of a sentence, whether within or outside the advisory guidelines range, is an appeal asserting that the sentence was imposed in violation of law pursuant to [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3742(a)(1).\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>434 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.2006).
