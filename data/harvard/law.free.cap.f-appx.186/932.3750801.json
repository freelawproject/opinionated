Susa-Valencia argues that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence, and that the IJ erred in denying asylum and withholding of removal. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we dismiss the petition in part and deny the petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-22\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b965-23\">Susa-Valencia entered the United States on May 27, 2002. In October 2002, she applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief alleging persecution by Squad #50 of the FARC<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> due to her political beliefs and activism. Susa-Valencia alleged that, beginning in March 2001, she was subject to terrorist and military persecution and also threatened. In a statement submitted in support of her application, Susa-Valencia stated that she received threats via anonymous notes, telephone calls, and in person. Among the documents submitted in support of her application was a police report based on a compliant that she filed on February 14, 2002. According to the report, Susa-Valencia told the police that she was a housewife and had received phone calls at home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>by persons who said that they would kill her because she worked for a local politician, a House Representative from the Department of Quindio, and helped him make political proselytism. Susa-Valencia also submitted a certification from the mayor of Calarca, signed on February 20, 2002, which stated that she was threatened and declared a military objective by Squad # 50 of the FARC, and that the mayor personally advised her to leave the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">In January 2003, Susa-Valencia was issued a notice to appear, charging her with removability under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B) for remaining in the United States for a time longer than permitted. During removal proceedings, Susa-Valencia conceded removability and requested asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">At the hearing on her application, SusaValencia testified that she was member of the Liberal Integration Movement and was the leader for one of six or seven groups within the organization. Her group conducted health brigades and recreational groups and collected school supplies for children. They would also help the peasants with their needs and help the youth so that they would not be recruited by the guerillas. At meetings, Susa-Valencia would speak to the youth about not joining the guerillas.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">Susa-Valencia described four incidents involving the FARC. On March 30, 2001, she received a threatening phone call at her home from the FARC. On July 20, 2001, one of her group\u2019s meetings was disrupted by 15 or 20 people, who identified themselves as from Front 50 of the FARC. These people came screaming for her head and threatened her, but she was protected by the people who were present at the meeting. On September 25, 2001, two men approached Susa-Valencia as she was walking into her apartment and handed her an envelope that read Front 50 of the FARC. Susa-Valencia never opened the envelope. On February 14, 2002, she received a phone call at work. The caller threatened her with death if she did not leave the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">Susa-Valencia explained that she did not put the dates of these incidents in her application because she was told that she could not write such a long story, and that she did not put them in her statement because she thought it would be too long. She explained that she told the police that she was a housewife because she had retired about two or three months before to see if she would be safer at home. Asked how she received a call at work when she had already retired, Susa-Valencia explained that \u201cthe dates aren\u2019t exactly the ones that I recall the most, because at that time, I was quite nervous.\u201d Susa-Valencia explained that the letter from the mayor was prepared because she went to see him in search of help. The mayor signed the certification as proof that she sought help from him and because she wanted a certificate. Asked why she needed this evidence, Susa-Valencia testified that she wanted to let the mayor know what was happening to her and denied that she was already planning to come to the United States and apply for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-9\">When she arrived in the United States, Susa-Valencia used a marine visa, the purpose of which was to work on a floating merchant ship, that she obtained in Bogota with the help of a company. However, upon arriving in the United States, SusaValencia told the company that she was not going to work. She explained that this was because she was frightened of the-ocean. However, she also stated that she knew she was not going to work on the ship because the visa was not legal for work on that ship, explaining that she meant that she had obtained the visa in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>order to get out of Colombia because she had been threatened. Susa-Valencia testified that she believed she would be killed if she returned to Colombia. She also stated that, as soon as she returned, she would continue working with the group because she liked participating in politics.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">The IJ denied asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Susa-Valencia appealed to the BIA, which affirmed the IJ without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">Because the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>See Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1284 n. 1. We review factual determinations, including credibility determinations, using the substantial evidence test. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). We will affirm if the decision \u201cis supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation marks omitted). We review the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision. <em>Id. </em>To conclude that the IJ should be reversed, we \u201cmust find that the record not only supports that conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir.2002) (citation and quotation marks omitted). To the extent the IJ\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">In his oral decision the IJ initially referred to Susa-Valencia\u2019s testimony as \u201cillogical and ... inconsistent in significant parts,\u201d and, as a result, found her credibility \u201csignificantly diminished.\u201d However, the IJ further found that, \u201cunder the circumstances of this case, the <em>lack of credibility of this respondent, </em>and the absence of reliable supporting documents to support her case, ... a reasonable person in [Susa-Valencia\u2019s] situation would not fear returning to Colombia for any of the five statutory grounds.\u201d (Emphasis added). Based on this latter statement, we are not \u201cleft in the dark\u201d as to whether or not the IJ found Susa-Valencia credible. <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005) (citation and quotation marks omitted). We therefore consider whether the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was supported by substantial evidence. In making this determination, the IJ pointed to inconsistencies both within Susa-Valencia\u2019s testimony and between her testimony and supporting documentation. The IJ also rejected Susa-Valencia\u2019s explanations for some of her actions as illogical. We readily conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-13\">Because the denial of asylum cannot be based solely on an adverse credibility finding if the applicant offered \u201cother evidence of persecution,\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287, we next consider whether the IJ\u2019s finding that Susa-Valencia was not eligible for asylum was supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-14\">We find that Susa-Valencia has not satisfied her burden of showing that the IJ\u2019s finding was not supported by substantial evidence. Her reliance on the telephonic death threat to establish past persecution fails because this threat does not \u201crise to the level of past persecution that would compel reversal of the IJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005). As to a well-founded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>fear of persecution, the IJ recognized that Susa-Valencia would understandably be concerned about returning if the attempt by the FARC to harm her at the meeting was true. However, he rejected this testimony as not credible. Although SusaValencia claimed that she feared death if she returned, her willingness to continue the activities that caused her to come to the attention of the FARC because she liked politics supports the IJ\u2019s finding that she would not fear returning to Colombia on account of a protected basis. Because Susa-Valencia failed to present credible testimony or reliable documentary evidence, the record does not compel the conclusion that she had an objectively reasonable fear of persecution. Furthermore, the evidence of the FARC\u2019s activities in Colombia that Susa-Valencia cites to show that she could not reasonably relocate does not appear in the administrative record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because our review is limited by the administrative record, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A), and Susa-Valencia failed to point to evidence in the administrative record, she cannot meet her burden to show that the record compels reversal of the IJ\u2019s finding that she could reasonably relocate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">Because Susa-Valencia cannot establish eligibility for asylum on the merits, she cannot meet the more stringent standard required for withholding of removal under the INA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1288 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">In light of the foregoing, we dismiss the petition in part for lack of jurisdiction and otherwise deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b965-18\">. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b967-9\">. Susa-Valencia does not raise any challenge in her brief to the denial of CAT relief, thereby abandoning the issue. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1286 n. 3 (11th Cir. 2003). Accordingly, this issue is not discussed further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b968-4\">. Susa-Valencia also challenges the IJ's finding regarding her ability to reasonably relocate as erroneous on the ground that the relocation requirement is unconstitutional. Although brought as a constitutional challenge, Susa-Valencia essentially seeks to either not be required to show that she is unable to relocate, or to have the IJ\u2019s relocation finding reevaluated. Susa-Valencia never raised this claim before the BIA, which could have afforded her the relief she seeks on appeal. Due to her failure to exhaust administrative remedies, we lack jurisdiction over this claim. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Sundar v. I.N.S., </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2003). Accordingly, Susa-Valencia's petition is due to be dismissed, in part, for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b968-16\">. We have recently held that the 1999 and 2000 U.S. Department of State\u2019s country reports on Colombia compel the conclusion that relocation in Colombia was not a viable option. <em>Arboleda v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>434 F.3d 1220, 1224-25 (11th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232 n. 7). Even if we were to find that the 2003 country report does not provide substantial evidence to support the IJ's relocation finding, because Susa-Valencia could not demonstrate past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution, this finding would not change the outcome of this case. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232 n. 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b968-17\">. We reject the government\u2019s contention that Susa-Valencia did not exhaust her administrative remedies as to this claim by failing to sufficiently raise it before the BIA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
