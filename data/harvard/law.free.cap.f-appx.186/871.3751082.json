Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531,159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), effectively overturned <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and thereby rendered his sentence unconstitutional;</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">2) The felon-in-possession statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), is facially invalid; and</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">3) The district court erred in enhancing his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">Appellant\u2019s first challenge is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267,1273 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">Appellant\u2019s second challenge is foreclosed by several of our decisions, including <em>United States v. Scott, </em>263 F.3d 1270, 1272 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-15\">We do not consider appellant\u2019s third challenge because, under the plea agreement he executed and as the district court found, appellant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b904-12\">.

Appellant was subject to an enhanced prison sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), to-wit: a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years and a maximum sentence of life. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(a), a defendant who is subject to an enhanced sentence under \u00a7 924(e) is an armed career criminal. Based on appellant's total offense level of 31 and his criminal history category of VI, the Guidelines prescribed a range of imprisonment of 188 to 235 months. According to the judgment it entered after imposing sentence, the district court sentenced appellant to a term of 168 months \"with credit for time served in Florida State custody on related offenses.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
