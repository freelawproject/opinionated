Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-25\">Benavides claims that his sentence was unreasonable. After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines, but still must calculate and consider the guideline range as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). We will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it is both reasonable and within the statutorily prescribed range. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-26\">The district court properly calculated the sentencing guideline range of thirty-three to forty-one months\u2019 imprisonment. As Benavides\u2019 sentence is within the properly calculated guideline range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.2006). Benavides has not rebutted that presump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>tion as the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, considered the guideline range, and weighed the relevant factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
