He appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition, arguing that his sentence was illegal because it was based on facts not submitted to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Davis argues that his claims should be allowed to proceed under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Davis\u2019s argument is unavailing in light of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b511-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
