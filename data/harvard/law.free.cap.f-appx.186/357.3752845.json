At resentencing the district court continued to apply a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 (2003). Simmons received a fifty-seven month term of imprisonment. On appeal, Simmons argues that the district court erred in applying the enhancement for obstruction of justice. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-15\">On appeal, Simmons primarily focuses on whether the obstruction of justice enhancement was applicable when he was arrested despite the fact that he gave officers a false identification. He also argues that the district court did not make a factual finding that providing a false identification significantly hindered the investigation or prosecution of his case. The Government replies that at the resentencing it incorporated and adopted the factual findings from the first sentencing hearing at which the court made the necessary findings to apply the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-16\">Simmons was indicted on the fraud charge in March 2002. An agent working on the matter, Darrell Watkins, testified that the agents working the case began looking for Simmons soon after the indictment issued. In summer or early fall 2002, a cooperating witness informed Watkins that he spotted Simmons driving an automobile in North Charleston, South Carolina. The North Charleston police were dispatched to Simmons\u2019 location and interrogated Simmons. He produced an identification for Anthony Brown. Because Simmons produced another identification, the police let him leave the scene after they took a photograph of him. Police posted the photograph on Crimestoppers, in newspapers, and on television. Watkins continued to interview witnesses and otherwise continued the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-17\">Another cooperating witness informed Watkins that Simmons was living in Sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>ter, South Carolina, with Kashawn Dray-ton. Investigators called the Sumter police department. Sumter notified Watkins that they had a search warrant for Dray-ton\u2019s residence. In December 2002, Watkins accompanied the local officers to serve the federal warrants on Simmons and Drayton. At the residence, Simmons again identified himself as Anthony Brown and produced an identification card for Brown. Drayton was arrested at the same time on a federal complaint for conspiracy in the fraud for which Simmons was indicted. She later broke down and told officers that they had the right individual, and that Simmons falsely identified himself as Brown. On the day of his arrest, Simmons later properly identified himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">At the first sentencing hearing, the court imposed the obstruction enhancement stating that \u201cthe defendant [] has the problem with the Anthony Brown identification twice, and after being questioned by the North Charleston Police and after being served with a warrant, he still persisted in being Anthony Brown in an effort to not be arrested and processed.\u201d At the second sentencing hearing, the court heard the Government\u2019s position as to the two instances, found that the two instances were connected, and held that giving a false statement to a law enforcement officer, when the purpose of the interaction is to arrest the individual, is obstruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Section 3C1.1 directs a sentencing court to increase a defendant\u2019s offense level by two levels if the defendant \u201cwillfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and the obstructive conduct related to the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct.\u201d <em>United, States v. Hudson, </em>272 F.3d 260, 263 (4th Cir.2001) (citing USSG \u00a7 3C1.1 (subdividing letters and numbers omitted)). The Application Notes for \u00a7 3C1.1 explain that \u201cproviding a materially false statement to a law enforcement officer that significantly obstructed or impeded the official investigation or prosecution of the instant offense\u201d amounts to the type of conduct for which the enhancement applies. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3C1.1, cmt. n. 4(g). Further, this court held in <em>Hudson, </em>272 F.3d at 263, that the district court erred by failing to apply USSG \u00a7 3C1.1 when the defendant, who was released on bond pending sentencing, failed to appear for scheduled meetings with his probation officer and actively eluded police for more than six months while using aliases and false identification. While Simmons did not fail to appear for probation meetings as Hudson did, his use of the Brown identification when he was stopped in summer or early fall of 2002 resulted in a delay of at least a few months prior to his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">However, the USSG \u00a7 3C1.1 Application Notes also state that \u201cproviding a false name or identification document at arrest, except where such conduct actually resulted in a significant hindrance to the investigation or prosecution of the instant offense\u201d and \u201cmaking false statements, not under oath, to law enforcement officers\u201d are examples of conduct which does not merit the enhancement for obstruction. USSG \u00a7 3C1.1 cmt. n. 5(a), (b). Because Simmons\u2019 conduct did not involve a single instance of providing false identification at the time of arrest only,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and his conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>resulted in a significant delay in his arrest, it was not error for the district court to conclude that Simmons\u2019 conduct constituted obstruction of justice under the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">We therefore affirm the sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b391-7\"> The fact that the police arrested Simmons at the time that the search warrant was executed at Drayton\u2019s residence, when he presented the Brown identification a second time is irrelevant, because the enhancement applies to attempted, as well as actual, obstruction. <em>See United States v. Hicks, </em>948 F.2d 877, 884-85 (4th Cir. 1991); <em>see also United States v. La</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number><em>gasse, </em>87 F.3d 18, 24 (1st Cir.19.96) (enhancement applied where witness intimidated prior to sentencing even though he had nothing to contribute to the sentencing process); <em>United States v. Cotts, </em>14 F.3d 300, 307-08 (7th Cir. 1994) (finding enhancement proper where defendant plotted to kill a fictional informant).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
