Yue asserts the district court erred in: (1) assessing a two-level increase in her offense level for employing sophisti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>cated means, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C); (2) assessing a two-level increase in her offense level for obstruction of justice, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1; and (3) denying her a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). The district court did not err, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review sentences for reasonableness. Nevertheless, the district court must calculate the Sentencing Guidelines correctly. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005). <em>Post-Booker, </em>we review the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines under the same standards as we did pr <em>e-Booker, </em>namely, that the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo and factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>Id. </em>at 1177-78. It is necessary to determine, utilizing pr <em>e-Booker </em>precedent, whether the district court correctly interpreted and applied the Guidelines to determine the appropriate advisory Guideline range. <em>See id. </em>at 1178. Here, Yue makes no argument as to the reasonableness of her sentence, and only argues whether the Guidelines range was calculated correctly. Thus, we will only address this aspect of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">A. <em>Sophisticated Means</em></p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">Two levels are added to a defendant\u2019s base offense level if the offense involved \u201csophisticated means.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C). \u201cSophisticated means\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-8\">especially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of an offense. For example, in a telemarketing scheme, locating the main office of the scheme in one jurisdiction but locating soliciting operations in another jurisdiction ordinarily indicates sophisticated means. Conduct such as hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore financial accounts also ordinarily indicates sophisticated means.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.8(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">Although we have not fully delineated what qualifies as \u201csophisticated means,\u201d we have held \u201csophisticated means involves more than minimal planning.\u201d <em>United States v. Humber, </em>255 F.3d 1308, 1314 (11th Cir.2001) (holding \u201csophisticated means\u201d and the now-defunct \u201cmore than minimal planning\u201d enhancements could be applied cumulatively).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-12\">Based on the repetition and complexity of Yue\u2019s scheme, the district court did not err in applying the enhancement. While working as an office manager for Dr. Karen Chason, Yue used Dr. Chason\u2019s financial and personal, information to (1) open new credit accounts in Dr. Chason\u2019s name, (2) access and use Dr. Chason\u2019s existing credit accounts, and (3) access money held in Dr. Chason\u2019s bank account. Additionally, Yue would impersonate Dr. Chason to pick up merchandise and to receive plastic surgery paid for by Dr. Chason, as well as use Dr. Chason\u2019s identity to order prescription pain killers for her drug counselor. Yue also went to great lengths to conceal her activity, including blaming other people and opening Dr. Chason\u2019s mail. This conduct, in the aggregate, is a sophisticated scheme both to commit fraud and avoid detection. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.8(B)). Therefore, we affirm the district court as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>B. <em>Obstruction of Justice</em></p>\n<p id=\"ALi\">If (A) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct related to (i) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (ii) a closely related offense, increase the offense level by 2 levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. The conduct resulting in obstruction varies \u201cwidely in nature, degree of planning, and seriousness.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n.3). Examples of conduct where \u00a7 3C1.1 applies include when the defendant commits perjury, provides \u201cmaterially false information to a judge or magistrate,\u201d or provides \u201cmaterially false information to a probation officer in respect to a presentence or other investigation for the court.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n.4 (b), (f), and (h)). An example of conduct where \u00a7 3C1.1 does not apply, but may warrant a greater sentence within the otherwise applicable Guideline range, is when the defendant provides \u201cincomplete or misleading information, not amounting to a material falsehood, in respect to a presentence investigation.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.5(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">\u201cTo justify an enhancement under Section 3C1.1, the defendant must act willfully, which has been interpreted to mean the defendant must consciously act with the purpose of obstructing justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Revel, </em>971 F.2d 656, 661 (11th Cir.1992) (quotations and citation omitted). A material statement is one \u201cthat, if believed, would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n.6). The threshold for materiality is low. <em>United States v. Dedeker, </em>961 F.2d 164, 167 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">Perjury, for purposes of obstruction of justice, is defined as giving \u201cfalse testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\u201d <em>See United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 1116, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993), <em>abrogated on other grounds, United States v. Wells, </em>519 U.S. 482, 117 S.Ct. 921, 137 L.Ed.2d 107 (1997). \u201cThis provision is not intended to punish a defendant for the exercise of a constitutional right\u201d such as the right to refuse to admit guilt, and \u201cthe court should be cognizant that inaccurate testimony or statements sometimes may result from confusion, mistake, or faulty memory, and, thus, not all inaccurate testimony or statements necessarily reflect a willful attempt to obstruct justice.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">The district court did not err in enhancing Yue\u2019s sentence based on obstruction of justice when Yue gave false information about her educational background. First, despite Yue\u2019s arguments that the misrepresentations were not willful, there is no indication it was based on confusion, mistake, or faulty memory. <em>See Dunnigan, </em>113 S.Ct. at 1116; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n.2). Second, the misrepresentation was material. The record supports that the magistrate relied, at least in part, on Yue\u2019s representations concerning her education when he determined Yue\u2019s pretrial detention. Yue further lied about her education to the district court under oath during the plea colloquy. Further, this misrepresentation went beyond merely \u201cincomplete or misleading information, not amounting to a material falsehood, in respect to a presentence investigation.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.5(e)). Thus, we affirm the district court as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>C. <em>Acceptance of Responsibility</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">\u201cThe district court is in a unique position to evaluate whether a defendant has accepted responsibility for [her] acts, and this determination is entitled to great deference on review. Unless a court\u2019s determination is without foundation, it should not be overturned on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Pritchett, </em>908 F.2d 816, 824 (11th Cir.1990). \u201cA district court\u2019s determination that a defendant is not entitled to acceptance of responsibility will not be set aside unless the facts in the record clearly establish that a defendant has accepted personal responsibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Sawyer, </em>180 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Section 3E1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides \u201c[i]f the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for [her] offense, decrease the offense level by 2 levels.\u201d \u201cThe defendant bears the burden of clearly demonstrating acceptance of responsibility and must present more than just a guilty plea.\u201d <em>Sawyer, </em>180 F.3d at 1323. Adjustment is not warranted where the defendant falsely denied relevant conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.l(a)). Moreover, \u201c[c]onduct resulting in an enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) ordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for [her] criminal conduct. There may, however, be extraordinary cases in which adjustments under both \u00a7\u00a7 3C1.1 and 3E1.1 may apply.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.4). A defendant is not entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility if she acknowledges responsibility for the offense but continued criminal conduct. <em>United States v. Villarino, </em>930 F.2d 1527, 1530 (11th Cir.1991). Further, an admission of involvement in the crime alone does not necessarily amount to an affirmative acceptance of responsibility. <em>See United States v. Shores, </em>966 F.2d 1383, 1388 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">Contrary to Yue\u2019s assertions, the district court expressly denied the reduction for acceptance of responsibility because she continued her deceptive behavior of lying about her educational background. Yue was required to do more than just plead guilty, and the district court found she actively lied to the court while the case was ongoing. <em>See Villarino, </em>930 F.2d at 1530. In addition, since Yue received an enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 3C1.1, she is generally not entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.4). Thus, since the facts in the record do not clearly establish Yue was entitled to acceptance of responsibility and the district court\u2019s decision is entitled to great deference, we hold the district court did not clearly err.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">The district court did not err in imposing the sophisticated means and obstruction of justice enhancements, or in denying an acceptance of responsibility reduction. Since all of Yue\u2019s Guideline issues fail, and Yue raises no argument that her sentence was unreasonable, we affirm Yue\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
