Chapa argues that, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), his sentence must be vacated because it was enhanced on the basis of judicial factual findings. Specifically, he challenges the increase in his base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-22\">Chapa concedes that he did not raise a constitutional challenge to his sentence before the district court and that review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). The district court did commit <em>Booker </em>error because Chapa\u2019s sentence was enhanced based on facts not alleged in the indictment or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. 738. However, Chapa fails to meet his burden of showing that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>521. Chapa has not identified anything in the record indicating that the district court would have imposed a lower sentence under an advisory guidelines scheme. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b506-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
