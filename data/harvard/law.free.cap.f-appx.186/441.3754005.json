Franco challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The Government argues that the waiver provision in Franco\u2019s plea agreement precludes his attack on the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b) and that, as a result of the waiver, Franco lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b). We assume, <em>arguendo </em>only, that the waiver does not bar the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">Franco\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Franco contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Franco properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b474-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
