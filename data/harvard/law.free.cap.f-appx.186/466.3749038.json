Lopez, federal prisoner # 56053-079, appeals the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition, in which he challenged the way the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is crediting the time he has served on a 72-month federal sentence and a 240-month federal sentence. Lopez argues that the BOP should back date the commencement of his 240-month sentence to coincide with the date he began serving his 72-month sentence. He contends that because the offenses are related, he can serve no more than the 240-month sentence imposed as a result of his second conviction. He argues that by refusing to credit the time he has served on his 72-month sentence toward the service of his 240-month sentence, his' punishment for those offenses is being illegally cumulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">To the extent that Lopez attempts to raise claims cognizable in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain them. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255. Accordingly, Lopez is not entitled to relief based on those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">With regard to his remaining claims, Lopez has not shown that the district court erred by denying his \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(a) &amp; (b). Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b498-36\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
