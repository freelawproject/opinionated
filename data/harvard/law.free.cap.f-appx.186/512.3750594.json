The district court departed from the Sentencing Guidelines to sentence Harris to 24 months of imprisonment, twice the 12-month maximum under the Guidelines, on the ground that Harris\u2019s criminal history score underrepresented the likelihood of repeated criminal wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-21\">We review \u201cboth the decision to depart and the extent of that departure for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Desselle, </em>450 F.3d 179, 182 (5th Cir.2006). The district court did not abuse its discretion by departing on grounds that Harris has repeatedly committed the same type of crime, Harris was on supervised release for that same crime, and prior sentences have failed to deter Harris\u2019s criminal conduct. <em>See United States v. De Luna-Trujillo, </em>868 F.2d 122, 125 (5th Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 328 (5th Cir.2004). Moreover, the 12-month departure was not an abuse of discretion; we have affirmed greater departures on similar grounds. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 491-92 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 713, 163 L.Ed.2d 543 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b544-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
