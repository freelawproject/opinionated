Hernandez-Martinez challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense- that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The Government argues that the waiver provision in Hernandez-Martinez\u2019s plea agreement precludes his attack on the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b). We assume, <em>arguendo </em>only, that the waiver does not bar the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-23\">Hernandez-Martinez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>AlmendarezTorres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Hernandez-Martinez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Hernandez-Martinez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b482-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
