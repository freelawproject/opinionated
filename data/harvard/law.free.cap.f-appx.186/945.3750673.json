After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">On May 30, 2005, the United States Coast Guard (\u201cUSCG\u201d) spotted a \u201cgo-fast\u201d boat alongside a fishing vessel in international waters off the coast of Ecuador. After the two vessels separated, the go-fast boat appeared dead in the water. When the USCG launched an inflatable boat to conduct a boarding, the go-fast boat attempted to escape. A USCG helicopter fired warning shots, which caused the go-fast boat to stop. Before jumping overboard, the four crew members of the go-fast boat were observed removing their clothing, throwing cargo overboard and attempting to set the boat on fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-13\">The crew was apprehended, including Defendant Solim\u00e1n. A total of approximately 118 bales of cocaine, weighing approximately 2,676 kilograms, were recovered from the go-fast boat and the surrounding waters. Solim\u00e1n received approximately $4,400 for his participation in the drug smuggling scheme. Solim\u00e1n pled guilty to both counts without a plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-14\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) set Soliman\u2019s base offense level at 38, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l), based on the 2,676 kilograms of cocaine found on the go-fast boat. With a total offense level of 33 and a criminal history category of I, the PSI recommended an advisory Guidelines range of 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-15\">At sentencing, Solim\u00e1n argued that he was entitled to a minor role reduction. The district court overruled Soliman\u2019s objection, noting that Solim\u00e1n was being held accountable for only the amount of drugs found on the go-fast boat, which was a significant amount, and that Soliman\u2019s role was the same as his crewmates, except for the captain.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-16\">Solim\u00e1n asked for a sentence below the advisory Guidelines range, noting, among other things, that one of his co-defendant\u2019s offense level had been reduced by one level because he had signed a plea agreement. The district court responded that Soliman\u2019s co-defendant\u2019s appeal waiver justified the reduction. Solim\u00e1n asked the district court to consider the same reduction for him to avoid a sentencing disparity-</p>\n<p id=\"b978-17\">The court adopted the PSI\u2019s facts and Guidelines calculations. Before the sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>tenee was imposed, Solim\u00e1n asked whether the district court would consider \u201cdeparting down one level\u201d if Solim\u00e1n agreed to waive his right to appeal. The district court responded, \u2018You know, I\u2019m somewhat hesitant to do that because it\u2019s not in writing anywhere. And ... [Soliman\u2019s co-defendant] enter[ed] into a plea agreement, and included in the plea agreement was the waiver of the right to appeal. So ... I would not consider doing that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">The district court then sentenced Solim\u00e1n to concurrent 135-month sentences, noting that it had considered the advisory Guidelines and the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-6\">I think if there\u2019s any reason for these high sentences, and [the government] has put [its] finger on it, it\u2019s deterrence and protection of the public from this large amount of drugs. So, I would find that there\u2019s not a reason to go beneath the advisory guidelines pursuant to [\u00a7 ] 3553.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">Solim\u00e1n appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">Solim\u00e1n argues that the district court erred by failing to grant him a minor role reduction. We review for clear error a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s qualification for a role reduction. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc). The defendant has the burden of establishing his role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 939. Two principles guide a district court\u2019s consideration: (1) the court must compare the defendant\u2019s role in the offense with the relevant conduct attributed to him in calculating his base offense level; and (2) the court may compare the defendant\u2019s conduct to that of other participants involved in the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 940-45. When the relevant conduct attributed to a defendant is identical to his actual conduct, he cannot prove that he is entitled to a minor-role adjustment simply by pointing to some broader scheme for which he was not held accountable. <em>Id. </em>at 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">The district court did not clearly err in refusing Solim\u00e1n a minor role reduction. Under the first prong of <em>De Varon, </em>the district court held Solim\u00e1n accountable for only the 2,676 kilograms of cocaine found on the go-fast boat. As to the second prong of <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>the record indicates that Solim\u00e1n was at least as culpable as his crewmates, all of whom attempted to throw the cocaine from the boat and set the boat on fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-12\">Solim\u00e1n also argues that his 135-month concurrent sentences are unreasonable under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). After <em>Booker, </em>a district court, in determining a reasonable sentence, must consider the correctly calculated sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines and the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 258-64, 125 S.Ct. at 764-67; <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). We review a defendant\u2019s sentence for unreasonableness in light of the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) and the reasons given by the district court. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1354-55 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-13\">Soliman\u2019s sentences are not unreasonable. The 135-month concurrent sentences are at the low end of the Guidelines range and well below the statutory maximum of life imprisonment. The district court indicated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and explained that it was not granting Soliman\u2019s request for a below-Guidelines sentence because of the need for deterrence and to protect the public in cases involving large amounts of drugs. Indeed, Soliman\u2019s offenses in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>volved <em>2,676 kilograms of cocaine. </em>Contrary to Soliman\u2019s assertion, the district court also considered Soliman\u2019s argument regarding the lesser sentence of Soliman\u2019s co-defendant, but chose not to accept it. The district court need not consider every \u00a7 3553(a) factor explicitly and \u201cexpound upon how each factor played a role in its sentence decision.\u201d <em>United, States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2005). The district court\u2019s acknowledgment that it considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is sufficient. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Soliman\u2019s 135-month concurrent sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b980-16\">. In his appellate brief, Solim\u00e1n attempts to adopt the arguments raised by his codefendant, Manual Estupinan, in Estupinan's separate appeal. Because Estupinan is not a party to this Soliman\u2019s appeal, Soliman\u2019s attempt to adopt Estupian\u2019s arguments is ineffective. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
