On appeal, he argues that the district court committed clear error when it calculated drug quantities for sentencing and that his sentence was imposed in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-19\">Abusaid pled not guilty to both of the charges listed above, and after representing himself <em>pro se </em>with the assistance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>back-up counsel, a jury found him guilty after an eight-day trial on both counts as charged in a superseding indictment. Following trial, a presentence investigation report (PSI) was filed, stating that undercover agents, officers, and confidential sources conducted 18 undercover operations within \u201cAV-02,\u201d Abusaid\u2019s club, and made controlled purchases of a total of 184 MDMA tablets. However, based largely on the trial testimony of Hoang Van Bui, a drug dealer at \u201cAV-02,\u201d and information provided by Martin Camano, Bui\u2019s \u201crunner\u201d inside the club, the PSI attributed a marijuana equivalency of 1,950 kilograms of MDMA (15,600 tablets) to Abusaid as to Count 1 for a base offense level of 32, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e)(4). The PSI based that calculation on a factual proffer Bui gave to Drug Enforcement Administration agents, indicating that he had sold approximately 200 MDMA tablets per weekend at AV-02 over a year and a half (78-week) period. However, pursuant to \u00a7 2D1.8(a)(2), applicable to those who rent or manage a drug establishment, Abusaid\u2019s offense level could be no higher than 26 because he had no other participation in the underlying controlled substance offense than allowing the use of his premises, and the otherwise applicable four-level reduction would not provide for a lower offense level. Abusaid also received a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, for a total offense level of 28. The calculations as to Count 2 are not relevant because Count 1 provided for the higher of the two total offense levels, even after a multiple count adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4. Abusaid was found to be in criminal history category III, which at offense level 28, provided a recommended sentencing range of 97-124 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">Abusaid filed several objections to the PSI, only two of which are relevant to this appeal. First, Abusaid challenged the credibility of Bui and argued that his trial testimony was unreliable. In a letter outlining his objections, Abusaid argued that Bui\u2019s claims and statements should be disregarded because: (1) Bui\u2019s trial testimony was different from his testimony to a grand jury; (2) Bui had been examined by a doctor, who found that Bui\u2019s recent memory was impaired and that Bui suffered from \u201cReactive Attachment Disorder\u201d (RAD), causing him to he; and (3) Bui had filed a motion in his own criminal proceedings seeking a 10-level downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 because of \u201cSevere Childhood Trauma, Extraordinarily Difficult Cultural Adjustment, and Resulting Reactive Attachment Disorder.\u201d Moreover, Abusaid argued that, during his cross-examination of Bui at trial, Bui had admitted that he wanted to be released and that the government held the key to his freedom. Based on Bui\u2019s alleged unreliability, Abusaid argued that the drug quantity attributed to him, based solely on Bui\u2019s trial testimony and not a special verdict form submitted to the jury, was incorrect and that he should be held accountable for less than 184 MDMA tablets.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">Relevant to Abusaid\u2019s objections, Bui testified during Abusaid\u2019s trial, and admitted that he recently had been sentenced to 96 months\u2019 imprisonment for distribution of MDMA. Bui further admitted that he had several prior felony convictions and that his testimony was being offered in the hope that the government would move to reduce his sentence. Bui then identified Abusaid as the owner of AV-02, and testified that he sold ecstasy at AV-02 for approximately two years leading up to his arrest. Bui testified that when he first began selling ecstasy at AV-02, he was not the \u201cmain guy,\u201d but that after approxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>mately one year, he became viewed as the primary drug distributor there.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">On one occasion, Abusaid caught Bui conducting an obvious drug deal, and had him removed from the premises. Within a week, Bui returned to AV-02, was never again told that he was unwelcome there, and continued to sell drugs there until his arrest. Bui testified that, on a good weekend, he could sell approximately 800 pills of ecstasy at $20-$30 per pill. In addition to drug dealings, Bui testified that he helped perform other duties at Abusaid\u2019s club, including helping with security at the front door, and, although Bui was not a paid employee, no one ever told him that his assistance was unwanted or unneeded. Bui also testified that he communicated with other employees of the club via two-way radios. For assistance, Bui relied on Martin Camano, whose responsibility, among other things, was to distribute ecstasy within the club.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">Bui testified that, on three or four occasions, he gave Abusaid ecstasy pills free of charge, \u201clike a gift,\u201d and, additionally, paid Abusaid $100 to $200 on about 10 occasions \u201cto keep him off our back\u201d and to \u201coverlook some stuff that we do,\u201d specifically, selling ecstasy. Bui also paid other AV-02 employees, mostly security guards. On occasion, Bui stated that he would be mistaken as the owner of the club because he had made a \u201cname\u201d for himself there, and was known as the \u201cbean man,\u201d meaning ecstasy dealer. On other occasions, people would show up at the front door specifically asking for Bui, which Bui learned from both security and Abusaid himself. Abusaid confronted Bui about people asking specifically for him and told Bui that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t look good\u201d because people were showing up at AV-02, purchasing drugs from Bui, and leaving the club without spending money at the club.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">On cross-examination, Bui testified that, more than anything else, he wished to be out of jail. He further testified that, preceding his arrest for distributing MDMA, Bui sold 100 MDMA pills for $1,500 to a detective, and one week later, was contacted regarding a sale of 500 pills for $6,750. The last sale was never consummated because Bui was arrested. At the time of Bui\u2019s arrest, an additional 115 MDMA pills were discovered in his vehicle. Bui then stated that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office had \u201cthe key to the gate\u201d that would permit Bui to go home. However, Bui testified that he did not have any belief or hope that he would be going home anytime soon.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">As part of his sentencing, Abusaid included several exhibits relating to Bui, including Bui\u2019s grand jury testimony, in which he testified that he first began selling ecstasy outside of AV-02 because it was a place that catered to ecstasy users. Initially, Bui was able to \u201cmove\u201d a significant number of pills outside the club in the parking lot. Within the year, Bui moved his sales inside the club, and former clients would approach him and introduce him to other people interested in purchasing pills. Bui testified that he tipped others in the club, including security and the \u201cwater girls,\u201d and occasionally provided free drugs to the employees. Bui testified that he \u201cspent a lot of money at the club,\u201d and there were times when \u201cone hand washes the other.\u201d Bui further testified that he gave Abusaid ecstasy pills two or three times. At its peak, Bui testified that he was selling between 300 to 400 pills a night at $20 to $30 per pill, and that he could sell 300 pills on a Friday night and sell nearly the same amount on Saturday night as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">Also submitted was a motion for a downward departure, submitted by Bui at his own sentencing for distribution of MDMA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>and seeking a 10-level downward adjustment based on severe childhood trauma, difficult cultural adjustment, and resulting RAD. In support of the motion, Bui was examined by a licensed social worker and found to be oriented to person, place, time, and his current situation, but his \u201crecent memory\u201d appeared to be \u201csomewhat impaired.\u201d In short, Bui was diagnosed as suffering from RAD, which resulted in such difficulties as engaging in \u201cintensive lying even when caught in the act\u201d and \u201chabitual dissociation,\u201d in which Bui often stated that he was \u201cnot sure what was real in his past and needed others to help substantiate it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Based on the foregoing, Abusaid argued at his sentencing hearing that Bui\u2019s estimates of how many phis he distributed at AV-02 should not be considered because Bui, based on the RAD diagnosis, suffered from impaired memory and diminished mental capacity. Abusaid further pointed out that Bui had sought a substantial downward departure based on his mental condition, and also argued that Bui\u2019s grand jury testimony conflicted with his trial testimony regarding the number of pills sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">Abusaid further argued that Bui\u2019s grand jury testimony overestimated the amount of pills sold per night, as rebutted by other trial testimony. Next, Abusaid argued that Bui\u2019s grand jury testimony indicated that he was able to sell drugs outside the club, which he argued was contrary to a lawsuit Abusaid had filed to keep the Tampa Police Department from infringing on his parking lots and hurting his business\u2014 the inference being that, with such a large police presence, Bui could not have been as successful selling pills as he claimed to be. Abusaid then highlighted Bui\u2019s diagnosis and the accompanying symptoms, most notably the impaired memory and penchant for lying, and argued that Bui\u2019s recollection of events was not supported by other evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">The court overruled Abusaid\u2019s objections to the drug quantity and found that testimony in the record and the jury\u2019s verdict supported the findings in the PSI. The court further found that the believability of the witnesses could be inferred from the jury\u2019s verdict because the jury was responsible for evaluating the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be afforded their testimony, and the jury\u2019s finding of guilt supported the PSI with regard to drug quantity. The court did, however, sustain Abusaid\u2019s objection to a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, and, therefore, found that Abusaid\u2019s total offense level was 26. At offense level 26 and criminal history category III, the court found that the guidelines recommended a sentencing range of 78 to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-9\">The court then noted that Abusaid had a lengthy history of criminal activity, indicating that, despite Abusaid\u2019s intelligence and skills, he repeatedly had chosen to become involved in activities detrimental to both himself and others in the community. The court noted that Abusaid\u2019s testimony at trial \u2014 that he was only providing water to people in his club \u2014 insulted the intelligence of the jury, and that, in reality, Abusaid had provided a facility for the operation of drug activity regardless of the negative effect it had on the people attending his club. The court found Abusaid\u2019s intelligence and representation of himself impressive, but noted that his intelligence made the criminal activity worse because it was clear that Abusaid was capable of making money in legitimate ways. Thus, based on a review of the PSI, as modified by <em>Booker </em>to render the guidelines advisory only, the court, upon review of the factors set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>sentenced Abusaid to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment and found that the sentence was sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">I. Drug Quantity</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">On appeal, Abusaid first argues that the district court erred by attributing a drug quantity to him based on the incredible testimony of Bui. Specifically, he argues that the government failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Bui\u2019s challenged estimates were supported by reliable evidence, and submits that he never admitted to any specific amounts and no specific amounts were found by a jury. Next, Abusaid equates his situation to that of co-conspirators, and argues that the amounts specifically attributable to Bui should not be attributable to him because there was no evidence of joint undertaking or proof of an agreement to sell drugs to others. Thus, Abusaid argues that his offense level should be set on the basis of 184 pills, the number actually recovered from AY-02 in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">At sentencing, the government bore the burden of establishing drug quantity by a preponderance of the evidence, and we will reverse only if the sentencing court\u2019s drug determination was made in clear error. <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>168 F.3d 1234, 1247 (11th Cir.1999). A defendant\u2019s base offense level is determined by including \u201call acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Mertilus, </em>111 F.3d 870, 873 (11th Cir.1997); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A). Furthermore, \u201c[wjhere there is no drug seizure or the amount seized does not reflect the scale of the offense, the court shall approximate the quantity of the controlled substance.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.12). To the extent that Abusaid challenges Bui\u2019s credibility as a witness, we have held that the \u201ccredibility of a witness is in the province of the factfinder, and we will not ordinarily review the factfinder\u2019s determination of credibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>415 F.3d 1257, 1267 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1570, 164 L.Ed.2d 305 (2006) (quotations and citation omitted). As we have noted, \u201c[w]e must accept the evidence unless it is contrary to the laws of nature, or is so inconsistent or improbable on its face that no reasonable factfinder could accept it.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">At the outset, we conclude that Abusaid\u2019s brief does not so much challenge the credibility of Bui as it does challenge the reliability of his testimony as evidence of the proper drug quantity. The PSI, concluding that the amount of pills actually seized did not reflect the scale of the offense, used Bui\u2019s testimony and conservatively set a drug quantity by multiplying 200 pills per week by 78 weeks \u2014 the equivalent of one and a half years\u2019 sales \u2014 to arrive at 15,600 MDMA tablets sold. Bui\u2019s testimony at trial indicated that in one weekend, he was capable of selling approximately 800 pills at $20 to $30 per pill. Abusaid never impeached this testimony during his cross-examination, and, in fact, Bui\u2019s grand jury testimony indicated that he was selling between 300 and 400 pills per night on a weekend \u2014 300 on Friday and another 300 on Saturday \u2014 and these numbers do not contradict his trial testimony. In fact, the PSI used a more conservative number than the one Bui proffered at trial \u2014 200 pills per weekend \u2014 which is what he told Drug Enforcement Administration agents during a proffer agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">Moreover, while undercover officers may have purchased only 184 tablets during the course of their investigation, the most in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>culpatory evidence in this case was that Bui paid Abusaid, as well as some of his employees, in order to \u201coverlook\u201d his selling ecstasy and \u201ckeep him off our back.\u201d He further testified that Abusaid, on occasion, would tell Bui that certain individuals were looking for him, presumably to purchase ecstasy. This testimony, which Abusaid also never impeached on cross-examination, was believed by the jury, which convicted Abusaid of knowingly operating a facility for distribution of drugs. Bui\u2019s testimony was strong evidence of that guilt, and despite Bui\u2019s RAD, there is no reason to believe that Bui was lying about his drug sales. The district court made a credibility determination in favor of Bui, and tempered that determination by using a lower, more conservative number than proffered at trial. Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the district court\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">None of Abusaid\u2019s cited cases countenance a different conclusion. He relies most heavily on <em>United States v. Lawrence, </em>47 F.3d 1559 (11th Cir.1995). However, in <em>Lawrence, </em>the district court\u2019s only evidence was the information contained in the PSI and the government\u2019s brief proffer of evidence admitted by the defendants during their Rule 11 colloquies. 47 F.3d at 1568. Here, unlike in <em>Lawrence, </em>the district court had the benefit of an eight-day trial, replete with sworn testimony, most notably Bui\u2019s, on which to base its factual findings regarding drug quantity. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, Abusaid, unlike the defendants in <em>Lawrence, </em>explicitly was given the ability to test the reliability and accuracy of the information provided because he had the opportunity to cross-examine every witness, including Bui, during his trial. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">Furthermore, unlike the cases Abusaid cites, wherein a district court, when determining how many drugs are attributable to co-conspirators, \u201cmust first make individualized findings concerning the scope of criminal activity undertaken by a particular defendant,\u201d <em>see, e.g., United States v. Ismond, </em>993 F.2d 1498, 1498 (11th Cir. 1993), individual findings are not mandated in this case because it is undisputed that Abusaid was not indicted for conspiracy, did not conspire to distribute MDMA, and did not participate in the actual distribution. Abusaid, by receiving a base offense level of 26, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.8(a)(2), was found to have no participation in the underlying controlled substance offense other than allowing use of his premises. However, by knowingly allowing use of his premises for drug distribution and receiving kick-backs or \u201ctips\u201d from Bui for doing so, there is no reason not to attribute to Abusaid the quantity of drugs sold on those premises, as the underlying controlled substance offense was the distribution of MDMA tablets, and Abusaid benefitted from the additional business those sales brought in.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">Abusaid has offered no precedent supporting his argument that only 184 MDMA tablets should be attributed to him. Abusaid relies only on cases where a co-conspirator is improperly made liable for drugs sold (1) in furtherance of the conspiracy, or (2) that are known by the defendant or reasonably foreseeable to him. <em>See, e.g., United States v. North, </em>900 F.2d 131 (8th Cir.1990). As noted above, Abusaid has never been named as a co-conspirator, nor could he have been a co-conspirator and still be eligible for a base offense level of 26, pursuant to \u00a7 2D1.8(a)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.8(a)(2), comment. (n.l). He has cited no cases that support his interpretation of calculating drug quantity in the context of a conviction for knowingly maintaining an establishment for the purpose of unlawfully distributing or using a controlled substance. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court\u2019s factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>findings were not clearly erroneous on the record before it and that the district court\u2019s sentencing calculations were correct with respect to drug quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">II. <em>Booker</em></p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">Next, Abusaid argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment right to a jury by enhancing his sentence on the basis of facts that were not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by him, citing <em>Booker. </em>Abusaid argues that the district court based its sentencing enhancements with respect to drug quantity \u201con the word of witnesses of questionable motives\u201d and that a jury should have determined the drug quantity before the court applied a sentencing enhancement based on the quantity. Thus, he argues that, because his enhancement was incorrectly applied, his sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">Where, as here, Abusaid failed to lodge a constitutional objection to his sentence on grounds that the district court improperly enhanced his sentence in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to a jury, we will review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). \u201cAn appellate court may not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory nature of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of a right to a jury trial. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 231-35, 125 S.Ct. at 749-51. In so doing, the Court reaffirmed its holding in Apprendi:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cAny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244, 125 S.Ct. at 756. To remedy the Sixth Amendment violation inherent in sentencing enhancements based on judicial fact-finding, the Court, in a separate opinion, held that the guidelines were no longer mandatory and binding, advisory only. <em>See id. </em>at 259-60, 125 S.Ct. at 764-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-12\"><em>Post-Booker, </em>we have recognized two possible <em>Booker </em>errors at sentencing: \u201c(1) the constitutional error of using extra-verdict enhancements to reach a Guidelines result that is binding on the sentencing judge and (2) the statutory error of applying the Guidelines in a mandatory fashion.\u201d <em>United States v. Cain, </em>433 F.3d 1345, 1347 (11th Cir.2005). In the present case, neither error is applicable. We have held that, where a district court makes factual findings by a preponderance of the evidence that go beyond the letter of the charges in the indictment, it does not violate a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights so long as the guidelines are applied in an advisory fashion. <em>See United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1324 (11th Cir.2005). Here, the district court recognized that the guidelines were advisory only, and, therefore, any judicial factfinding was not binding on the judge and no constitutional error occurred. Moreover, because the court applied the guidelines in an advisory fashion, no statutory error could have occurred. Accordingly, there was no <em>Booker </em>error of any kind, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err when determining the drug quantity attributable to Abusaid and did not commit any <em>Booker </em>error. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b990-10\">. <em>Apprendi v.
