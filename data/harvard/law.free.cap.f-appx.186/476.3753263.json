Relying on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and its progeny, Jones argues that the sentence imposed by the trial court was illegal because the jury did not find drug type or quantity beyond a reasonable doubt. Insofar as Jones argues that he is entitled to proceed under \u00a7 2241 based on the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because relief under the latter section is \u201cinadequate or ineffective,\u201d such suggestion is unavailing. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Wesson v. U.S. Penitentiary, Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 347-48 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-21\">Jones also argues that the gatekeeping requirements of \u00a7 2255 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 are unconstitutional and impermissibly deny him his constitutional right to file a habeas petition. This argument is also unavailing. <em>See Wesson, </em>305 F.3d at 346-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b508-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm.
