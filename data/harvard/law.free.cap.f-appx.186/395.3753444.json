See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b427-22\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b427-23\">Mirabel Kien Nguti, a native and citizen of Cameroon, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) affirming, without opinion, the immigration judge\u2019s denial of her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Torture.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because the Board affirmed under its streamlined process, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4) (2006), the immigration judge\u2019s decision is the final agency determination. <em>See Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 366 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Nguti challenges the immigration judge\u2019s finding that her testimony was not credible, and that she otherwise failed to meet her burden of proof to qualify for asylum. We will reverse this decision only if the evidence \u201cwas so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotations and citations omitted). We uphold credibility determinations of the immigration judge if they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Tewabe v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 533, 538 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">We have reviewed the administrative record and the immigration judge\u2019s decision and find that substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s credibility finding, as well as his conclusion that Nguti failed to establish the past persecution or well-founded fear of future persecution necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2006) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same). Moreover, as Nguti cannot sustain her burden on the asylum claim, she cannot establish her entitlement to withholding of removal. <em>See Camara, </em>378 F.3d at 367 (\u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b428-6\"> Nguti withdrew her Convention Against Torture claim before the immigration judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
