Diaz was sentenced to 270 months\u2019 imprisonment after pleading guilty to the following three counts of a five-count, superseding indictment: (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B)\u00ae (Count One); (2) carrying a firearm during a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)\u00ae (Count Three); and (3) possession of a firearm by a convicted felon as an armed career criminal, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(e)(1) (Count Five). In his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to the district court, Diaz requested the court to reduce his sentence pursuant to Amendments 489 and 591 of the Sentencing Guidelines. The district court denied the motion because Amendments 489 and 591 were in effect at the time of sentencing and, therefore, the court lacked jurisdiction to consider Diaz\u2019s claim under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-24\">Section 3582(c)(2) is applicable \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o).\u201d The Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendment 489 effective November 1, 1993, and Amendment 591 effective No<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>vember 1, 2000. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amends. 489, 591 (2001). The district court did not err in finding it lacked jurisdiction to review Diaz\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion because both amendments were in effect on Diaz\u2019s January 22, 2002, sentencing date and had already been incorporated into the November 1, 2001, Guidelines used by the sentencing court. Thus, Diaz was not a defendant \u201csentenced based on a sentencing range that was <em>subsequently </em>lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000) (emphasis added). Additionally, although Diaz does not argue any alternative basis for jurisdiction, because of his pro se status, the district court executed a thorough analysis of potential bases of jurisdiction available to Diaz. We conclude the district court did not err in determining that no other statute or rule applied to Diaz\u2019s claim. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Diaz\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
