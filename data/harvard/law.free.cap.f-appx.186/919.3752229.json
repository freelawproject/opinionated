After review, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-23\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b952-24\">Pinckney, a veteran of the United States Army, was honorably discharged in 1990 after he tore a ligament in his knee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time Pinckney was discharged, the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) assessed that Pinckney was twenty percent disabled, meaning that his injuries limited his future earnings by an estimated twenty percent. Ten percent of this rating was assessed on account of Pinckney\u2019s knee injury, while the remaining ten percent related to a back injury Pinckney sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>tained in 1980. Because he was injured during active military service, Pinckney receives disability payments correlated to the twenty percent impairment rating.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">A. Denial of Employment</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">Between 1990 and 1995, Pinckney worked in the private sector without incident, including as a tractor-trailer operator. In 1995, Pinckney applied to the Postal Service in Tampa, Florida for the position of Mail Handler. Pinckney passed the required postal examination with a high score, and the Postal Service placed him on its job register. Pinckney subsequently passed a drug screening, an interview, and a strength and stamina test.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">In October 1995, the Postal Service tentatively selected Pinckney for employment, pending a suitability determination. Due to a Postal Service hiring freeze, Pinckney\u2019s application was delayed until early 1996, when the Postal Service began hiring again. At that time, the Postal Service asked Pinckney to obtain medical clearance before he was placed in the Mail Handler position.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">On April 12, 1996, Pinckney submitted to the Postal Service a letter from Dr. Steven Scott at the James A. Haley Veterans\u2019 Hospital. Scott\u2019s two-sentence letter stated summarily that Pinckney was able to perform all functional requirements of the Mail Handler position as listed by the Postal Service. Laura Henley, a Human Resources Specialist for the Postal Service, received Pinckney\u2019s submission and determined that it was insufficient to establish Pinckney\u2019s functional capacity. Henley instructed Pinckney that he needed to submit additional information, including an independent doctor\u2019s evaluation of his functional capacity from a non-VA doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-13\">After receiving Pinckney\u2019s reply, on May 7, 1996, Pinckney visited Dr. Carlos Lopez at the Tampa Orthopaedic and Sports Medical Center for a pre-employment evaluation. Dr. Lopez examined Pinckney and reviewed Pinckney\u2019s x-rays and other medical records. Based on this examination and review, Dr. Lopez recommended to the Postal Service that Pinckney \u201ccould perform the postal job requirements\u201d of the Mail Handler position, including lifting \u201cmore than 70 pounds.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Lopez also concluded that Pinckney had good coordination, was healing well, and could \u201cwork in any atmosphere\u201d and for \u201cany hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b953-14\">Dr. Lopez remarked, however, that while Pinckney could meet all the functional requirements \u201cwell at this time,\u201d Pinckney \u201chas a greater than a 50% chance of having severe back problems in the near future and requiring [back] surgery.\u201d Dr. Lopez also noted that \u201c[Pinckney\u2019s] knee might hold well, but also the chances of osteoarthritis and requiring surgery are greater on him. Obviously heavy work like lifting, standing, changing positions may be an aggravating factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b953-15\">Henley forwarded Pinckney\u2019s medical submissions to Dr. Felix Vicente, a Postal Service medical officer. Dr. Vicente reviewed Pinckney\u2019s submissions and completed a Postal Service form entitled \u201cMedical Examination &amp; Assessment.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>Dr. Vicente noted Pinckney\u2019s knee and back injuries, and he quoted Dr. Lopez\u2019s statements that Pinckney \u201chas a greater than 50% change of having severe back problems in the near future and requiring surgery\u201d and that \u201cheavy work like lifting, standing, [and] changing positions may be an aggravating factor.\u201d Dr. Vicente assessed that Pinckney had a moderate risk of incurring job-related injury or illness within the next six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">Upon reading Dr. Vicente\u2019s medical opinion, Henley concluded that Pinckney would be unable to perform the duties of the Mail Handler position. In a letter dated May 29, 1996, Henley informed Pinckney that he had \u201cbeen found medically unsuitable for the position of PTR Mail Handler\u201d and that his \u201cname ha[d] been removed from the active register of eligibles.\u201d Henley\u2019s letter explained that \u201c[pjostal employment in this position or any entry position\u201d would endanger Pinckney\u2019s health, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-5\">A review of your medical records and evaluation by our Medical Officer indicates that performance of the duties required of a Mail Handler would be at significant risk of causing severe back problems that would require surgery for stabilization. Under these conditions, <em>Postal employment in this position or any entry position </em>would place your personal health and safety in jeopardy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuL\">Defs\u2019 Exh. 9 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">On June 12, 1996, Pinckney asked the Postal Service to reconsider its decision. Pinckney asserted that he could perform all the duties of the Mail Handler position and submitted a more detailed letter from his VA physician, Dr. Scott. Dr. Scott attested that he had treated Pinckney for three years and had observed and examined him frequently. Dr. Scott\u2019s letter explained that during his evaluation, Pinckney was able to complete a series of physical tests without difficulty, including lifting weights up to seventy pounds and pushing them for fifteen minutes. Dr. Scott concluded that \u201cbased on my observation, and the test that were [sic] performed, Mr. Pinckney can perform all of the functional requirements of the job.\u201d Dr. Scott made no reference to any risks posed by Pinckney performing the Mail Handler position or any future surgery he was likely to require.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">On June 14, 1996, Henley denied Pinckney\u2019s request for reconsideration in a final letter. Henley noted that Pinckney\u2019s medical records showed that in 1994, Pinckney had asked the VA for increased disability benefits, something \u201cunlikely one would attempt ... if there was no deterioration or increase in the symptoms.\u201d Henley also explained that Dr. Lopez\u2019s opinion carried more weight than Dr. Scott\u2019s because Dr. Lopez was an orthopedist. Henley reiterated her conclusion that \u201cperformance of entry level duties would aggravate your condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">B. Subsequent Hiring</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">Following the Postal Service\u2019s final rejection of Pinckney\u2019s application, Pinckney continued his employment as a tractor-trailer operator for a private firm. Roughly four years later, in September 2000, Pinckney reapplied for employment with the Postal Service, this time as a part-time tractor-trailer operator. The Postal Service again requested that Pinckney provide medical information concerning his knee and back conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>Pinckney visited an orthopedist, who examined Pinckney and evaluated Pinckney\u2019s medical records. The orthopedist concluded that Pinckney\u2019s condition was stable and that there was no reason he could not perform the duties of the position. Shortly thereafter, the Postal Service hired Pinckney as a tractor-trailer operator, a position Pinckney has held without incident since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">C. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">In March 1997 \u2014 approximately nine months after Pinckney received Henley\u2019s final rejection letter \u2014 Pinckney contacted an Equal Employment Occupation Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) representative to complain that the Postal Service had discriminated against him. After Pinckney\u2019s complaint was initially dismissed as untimely, Pinckney appealed to the EEOC. The EEOC reversed the dismissal and remanded Pinckney\u2019s complaint to the agency on August 3, 2000. The EEOC issued a final denial of Pinckney\u2019s claim on December 3, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">On February 20, 2003, Pinckney timely filed this civil suit against John Potter, the Postmaster General of the U.S. Postal Service, in the Middle District of Florida. Pinckney\u2019s complaint sought damages and fees pursuant to Section 505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a, for discrimination on the basis of physical handicap. Pinckney contended that the Postal Service wrongly regarded him as disabled and rejected his Mail Handler job application on that unlawful basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">The Postal Service moved for summary judgment, and on June 16, 2005, the district court granted that motion. Pinckney timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">Claims under the Rehabilitation Act are analyzed under the standards applicable to the Americans with Disabilities Act and as set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(d); <em>see also Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, </em>112 F.3d 1522, 1529 (11th Cir. 1997).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under this standard, in order to succeed on his Rehabilitation Act claim, Pinckney must first assert a <em>prima facie </em>case of disability discrimination. More specifically, Pinckney must show that \u201c(1) he has a disability; (2) he is otherwise qualified for the position; and (3) he was subjected to unlawful discrimination as the result of his disability.\u201d <em>Ellis v. England, </em>432 F.3d 1321, 1326 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-12\">A. Disability</p>\n<p id=\"b955-13\">As noted, as the first prong of a <em>prima facie </em>case, a plaintiff must establish that he has a disability. <em>Id. </em>\u201cBeing regarded as\u201d disabled fits under the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s definition of \u201cdisabled.\u201d <em>Cash v. Smith, </em>231 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir.2000) (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2) and 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.3(j)(l)). Here, Pinckney argues that even though he is not actually disabled, he is disabled under the law because the Postal Service erroneously regarded him as disabled and discriminated against him because of that erroneously perceived disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-14\">Where a plaintiff alleges that the defendant regarded him as disabled, he must prove more than that the defendant perceived him to be impaired by his medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>condition. Specifically, to satisfy this first prong, Pinckney must introduce evidence that the Postal Service regarded him to be so impaired or disabled that he was substantially limited in his ability to perform a major life activity. <em>See Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams, </em>534 U.S. 184, 194-95,122 S.Ct. 681, 690,151 L.Ed.2d 615 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">In this case, the sole \u201cmajor life activity\u201d at issue is working. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(i). \u201cTo be substantially limited in the major life activity of working, an individual must be precluded from more than one type of job, even if the job foreclosed is the individual's job of choice.\u201d <em>Cash, </em>231 F.3d at 1306. A person\u2019s inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j)(3)(i); <em>see also Hilburn v. Murata Elec. N. Am., Inc., </em>181 F.3d 1220, 1227 (11th Cir.1999). Rather, \u201c[w]hen the major life activity under consideration is that of working, the statutory phrase \u2018substantially limits\u2019 requires, at a minimum, that plaintiffs allege they are unable to work in a broad class of jobs.\u201d <em>Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>527 U.S. 471, 491, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 2151, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Thus, Pinckney is \u201cdisabled\u201d under the Rehabilitation Act if the Postal Service regarded him as substantially limited in his ability to work in a broad class of jobs. <em>Standard v. A.B.E.L. Services, Inc., </em>161 F.3d 1318, 1327 n. 2 (11th Cir.1998). The Postal Service insists that Pinckney has produced no evidence that it regarded him as unable to perform a broad class of jobs. The Postal Service contends that the evidence presented by Pinckney shows only that the Postal Service regarded Pinckney as unable to perform the specific duties of the 1996 Mail Handler position. In particular, the Postal Service emphasizes that Henley\u2019s May 29,1996 letter denied Pinckney\u2019s job application on the narrow grounds that \u201cperformance of the duties required of a Mail Handler\u201d would place Pinckney \u201cat significant risk\u201d of sustaining a severe back injury requiring surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">Contrary to the Postal Service\u2019s characterization of the evidence, the very letter which it quotes can also be read to suggest that the Postal Service viewed Pinckney as incapable of performing a much wider range of jobs than merely that of Mail Handler. Henley\u2019s May 29, 1996 letter went on to state that in the Postal Service\u2019s view, Pinckney\u2019s back and knee conditions meant that \u201c[pjostal employment in [the Mail Handler] position <em>or any entry position </em>would place your personal health and safety in jeopardy.\u201d (Emphasis added). Henley reiterated this point in her June 14,1996 letter to Pinckney, and again in her deposition, when she stated that \u201c[i]t was my understanding ... that working in this or <em>any of our entry-level positions\u201d </em>would be prohibited by Pinckney\u2019s condition. Henley Dep. at 35 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">Henley\u2019s May 29, 1996 letter and her testimony also suggest that the Postal Service maintained a single list of eligible job applicants that is not job-specific. If so, the fact that the Postal Service removed Pinckney\u2019s name from its \u201clist of eligibles\u201d tends to support Pinckney\u2019s contention that the Postal Service viewed him as unable to perform the entire range of jobs offered by the Postal Service. Indeed, Pinckney himself testified that in 1995 and 1996, he actually applied for three or four positions at the Tampa Post Office, but the Postal Service never definitively reviewed his other applications after he was denied the Mail Handler position.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to Pinckney, Pinckney has presented a question of material fact as to whether the Postal Service in 1996 regarded him as \u201cdisabled.\u201d In particular, construing the evidence in Pinckney\u2019s favor, Pinckney has presented a question of material fact as to whether, in 1996, the Postal Service considered him unable to perform all entry-level positions at the Postal Service and therefore considered him unable to perform a \u201cbroad class of jobs.\u201d <em>Sutton, </em>527 U.S. at 491, 119 S.Ct. at 2151. The record does not limit the range of entry level positions which the Postal Service apparently believed Pinckney unable to perform, nor does it preclude the possibility that the Postal Service rejected Pinckney\u2019s applications for positions other than Mail Handler because it regarded him as unable to perform a wider range of duties than the functional requirements of the Mail Handler position. For that matter, the parties have not defined the functional requirements of the Mail Handler position itself, making it impossible to determine whether they are requirements applicable to a \u201cbroad class of jobs.\u201d Accordingly, factual disputes remain as to whether the Postal Service regarded Pinckney as unable to perform a broad range of jobs and therefore regarded Pinckney as disabled.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">B. Qualified Individual</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">The Postal Service proposes that even if questions of material fact exist as to whether it regarded Pinckney as disabled, we should affirm summary judgment on the alternative grounds that Pinckney failed to show that he was \u201cotherwise qualified for the position.\u201d <em>See Ellis, </em>432 F.3d at 1326. Again, based on the record at this juncture, we conclude that questions of material fact preclude summary judgment on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">A \u201cqualified individual\u201d is an individual who can perform, with or without reasonable accommodation, the essential functions of the employment position that the individual held or desires. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8); <em>Davis v. Fla. Power &amp; Light, Co., </em>205 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir.2000). Thus, if Pinckney is unable to perform (even with accommodation) an essential function of the Mail Handler position, he is not a \u201cqualified individual\u201d covered under the Rehabilitation Act, and he has failed to state a <em>prima facie </em>case. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-11\">An individual is also not a \u201cqualified individual\u201d if, by performing the duties of a given position, he would pose a \u201cdirect threat\u201d to himself. The ADA defines a \u201cdirect threat\u201d as \u201ca significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(3). Regulations have extended the definition of \u201cdirect threat\u201d to include threats to the worker himself. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(r); <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Echazabal, </em>536 U.S. 73, 87, 122 S.Ct. 2045, 2053, 153 L.Ed.2d 82 (2002) (upholding 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(r)).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>The Postal Service contends that Pinckney would have represented a direct threat to his own health and safety were he to work in the position of Mail Handler. The Postal Service points to Dr. Lopez\u2019s statement that Pinckney had \u201ca greater than 50% chance of having severe back problems in the near future and requiring surgery\u201d and that \u201cheavy work like lifting, standing, [and] changing positions\u201d might aggravate his knee. The Postal Service also cites the fact that the VA had found Pinckney\u2019s injuries to impair his earning capacity by 20%.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">However, there is also medical evidence in the record that Pinckney could perform the job without representing a direct threat to himself. Both Dr. Lopez and Dr. Scott opined that Pinckney was able to perform the functional requirements of the Mail Handler position, including lifting over seventy pounds. Although Dr. Lopez suggested that the job might aggravate Pinckney\u2019s knee condition, he did not explicitly classify this as a \u201csignificant risk\u201d to Pinckney\u2019s health or safety, nor did he suggest that Pinckney should be denied the job. More importantly, Dr. Scott explained that he had personally observed Pinckney lifting weights up to seventy pounds and pushing them for fifteen minutes without difficulty, and Dr. Scott made no reference to any potential risks posed by the Mail Handler position. In addition, the record includes no evidence at all as to whether reasonable accommodations to the Mail Handler position could have alleviated any risks, or at least any substantial risks, posed to Pinckney by working as a Mail Handler. Viewed in the light most favorable to Pinckney, factual questions remain as to whether he was \u201ca qualified individual\u201d for the Mail Handler position.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">In conclusion, we reverse and vacate the district court\u2019s order, dated June 16, 2005, granting summary judgment in favor of the Postal Service, and we remand this case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b952-14\">. Pinckney's tom ligament was successfully repaired surgically.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b953-9\">. The Postal Service made this request because VA records informed the Postal Service of Pinckney\u2019s twenty percent disability status.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b953-10\">. The district court\u2019s summary judgment order states that the duties of the Mail Handler position \u201cinclude picking up and carrying seventy pound boxes.\u201d Although both parties do not dispute this seventy pound lifting requirement, no evidence in the record identifies the complete list of functional requirements of the Mail Handler position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b953-17\">. Dr. Vicente\u2019s assessment is not in the record before this Court, although apparently it was an exhibit to Henley's deposition.

We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing all evidence in the light most favorable to Pinckney. <em>Merritt v. Dillard Paper Co., </em>120 F.3d 1181, 1184 (11th Cir. 1997); <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1356, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b956-6\">.

We find unconvincing the district court\u2019s reliance on the fact that the Postal Service hired Pinckney as a tractor-trailer operator in 2000. That the Postal Service did not regard Pinckney as disabled in 2000 says nothing about whether different decision-makers at the Postal Service regarded Pinckney as disabled at the time it rejected his application in 1996. This is especially so given that Henley\u2019s May 29, 1996 rejection letter referred to Pinckney\u2019s incapacity to perform the duties either of the Mail Handler position or of \"any entry position.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b957-13\">. \"Essential functions\u201d are defined as the fundamental duties of a job that a disabled employee actually is required to perform. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(n)(2)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
