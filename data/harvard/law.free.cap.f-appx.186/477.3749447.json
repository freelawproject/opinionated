Maxwell sued Sam Saleh to recover the retainer paid to him to act as defense counsel for Maxwell and his wife; after the payment, Saleh allegedly informed them that he could no longer represent them because he had been elected judge. Maxwell argues that the district court abused its discretion by not notifying him of his complaint\u2019s deficiencies and providing an opportunity to amend. He also argues that his suit was not untimely. He further asserts that the actions of Saleh, and others, were under color of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Attorneys do not act under color of state law when they perform a lawyer\u2019s traditional function as defense counsel in a criminal proceeding. <em>See Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 325, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981). Thus, we need not address Maxwell\u2019s contentions that his \u00a7 1983 complaint was timely because, even if the complaint is timely, Saleh is not a state actor for \u00a7 1983 purposes. Maxwell has shown no error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint without affording him an opportunity to amend. <em>See Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 326-27 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Maxwell\u2019s appeal lacks arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The dismissal of this appeal and the dismissal by the district court count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Maxwell is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). Maxwell\u2019s motion for production of documents is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-14\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b510-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
