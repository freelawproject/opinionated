Parra-Montalvo\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising the argument that the sentence was not reasonable, but stating that he finds no meritorious grounds for appeal. The Government did not file an answering brief, and although advised of his right to do so, Parra-Montalvo did not file a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-26\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. The district court sentenced Parra-Montalvo within the properly calculated sentencing guidelines range, <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 455-56 (4th Cir. 2006), and considered the factors provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005). We find Parra-Montalvo\u2019s sentence of seventy-two months to be reasonable. We therefore affirm his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">This court requires that counsel inform Parra-Montalvo, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Parra-Montalvo requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Parra-Montalvo.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
