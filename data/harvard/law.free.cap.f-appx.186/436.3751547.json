Corona-Majatca argues that the district court erred in departing upwardly from the Sentencing Guidelines because his criminal history was in fact accurately represented in the presentence report and within the heartland of the guidelines. Corona-Majatca also argues that the district court failed to conduct a proper upward departure by not explaining the methodology it used to arrive at his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>548 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review sentences for reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). We review the district court\u2019s decision to depart upwardly and the extent of that departure for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006). \u201cAn upward departure by a district court is not an abuse of discretion if the court\u2019s reasons for departing 1) \u2018advance the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)\u2019 and 2) \u2018are justified by the facts of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">The district court departed under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. At sentencing, the district court evaluated the guideline range and articulated its reasons for deviating from the range. The court discussed Corona-Majatca\u2019s criminal history in some detail and why it believed that his criminal history was underrepresented. We do not require the district court \u201cto go through a ritualistic exercise in which it mechanically discusses each criminal history category it rejects en route to the category that it selects.\u201d <em>United States v. Lambert, </em>984 F.2d 658, 663 (5th Cir.1993). In this case, the record \u201cmakes abundantly clear, through the court\u2019s adoption of the PSR, its statements at sentencing and its Statement of Reasons, the reasons for an upward departure.\u201d <em>Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347. The amount of the upward departure, i.e., 19 months, was not an abuse of discretion in light of CoronaMajatca\u2019s criminal history. <em>See id. </em>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b469-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
