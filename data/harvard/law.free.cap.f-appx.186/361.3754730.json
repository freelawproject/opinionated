In Burch\u2019s first lawsuit, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and denied relief in January 2004. Burch moved to rescind the district court\u2019s order, but that motion was denied in June 2005. Burch\u2019s appeal was assigned No. 05-2382. In Burch\u2019s second action, the district court denied relief in June 2005.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Burch\u2019s appeal was assigned No. 05-2381. Both notices of appeal were filed on December 5, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-26\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>risdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (I960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Because Burch failed to file a timely notice of appeal or obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period in either case, we dismiss the appeals. We deny his motions for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not assist in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b393-18\"> The district court subsequently granted Philip Morris\u2019s motion for sanctions in September 2005. Burch moved to pay the sanctions in installments, and by order dated November 18, 2005, the district court directed Burch to provide proof of indigency by December 5, 2005, and provided that the sanction would be payable in full on December 15, 2005, if Burch did not comply. Burch never responded to the district court's November 18 order to provide an affidavit in support of his need for an installment payment plan, and therefore, pursuant to its terms, the order was reduced to a judgment for the full amount of the sanction on December 15, 2005. Burch does not challenge the sanctions order in his informal brief on appeal, so he has waived appellate review of that order. See 4th Cir. R. 34(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
