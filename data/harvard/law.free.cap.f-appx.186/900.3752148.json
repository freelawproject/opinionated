She appealed, and we vacated her sentence, and remanded the ease for resentencing, because the court, prior to imposing sentence, failed to give her notice of its intent to fashion a sentence above the sentence range prescribed by the Guidelines, i.e., 18-24 months imprisonment. <em>Uhited States v. Nettles, </em>138 Fed.Appx. 299 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-21\">On remand, the court held a new sentencing hearing, and imposed the same sentence without making reference to an \u201cupward departure.\u201d This appeal challenges that sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-22\">Appellant asks that we vacate her sentence and remand the case for resentencing on three grounds: (1) <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), barred the court from departing upward from the Guidelines sentence range; (2) the court once again failed to give appellant advance notice of its intent to depart upward; and (3) the court erred in ordering restitution in an amount greater than that relating to the offense of conviction and the parties\u2019 oral stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>Appellant\u2019s first point is meritless. <em>Booker </em>instructs that the district courts treat the Guidelines as discretionary, rather than mandatory, and after consulting the Guidelines, consider the sentencing objectives set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In this case, the district court did precisely as <em>Booker </em>instructs.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Appellant\u2019s second point lacks merit because appellant well knew that the court would depart upward from the Guidelines sentence range. If there was error, it was clearly harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Appellant\u2019s third point also lacks merit. In the plea agreement appellant made with the Government, she waived the right to appeal her sentence \u201cexcept in the case of an upward departure from the guidelines pursuant to [U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 ] 5K2.0 and 4A1.3 and any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,\u201d which is not implicated here. At the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing, the court determined that appellant executed this waiver freely and voluntarily. It therefore bars her attack on the court\u2019s restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
