Staine and Dinnall were convicted of conspiracy to unlawfully kidnap a person, and Joseph was convicted of traveling in interstate commerce with intent to promote the drug conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-29\">In their initial appeal, we affirmed the convictions, rejecting those arguments that challenged trial proceedings and the sufficiency of the evidence. However, because the imposition of their sentences was plain error in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we vacated the sentences and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>remanded to the district court for resentencing. At resentencing, the district court followed the instructions in <em>Booker </em>and <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 555-56 (4th Cir.2005), and chose not to disturb the original life sentences imposed upon Staine and Dinnall. Joseph was sentenced to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment, the bottom end of the Guidelines range of imprisonment and two months less than the original sentence. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Staine and Dinnall raise several issues raised in their initial appeal challenging their convictions. We will not review these issues again. <em>United States v. Aramony, </em>166 F.3d 655, 661 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">With respect to the Guidelines enhancements for Fisher\u2019s murder and for Staine\u2019s and Dinnall\u2019s role in the offense, we find no clear error with respect to the district court\u2019s findings. <em>United States v. Crump, </em>120 F.3d 462, 468 (4th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The district court resentenced Dinnall and Staine only after properly calculating the sentence under the advisory Guidelines and considering the factors under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2005). The court did not have to articulate its findings with respect to each factor under \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). We find the sentences were reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">Likewise, we find Joseph\u2019s sentence reasonable. We find no merit to any of Joseph\u2019s arguments challenging the resentencing. The district court arrived at the correct range of imprisonment after considering the Guidelines. The court also reviewed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the specific arguments raised by counsel. There is no merit to the claim that the presumption of reasonableness for a sentence within the Guidelines is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-14\">Accordingly, we affirm the sentences. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
