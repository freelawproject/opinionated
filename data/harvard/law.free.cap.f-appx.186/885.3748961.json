Gilder-Lucas was a nontenured public high school science teacher and junior varsity cheerleader sponsor who alleges that her contract was not renewed because she raised concerns about the fairness of cheerleader tryouts in response to an inquiry by the principal at the school. We apply <em>Garcetti v. Ceballos, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1951,164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006), and conclude that Gilder-Lucas\u2019s speech was not protected by the First Amendment because she spoke \u201cpursuant to [her] official duties,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1958. We also conclude that Gilder-Lucas had no protectable property interest under the Fourteenth Amendment because she was not entitled to re-employment under state law. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">The Elmore County Board of Education hired Angela Gilder-Lucas as a nontenured science teacher at Stanhope Elmore High School in January 2008. Gilder-Lucas also was a junior varsity cheerleading sponsor. Two parents complained about unfairness in the cheerleader tryouts that were held in March 2004. The school principal, Louie Fryer, conducted an investigation into those complaints and asked Gilder-Lucas to complete a questionnaire that included several questions about the tryouts. On April 19, 2004, Gilder-Lucas responded to the questionnaire and raised several concerns about the tryouts. On May 12, 2004, Fryer told Gilder-Lucas he would not renew her contract. Fryer offered to permit Gilder-Lucas to resign, but Gilder-Lucas did not resign and her contract was not renewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-13\">Gilder-Lucas filed a complaint that alleged she was fired because she expressed concerns about the cheerleader tryouts. The district court granted summary judgment against Gilder-Lucas\u2019s claims under the First and Fourteenth Amendments because it concluded that Gilder-Lucas\u2019s \u201cresponse to Fryer\u2019s [questionnaire] did not address issues of public concern\u201d and \u201cis rightly considered speech made primarily in her role as an employee that does not trigger First Amendment protection.\u201d The district court also concluded that Gilder-Lucas did not have a cognizable property interest because nontenured teachers are not entitled to re-employment under the laws of Alabama.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-14\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b918-15\">\u201cThis court reviews the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standard that the district court employed in the first instance.\u201d <em>Yang v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>146 F.3d 1320, 1322 (11th Cir.1998). \u201c[A] moving party is entitled to summary judgment \u2018if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fitzpatrick v. City of Atlanta, </em>2 F.3d 1112, 1115 (11th Cir.1993) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)). \u201cWhen reviewing a\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>grant of summary judgment, the court of appeals may affirm if there exists any adequate ground for doing so, regardless of whether it is the one on which the district court relied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1117.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">Gilder-Lucas argues that her speech was protected under the First Amendment because it concerned the educational quality of the school and did not further her private interests. Gilder-Lucas also argues that she was denied her right of free speech without due process and had a property interest in re-employment. We discuss each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">First, Gilder-Lucas\u2019s response to Fryer\u2019s questionnaire is not protected by the First Amendment. \u201cA state may not demote or discharge a public employee in retaliation for [ ] speech\u201d protected by the First Amendment, <em>Morgan v. Ford, </em>6 F.3d 750, 754 (11th Cir.1993), but the Supreme Court has explained that a public employee who does not speak as a citizen on a matter of public concern \u201chas no First Amendment cause of action based on his or her employer\u2019s reaction to the speech,\u201d <em>Ceballos, </em>at 1958. \u201c[WJhen public employees make statements pursuant to their official duties, the employees are not speaking as citizens for First Amendment purposes, and the Constitution does not insulate their communications from employer discipline.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1960. Because the record reveals no genuine question about whether Gilder-Lucas responded to Fryer\u2019s questionnaire pursuant to her duty as a junior varsity cheerleader sponsor rather than as a citizen, the district court correctly granted summary judgment against Gilder-Lucas\u2019s claim under the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">Second, the school board did not violate Gilder-Lucas\u2019s right of due process when it did not renew her contract. \u201cThe Fourteenth Amendment protects against the government\u2019s deprivation of liberty or property without procedural due process.\u201d <em>Warren v. Crawford, </em>927 F.2d 559, 562 (11th Cir.1991). \u201cState law determines whether a public employee has a property interest in his or her job.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cUnder Alabama law ... [,] a nontenured teacher has no right, statutory or otherwise, to be re-employed.\u201d <em>Foster v. Blount County Bd. ofEduc., </em>340 So.2d 751, 752 (Ala.1976). Because Gilder-Lucas was a nontenured teacher and the record reveals no other basis of entitlement to re-employment, <em>e.g., Perry v. Sindermann, </em>408 U.S. 593, 601, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 2699, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972) (stating that \u201cmutually explicit understandings\u201d can \u201csupport [a] claim of entitlement to the benefit\u201d for the purpose of due process), the district court correctly granted summary judgment against Gilder-Lucas\u2019s claims under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">Gilder-Lucas\u2019s arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
