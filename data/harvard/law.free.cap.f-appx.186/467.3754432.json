As the Government notes, \u201c 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(b)(2)(B)\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>does not exist. A district court may modify the imposed term of imprisonment under limited circumstances. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). Because Cartwright\u2019s motion did not fall under any of the provisions of \u00a7 3582(c), it was unauthorized and without jurisdictional basis. <em>United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 141-42 (5th Cir.1994). Moreover, it cannot be construed as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, because Cartwright has already filed one \u00a7 2255 motion and a second would be subject to the jurisdictional bar of the successive-motion provision, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). <em>See United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000). Because Cartwright\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit, we dismiss the appeal as frivolous. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Cartwright is hereby warned that any further repetitious or frivolous filings, including those attempting to circumvent statutory restrictions on filing second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions, may result in the imposition of sanctions against him. These sanctions may include dismissal, monetary sanctions, and restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court and any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b499-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
