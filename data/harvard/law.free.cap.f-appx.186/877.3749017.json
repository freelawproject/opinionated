Rojas argues that the district court clearly erred by not granting Rojas a minor-role reduction under section 3B1.2 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-22\">Rojas was one of six crew members on a vessel that the United States Coast Guard intercepted near Colombia. The Coast Guard discovered, on the vessel and in the water around the vessel, approximately 1850 kilograms of cocaine packaged in bales. Rojas was arrested, and he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute, and possession of with intent to distribute, 5 or more kilograms of cocaine. 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 1903; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(1)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-23\">At sentencing, Rojas objected that the presentence investigation report did not recommend a minor-role reduction under section 3B1.2 of the sentencing guidelines. Rojas asserted that, during the voyage on the vessel, he was seasick and unable to help the other drug traffickers. Rojas explained that, in contrast to his co-conspirators, he was unfamiliar with the sea. An agent of the government testified, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>based on an investigation that included interviews with the other crew members, that Rojas was a \u201cload guard\u201d on the vessel. The district court overruled Rojas\u2019s objection and sentenced him to 135 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Rojas argues that the district court clearly erred by not granting him a minor-role reduction. We review \u201ca district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense ... for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). Section 3B1.2(b) of the sentencing guidelines provides for a reduction of the offense level in the case of a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 5 (2004). A \u201cdistrict court must measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which [ ]he has been held accountable,\u201d <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d at 940, and \u201cmay also measure the defendant\u2019s culpability in comparison to that of other participants in the relevant conduct,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 944. \u201cThe defendant bears the burden of proving his minor role by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Rojas\u2019s argument fails. Rojas\u2019s role as a load guard of a crew on a vessel trafficking over 1800 kilograms of cocaine cannot \u201cbe described as minimal\u201d when measured against the conduct for which he was held accountable. Rojas also cannot be considered \u201cless culpable\u201d than the other crew members because he might have had less drug trafficking experience than them or was seasick.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
