He raises two issues in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-29\">First, Wilkins argues the district court erred by finding that his prior Texas felony conviction for burglary of a habitation was a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) and 4B1.2(a). The district court correctly found that Wilkins\u2019s prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>conviction for burglary of a habitation was a conviction for a crime of violence. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1398, 164 L.Ed.2d 100 (2006); <em>United States v. Hornsby, </em>88 F.3d 336, 339 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Second, Wilkins contends that the felon-in-possession-of-a-firearm statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), is unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause because it criminalizes the possession of firearms which do not substantially affect interstate commerce and that there was insufficient evidence to establish there was a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Wilkins correctly concedes that these arguments are foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 <em>&amp; </em>n. 12 (5th Cir.2001). He raises the issues to preserve them for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b477-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
