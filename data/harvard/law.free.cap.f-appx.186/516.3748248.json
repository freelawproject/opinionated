INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 415 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">Bokhetache argues that the BIA violated his due-process rights and abused its discretion in refusing to consider his brief, which was filed more than two months late. Bokhetache\u2019s attorney had failed to inform the BIA of her change of address and did not receive the briefing schedule. Bokhetache argues that the BIA\u2019s refusal to consider his untimely brief was a \u201ctotal denial\u201d of \u201cany opportunity\u201d to be heard and that the agency\u2019s own regulations do not set forth requirements for notifying the BIA of an attorney\u2019s address change. Because 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.38(e) explicitly requires applicants and their attorneys to notify the BIA of an address change, this contention is unavailing. The BIA did not abuse its discretion in refusing to file the brief. <em>See Huicochea-Gomez v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 696, 701 (6th Cir.2001). Bokhetache has not established a due-process violation, either, because he had not made an initial showing of \u201csubstantial prejudice.\u201d <em>See De Zavala v. Ashcroft, </em>385 F.3d 879, 883 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Bokhetache\u2019s challenge to review the IJ\u2019s rejection of his asylum application as time-barred. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(D), (a)(3); <em>Tsevegmid v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 1231, 1235 (10th Cir.2003); <em>Nieto-Baquero v. Gonzales, </em>133 Fed.Appx. 976 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Bobo v. Gonzales, </em>172 Fed.Appx. 69 (5th Cir.2006), 172 Fed. Appx. at 72, 73 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-15\">We will uphold the finding that an alien is not eligible for withholding of removal if that finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir.2005). When the BIA has adopted the IJ\u2019s decision, as here, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Williams-Igwonobe v. Gonzales, </em>437 F.3d 453, 455 (5th Cir.2006). The \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard requires that the agency decision be based on the record evidence and that the decision be substantially reasonable. <em>CarbajalGonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). Under this standard, the IJ\u2019s determination will be affirmed unless the \u201cevidence compels a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b549-16\">Bokhetache has not established that the evidence \u201ccompels\u201d a conclusion that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he will be persecuted if returned to Algeria. <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138-39 (5th Cir. 2004); <em>Zhang, </em>432 F.3d at 344. Between 1974 and 2000, Bokhetache worked for a for state-owned Algerian petroleum company, Sonatrach. In the mid-to-late 1990s, Sonatrach had a entered into a joint venture with an American company to develop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>a hydrocarbon field in Algeria, a project for which Bokhetache served as engineering manager. Because of alleged waste and inefficiency by Algerian contractors and workers, Bokhetache replaced them with Filipino companies and workers. Allegedly, these actions earned the enmity of Islamic militants in Algeria, as did Sonatrach\u2019s collaboration with American companies and the perception that Sonatrach was connected to a corrupt Algerian government. Bokhetache, however, has failed to show that he was individually targeted by militants or that, as a <em>former </em>Sonatrach employee, he likely will be targeted if were to be returned to Algeria. <em>See Roy, </em>389 F.3d at 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b549-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
