We review for abuse of discretion and affirm for the following reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-18\">\u201c[T] his court will uphold a sentence unless it is in violation of the law or plainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 925 (5th Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted). To revoke a term of supervised release, a district court must find by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of his release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). As a Class B felon, Albert was susceptible to three years imprisonment for violating the conditions of his supervised release. <em>Id. </em>The preponderance standard was easily satisfied because Albert stipulated to the Grade C supervised release violations. In light of Albert\u2019s lengthy criminal history, this sentence is not plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b545-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
