Frazier filed a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in 2001, which was dismissed as time-barred. Frazier filed a second \u00a7 2255 motion in 2005, arguing that his sentence was unconstitutional in light of the decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court dismissed Frazier\u2019s motion as an unauthorized successive \u00a7 2255 motion but granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on the issue whether <em>Booker </em>is retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-22\"><em>Booker </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on initial collateral review. <em>United States v. Gentry, </em>432 F.3d 600, 604 (5th Cir.2005). Further, <em>Booker </em>is not a ground for filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>In re Elwood, </em>408 F.3d 211, 213 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-23\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Frazier\u2019s motion to stay proceedings is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b522-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
