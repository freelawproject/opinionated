The BIA ruled Aguilar was ineligible for adjustment of status pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) because he had accrued more than one year of unlawful presence in the United States <em>and </em>pursuant to \u00a7 1182(a)(2) because of his prior conviction for misprision of felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-24\">On a petition for review of a BIA decision, factual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence; questions of law, <em>de novo. Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001). We review the BIA\u2019s order and will consider the underlying IJ decision only if it influenced the BIA\u2019s determination. <em>Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 348 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-25\">Aguilar contends his unlawful presence in the United States did not render him ineligible for adjustment of status under \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(I). We need not reach this contention, because Aguilar has <em>not </em>shown the BIA erred in determining he was ineligible for adjustment of status because his conviction for misprision of felo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>ny was a conviction for a crime of moral turpitude, making him ineligible for adjustment of status under \u00a7 1182(a)(2). <em>See Smalley v. Ashcroft, </em>354 F.3d 332, 339 (5th Cir.2003). Because Aguilar\u2019s conviction was for a crime of moral turpitude, we lack \u201cjurisdiction over his final order of deportation\u201d. <em>Id.; see Lee v. Gonzales, </em>410 F.3d 778, 783 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Aguilar\u2019s assertion that the BIA violated his due process rights by considering the \u00a7 1182(a)(2) issue is unavailing. <em>See An-war v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir. 1997); <em>Ghassan v. INS, </em>972 F.2d 631, 635 (5th Cir.1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 971, 113 S.Ct. 1412, 122 L.Ed.2d 783 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\n<em>DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b547-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
