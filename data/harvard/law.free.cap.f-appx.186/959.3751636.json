The district court sentence Hodges under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), (\u201cACCA\u201d) based on prior Florida state convictions for possession of cocaine with intent to sell within 1,000 feet of a public housing facility, aggravated assault, and battery. Hodges argues that the district court erred in applying a statutory mandatory-minimum sentence under \u00a7 924(e) because this violated the law announced in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Second, Hodges argues that his constitutional rights were violated when the district court sentenced him under the enhanced penalties under the ACCA and used prior convictions that were not alleged in an indictment or proven to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-10\">Because Hodges did not make any objections to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) or at his sentencing hearing, review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 2935,162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). Under plain error, we \u201cmay not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). If these three conditions have been met, we only exercise our discretion to reverse the error if \u201c(4) [it] seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). When a defendant fails to object to facts in the PSI, those facts are admitted. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325,1330 (11th Cir .2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-14\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that the mandatory nature of the Sentencing Guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to the right to a jury trial. 543 U.S. at 233-34, 125 S.Ct. at 749-51. The Supreme Court also held that a fact, other than a prior conviction, that supports a sentence exceeding the statutory maximum must be admitted by the defendant or submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 244, 125 S.Ct. at 756. Thus, there are two types of <em>Booker </em>error, (1) constitutional error of using facts that were not proven to a jury to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence, and (2) statutory error of sentencing under a mandatory Guideline. <em>See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1329-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-15\"><em>I. Statutory </em>Booker <em>error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b992-16\">We have emphasized that there is no statutory error when a defendant is sentenced under statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums, as opposed to mandatory m\u00ednimums under the Guidelines. <em>See id. </em>at 1333 n. 10. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), if a defendant is found to be an armed career <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>criminal, his statutory mandatory minimal sentence is enhanced to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">In this case, Hodges\u2019s argument against the use of a statutory mandatory minimum fails. We have expressly stated that district courts are still required to sentence in accordance with these statutes after <em>Booker. See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325,1333 n. 10. The district court sentenced Hodges under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), and thus, Hodges\u2019s argument against statutory mandatory-minimum sentencing is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\"><em>II. Constitutional </em>Booker <em>error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">In addressing Hodges\u2019s constitutional arguments under <em>Booker, </em>the analysis begins with the relevant provisions of the ACCA. In order to enhance a sentence under the ACCA, the sentencing court must find that the defendant had \u201cthree previous convictions by any court [as listed in \u00a7 922(g)(1) ] for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another.... \u201d 18 U.S.C. 924(e)(1). The term \u201cviolent felony\u201d is defined in ACCA as any crime that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-8\">(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-9\">(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). The term \u201cserious drug offense\u201d includes, \u201can offense under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute a controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802)) for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii). Cocaine is listed as a controlled substance. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(17)(D). Under Florida law, possession of cocaine with intent to sell within 1,000 feet of a public housing facility has a maximum term of imprisonment of 30 years. Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 775.082(3)(b), 893.03(2)(a)(4), 893.13(l)(f)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-13\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court held that the government need not allege a prior conviction in the indictment nor prove it beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury in order to use that conviction for purposes of enhancing a sentence. 523 U.S. 224, 226-27 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1222, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). In <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>however, the Supreme Court noted the difference between the \u201cfact of a prior conviction\u201d and a \u201cfact about a prior conviction,\u201d for purposes of enhancing a sentence under the ACCA. 544 U.S. 13, 24-26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1262-63, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). The former is governed by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and may be determined by the sentencing judge, while the latter may only be found by the sentencing judge if based on a limited set of documents laid out in <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 26, 125 S.Ct. at 1263. In determining whether a prior conviction qualifies as a violent felony \u2014 a fact about a conviction \u2014 for purposes of increasing a defendant\u2019s sentence, a sentencing judge is limited to examining \u201cthe statutory elements, charging document, any plea agreement and colloquy or jury instructions, or comparable judicial record.\u201d <em>United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1275 (11th Cir .2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-14\">In <em>Greer, </em>we held that a district court may find the facts necessary to determine that a prior conviction was a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of defining an individual as a armed career criminal. <em>Id. </em>at 1275-76. Specifically, we found that \u201cthere [was] no <em>Shepard </em>problem because the vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>lent nature of each prior conviction, as \u2018violent\u2019 is defined in the ACCA, can be determined from the face of the certified copy of the conviction document read along with the indictment and in light of the statutory elements of the offense.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">In this case, Hodges\u2019s basic contention is that a district court errs when it, instead of the jury, determines if a prior felony conviction is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the ACCA. We have expressly held that a district court may make this determination, but the court is limited to certain documents in the record to make that determination. Greer, 440 F.3d at 1267. Thus, the main thrust of Hodges\u2019s argument is in direct conflict with this Court\u2019s precedent and necessarily fails, and thus, there was no constitutional error when the judge, not the jury, made the decision to determine if Hodges\u2019s prior convictions were violent felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">In so far as Hodges argues that the district court erred in its determination that the prior convictions were felonies, this argument fails as well. Hodges did not object to this determination in the PSI or before the sentencing court, and therefore, he admitted these facts and waived any arguments contesting those facts. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005). Moreover, a review of the convictions shows that they were for possession of cocaine with intent to sell, aggravated assault, and battery. These convictions qualify as predicate felonies under the ACCA because they were violent felonies or serious drug offenses on their face and the proper documents that support this finding were in the record. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) and (2); <em>Greer, </em>440 F.3d at 1275-76. Thus, the district court did not err, much less plainly err, in determining that Hodges\u2019s prior convictions were predicate felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">Accordingly, based on our review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Hodges\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
