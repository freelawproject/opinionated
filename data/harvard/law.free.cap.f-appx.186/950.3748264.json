Garcia assumes on appeal that she is entitled to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of her motion for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(d)(5). She contends that the denial, which was based upon the merits, and, alternatively, procedural grounds, was in error. Garcia also claims that the district court believed that it lacked authority to depart.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">Where a sentencing court refuses to depart downward based on the exercise of its discretionary authority, we lack jurisdiction to review that decision. <em>United States v. Chase, </em>174 F.3d 1193, 1195 (11th Cir. 1999). \u201c[WJhen nothing in the record indicates otherwise, [we] assume the sentencing court understood it had authority to depart downward.\u201d <em>Chase, </em>174 F.3d at 1195; see <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cAfter <em>Booker,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>our review of decisions regarding downward departures remains limited\u201d). In fact, a district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward can present a cognizable claim on appeal only if the court erroneously believed that it lacked the authority to grant such a departure. <em>Chase, </em>174 F.3d at 1195; <em>United States v. Hadaway, </em>998 F.2d 917, 919 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">A review of the sentencing hearing reveals that the district court understood that it had the authority to grant the departure and that it ruled on the motion both procedurally and on the merits. The district court made no statements that did not have the authority to grant the departure so we assume that it thought it did have the authority. <em>See Chase, </em>174 F.3d at 1195. Garcia\u2019s claims to the contrary are without support in the record. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review the merits of the district court\u2019s denial of Garcia\u2019s motion for downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-13\">Because the motion was considered on the merits by the district court, we further decline to reach her argument that it erred by finding that the motion was untimely filed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Chase, </em>174 F.3d at 1195; <em>Hadaway, </em>998 F.2d at 919. Specifically, although the court alternatively discussed another basis for denying the motion (e.g., timeliness), the court\u2019s ruling on the merits rendered the former omission moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-14\">Based upon the foregoing, we affirm Garcia\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b983-8\">. <em>United States v.

We have previously considered the Southern District of Florida\u2019s Local Rule 88.8(6), which requires that motions for departure be filed no later than 5 days prior to the sentencing proceeding, and determined that the rule is permissible. <em>United States v.
