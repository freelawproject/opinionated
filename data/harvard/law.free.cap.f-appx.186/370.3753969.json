In these consolidated appeals from his conviction and sentence (No. 03^4887) and the district court\u2019s order denying his pro se motion for production of documents (No. 03-7686), Wells contends his sentence constituted plain error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir. 2005); he did not knowingly and intelligently waive the right to seek appellate review of his conviction; and the evidence was insufficient for the jury to find him guilty of conduct constituting a \u201cpattern of racketeering activity.\u201d We affirm the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for production of documents in No. 03-7686. In No. 03-4887, we affirm Wells\u2019s conviction, but vacate his sentence because it exceeded the range that was supported by the jury\u2019s verdict and grant the motions to remand for resentencing in accordance with Booker.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Whether a defendant has effectively waived his right to appeal is a matter of law we review de novo. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005). When the Government seeks to enforce an appellate waiver, and there is no claim the Government breached the parties\u2019 agreement, this court will enforce the waiver if the record establishes the defendant knowingly and intelligently agreed to waive the right to appeal, and the issue being appealed is within the scope of the waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 168-69. Although the determination of whether a defendant knowingly and intelligently agreed to waive the right to appeal is often made based on the adequacy of the district court\u2019s questioning, the issue ultimately is evaluated by considering the totality of the circumstances, including the background, experience, and conduct of the accused. <em>Id. </em>at 169 (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">It is not clear from the materials before us on appeal that Wells knowingly and intelligently agreed to waive appellate review of his conviction. The district court did not question Wells regarding the waiver, which was contained in an agreement executed after the jury\u2019s verdict, to confirm that it was knowing and intelligent. The only time the district court discussed the waiver with Wells was at a post-judgment hearing in which Wells contended his intention was always to appeal his conviction. This contention, although contradicted by the waiver provision, was supported by the fact that one of his attorneys filed a notice of appeal of the conviction nearly simultaneously with Wells\u2019s execution of the agreement containing the waiver provision, and his counsel\u2019s subsequent filing of a motion for a new trial. Moreover, Wells alleged his other attorney advised him pri- or to sentencing that the Government had repudiated the parties\u2019 agreement. We therefore decline to enforce the waiver of appellate rights contained in this agreement and review Wells\u2019s claim challenging the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">We conclude the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find a pattern of racketeering activity beyond a reasonable doubt. In reviewing a sufficiency challenge, the verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it. <em>Glasser v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number><em>United, States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). Reversal of a conviction for insufficient evidence is reserved for the rare case in which the prosecution\u2019s failure is clear. <em>United States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir.1997) (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">A \u201cpattern of racketeering activity\u201d requires \u201cat least two acts of racketeering activity, one of which occurred after [October 15, 1970] and the last of which occurred within ten years ... after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(5) (2000). A \u201cpattern\u201d is something more than the commission of widely separated and isolated or sporadic offenses, and it requires a relationship between the predicates and a threat of continuing activity. <em>H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., </em>492 U.S. 229, 238-39, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989). The three acts found by the jury constituted more than isolated or sporadic offenses. Because of their similarity in means and mode of execution, they were both sufficiently related and implicitly threatened repetition to a degree consistent with continuing activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Because Wells was sentenced prior to <em>Booker </em>and he did not raise any <em>Booker </em>claim in the district court, we review his sentence for plain error. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547. \u201cIn <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court ruled that the Sixth Amendment is violated when a district court, acting pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act and the guidelines, imposes a sentence greater than the maximum authorized by the facts found by the jury\u2019s verdict alone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546. As conceded by Wells, his base offense level and the two-level enhancement for abuse of a position of public trust were supported by the jury\u2019s verdict. However, his remaining sentencing enhancements were based on facts not found by the jury. Wells was prejudiced by the error because his sentence exceeded the range of thirty-seven to forty-six months that would have applied without the additional enhancements. <em>See id. </em>at 550-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Although the sentencing guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000) and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Accordingly, in No. 03-4887, we affirm Wells\u2019s conviction, vacate his sentence, and grant the parties\u2019 motions to remand for resentencing. In No. 03-7686, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for production of documents. We deny Wells\u2019s motion for leave to file a pro se supplemental brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">\n<em>No. OS-4887 AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">\n<em>No. 03-7686 AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-5\"> Just as we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. 4, \u201c[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Wells's sentencing. <em>See generally Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (stating an error is \"plain\u201d if \"the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
