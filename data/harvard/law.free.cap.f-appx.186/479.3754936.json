Thomas argues that the district court erred in dismissing his petition. This court reviews issues of law de novo. <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-26\">A petition filed under \u00a7 2241 which attacks errors that occurred at trial or sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>tencing should be dismissed or construed as a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Id.; Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). Thomas\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition challenged his conviction, rather than attacking the manner in which his sentence was being executed. Thomas has not shown that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.2000) (prior unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion or inability to meet successive-petition requirements does not render \u00a7 2255 \u201cinadequate\u201d). Further, the district court lacked jurisdiction to construe Thomas\u2019s petition as a successive motion under \u00a7 2255. <em>See Hooker v. Sivley, </em>187 F.3d 680, 681-82 (5th Cir.1999). The district court\u2019s judgment dismissing Thomas\u2019s petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b511-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
