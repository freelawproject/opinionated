On appeal, he argues that because he was found not guilty only by reason of insanity and subsequently committed, he is not a prisoner in custody for purposes of \u00a7 2255, and thus \u00a7 2241 was the appropriate avenue for relief. Wattleton previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, raising the same claims he raises in his \u00a7 2241 petition, which the district court denied and we affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-23\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). In a proceeding on a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and the legal issues <em>de novo. Castillo v. United States, </em>200 F.3d 735, 736 (11th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-24\">A person committed after having been found not guilty by reason of insanity is not precluded from establishing by writ of habeas corpus the illegality of his detention. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4247(g). Section 2255 is the primary method to collaterally attack a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>federal sentence. <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>915 F.2d 622, 629 (11th Cir.1990). Attacks on the execution, rather than the imposition, of a sentence are a matter for habeas corpus review under \u00a7 2241. <em>Bishop v. Reno, </em>210 F.3d 1295, 1304 n. 14 (11th Cir.2000). Under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255, a federal prisoner may bring a \u00a7 2241 petition if his remedy under \u00a7 2255 \u201cis inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>see also Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1238-39 (11th Cir.1999). However, a petitioner who has filed and was denied a \u00a7 2255 motion may not circumvent the successive-petition rule simply by filing a petition under \u00a7 2241. <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">A federal prisoner seeking to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion must first seek authorization from us in order for the district court to consider the motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), 2255. Here, it was reasonable for the district court to construe Wattleton\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion. Wattleton, who is in federal custody, was attacking the legality of his detention, not how it was being carried out, and \u00a7 2255 is the primary vehicle for doing this. Although Wattleton argues on appeal that since he was adjudicated not guilty only by reason of insanity, he is not a \u201cprisoner\u201d attacking his \u201csentence\u201d and therefore cannot proceed under \u00a7 2255, he previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, raising the same claims he now raises in his \u00a7 2241 petition. The district court accepted that as a \u00a7 2255 motion and ruled on it. We, in turn, affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of his earlier \u00a7 2255 motion, accepting Wattleton\u2019s implicit representation that his claims were properly pursued under \u00a7 2255. Wattleton cannot now be heard to argue that his claims are not properly brought under \u00a7 2255;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he cannot circumvent the prohibition on successive petitions simply by filing under \u00a7 2241. Thus, the same rules regarding collateral attack of sentences apply to Wattleton. He previously tried to establish the illegality of his detention through his initial motion, designated as one under \u00a7 2255, and he cannot now reargue those same claims in a second petition, regardless of whether it is labeled as one under \u00a7 2241 or \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">The only way that Wattleton could proceed under \u00a7 2241 would be to show that his remedy under \u00a7 2255 \u201cis inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d Wattleton has raised his \u00a7 2241 claims regarding both on direct appeal and collateral attack. All of these claims were ruled on. Since Wattleton has had all his claims addressed, he has not shown how a \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his sentence. As such, the district court correctly construed his \u00a7 2241 petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion. Since Wattleton had previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion that had been considered on the merits, the district court correctly characterized his present motion as impermissibly successive.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">Since Wattleton sought to challenge the validity of his detention, did not satisfy the savings clause of \u00a7 2255, and did not seek our permission to file a second successive petition, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-11\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-6\">. Thus we decline to address Wattleton's argument that he is not a federal \"prisoner,\u201d that his claims were improperly brought before under \u00a7 2255, and that he should be entitled to proceed with the same claims under \u00a7 2241. We have not previously addressed whether a person committed after being found not guilty by reason of insanity may proceed under \u00a7 2255. However, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>reasons discussed, we need not reach that issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b886-27\">. Wattleton\u2019s motion to file his reply brief out of time is granted. However, we decline to address any new arguments that are presented for the first time in the reply brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
