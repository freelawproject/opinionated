Counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no meritorious issues for review; however, raising the issue of whether this court properly decided in a prior opinion to reverse the district court\u2019s order granting Wallace\u2019s motion to suppress. Wallace did not file a pro se supplemental brief. We affirm the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">We will not revisit the issue of this court\u2019s prior decision to reverse the district court\u2019s order granting Wallace\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>See United States v. Wallace, </em>124 Fed.Appx. 165 (4th Cir.2005) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the conviction and sentence. In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record and find no meritorious issues. This court requires counsel inform his client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
