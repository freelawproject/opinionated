The district court determined James was responsible for 2.5 kilograms of cocaine base, and sentenced him to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. We affirm James\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The sole issue James raises on appeal is the contention he should be resentenced in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court based his offense level on a drug weight that was neither admitted by him nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. As James raises this issue for the first time on appeal, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>416 F.3d 298, 300 (4th Cir.2005). To establish that a Sixth Amendment error occurred during sentencing, a defendant must show that the district court imposed a sentence exceeding the maximum allowed based only on the facts to which he admitted. <em>Id. </em>\u201cAdmissions may take a variety of forms, including guilty pleas and stipulations, a defendant\u2019s own statements in open court, and representations by counsel.\u201d <em>United States v. Revels, </em>455 F.3d 448 (4th Cir. 2006) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">At sentencing, counsel represented that James \u201cdid not disagree with the total weight which was computed in the presentence report,\u201d but rather that James disagreed with the specific dates on which drug transactions occurred. Any issues involving specific dates were resolved, and counsel withdrew his objections to the presentence report. Consequently, James was assigned an offense level based on the drug weight specified in the presentence report. Like the representation made in <em>Jones, </em>counsel\u2019s assertion that James did not disagree with the total weight computed served as the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of adopting the factual basis for sentencing. <em>See Jones, </em>181 Fed.Appx. 337; <em>see also Revels, </em>455 F.3d at 449. Therefore, we conclude judicial factfinding was not required and there was no Sixth Amendment error.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">Accordingly, we affirm James\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b442-8\"> This appeal was placed in abeyance pending the issuance of <em>United States v. Jones, </em>181 Fed.Appx. 337 (4th Cir.2006) (unpublished).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
