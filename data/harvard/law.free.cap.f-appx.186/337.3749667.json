Baker, Chairman of the North Carolina Parole Board. Overman asserted that he should be subject to the parole procedures that were in effect at the time of his 1964 conviction, and that imposition of subsequently enacted policies and procedures violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution and denies him due process. Citing <em>Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005), Overman sought declaratory and injunctive relief, stating that he was not seeking release on parole, merely reconsideration under the procedures in effect at the time of his conviction. The district court dismissed Overman\u2019s case as frivolous, holding that Overman must make such a claim through federal or state habeas corpus procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-15\">We conclude that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Wilkinson </em>requires us to vacate the district court\u2019s decision and remand for further proceedings. Like Over-man, the plaintiffs in <em>Wilkinson </em>sought only to challenge the policies and procedures applicable to their parole reviews, not the denial of parole itself. The Court held that, because neither inmate\u2019s claims \u201cwould necessarily spell speedier release, neither lies at the core of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82,125 S.Ct. 1242 (internal quotation omitted). Therefore, the Court held that the \u00a7 1983 actions could proceed. Here, as well, Overman\u2019s claims do not \u201cspell speedier release,\u201d and therefore, he may proceed under \u00a7 1983 without first successfully challenging the more recent procedures under habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-16\">Accordingly, we vacate the decision of the district court and remand for further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>proceedings.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b371-18\"> We express no opinion on the merits of Over-man's claim, or the availability of other grounds for summaiy disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
