He argues on appeal that the district court erred in determining that his prior California conviction under CalPenal Code \u00a7 261.5 for unlawful sexual intercourse qualifies under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 as a crime of violence because it met both the enumerated offense of statutory rape and the enumerated offense of sexual abuse of a minor. Concerning the enumerated offense of statutory rape, Eusebio-Giron contends that \u00a7 261.5 does not have an exception for sexual intercourse between contemporaries, whereas the Model Penal Code (\u201cMPC\u201d) definition of statutory rape excludes sexual intercourse between persons within four years of age of one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Eusebio-Giron bases his argument that \u00a7 261.5 does not have an exception for sexual intercourse between contemporaries on the fact that \u00a7 261.5(b) makes sexual intercourse with a minor within three years of age from the actor a misdemean- or. Because, however, Eusebio-Giron was indicted for and pleaded guilty of violating \u00a7 261.5(c), we need not consider whether the offense listed under \u00a7 261.5(b) qualifies as statutory rape under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.Bd 270, 273 n. 6 (5th Cir.2005). Section 261.5(c) contains an exception similar to that in the MPC, because it does not criminalize sexual intercourse with a minor three years or less apart in age from the actor. Accordingly, Eusebio-Giron\u2019s argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">Eusebio-Giron\u2019s constitutional challenge to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See Rangel-Reyes v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2873, 165 L.Ed.2d 910 (2006); <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Eusebio-Giron properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b540-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
