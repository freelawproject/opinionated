On appeal, Islam challenges the continuance ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">\u201cThe immigration judge may grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29 (2006). Whether to grant such a motion \u201cis within the sound discretion of the immigration judge and is reviewed for abuse of discretion only.\u201d <em>Onyeme v. INS, </em>146 F.3d 227, 231 (4th Cir.1998). Having reviewed the administrative record, we conclude that the Board did not err in finding the immigration judge acted within its discretion in denying Islam\u2019s motion for continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
