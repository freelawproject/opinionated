Our independent review of counsel\u2019s brief and the record discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b496-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
