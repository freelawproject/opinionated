Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). On appeal, Brown asserts that her sentence was unreasonable because the trial court did not explicitly ascertain an advisory guideline range and because the district court\u2019s bare statement that it considered the 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553 (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005) factors was insufficient to show that the court did a proper analysis. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-20\">Although the trial court did not state the advisory guideline range, it is clear that the court adopted the range used at Brown\u2019s initial sentencing. The court readopted the original presentence report and stated that it calculated the advisory guideline range based on the findings in the report. In addition, the Government stated that \u201cthe Fourth Circuit did not direct [Brown\u2019s] guideline calculations be redone,\u201d and the court stated \u201cwell, I understand that. I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. We just imposed a sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>tence indicating that we have considered that the guidelines are not mandatory.\u201d Moreover, the statement of reasons included in Brown\u2019s criminal judgment shows that the guideline range was determined to be 78 to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment, the range used at Brown\u2019s first sentencing. Thus, there was no error in failing to explicitly restate the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Turning to Brown\u2019s second argument, her sentence, which was imposed within the advisory guideline range, was presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). A defendant can only rebut this presumption by showing the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375 (4th Cir.2006). In addition, a sentence may be procedurally unreasonable when the district court provides an inadequate statement of reasons. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 434 (4th Cir. 2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). However, a court need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection\u201d or \u201cexplicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">Brown does not argue that there was any specific factor in her case that was not considered. Instead, she focuses her argument on the fact that the district court did not conduct a proper analysis. We find that the district court\u2019s explanations of its reasons for sentencing Brown were sufficient. The court expressly stated it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and it heard Brown\u2019s allocution. In addition, the written judgment shows that the district court exempted Brown from the drug testing requirement because she posed a low risk of future substance abuse and from paying a fine because she lacked the ability to do so. Moreover, the presentence report, which the court adopted, addressed Brown\u2019s education, financial situation, and her obligations to her daughter. Finally, at Brown\u2019s initial sentencing, she moved for a downward departure based on aberrant behavior, her recent college graduation, and her lack of criminal history, and the district court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">Thus, we hold that the court, over the course of both sentencings, considered all the relevant \u00a7 3553 factors before imposing sentence. While the court could have been more explicit in its findings and reasoning, there was no reversible error. The court stated that it considered the \u00a7 3553 factors, Brown did not argue for special consideration of any factors, and Brown was sentenced to the low end of the guideline range. We conclude that Brown\u2019s sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-13\">Thus, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
