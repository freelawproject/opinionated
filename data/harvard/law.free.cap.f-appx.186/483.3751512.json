The district court dismissed Brown\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint without prejudice finding that it was barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). The district court further concluded that Brown\u2019s complaint could not be construed as a habeas petition because it was not filed in the right district as provided by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-24\">On appeal, Brown does not challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of his civil rights complaint as barred by <em>Heck. </em>Rather, he argues the merits of his claim that he was unconstitutionally confined in a state men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>tal facility. Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). By failing to identify any error in the district court\u2019s judgment, Brown has abandoned the issue on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Brown\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The dismissal of the instant appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Brown is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b515-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
