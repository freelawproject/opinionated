Dolenz, federal prisoner # 31480-077, filed an action in the district court invoking 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Because Dolenz\u2019s action attacked the legality of the conviction and sentence for mail fraud, the district court construed the action as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissed it as an unauthorized successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Dolenz has appealed the judgment and the district court\u2019s order denying Dolenz\u2019s motion under Fed.R.CivP. 59(e). Dolenz\u2019s contention that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because of defects in the indictment is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002). <em>See Wesson v. United States Penitentiary Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 346 (5th Cir.2002). Dolenz has not shown that the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 applies to his claim of actual innocence. <em>See id.; Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-25\">Dolenz asserts for the first time on appeal that his sentence is illegal in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This argument implicates the Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>Booker </em>claims do not fall under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 427 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also Wesson, </em>305 F.3d at 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-26\">Dolenz\u2019s contention that the savings clause violates the Suspension Clause of the United States Constitution is foreclosed. <em>See Wesson, </em>305 F.3d at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-27\">Because Dolenz has not shown that the district court erred in determining that he could not assert his claims in a \u00a7 2241 proceeding under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255, Dolenz\u2019s contentions that his restitution order and prison sentence violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>and unusual punishment and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel have not been considered. The judgment is affirmed. Because Dolenz has not shown that the interests of justice require appointment of counsel, <em>see Schwander v. Blackburn, </em>750 F.2d 494, 502 (5th Cir. 1985), his motion for appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b507-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
