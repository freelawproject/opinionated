Tried below before the Hon. G-. H. Noonan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-10\">The appellants in this case, J. T. O\u2019Connor, Abbie M. O\u2019Con-nor and Mattie Collins, were held under a capias issued from the justice\u2019s court of precinct number one of Bexar county, Texas, on a charge against them of the murder of the infant child of the said Mattie Collins. They sought relief under the writ of habeas corpus, and bail being refused by the district judge, this appeal has been prosecuted to this court, and bail is awarded to each of the relators in the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-11\">The evidence for the State was first introduced, and L. P\u201e Weathers was the first witness. He testified that he was a p hysician and had been engaged in the practice of medicine for the period of twenty years. The witness was acquainted with Thomas (J. T.) O\u2019Connor, his wife Abbie O\u2019Connor, and Mattie Collins. He had known Thomas O\u2019Connor about a year at the time of this trial, but could not recall the length of time that he had known Mrs. O\u2019Connor. The witness knew Mattie Collins as Mrs. Smith, and as Mrs. Smith he attended her at Mrs. O\u2019Con-nor\u2019s house late in October, 1886. Witness attended her for the three of four days succeeding the birth of her child. The child\u2019s general condition was very healthy. Mattie Collins was the natural mother of the child, and her ability to nurse the child was good. Witness saw Mattie Collins about two and a half <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>weeks after the birth of the child. He then went to collect his fee, and not in his professional capacity to attend upon either mother or child. One Joe Murray, acting ostensibly as the agent of some third party, employed the witness in the first instance, to attend Mattie Collins, and witness looked to Murray for his fee. Witness saw the child on the occasion of that visit. It looked much worse and smaller than when the witness first saw it. The witness never saw Mattie Collins nurse the child. The witness could not undertake to say what was the matter with the child, but he thought it evident that the child was suffering from the want of nourishment, though it might have been sick. The child looked very much reduced, and as if whatever nourishment it had taken had disagreed with it. This visit was paid by the witness late in November. The child, at birth, had every appearance of having been carried the full period. The probable result of placing a white child, two and a half weeks old, with a colored woman to nurse would be to cause its sickness and death. Mrs. O\u2019Connor was present at the birth of Mattie Collins\u2019s child, and it was the recollection of the witness that Thomas O\u2019Connor was about the house. Mrs. O\u2019Con-nor never made a statement to the witness relative to the condition of the child.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-5\">On his cross examination the witness said that he made three or four professional visits to the house after the birth of the child, but he could not remember exactly how many. Mattie Collins had a large, well developed breast. When he went back to the house, two weeks after his professional services were discontinued, witness saw both mother and child, and asked how the latter was getting along. He then made no suggestions regarding the treatment of the child, nor did he make any inquiry about it other than the general one stated. He did not consider it his business to make suggestions with regard to the child, unless he was called upon professionally to do so. The mother was up, working about the house, and looked well and \u201chearty.\u201d Witness looked at the child, but made no examination of it. What he saw of it on that occasion would not warrant him, as an expert, to express an opinion of its condition. He did not know what produced the emaciated condition in which he found the child. Witness did not know the negro woman to whom his attention is now called by counsel, and had never seen her to his knowledge. Negro women make very good nurses for infants when under the supervision of whites. Witness had never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>heard the name of the child. This occurred in Bexar county, Texas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-5\">Doctor R. L. Graves testified, for the State, that he had been in the regular practice of medicine for forty-four years. Witness was present at the inquest held over the body of a child at the office of McAllister, the justice of the peace. Witness did not observe the gender of the child, but thought it to be about six weeks old at the time of its death. The appearance of the body was wasted and emaciated, and indicated that its death was produced by starvation or else by nourishment on bad milk. The witness was impressed with the idea that starvation was the immediate cause of the child\u2019s death, although it may have died from taking bad milk, or from some disease of the bowels produced by overfeeding. It is a fact that, at one time, about one-half the infants born in the cities of London and New York died from nourishment on impure milk. The child witness saw at McAllister\u2019s office had no \u201cvividness\u201d about its face or body, but looked as though it had wasted away gradually. The witness could not recall a single instance of the death of a child in the city of San Antonio, Bexar county, Texas, from imbibing impure milk. It was the opinion of the witness, as a physician, that nineteen out of twenty infants will die if given out to a negro woman to nurse, because few people, especially negroes, know how to feed infants on cow\u2019s milk. \u201cThe great emaciation would have to come on before the three or four days spoken of.\u201d An infant suffering from starvation would present the same appearance as one dying from mirasmus, which is the technical name for gradual wasting away. The removal of a five or six weeks old child from its mother would bring about the death of the child sooner if it had mirasmus than if it did not have that disease. The child inquired about in this case may have died from heart disease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-7\">Clarissa Crawford was the next witness for the State. She testified that she lived in a small, dilapidated cedar house, in the bushes, above the beer brewery in San Antonio, Texas. The house had two rooms in it and is cold and exposed. Witness had no stove, but made her fire in a hole in the floor. Witness had been married about three years, and had been the mother of five children, one of them colored. All of witness\u2019s children are dead. One of them died in infancy, and one of them lived to young manhood, when he was shot and killed. Witness\u2019s husband worked on the side walks. The witness had known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Mrs. O\u2019Connor for some time. She saw Mr. O\u2019Connor the one time when he came to witness\u2019s house to bring the child involved in this investigation. Mrs. O\u2019Connor came to the witness\u2019s house on the second Sunday before this trial for the first time in three years. She told witness that she wanted the witness to take care of a baby whose mother was dead. She did not mention the mother\u2019s name, though the witness asked it. She said that the child had been sick but was better. She agreed to pay witness eight dollars to pay for her trouble, and gave her two dollars with which to buy milk for the child. The witness agreed to keep the child a week. She brought the child, well wrapped in a shawl, and told witness not to unroll it, but to take it in and lay it down/ The child was brought to witness on a dark Sunday night. As it was sleeping well the witness did not unwrap it, but took it to bed with her in her cot. It rested well until about four o\u2019clock, when witness unwrapped it and found it so very poor and emaciated that she took the \u201c trembles\u201d and could not dress it. Witness was afraid to let the infant suck much, for it had every appearance of being starved, and there was great danger of over feeding it. Witness would not have taken the child had she seen it before Mrs. O\u2019Connor went back home. The child\u2019s cheeks, legs, stomach and arms were drawn in, and its stomach was yellow. Witness fed it on sweetened milk from a bottle early on Monday morning, and it nursed like it was starved. The man with Mrs. O\u2019Connor when the child was left with witness said nothing more than that he would soon be back. When they left they said nothing to witness about getting a doctor. They left an ample supply of clothing, including two flannel skirts and a shawl. They left two dollars for the purchase of milk, and witness got a quart of milk night and morning from Mrs. Smith, who lived near and kept a cow. The child drank about half a bottle of milk on Monday morning. It drank but little Monday night. It cried nearly all of Tuesday, and drank but little. The child slept well on Sunday night until it woke up, but slept little afterwards. Witness understood Mrs. Holmes to say that she was married to a Mr. Thompson, but doubtless was mistaken in the name. After the child died, witness got Mrs. Smith\u2019s sister to write a note to Mr. Kelson, signed \u201c Mrs. Holmes and Mr. Thompson,\u201d telling him of the child\u2019s death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b673-11\">On her cross examination the witness said that she was a good and experienced nurse for infants. Mrs, O\u2019Connor knew the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>witness as a good nurse. She was to pay the witness eight lars per month for earing for the child, and she furnished her with two dollars to buy milk. She brought the child wrapped in a woolen shawl. She brought also a bottle of milk. A child sleeping without food from early evening until four o\u2019clock in the morning, ought to nurse heartily. Babies, as a general rule, nurse heartily in the morning. The child was kept in the kitchen. The clothing furnished for the child was ample and sufficient. Witness had plenty of bedding, and her room, with the doors closed, was pleasant enough. The baby did not get cold. Witness was well prepared for the care of children, and this child was as well cared for as it could have, been by any body. Her house was kept clean and tidy. Mrs. Holmes (evidently Mrs. O\u2019Connor) knew that witness kept a clean house when she brought her the child. Mrs. Holmes told witness when she brought the baby where she lived, but witness had forgotten the address she gave. Mrs. Holmes brought the baby and Mr. O\u2019Connor the clothes. Mrs. Holmes told witness that her husband was dead, and that she had married a Mr. Thompson. The baby was at witness\u2019s house two days and three nights before its death. Witness did not know upon what food Mrs. Smith fed her cow, but the cow ran at large during the day. The child was so poor that it was impossible for one to tell it was sick. It cried only after taking milk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-4\">On redirect examination the witness said that she gave the milk furnished by Mrs. O\u2019Connor when the child woke up at four o\u2019clock, after she first got it. Mrs. Smith\u2019s cow\u2019s milk was given afterwards. The child was a female, but witness never heard its name called. It was in no condition to be taken from its mother when brought to witness. Witness could not leave with the child, and had no one to send for a doctor. Two gentlemen and a colored man had talked to witness about this matter. The colored man came to the house first. One of the white men told witness that he wanted her to tell the truth about this matter. The other did not enter witness\u2019s house. Witness left her home on the night before this trial, not because she was afraid to attend court; but because she had curious feelings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-5\">Mrs. Bertha Dietler testified, for the State, that she lived on Victoria street, in the fourth ward of the city of San Antonio. She knew the three relators as Mr. and Mrs. O\u2019Connor and Mrs. Smith. O\u2019Connor rented the witness\u2019s house, which was near the residence of witness, and the three relators, with some chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>dren and a baby, moved in on the sixth day of December, 1886. Witness never saw any men about the house. \u25a0 Witness saw that the baby looked sickly, and, on the day after the parties moved in, she asked Mrs. Smith (Mattie Collins) how the baby was. Mrs. Smith replied that it was a little sick, and that she was going to call in the doctor. . Witness never saw a doctor about the house. Witness saw the baby take milk from a bottle, but never saw Mrs. Smith nurse it. Mrs. Smith said that the reason she did not nurse the baby was it was not her child. When she said this she smiled as in jest. Witness did not ask Mrs. Smith who the mother of the baby was. She saw no reason why Mrs. Smith did not nurse the child. Witness knew nothing about the removal of the child, more than that Mrs. O\u2019Connor said that it had been taken to the Orphan\u2019s Home.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b675-4\">Cross examined, witness said that she saw milk administered to the baby from a bottle, and thought the milk was obtained from a goat kept in the yard. She knew nothing about Mrs. Smith\u2019s ability to nurse the child.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b675-5\">Mrs. Josephine Kingsley testified that she had license to practice medicine, and was connected with the San Antonio Orphan\u2019s Home. . The witness had known Mr. and Mrs. O\u2019Connor since their application for .the admission of a child to the Orphan\u2019s Home. That application was made about two weeks before this trial by Mr. O\u2019Connor, who said that the child was an orphan. The application was laid before the board, and witness was one of the committee appointed to receive the child if its orphanage and destitution should be established. Witness told O\u2019Connor that the child, if in fact an orphan and destitute, would be received. O\u2019Connor said that the child\u2019s name was Li\u00f3la May Smith. He said that he knew the mother of the child to be dead, but was unable to say that its father was dead. O\u2019Connor did claim relationship to the child, but said that it was brought to his wife to get a home for it, but that his wife had failed to find it a home. He did not say who brought the child to his wife. Mr. and Mrs. O\u2019Connor together brought the child to the Home, and Mrs. O\u2019Connor afterwards took it away. It was at the Home about a week, and was taken away on the second Friday before this investigation, because it was ascertained that its mother was still living and was not destitute. Witness saw O\u2019Connor on Thursday evening, and told him that because of the discovery the child would have to be taken from the Home. A dark complected man of medium height, called Jones by O\u2019Cod-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>nor, came with O\u2019Connor on Friday. O\u2019Connor appeared to be acting under Jones\u2019s orders, who said that the child would have to be taken away. Witness never afterwards saw Mr. O\u2019Connor. She was unable to say whether or not she would know Jones if she were to see him. Witness never saw the mother of the child. When she went to demand the removal of the child from the Home, she left a note with O\u2019Connor\u2019s landlady, telling O\u2019Connor that she had discovered the facts about the child, and that if he did not attend to the matter the authorities would. The child was in a very bad condition when it left the Home. It was much wasted away. Its condition may have been the result of starvation or of disease. It did not show symptoms of disease, but was restless, trying and emaciated, the usual indications of starvation. Witness prescribed only wholesome food, and the matron of the Home reported slight improvement in the child\u2019s condition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b676-5\">Cross examined, witness said that she could speak, of the child\u2019s improvement while at the Home, only upon the matron\u2019s report. While at the Home the child was fed on Mellen\u2019s food and cow\u2019s milk. Goat\u2019s milk was not used at the Home. Witness could not positively identify the man pointed out to her as the Mr. Jones who visited the Home With O\u2019Connor. He resembles Jones somewhat.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b676-6\">L. S. Hodges testified, for the State, that he had known the O\u2019Connors, husband and wife, since the early summer of 1886, and lived on the same place with them. Mattie Collins came to O\u2019Connor\u2019s house, as Mrs. Smith, in May or June, and was evidently pregnant at that time, and was afterwards delivered of a child. O\u2019Connor told witness that Mrs. Smith was an unfortunate woman who had been too intimate with her brother in law, and had come to his house to escape her troubles. He did not tell the witness who Mattie Collins\u2019s brother in law was. He never told witness that the mother of the child was not named Mrs. Smith, Witness frequently saw Mattie after she got up from child bed, but never had a talk with her about the child. Witness had seen men about the house, but did not know whom they came to see. Witness never saw the child while at O\u2019Connor\u2019s house. Mattie worked laboriously, ironing most of the time. They milked a goat while they lived on the place with witness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b676-7\">George H. Kalteyer testified, for the State, that he was a chemist and druggist. Witness analyzed some milk brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>to him by Sheriff Alexander, and pronounced it pure. It was admitted that the milk analyzed by Kalteyer came from the cow from which the milk was taken that was used by Clarissa Crawford. The State closed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b677-5\">Doctor Craves, recalled by the relators, testified that, next to mother\u2019s milk, the milk of an ass, the milk of a mare, and the milk of a goat, in the order named, is best for infant\u2019s food.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b677-6\">Mrs. Hodges testified, for the relators, that she did not know any thing about the care of the baby, which she saw but once at O\u2019Conner\u2019s. It was then about ten days old, and appeared to be healthy. Witness did not know how the O\u2019Conners fed the child, but thought on milk from a bottle. Witness thought the O\u2019Conners took good care of the child; in fact, she knew from what she saw and was told that the child had gpod care.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b677-7\">Mrs. Meyers testified, for.the relators, that she saw the child at O\u2019Conner\u2019s when it was about four days old. It looked well and healthy, and was apparently well cared for. It was comfortably clothed, and was kindly spoken of and handled by Mrs. O\u2019Conner. Witness afterwards, when its mother had gotten up, saw the baby. Its mother said it was then sick. It was well and carefully wrapped. All the parties seemed attached to the child. Witness was unable to say whether or not Mrs. Smith was able to nurse the child.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b677-8\"><em>J. A. &amp; N. O. Green, T. J.

Crim. Defenses; vol. 4, p. 105; Desty\u2019s Am. Crim. Law, secs. 57a and 124e; Bishop\u2019s Crim. Law, vol. 1, sec. 883; Roscoe\u2019s Crim. Ev., 3 Am. ed., p. 721; Taylor\u2019s Med. Jur., 8 Am. ed., p. 646.) The last authority says: \u201cA new born child kept long without food will die, and no evidence of the fact may be derivable from an examination of the body. There may be no marks of violence externally, nor any pathological changes internally, to account for death. This is a rare form of murder, except as it may be accidentally combined with exposure to cold. <em>In order to convict the mother, it is necessary to show that the child was willfully kept without food, with the criminal design of destroying it. </em>Mere neglect or imprudence will not make the case infanticide. The only appearance likely to be found on an examination of the body would be complete emptiness of the alimentary canal. Without corroborative circumstantial evidence, this would not suffice to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>establish the cause of death; a medical witness could only form a probable conjecture on the point. In a suspected case of this kind, the contents of the stomach should be tested for farinaceous and other kinds of food.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b678-4\">If it was lawful for Mattie Collins to raise the child upon goat\u2019s and cow\u2019s milk, at the Orphans\u2019 Home, and under the care of an experienced nurse, so that she might conceal from the public her disgrace and loss of chastity, then the case before the court is, at most, only negligent homicide.

In order that the child might have good care, and at the same time that she might be able to appear before the community, her friends and relatives as a virtuous woman, a place for the infant is obtained at the Orphan\u2019s Home by a subterfuge of O\u2019Connor and Mr. Jones.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b679-6\">8.

The testimony of the medical experts is as follows: Doctor Weathers, who called two and a half weeks after the birth of the child, says: \u201cI saw the child the day I called. It looked smaller and worse.
