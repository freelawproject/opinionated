The appeal is from an order granting plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-20\">From the record before us we consider the following facts as being without dispute. Appellant, Norton, was the owner of a race horse named Pocket Valu, which he had purchased in Kentucky. At the end of the 1962 racing season, the horse developed an inflammation in its left front foot and was taken to the Veterinary Clinic of Colorado State University for diagnosis and treatment. Doctors Wolff and Adams of the Clinic diagnosed the condition as navicular disease of the horse\u2019s front feet and Doctor Wolff performed an operation on the horse to correct the condition. A horse having had this particular operation performed upon it is thereafter referred to as having been \u201cheel nerved\u201d. Some months later soreness developed in the horse\u2019s legs and a second operation was performed on it to remove some nerve tumors. After the operations the horse had a successful racing season in 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-21\">Toward the end of that season appellee, Lindsay, became interested in buying the horse and sent his trainer to Denver to negotiate with Norton. During the negotiations and before the sale was agreed upon, appellant stated that the horse was \u201csound\u201d and that it had been \u201cheel nerved\u201d. Lindsay purchased the horse and paid Norton $40,000, with an oral agreement that if Lindsay retired the horse Norton was to receive stallion services from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-22\">Within a few weeks after purchasing the horse, Lindsay entered it in a race at Aqueduct Race Track. However, the horse was barred from racing by the track veterinarian because in his opinion it had been \u201chigh nerved\u201d. This term refers to an operation which is performed upon a horse, severing the main nerve before it enters the horse\u2019s foot. The operation disqualifies the horse from racing. Other veterinarians in the East Coast area confirmed the opinion of the track veterinarian to the effect that the horse had been \u201chigh nerved\u201d. Lindsay then notified Norton about the condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>tion of the horse and by letter attempted to rescind the sale and made a demand for the return of the sale price and offered to return the horse to Denver. Norton refused the demand and this action was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">After the action was commenced an examination of and an operation on the horse at Norton\u2019s request, pursuant to Rule 34, F.R.Civ.P., was had, which conclusively showed that the horse had been \u201chigh nerved\u201d. After this fact had been established in the case, Norton received permission from the court to file a third-party complaint bringing Doctors Wolff and Adams and Colorado State University into the case as third-party defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">On the basis of the pleadings, depositions, affidavits and exhibits on file in the case, the able trial judge concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact left in the case and granted a summary judgment to the plaintiff on the theory of express warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Appellant attacks the granting of summary judgment upon three grounds: (1) That the summary judgment precluded the third-party defendants from asserting against the plaintiff any defenses they may have under Rule 14(a), F.R.Civ.P.; (2) that a determination of whether the words \u201csound\u201d and \u201cheel nerved\u201d as spoken by Norton constitute an express warranty is a question of fact for a jury and cannot be disposed of as a matter of law; (3) the question of whether Lindsay relied upon the spoken words \u201csound\u201d and \u201cheel nerved\u201d as a warranty is a question of fact for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">There is no merit to the first point because appellant has no standing to raise the point on behalf of the third-party defendants. They are in court, represented by separate counsel, and are not now here complaining about the summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">At the outset of our consideration of points two and three, it should be pointed out that although appellant urges that the questions referred to in both points are matters to be determined by a jury, no jury demand was made by either side in the case and all questions of law and fact were left for determination by the court. Also, with reference to both points, we must keep in mind the general principles of law governing the granting of motions for summary judgment. That procedure may not be used as a substitute for a trial in the determination of genuine material factual issues. It should be used only in eases in which no issue of a material fact exists. See SMS Manufacturing Company v. U. S.-Mengel Plywoods, 10th Cir., 219 F.2d 606; Hunt v. Pick, 10th Cir., 240 F.2d 782 and Bolack v. Underwood, 10th Cir., 340 F.2d 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">With reference to appellant\u2019s point-two, the trial court found, as undisputed, the fact that Norton made at least two affirmations of fact concerning the horse, both of which had a natural tendency to induce a purchase. Those statements were \u201cthat the horse was sound\u201d and that \u201cit had been heel nerved\u201d and Norton admitted making both statements. The trial court relied upon the definition of express warranty as set out in Colorado\u2019s Uniform Sales Act, C.R.S. 1963, \u00a7 121-1-12:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-13\">\u201cAny affirmation of fact or any promise by the seller relating to the goods is an express warranty if the natural tendency of such affirmation or promise is to induce the buyer to purchase the goods, and if the buyer purchases the goods relying thereon. No affirmation of the value of the goods, nor any statement purporting to be a statement of the seller\u2019s opinion only shall be construed as a warranty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-14\">We agree with the trial judge that the affirmation of fact here was the words that \u201cthe horse was sound\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>special form of words is necessary to constitute a warranty. Rudd v. Rogerson, 133 Colo. 506, 297 P.2d 533 (1956). Appellant puts some stress on the fact that appellee\u2019s trainer carefully examined the horse before the sale. The fact that appellee\u2019s trainer did inspect the horse but did not detect the defect is of no importance for the facts conclusively show the defect was not ascertainable by a layman. Investigation is compatible with the giving of an express warranty. Only where the buyer clearly relies only upon his own investigation and waives the warranty will it be rendered inoperative, see Rudd v. Rogerson, supra, and Williston on Sales, Revised Edition, Vol. I, \u00a7 208 at p. 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The word \u201csound\u201d when used with reference to many animals and especially a horse has a special and particular connotation. The statement that a horse is \u201csound\u201d implies \u201cthe absence of any defect or disease which * * * will impair the animal\u2019s natural usefulness for the purpose for which it is purchased * 77 C.J.S. Sales \u00a7 330. In other words, using the word \u201csound\u201d in describing the horse in this case clearly constituted an express warranty of fitness as a race horse, which was the purpose for which it was purchased. If, as contended by appellant, the case had been tried to a jury, it would have been incumbent upon the trial judge to instruct the jury, as a matter of law, as to the meaning of the word \u201csound\u201d under the particular facts of the case. The court was clearly correct in considering, as a matter of law that the use of the word \u201csound\u201d in describing Pocket Yalu constituted an express warranty. Although there are some old cases to the contrary, this is the modern view. See Williston on Sales, supra, \u00a7 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Appellant\u2019s third point likewise is without merit. Williston on Sales, supra, \u00a7 206, succinctly disposes of the question in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">\u201cThere is danger of giving greater effect to the requirement of reliance than it is entitled to. * * * and as a general rule no evidence of reliance by the buyer is necessary other than the seller\u2019s statements were of \u00e1 kind which naturally would induce the buyer to purchase the goods and that he did purchase the goods.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">And later in the same section he continues :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-13\">\u201cIf a representation was evidently made for the purpose of inducing a sale, and was of a kind appropriate for that purpose and a sale followed, this should be enough.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-14\">Making even a stronger showing here, appellee affirmatively, and without contradiction, maintained that he did rely upon the affirmations of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-15\">The trial court properly and judiciously made use of the procedure for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-9\">. Appellant also stated that the horse was \u201cheel nerved\u201d. The trial court believed that this was tantamount to saying the horse was not high nerved. We do not pass on this contention for the statement the horse was sound establishes the warranty.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
