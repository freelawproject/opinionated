The plaintiff appeals from an order entered by the district court granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">We view the evidence and the inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the plaintiff to determine whether they are sufficient to show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact concerning the plaintiff\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">The complaint grows out of the refusal of Continental Oil Company to renew a service station lease and \u201cSupplemental Bailment Agreement\u201d for gasoline with the plaintiff. The \u201cSupplemental Bailment Agreement\u201d is terminable by either party \u201cfor cause\u201d at any time and is cancelable by either party without cause upon twenty-four hours\u2019 written notice. Unless canceled or terminated, the Agreement\u2019s term was the term of the accompanying service station lease. The lease is for one year. The \u201cSupplemental Bailment Agreement\u201d and the lease were made on Continental\u2019s printed forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">The plaintiff alleges that the lease was not renewed because the plaintiff would not comply with the demands of the defendant that he reduce his retail prices for gasoline. The plaintiff had given, the district sales representative for Continental \u201ca two-week trial at the prices, he wanted, and at the time he wanted it.\u201d Some other service station operators in the Company who were asked to cut their prices changed their prices but some did not. The person who replaced the plaintiff and operated the service station formerly operated by him agreed to start selling gasoline at the reduced prices, suggested by Continental\u2019s general sales, representative and complied with this agreement for a short time.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-16\">Continental Oil Company sells Conoco' branded gasoline in thirty states and the interstate character of the Company\u2019s business is undenied. Nor is it denied that the Company utilizes a substantial number of lease-type stations and dealer stations.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-17\">The plaintiff alleges that by a verbal agreement between the plaintiff and the Company, the plaintiff was not to handle or to sell any other products of the same line marketed or \u201csponsored\u201d by the Company. However, in his testimony on oral deposition, the plaintiff admitted that he could sell \u201canything in the world\u201d that he wanted to for cash or on his own credit. But the plaintiff could only charge Firestone and Goodrich tires and tubes on the Company\u2019s credit cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-18\">The district court concluded that the undisputed facts showed a simple unilateral refusal to deal by the defendant within the permissible bounds of United States v. Colgate &amp; Co., 1919, 250 U.S. 300, 39 S.Ct. 465, 63 L.Ed. 992. The district court deemed the complaint to be without substance and granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-19\">A supplier may not use coercion on its retail outlets to achieve resale-price maintenance. The Colgate doctrine presumes that there is no agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>ment to maintain retail prices.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here, agreements existed between two or more retail outlets in the same market. The ^coercive device in Continental\u2019s hands is its-\u201cSupplemental Bailment Agreement\u201d and lease with its short-term and cancellation provisions which may be used effectively to terminate not only the plaintiff\u2019s gasoline supply, but his whole service station business.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Such devices promise to be equally, if not more, effective in maintaining gasoline prices than were the techniques in fixing monopoly prices on drugs in United States v. Parke, Davis &amp; Co., 1960, 362 U.S. 29, 80 S.Ct. 503, 4 L.Ed.2d 505.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On similar facts, the Supreme Court has recently held that resale-price maintenance through such a coercive type of agreement is illegal under the antitrust laws. Simpson v. Union Oil Co.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The agreement involved in that case was a short-term \u201cconsignment\u201d agreement with cancellation provisions. Pursuant to the \u201cconsignment\u201d agreement the company set the prices at which the retailer sold the gasoline. It is argued by Continental that Simpson is distinguishable since the \u201cSupplemental Bailment Agreement\u201d does not allow Continental to set the retail prices. We do not think this is a significant distinction. Although accomplished extraneous to the \u201cSupplemental Bailment Agreement,\u201d a price agreement existed. Its existence is the significant fact. However, the Court in Simpson reserved \u201cthe question whether, when all the facts are known, there may be any equities that would warrant only prospective application in damages suits of the rule governing price fixing by the \u2018consignment\u2019 device which we announce today.\u201d This reservation seemingly refers to the inequity to subjecting the Union Oil Company to a triple damage action for conduct that was apparently legal until the narrowing of United States v. General Elec. Co.,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 1926, 272 U.S. 476, 47 S.C. 192, 71 L.Ed. 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-14\">In General Elec. Co., the Court held that the ban on resale-price maintenance did not prohibit price fixing when used as part of a bona fide consignment distribution system. The consignment agreement involved the distribution of a patented product but the Court did not restrict its ruling to patented articles; it said that the use of the consignment device was available to the owners of articles \u201cpatented or otherwise.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus courts have consistently viewed agencies created by <em>bona fide </em>consignments as beyond the scope of section 1 of the Sherman Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But ever since the passage of the Sherman Act, the courts have consistently refused to permit the requirement of antitrust to be circumvented by the easy expedient of dressing a sale in the vestments of a sham agency agreement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We do not deal with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>question of prospective application of the rule announced in Simpson because of the nature of the \u201cSupplemental Bailment Agreement\u201d in the present action. By the terms of the \u201cbailment,\u201d the plaintiff agreed \u201cto hold and care for gasoline delivered hereunder without compensation as the property of Cono-co.\u201d The plaintiff had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">\u201c * * * the option to purchase such stored gasoline from Conoco * * *. Bailee [the plaintiff] shall pay Conoco for all gasoline so purchased and withdrawn by Bailee upon invoice therefor submitted by Conoco * * *. All payments for the purchase price of said gasoline shall be at Conoco\u2019s dealer price, including all applicable federal, state and local excise taxes prevailing at the time and place of such purchase.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">* -\u00bb \u00ab\u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">****\u00ab\u2022\u00ab\u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-10\">\u201c * * * Upon any cancellation or termination hereof, Bailee shall promptly (a) pay Conoco for all gasoline purchased and withdrawn from storage by Bailee and then unpaid for by Bailee; (b) deliver to Conoco consigned gasoline not so previously purchased by Bailee, or at Bailee\u2019s election, purchase for cash such consigned gasoline from Conoco at Conoco\u2019s then prevailing dealer price therefor at Bailee\u2019s location plus all applicable taxes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">While the purchase is effected when and as the Bailee delivers gasoline to his customers from the gasoline storage tanks, \u201ctitle passing from Conoco to Bailee at the meters on the pumps,\u201d it is a title effectively passed. We find \u201cin the contracts themselves and their operation plain provision for purchases by the so-^T called agents which necessarily made the contracts as to an indefinite amount of the consignments to them, contracts of sale rather than of agency.\u201d United States v. General Elec. Co., 1926, 272 U.S. 476, 487, 47 S.Ct. 192, 196, 71 L.Ed. 362; see Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park &amp; Sons Co., 1911, 220 U.S. 373, 31 S.Ct. 376, 55 L.Ed. 502.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-17\">Concerning the plaintiff\u2019s claim of a \u201ctying\u201d arrangement, we hold that the legality of the credit card limitations to Firestone and Goodrich tires should be determined only after a trial. We need to know more than we do about the actual impact of these credit-card arrangements on competition to decide whether the effect of these arrangements is to tie the sale of one product to a different product or preclude the purchase of that product from any other supplier, and to decide whether these arrangements have a \u201cpernicious effect on competition and lack * * * any redeeming virtue,\u201d Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, 1958, 356 U.S. 1, 5, 78 S.Ct. 514, 518, 2 L.Ed.2d 545, and therefore violate the antitrust laws.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-19\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-20\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-12\">.
