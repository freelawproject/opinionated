The complaint alleged further and the appellee denied that the car was then owned and controlled by the code-fendant, appellee here, thus raising an issue as to ownership. Summary judgment was entered for the car dealer, the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">On appeal the appellant alleges error in that the movant had failed to comply with District Court Rule 9(h) which in pertinent part provides that a movant for summary judgment shall serve and file <em>\u201ca </em>statement of the material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue.\u201d An opposing party is permitted to file a concise statement \u201csetting forth all material facts as to which it is contended there exists a genuine issue necessary to be litigated.\u201d Thereupon the court may assume the facts to be as contended by the movant \u201cexcept as and to the extent that such facts are asserted to be actually in good faith controverted\u201d in the opposition statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-14\">The appellee with its \u201cStatement of Facts\u201d filed a copy of the retail installment contract entered into with Addison as of February 14, 1963, and of appellee\u2019s assignment of the paper to Commercial Credit Corporation as of February 15, 1963. Also exhibited was a copy of Addison\u2019s application to the District of Columbia for a certificate of title. That document described Addison as having acquired ownership of the vehicle on February 14, 1963, and also designated Commercial Credit Corporation as holder of the first and only lien on the car. Ap-pellee\u2019s \u201cStatement\u201d further cited to appellant\u2019s pre-trial interrogatory to Addison who was asked: \u201cWhen, from whom and under what terms did you obtain possession of the vehicle involved in this accident?\u201d and Addison\u2019s answer: \u201cThrough Jay Willis, salesman of ACP, Inc. on Feb. 14, 1963.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-15\">Appellant\u2019s \u201cOpposition\u201d contained no allegation that the February 14, 1963 transactions were sham or that the documents were fraudulent in any material respect. Appellant\u2019s Opposition rather pointed to a clause in the conditional sales contract: \u201cTitle to car shall remain in seller (Anacostia) until all amounts owing hereunder are fully paid in cash.\u201d Appellant further referred to her interrogatories to Addison and his reply that Anacostia \u201chad agreed to handle for him all insurance coverage necessary other than that required by the finance company, and that at the time of the accident [February 16] he was on his way to Defendant Anacostia, at its request.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Opposition also stated that Addison had said he never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>had paid for the tags which were \u201calready on the car when he took it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Appellee then filed a Reply to the Opposition and attached two additional exhibits: a Special Use Tag, issued by the District Department of Motor Vehicles on February 14, 1963, bearing \u201cName of owner David S. Addison\u201d ; and ap-pellee\u2019s invoice to Addison, dated February 14, 1963, in much detail which included items covering the District registration fee, inspection fee and \u201cTag serv. 2.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Addison\u2019s lawyer had died, but the judge was informed that Addison was in court without counsel when the appellee\u2019s motion came on for hearing. After respective counsel for the appellee and the appellant had argued their claims as to the effect of the documentary evidence, in light of the pleadings and the record of the pre-trial discovery proceedings, the judge asked if there was anything Addison wanted to say. \u201cNo, Your Honor,\u201d he replied.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">The record overwhelmingly supports the conclusion of the trier that there were no genuine issues of material fact as to Addison\u2019s ownership of the car on the day of the accident. The documentary evidence was irrefutable on its face as between Addison and the appellee. Certainly the allegation that Addison had not paid for the tags changed nothing, even if it were true despite record evidence to the contrary. If Addison and the company had an agreement that the latter was to arrange insurance coverage other than that for which Addison clearly had contracted to pay as the document showed, he was free to assert that claim against the appellee either in a cross-complaint or in a separate action. He did neither. His answer to the complaint had simply denied liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">Appellant had alleged only that \u201cUpon information and belief, said automobile was owned and controlled by Defendant Anacostia.\u201d To the extent reliance is now placed upon a clause in the conditional sales contract which reserved title to the seller, we read the instrument as providing only a typical means of achieving security for the unpaid balance of the agreed purchase price.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Conclusions of like import by our courts in not dissimilar situations are further reflected in the definition of \u201cOwner\u201d in the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which, in part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-10\">\u201cA person who holds the legal title of a vehicle, or in the event a vehicle is the subject of an agreement for the conditional sale or lease thereof * * * with an immediate right of possession vested in the conditional vendee or lessee * * * then such conditional vendee or lessee * * * shall be deemed the owner for the purpose of this chapter.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-13\">We find no error in the District Court\u2019s conclusion respecting the alleged failure by the appellee to comply with the court\u2019s Rule 9(h). Were that not so, however, after extensive consideration of the entire record, we are satisfied that in any event there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b831-15\">.
