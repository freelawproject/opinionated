It seems to me that the fact that there is a <em>de novo </em>trial upon appeal in the Circuit Court can not give validity to detention in the meantime that is justified solely by the judgment entered by the Justice\u2019s court.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-26\">As to the suggestion that a habeas corpus petition might be available in the State courts, I can only say that the Supreme Court of Mississippi has rejected this idea in Hitt v. State, 149 Miss. 718, 115 So. 879, where the Court found that a conviction by a Justice of the Peace under the circumstances here present does not violate the Federal Constitution, and also said, \u201cHitt would not have been entitled to a writ of habeas corpus to secure his liberty.\u201d I do not think that we should speculate that the State court might now reverse its previous views, and, on this speculation, conclude that an effective remedy is available.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-27\">Rehearing denied; Tuttle, Chief Judge, dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
