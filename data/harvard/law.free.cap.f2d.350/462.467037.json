The parties agree on the relevance to the Section 404(b) question of the standard ratemaking principle that discrimination between shippers is not unjust if the service provided one is not \u201clike and contemporaneous\u201d to that provided another, or if the transportation is not of a \u201clike kind of traffic,\u201d or if the carriage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>involves \u201ccircumstances and conditions\u201d not substantially similar. See Section 2 of the Interstate Commerce Act, 24 Stat. 379, as amended, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, which the Board has followed in its administration of Section 404(b) of the Aviation Act. E.g., Military Tender Investigation, <em>supra; </em>Tour Basing Fares, 14 C.A.B. 257 (1951); Summer Excursion Fares, 11 C.A.B. 218 (1950).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b511-15\">BURGER, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b511-16\">Petitioner, The Flying Tiger Line, an air carrier licensed for scheduled movement of air freight, seeks review of Civil Aeronautics Board Order No. E 20990, which dismissed without a hearing its complaint against a tariff filed by Pan American World Airways. The challenged tariff sets forth special low rates limited to military stores and impedimenta moving under United States Government bills of lading for the Department of Defense; it deals with air freight transportation chiefly to Asia, Africa and Europe.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-17\">Pan American is a combination carrier licensed for both freight and passenger carriage; Flying Tiger carries freight only and in the past has carried air cargo for Military Air Transport Service (MATS) at the lowest rates permitted by the Board. The operations of the Defense Department are of such magnitude that it is the largest single shipper in foreign air transport. Necessarily, the allocation of this carriage among available carriers has an important impact on the civil air transport system. The Board does not have direct statutory power to fix rates in foreign carriage as it does in interstate transportation and to territories and possessions of the United States. Section 1002(f) of the Act, 72 Stat. 789, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1482(f), gives it power over foreign rates applicable only \u201cto the extent necessary to correct [unjust or undue] discrimination, preference, or prejudice\u201d which is disclosed after hearing and notice before the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-18\">Even without direct rate making power the Board has exercised significant indirect control over foreign rates under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>its veto power over rates fixed under procedures of International Air Transport Association. Another source of such control is the power to fix minimum rates for military carriage which are not governed by Association established rates; this is done by making such minimum rates a condition of the operating authority granted pursuant to Section 416 (b) exemptions. 72 Stat. 771, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1386(b). Pan American\u2019s rates under review here are no lower than the Board\u2019s latest minimum rates under a 1964 Board order renewing an exemption covering service to foreign points from various Air Force Bases. The present rates, however, are not offered under any exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Flying Tiger\u2019s complaint contends that the Pan American tariff is an impermissible classification of a <em>shipper </em>rather than the familiar classification of a <em>commodity </em>and is therefore discriminatory and in violation of Section 404(b) and Section 403(b) of the Act, the latter being the Section which authorizes an air carrier to grant free or reduced fare carriage to specified classes of persons of which the United States Government is not one.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In Flying Tiger\u2019s complaint it affirmatively posed the issue as one \u201cpurely legal\u201d for which there was \u201cno reason, need, or requirement for an evidentiary hearing.\u201d Pan American in moving similarly for summary disposition pointed to the historical background of Board approval of low rates available only under United States Government Bills of Lading for military supplies; it also pointed to similar discrimination applicable to government freight carried by other carriers including Flying Tiger\u2019s charter rates with MATS, all substantially less than commercial rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">Petitioner\u2019s complaint asserted that Pan American\u2019s rates violate Section 404 (b) of the Federal Aviation Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the ground that the limitation to Defense Department shipments unjustly discriminates against other shippers as a matter of law. Petitioner asked the Board summarily to order Pan American to discontinue the challenged rates, averring that the notice and hearing contemplated by Section 1002(f) of the Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were unnecessary since Pan American\u2019s tariff was illegal on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">The Board dismissed Petitioner\u2019s complaint and declined for the present to initiate a formal investigation \u201clooking to whether or not the subject rates of Pan American or the numerous other fares and rates currently applicable to military transportation are unjustly discriminatory.\u201d In taking this action the Board relied chiefly on its conclusion in <em>Military Tender Investigation, </em>28 C.A.B. 902 (1959), that special fares for military personnel traveling at government expense do not violate Section 404(b) since such travel involves \u201ccircumstances and conditions\u201d substantially different from those presented by travel by civilians.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>In this court the Board has maintained its position that carriage of military property for the Government involves \u201ccircumstances and conditions\u201d justifying special rates. It argues additionally that military goods shipped by the Government and physically comparable goods shipped by private persons are not within the contemplation of the term \u201clike traffic\u201d and consequently that no question of discrimination can arise. Petitioner denies both contentions. We find it unnecessary to pass on either.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Nothing advanced at argument persuades us that Pan American\u2019s rates are illegal <em>as a matter of law </em>under the criteria set out in note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\"> The narrow question presented by this record is whether the Board abused its discretion in refusing to investigate the allegation of unjust discrimination. We cannot say that it did. The duty imposed on the Board by Section 1002(a) of the Act, 72 Stat. 788, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1482(a), to investigate complaints when there is a \u201creasonable ground\u201d for doing so is a duty to exercise its sound discretion. In the exercise of such discretion, the Board may dismiss even a legally sufficient complaint. Flight Engineers Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n v. C. A. B., 118 U.S.App.D.C. 112, 332 F.2d 312 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\"> Petitioner\u2019s complaint provided the Board with no guidance as to the how and why of the Section 404(b) illegality it alleged to inhere in Pan American\u2019s tariff. That Section exists to protect <em>shippers, </em>not carriers. <em>Cf. </em>I. C. C. v. Baltimore &amp; O. Ry., 145 U.S. 263, 281, 12 S.Ct. 844, 36 L.Ed. 699 (1892). The Board concedes and we assume for present purposes that that fact does not deprive Petitioner of standing as a carrier to challenge the Board\u2019s action in this court. But it seems to us that Petitioner\u2019s complaint had to make a plausible case that Pan American\u2019s rates would cause some substantial injury to <em>shippers </em>in order to require the Board to take action. We do not think that Petitioner\u2019s assertion that it \u201cis a sometime shipper of transpacific airfreight of the kind and character * * * moved by PAA for the U. S. government under the low impedimenta tariff\u201d is sufficient to do so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">In holding that Petitioner\u2019s complaint did not require action by the Board we do not pass upon the Board\u2019s reliance on its decision in <em>Military Tender Investigation, supra. </em>Even if that decision was correct \u2014 and we intimate no opinion on the subject \u2014 it does not necessarily control the issue of the legality of Pan American\u2019s tariff here. In its <em>Military Tender </em>holding the Board relied chiefly on facts showing lower costs for the domestic transportation of military as opposed to civilian personnel and on the existence of strong competition between air and surface carriers for military passengers within the United States. What conditions of this general nature obtain with respect to the <em>foreign </em>transportation of military <em>property </em>we have no way of- knowing from the <em>Military Tender </em>decision or from anything now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-13\">In arguing that Pan American\u2019s rates are illegal per se, Flying Tiger relies also on the absence of the Government from the list of persons in Section 403 (b) of the Act, 72 Stat. 759, as amended, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373(b), who may be afforded special rates.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But that Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>tion, as its heading indicates, seems to be concerned with the observance by carriers of tariffs they have filed and the avoidance of rebates except as authorized by that Section and Board regulations thereunder. Whether published rates are themselves discriminatory seems to raise a problem rather within the rubric of Section 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">The Board argues, on the other hand, that Section 403(b) justifies Pan American\u2019s rates. This argument encounters the same difficulty as Flying Tiger\u2019s, namely, that the Section\u2019s concern is observance of published tariffs, not discrimination. Moreover, the authorization for reduced rates in this Section appears to deal exclusively with carriage of passengers except for its tangential adversi\u00f3n to the carriage of property in relief of general epidemics, etc. <em>Cf. American Express Co. v. United States, </em>212 U.S. 522, 29 S.Ct. 315, 53 L.Ed. 635 (1909). And the Section seems to contemplate exemptions from its provis-sions concerning reduced rates only under such circumstances as the Board by regulation prescribes; no such regulations have been cited to us. Finally, even if Section 403(b) could be taken to establish the <em>prima facie </em>validity of special rates to the Government for military impedimenta and stores, those rates might still be subject to challenge under Section 404(b). <em>Cf. </em>Nashville, C. &amp; St. L. Ry. v. Tennessee, 262 U.S. 318, 43 S.Ct. 583, 67 L.Ed. 999 (1923). We mention the Section 403(b) arguments only because the parties have argued them at length; all we decide is that Section 403(b) does not, as a matter of law, invalidate Pan American\u2019s rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Petitioner having failed to allege facts, adduce evidence or advance reasons compelling Board action on its complaint,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we accordingly affirm the Board\u2019s dismissal of that complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-6\">.

Petitioner failed to allege, for example, that Pan American\u2019s rates are noncompensatory. Such an allegation would be a factor for the Board to consider in the exercise of its discretion in deciding whether to pursue a complaint like Petitioner\u2019s. Some have urged repeal of Section 22 of the Interstate Commerce Act, 24 Stat. 379, as amended, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 22, which authorizes carriage of government property at reduced rates, on the theory that such rates have been responsible for offsetting increases in rates to commercial shippers.
