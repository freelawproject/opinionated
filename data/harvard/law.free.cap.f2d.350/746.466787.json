She was thereupon held in contempt of court and committed to the custody of the United States Marshal for the District of Columbia until such time as she agreed to comply with the court order. We granted stay of the commitment order pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">In seeking reversal of the contempt order appellant first contends that the immunity grant extended by the terms of 2 D.C.Code \u00a7 1514 includes immunity for an offense for which the witness has been convicted in the District Court but upon which the judgment of conviction is non-final because a timely appeal from the judgment is pending. In Frank v. United States, 120 U.S.App.D.C. -, 347 F.2d 486 (1965), we held that the immunity granted does encompass such a conviction. But this holding does not alter appellant\u2019s obligation to testify when directed to do so and, therefore, the adjudication of civil contempt must be affirmed. Piemonte v. United States, 367 U.S. 556, 81 S.Ct. 1720, 6 L.Ed.2d 1028 (1961); Reina v. United States, 364 U.S. 507, 81 S.Ct. 260, 5 L.Ed.2d 249 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">The immunity statute does not operate unless the witness testifies or gives evidence over his claim of privilege against self-incrimination. Once evidence is given, the witness cannot be \u201cprosecuted or subject to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning\u201d that evidence. 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 1514. In Frank v. United States, <em>supra, </em>the witness Angelone, while his appeal was pending, gave evidence relating to the subject matter of his conviction in compliance with a court order. His conviction was vacated on the theory that a subsequent affirmance would subject him to penalty in violation of the immunity statute. 120 U.S.App.D.C. at -, 347 F.2d at 491. Assuming appellant\u2019s testimony would be related to the matters involved in her conviction, <em>cf. </em>8 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2282, p. 512 (McNaughton rev. 1961), the decision in <em>Frank </em>would seem to apply to vacate that conviction, but this fact does not provide any ground for reversing the contempt order here considered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-14\">Appellant also argues that since the language \u201cin any criminal proceeding * * * against him in any court\u201d on which the Supreme Court relied in Ullmann v. United States, 350 U.S. 422, 76 S.Ct. 497, 100 L.Ed. 511, 53 A.L.R.2d 1008 (1956), in upholding the constitutionality of the Immunity Act of 1954, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3486(c), is missing from 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 1514, the District immunity statute is unconstitutional. We find that any uncertainty as to the immunity provided by 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 1514, with reference to state as well as federal prosecutions, has been eliminated by Murphy v. Waterfront Comm\u2019n, 378 U.S. 52, 84 S.Ct. 1594, 12 L.Ed.2d 678 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-16\">WILBUR K. MILLER, Senior Circuit Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b795-10\">. The appeal from appellant\u2019s conviction (No. 19,199) was argued before this court on June 4, 1965. If, while the appeal is pending, appellant should give evidence entitling her to relief under <em>Franh, </em>counsel should inform the court so that that appeal may be properly disposed of.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
