DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, Respondent.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b776-9\">No. 19085.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b776-10\">United States Court of Appeals District of Columbia Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b776-11\">April 28, 1965.</decisiondate>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b776-12\">Petition for Rehearing En Banc Denied Oct. 7, 1965.</otherdate>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Before Bazelon, Chief Judge, Fahy, Circuit Judge, and Bastian, Senior Circuit Judge, in Chambers.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Order</p>\n<author id=\"b777-6\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">On consideration of petitioner\u2019s petition for the allowance of an appeal from the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, of petitioner\u2019s brief in support thereof, and of respondent\u2019s brief in opposition thereto, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">Ordered by the court that petitioner\u2019s aforesaid petition be granted, and petitioner is allowed to appeal from the judgment of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in this case.</p>\n<author id=\"b777-9\">BAZELON, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">Petitioner was convicted in the Court of General Sessions for using \u201cprofane language, indecent and obscene words and engaging] in disorderly conduct,\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 11-741 (c), 17-801 (b) (Supp. V, 1965). He was sentenced to a $25.00 fine or ten days in prison, and he paid the fine. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals refused to allow an appeal. Petitioner now seeks allowance of an appeal in this court. The court grants this petition today because of the importance of the issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">If I should be a member of the division of this court which hears this appeal, I would wish the parties to brief and the court to consider the additional matters (a) whether an alternative sentence of fine or imprisonment is an invalid discrimination between those who are able to pay and those who are not, see Wildeblood v. United States, 109 U.S.App.D.C. 163, 284 F.2d 592 (1960) (opinion of Edgerton, C. J.); (b) whether this question is mooted by payment of the fine; and (c) whether this question may properly be considered by this court though it was not raised before the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b777-14\">BASTIAN, Senior Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"aae-dedup-0\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-15\">I would not grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-16\">Further, if I should be a member of the division of this court which hears this appeal, I would not have the additional point raised by Judge Bazelon, and not raised by petitioner, briefed or argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-17\">It is obvious that this latter matter is not before us, as the petitioner has not only not raised the point but has paid the fine; and I am quite positive he would not want to risk, on resentencing (if the conviction is finally affirmed), the possibility that the trial judge would impose a straight jail sentence, which, under the law, he may do.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
