Klaw was also indicted on forty-one counts for using the mails to carry certain \u201ccirculars, advertisements and notices, * * which were non-mailable in that they gave information directly and indirectly, where, how, from whom and by what means, certain obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy and vile articles, matters and things might be obtained.\u201d Eleven of these counts were eventually dismissed, leaving thirty.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-23\">The conspiracy was said to have run from June 1, 1960, until the date of the indictment, June 27, 1963. The substantive counts were each based on individual mailings of materials over a period running from July 25, 1958, to May 6, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-24\">At a jury trial, the Government produced six witnesses whose receipt (or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>whose son\u2019s receipt) of circulars and materials had been the basis of thirteen of the thirty-four \u201cobscene materials\u201d counts and ten of the thirty \u201cpublicizing\u201d counts. The lion\u2019s share of these mailings had been to one Duane Thoman of LaGrange, Kentucky, which name was one of the 300 or so aliases of Postal Inspector Harry Simon of Washington, D. C., who testified at the trial. Three of the Government\u2019s witnesses were parents who, while rummaging through Junior\u2019s bureau drawer, found that their respective adolescent offspring were exploring on their own a new world just coming into view. One Junior also testified but only as to his receipt of items from Nutrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Klaw is the owner of Nutrix Co., a New York based establishment that prints and publicizes materials \u2014 stories, photographs and drawings in the \u201cbondage\u201d genre. Much solicitation and distribution is carried on through the mails, particularly by way of mail order ads appearing in magazines likely to have a male clientele. These \u201cbondage\u201d booklets usually contain some twenty to twenty-five photographs or crude drawings of females \u2014 some scantily clad, some tightly trussed, and all voluptuous \u2014 subjecting other women and men to various tortures and indignities, including violent and forcible deformation of the body, while being gagged, fettered and bound in bizarre postures. The booklets bore such titles as \u201cSorority Girls Stringent Initiation,\u201d \u201cFemale Doctor Forced into Bondage,\u201d \u201cGirls Concentration Camp Ordeals,\u201d \u201cDominating Woman Turns Man into Girl,\u201d \u201cMen in the Ladies Room,\u201d and the like. A text in each booklet described in a puerile and asinine fashion the activity depicted in the drawings. One booklet entitled \u201cThe Devil of Yoch-erwalden\u201d pictures female \u201cGazi\u201d guards subjecting female prisoners to brutal tortures at the direction of the \u201cGazi\u201d commandant \u201cElsi Achstunk.\u201d The captives and tormentors are drawn with exaggerated female physical characteristics, clothed in tight-fitting garments, wearing black leather shoes with very high heels, and posed in unreal positions. There were also photographs of \u201cFighting Girls,\u201d corset and high heel shoe scenes, and girls in rubber apparel. Photographs offered for sale were in many instances taken from motion pictures said to have been recently released, such as \u201cBlood of the Vampire,\u201d \u201cSlaves of Carthage,\u201d and \u201cThe Mystery of the Black Whip.\u201d Amateur \u201cbondage\u201d photographs were often solicited. Bulletins published by Nutrix advertised r its publications in various bondage series. All these materials are described to us as being \u201csado-masochistic,\u201d and we are referred to Krafft-Ebing\u2019s <em>Psychopathic Sexualis </em>for further elucidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Nutrix is apparently a long-time disseminator of substantially the same type of bondage materials as those involved here. Surveillance by the Postal authorities (Inspector Simon) had commenced in 1951 and continued for four years, at which time no criminal reference was made. However, an administrative proceeding was then begun which culminated in the Postmaster-General\u2019s ordering that mail addressed to Klaw be marked \u201cunlawful\u201d and returned to the sender, pursuant to then 39 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 259a (now 39 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4006). Klaw sought to enjoin the Postmaster from implementing that order, but was unsuccessful. See Klaw v. Schaffer, 151 F.Supp. 534 (S.D.N.Y.1957). This court affirmed <em>per curiam </em>the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Postmaster General had acted within his statutory authority and that there was substantial evidence in that record to support the hearing examiner\u2019s finding that the material was obscene. 251 F.2d 615 (2d Cir. 1958). This court\u2019s judgment was vacated by the Supreme Court on other grounds and the complaint was dismissed. 357 U.S. 346, 78 S.Ct. 1369, 2 L.Ed.2d 1368 (1958). Thereupon Inspector Simon resumed his investigation. In 1960 he recommended prosecution, but no official action was taken until 1963. Kramer apparently began working for Nutrix in 1960 as manager of the New Jersey warehouse. In addition to these facts, the jury also had visual im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>pressions from observation of the Nutrix materials introduced on trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Defendants were found guilty on each of the sixty-five counts that went to the jury. Klaw received concurrent sentences of two years\u2019 imprisonment on counts 1 to 5, with a $1,000 fine on each count; he received a suspended sentence on each of the remaining counts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Kramer was fined $2,500 on count 1 and received a suspended sentence. Both Klaw and Kramer appeal, claiming that their motion for a directed verdict of acquittal was erroneously denied because there was insufficient evidence relating the Nutrix materials to \u201cobscenity\u201d or to \u201cprurient interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In approaching this controversy arising out of another of our society\u2019s attempts at censorship, it is helpful to have in mind the scope of the problem and the variety of ways in which it arises. Cases in the Supreme Court over the past decade or so have come into being because state and city police officers, state attorneys general and federal district attorneys, state motion picture licensing bureaus, state youth morality commissions, federal Post Office Examiners and Inspectors, state and federal judges, and juries have considered a variety of movies, books and magazines to be \u201csacrilegious,\u201d \u201cimmoral,\u201d \u201cobscene,\u201d or \u201cobjectionable.\u201d The specific items have run the gamut from motion pictures like \u201cThe Miracle,\u201d \u201cLa Ronde,\u201d \u201cM,\u201d \u201cNative Son,\u201d \u201cThe Game of Love,\u201d \u201cLady Chatterley\u2019s Lover,\u201d \u201cLes Amants,\u201d and \u201cA Stranger Knocks\u201d to books like \u201cNights of Horror,\u201d \u201cPeyton Place,\u201d \u201cPleasure Was My Business,\u201d and \u201cTropic of Cancer,\u201d to magazines like \u201cOne \u2014 The Homosexual Magazine,\u201d \u201cMANual,\u201d \u201cTrim,\u201d \u201cGrecian Guild Pictorial,\u201d \u201cPlayboy,\u201d \u201cRogue,\u201d \u201cFrolic,\u201d other \u201cgirlie-type\u201d magazines, and nudist magazines. Publishers, exhibitors, distributors and sellers of these materials have been subjected in state and federal courts and agencies to set-backs including stiff fines and jail sentences, seizure of the materials, injunctions against distribution, denial of licenses needed to exhibit a motion picture, and loss of the privilege to use the United States mails to distribute and publicize the materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">The censors\u2019 successes have been short-lived, however, for in virtually every case decided by the Supreme Court, the dis-seminator has had a favorable result on one ground or another, save for three cases decided on one day in 1957.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>are significant here \u2014 Roth v. United States and Alberts v. California, both reported at 354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957), which deal with the constitutional protection and definition of \u201cobscenity,\u201d and which constitute the first and apparently only opinion subscribed to by a majority of the Court. In both cases convictions for violation of federal and state statutes pertaining to \u201cobscenity\u201d were upheld by divided Courts \u2014 5 to 4 in Roth, and 6 to 3 in Alberts.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">But if the censors won the battles of Roth and Alberts, the subsequent application of the principles of those cases suggests that as far as the war against pornography goes, the victory was only Pyrrhic. Since 1957 and Roth the \u201cobscenity\u201d situation has advanced rapidly. Then Lady Chatterley was still enjoying her clandestine sylvan trysts with her earthy gamekeeper; Fanny Hill\u2019s lively and apparently continuous actions were known only to the foreign traveling elite or to the reader of a smuggled copy; and \u201cTropic of Cancer\u201d was still being seized by vigilant customs agents as contraband. Suddenly the entire picture changed. Whether encouraged by the courts, or whether literary styles turned towards super-realism, or both, authors and publishers were quick to capitalize on the \u201cmodern\u201d trend \u2014 a trend which they largely made. \u201cLady Chatterley\u2019s Lover\u201d in paperback editions was sold to countless thousands with the court\u2019s opinion of approbation attached as a major part of its advertising. No longer did Constance enjoy the privacy of her woodland. Millions of eyes ogling with interest (\u201cprurient\u201d interest probably) stared at her and her lover whilst they enjoyed those moments which court opinions cannot describe lest they risk going \u201csubstantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or representation of such matters.\u201d Roth, supra, 357 U.S. at 487, n. 20, 77 S.Ct. at 1310.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">\u201cTropic of Cancer\u201d was brought out from under the counter and dusted off. In 1962 it was approved (four justices approving, three dissenting) for public reading by a Massachusetts court. See Attorney General v. Book Named \u201cTropic of Cancer,\u201d 345 Mass. 11, 184 N.E.2d 328 (1962). In Wisconsin by an equally close vote (four-to-three), the Supreme Court reversed a lower court decision declaring the book \u201cobscene\u201d and held that, although \u201c[m]ueh of the language in the book would be offensive to many\u201d and that in one or two instances the \u201cshort English words of ancient origin\u201d were \u201cobscene,\u201d nevertheless, despite the fact that some episodes would \u201cappeal to prurient interests,\u201d it was the court\u2019s duty \u201cto respect and enforce in full measure the freedom of expression guaranteed by state and federal constitutions.\u201d McCauley v. Tropic of Cancer, 20 Wis.2d 134, 151, 121 N.W.2d 545, 554 (1963). The Supreme Court of California reviewed a decision determining the book to be \u201cobscene\u201d and, after a comprehensive survey of post-Roth decisions, unanimously reversed. Zeitlin v. Arnebergh, 59 Cal.2d 901, 31 Cal.Rptr. 800, 383 P.2d 152, cert. denied, 375 U.S. 957, 84 S.Ct. 445, 11 L.Ed.2d 315 (1963). The New York Court of Appeals in People v. Fritch, 13 N.Y.2d 119, 243 N.Y.S.2d 1, 192 N.E.2d 713 (1963) also by a four-to-three vote held the same book to be \u201cobscene\u201d and reversed a determination by the County Court to the contrary, thus reinstating a conviction by a jury, although ordering a new trial on the issue of <em>scienter. </em>This decision, however, the same court (also by a four-to-three vote) considers as having been \u201cnow overruled by Grove Press, Inc. v. Gerstein, 378 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>577, 84 S.Ct. 1909 [12 L.Ed.2d 1035].\u201d Larkin v. G. P. Putnam\u2019s Sons, 14 N.Y.2d 399, 404, 252 N.Y.S.2d 71, 75, 200 N.E.2d 760, 763 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The most cursory perusal of the cases makes it obvious that the various agencies, officers, judges and juries that initially find material \u201cobscene\u201d do not have the last word to say on the matter. Rather, the Supreme Court has left no doubt that any abnegation of judicial supervision in the \u201cobscenity\u201d field would be inconsistent with its duty to uphold constitutional guarantees. The issue \u201cmust ultimately be decided by this [the Supreme] Court.\u201d Jacobellis v. State of Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 188, 84 S.Ct. 1676, 1679, 12 L.Ed.2d 793 (1964). Mr. Justice Brennan explicitly declared that \u201cthis Court cannot avoid making an independent constitutional judgment oh the facts of the case as to whether the material involved is constitutionally protected.\u201d Id. at 190, 84 S.Ct. at 1679. He added that \u201c[t]his is precisely what the Court did in Times Film Corp v. City of Chicago, 355 U.S. 35 [78 S.Ct. 115, 2 L.Ed.2d 72]; One, Inc. v. Olesen, 355 U.S. 371 [78 S.Ct. 364, 2 L.Ed.2d 352] ; and Sunshine Book Co. v. Summerfield, 355 U.S. 372 [78 S.Ct. 365, 2 L.Ed.2d 352].\u201d Id. at 190, n. 6, 84 S.Ct. at 1679. In examining the material in Times Film, the Supreme Court did not yield in its judgment to the Chicago Police Commissioner and persons appointed by him to inspect the film, \u201cThe Game of Love,\u201d a District Court judge, and the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which found that \u201cthe calculated purpose * * * and its (the film\u2019s) dominant effect, are substantially to arouse sexual desires.\u201d 244 F.2d 432, 436 (7th Cir. 1957). In One, Inc., the Postmaster, a district judge and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had determined that the homesexual magazine \u201cOne\u201d had \u201ca primary purpose of exciting lust, lewd and lascivious thoughts and sensual desires in the minds of the persons reading it,\u201d 241 F.2d 772, 778 (9th Cir. 1957). And in Sunshine Book, the Postmaster, a Hearing Examiner, the Department Solicitor, the District Court and five out of eight judges on the Court of Appeals for the D.C.Circuit found a \u201cnudist\u201d magazine to come within the proscription of the statute. 101 U.S.App.D.C. 358, 249 F.2d 114 (1957). Thus, the Court has definitely accepted the responsibility of being the final arbiter and has refused to accept the judgments of officials, judges or juries to the contrary. The \u201csufficient evidence\u201d test on review advocated by the Chief Justice has not been adopted. See Jaco-bellis v. State of Ohio, supra, 378 U.S. at 190, n. 6, 84 S.Ct. 1676 (dissenting opinion). The burden on this court at this appellate stage should be no less. And the enlarged judicial function in this area requires that we consider the proof or lack thereof and the manner in which the case was placed before the jury, not just whether the material could possibly be brought within the range of the so-called \u201cobscenity\u201d statute. What, then, upon review, does this record disclose ?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The Government rested its case largely on a showing of the exhibits themselves insofar as proof of the \u201cobscene\u201d nature of the Nutrix materials was concerned. As for those exhibits, we need add little to what we have already said. It may be conceded that the \u201csado-masochistic\u201d trash disseminated by Nutrix is not artistic or aesthetically pleasing. Nor is any claim made that it has any redeeming literary or social value whatsoever; it is difficult to imagine such a claim being made, at least on traditional grounds. But cf. People v. Birch, 40 Misc.2d 626, 243 N.Y.S.2d 525 (Sup.Ct.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">As for the statute involved, it is hardly a model of drafting precision or clarity. Section 1461 and the subsequent sections of the \u201cobscenity\u201d chapter are regret<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>tably short on terminological and grammatical consistency. Thus, section 1461,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which is entitled \u201cMailing obscene or crime-inciting matter,\u201d refers in one part to matter that is \u201cobscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile\u201d ; the other part, dealing generally with abortion and conception prevention, refers to \u201cindecent or immoral\u201d uses and purposes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For section 1461 only \u201cindecent\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>is specifically defined to include matter \u201ctending to incite arson, murder, or assassination.\u201d Section 1462,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> entitled \u201cImportation or transportation of obscene matters\u201d refers to certain matters that are \u201cobscene, lewd, lascivious or filthy\u201d (but not \u201cvile\u201d) or of \u201cindecent\u201d character, as well as \u201cindecent and immoral\u201d uses (again, in a subsection relating to abortion and conception prevention). Section 1463,\u00ae entitled \u201cMailing indecent matter on wrappers or envelopes\u201d refers to \u201cindecent, lewd, lascivious, or obscene\u201d (but not \u201cfilthy,\u201d \u201cvile,\u201d or \u201cimmoral\u201d) delineations and epithets. Section 1464,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> entitled \u201cBroadcasting obscene language,\u201d refers to \u201cobscene, indecent, or profane\u201d (but not \u201clewd,\u201d \u201clascivious,\u201d \u201cfilthy,\u201d \u201cvile,\u201d or \u201cimmoral\u201d) utterances. Lastly, section 1465,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> entitled \u201cTransportation of obscene matters for sale or distribution\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>refers to matter that is \u201cobscene, lewd, lascivious, or filthy\u201d (but not \u201cvile\u201d or \u201cprofane\u201d) or of \u201cindecent or immoral\u201d character. Thus, as the chapter heading suggests, all five sections are concerned with \u201cobscene\u201d matter. They also each mention \u201cindecent,\u201d but apply it variously to \u201ccharacter,\u201d \u201cuse\u201d and \u201cpurpose.\u201d The other terms \u2014 \u201clewd,\u201d \u201clascivious,\u201d \u201cfilthy,\u201d \u201cvile,\u201d \u201cimmoral\u201d and \u201cprofane\u201d \u25a0 \u2014 are used only sporadically.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">It should not be surprising, then, that the results of judicial attempts to apply these and similarly worded statutes consistently with the First Amendment have produced strange results. The broad freedom of expression so preferentially protected by the First Amendment, cf. United States v. Carolene Prods. Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152, n. 4, 58 S.Ct. 778, 82 L.Ed. 1234 (1938), has been found to have an exceptional enclave for \u201cobscenity.\u201d The varied and vague terms in such statutes are often subsumed within the one term \u201cobscene\u201d which is found throughout the federal law. Indeed, \u201cit is doubtful whether any standard other than obscenity could stand the Constitutional test.\u201d People v. Brooklyn News Co., 12 Misc.2d 768, 771, 174 N.Y.S.2d 813, 817 (Kings County Ct. 1958) (Sobel, J.); cf. United States v. Keller, 259 F.2d 54 (3d Cir. 1958). See also People v. Mishkin, 26 Misc.2d 152, 154, 207 N.Y.S.2d 390, 393 (Ct.Spec.Sess.1960), aff\u2019d as modified, 17 A.D.2d 243, 234 N.Y.S.2d 342 (1st Dept. 1962), aff\u2019d, 15 N.Y.2d 671, 255 N.Y.S.2d 881, 204 N.E.2d 209 (1964), probable jurisdiction noted, 380 U.S. 960, 85 S.Ct. 1103, 14 L.Ed.2d 152 (1965) (No. 858,1964 Term, renumbered No. 49, 1965 Term). See also Friedman v. New York, 34 U.S.L. Week 3014 (New York Sup.Ct., Jan. 21, 1965), petition for cert. filed, 33 U.S.L. Week 3369 (U.S. May 13, 1965) (No. 1161, 1964 Term; renumbered No. 135, 1965 Term). We must take great care, therefore, to see that limitations on materials regarded as \u201cobscene\u201d have no more scope than is necessary to effectuate the permissible purposes of such constraints. Cf. Butler v. State of Michigan, 352 U.S. 380, 383, 77 S.Ct. 524, 1 L.Ed.2d 412 (1957).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\"> We do not doubt that \u201cobscenity\u201d may be regulated because it is thought to incite antisocial sexual behavior and crime. \u201cObscene\u201d material and conduct may also sometimes be suppressed and penalized because, like a common law nuisance, it constitutes an unreasonably offensive intrusion into the lives of persons who cannot reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>avoid it. Other reasons for proscription are more troublesome, such as when the \u201cobscenity\u201d might merely be thought to cause sexual or other stimulation or excitement \u2014 unrelated to otherwise deleterious behavior \u2014 for willing adults who would not be subject to the material if they did not want to be. Also troublesome is regulation of \u201cobscenity\u201d simply because it reflects sexual values differing from current majority morals, cf. Kings-ley Int\u2019l Pictures Corp. v. Regents of the University of the State of New York, 360 U.S. 684, 688-689, 79 S.Ct. 1362, 3 L.Ed.2d 1512 (1959). See generally Henkin, Morals and the Constitution: The Sin of Obscenity, 63 Colum.L.Rev. 391, 392-95 (1963); Kalven, The Metaphysics of the Law of Obscenity, in 1960 Supreme Court Review, 1, 3-4 (Kurland ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">However, in considering the permissible meaning of \u201cobscene\u201d in section 1461, we must begin with the Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of that statute in Roth. That case contains the oft-quoted \u2014 although difficult to apply \u2014 statement that material is \u201cobscene\u201d if: \u201cto the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.\u201d 354 U.S. at 489, 77 S.Ct. at 1311.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">In addition to its appeal to \u201cprurient interest,\u201d proscribable \u201cobscenity\u201d must be \u201cutterly without redeeming social importance.\u201d Roth v. United States, supra, 354 U.S. at 484, 77 S.Ct. 1304; Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. at 191, 84 S.Ct. 1676. It must go \u201csubstantially beyond the customary limits of candor in description or representation.\u201d Ibid, (quoting American Law Institute, Model Penal Code formulation also quoted in Roth, 354 U.S. at 487 n. 20, 77 S.Ct. at 1310). It must be characterized by \u201cpatent offensiveness.\u201d Manual Enterprises, Inc. v. Day, 370 U.S. 478, 482, 82 S.Ct. 1432, 8 L.Ed.2d 639 (1962). In brief, it is \u201chard-core pornography.\u201d Jacobellis v. Ohio, supra, 378 U.S. at 197, 84 S.Ct. 1676.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">Thus, material is proscribable \u201cobscenity,\u201d or hard-core pornography, if it has the requisite prurient appeal, <em>and, </em>if it so exceeds customary candor as to be patently offensive, <em>unless </em>it has <em>any </em>redeeming social importance. The last requirement is part of the broad protective mantle of the First Amendment. 'But, as counsel for defendants repeatedly emphasized, there is no claim in this case that the Nutrix materials have any redeeming social importance. However, the absence of artistic or literary value or other value of social consequence does not, without more, lead to a finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>proscribable \u201cobscenity.\u201d Such qualities would merely insulate what might otherwise be proscribable due to its offensiveness and prurient appeal. See, e. g., Larkin v. G. P. Putnam\u2019s Sons, 14 N.Y.2d 399, 252 N.Y.S.2d 71, 200 N.E.2d 760 (1964) (the novel \u201cFanny Hill\u201d); People v. Bruce, 31 Ill.2d 459, 202 N.E.2d 497 (1964) (satirical monologist); Goldman, The Comedy of Lenny Bruce, 36 Commentary 312 (1963); cf. People v. Birch, supra. But cf. People v. Bruce, unreported, Crim.Ct. City of New York, 1964 (appeal pending); Attorney General v. Book Named \u201cJohn Cleland\u2019s Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure,\u201d Mass., 206 N.E.2d 403 (1965). Compare United States v. Ginzburg, 338 F.2d 12, 14 (3d Cir. 1964), cert. granted, 380 U.S. 961, 85 S.Ct. 1103, 14 L.Ed.2d 152 (1965) (No. 807), 1964 Term, renumbered No. 42, 1965 Term.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">Nor is mere \u201cpatent offensiveness\u201d enough. There must in addition be the requisite prurient appeal. Assuming that \u201cprurient appeal\u201d can be adequately defined, there are still some questions: appeal to whose prurient interest? judged by whom? on what basis? For example, is it the \u201caverage person\u201d who applies \u201ccontemporary community standards\u201d to determine if the \u201cdominant theme\u201d appeals to \u201cprurient interest\u201d (of someone) ? Or is it someone else applying \u201ccontemporary community standards\u201d to determine that the \u201cdominant theme\u201d appeals to \u201cprurient interest\u201d of the \u201caverage person\u201d ? Do \u201ccontemporary community standards\u201d operate to reduce potential prurient appeal ? Or do they operate to establish that some \u201credeeming social importance\u201d is present? Or, do they operate to measure the \u201cpatent offensiveness\u201d of an excess of candor? Again, does the \u201cdominant theme\u201d indicate that the prospective prurient appeal is great or slight? Or does it suggest that other themes will supply the redeeming social importance? Perhaps the Roth statement is too compact \u2014 an unsurprising failing in an initial formulation; the Court itself has acknowledged that it \u201cis not perfect.\u201d Jacobellis v. Ohio, supra, 378 U.S. at 191, 84 S.Ct. 1676. But the difficulties of articulating an adequate substitute need not dictate immutable adherence to such a will-o\u2019-the-wisp.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\"> Having in mind the constitutional constrictions on the breadth of legislation affecting the freedom of expression, if appeal to prurient interest-on either an \u201caverage man\u201d or a \u201cdeviant typical recipient\u201d basis \u2014 is the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>concern, then it seems desirable, indeed essential, that such appeal to someone be shown to exist. This the Government\u2019s view of Roth does not require. Nor should it be sufficient merely that the disseminator or publicizer thinks such appeal exists. The stimulation and reaction with which the \u201cobscenity\u201d laws are concerned are unlikely to be a problem if the appeal is felt by none of the recipients, but only by the disseminator. While such a person may in some other ways be a potential problem for society, the \u201cobscenity\u201d laws do not seem best calculated to cope with him. Moreover, the Court stresses in Roth the \u201ceffect\u201d of the material on the people reached by it. See 354 U.S. at 490, 77 S.Ct. 1304.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Of course, we are not asked to decide that Nutrix materials can in no case be a proper basis for exclusion from the mails nor, for that matter, for criminal convictions. Exclusion has already been decided. But while this discussion would be quite relevant to whether particular material alleged to be \u201cobscene\u201d may possibly be found to be beyond the scope of the First Amendment, it is also of central importance to the main problem in this case, which is one of proof and conviction. And if proof of prurient stimulation and response is generally important, it is particularly necessary when the prurient interest may be that of a deviant segment of society whose reactions are hardly a matter of common knowledge. It may well be that there are characters and cults to which exaggerated high heels, black patent leather bindings and bondage poses have some occult significance, but we doubt that any court would take judicial notice of the reaction that deviates \u2014 or the average man \u2014 \u2022 might have to such stimuli. However, some proof should be offered to demonstrate such appeal, thereby supplying the fact-finders with knowledge of what appeals to prurient interest so that they have some basis for their conclusion. As was observed earlier in Klaw\u2019s troubles with the postal censors, \u201cobviously, the issue of what stirs the lust of the sexual deviate requires evidence of special competence.\u201d Klaw v. Schaffer, supra, 151 F.Supp. at 539 n. 6; see Manual Enterprises, Inc. v. Day, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 78, 289 F.2d 455 (1961, rev\u2019d, 370 U.S. 478, 82 S.Ct. 1432, 8 L.Ed.2d 639 (1962)).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">In this case, although Judge Wyatt wisely suggested, and the Government considered, introduction of such evidence, there was none. Because of this Judge Wyatt stated at the end of the case, as he had to, that there was no \u201cevidence from which the jury could find that it [Nutrix materials] would in fact appeal to the prurient interest of a particular class.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Furthermore, nothing in the record shows that the material even has prurient appeal to the average man. The parent witnesses did not react to Junior\u2019s new literary and pictorial delights in a prurient manner, nor did the other recipient witnesses. Junior was not called upon to describe the appeal (if any) to his prurient interest; he probably would not have understood what \u201cprurient\u201d meant any more than do his elders. Most of the witnesses testified that they found the material disgusting or revolting, but that lascivious and lecherous thoughts had not been aroused in them. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>not unlikely that many if not most witnesses and jurors would also consider \u201cdisgusting and revolting\u201d more than a few of our current motion pictures, like \u201cDr. Terror\u2019s House of Horrors,\u201d many of the newsstand magazines so anomalously entitled \u201chorror comics,\u201d the risque birthday, convalescent, and greeting cards found in almost every corner drug store, as well as the scores of vulgar party favors. Indeed, vulgarity seems to be in vogue. But it is doubtful whether our jails would be well used if convictions were to he based on- material that is just \u201cdisgusting* and revolting.\u201d To do so would, we fear, be simply another application of the age-old double standard of the drawing room and the locker room.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">If the witnesses presented in this case provide any sampling, these pamphlets and pictures stimulated no one\u2019s prurient interest. Although it may be difficult to find expert and other witnesses properly qualified to inform the jury about what does or does not appeal to the prurient interest of the average person, cf. Klaw v. Schaffer, supra, 151 F.Supp. at 539-540, it would not seem impossible. On the other hand, it is clear that jurors should not consider their own personal reactions as setting the standard; there is too much truth in the observation that \u201cwhat is pornography for one man is the laughter of genius to another.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Cf. Ass\u2019n of the Bar of the City of New York, Comm, on the Bill of Rights, Report on H.R. 319, 88th Cong., 2d Sess. (1964), on \u201cMorally Offensive Mail,\u201d in Reports of the Ass\u2019n of the Bar Concerned with Federal Legislation 54, 56 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">In this case, however, the only predicate for any conclusion about prurient appeal was the material itself, as if <em>res ipsa loquitur. </em>The jurors were, therefore, left to speculate. They were invited to behold the accused material and, in effect, conclude simply that it is undesirable, it is distasteful, it is disgusting. Knowing perhaps that they would not be interested in obtaining more of the material they might wonder why anyone else would, and conclude that the only answer is \u201cprurient appeal.\u201d Because the jury was given no basis for understanding exactly how and why the material appeals to its audience, whether deviate or average person, it may too readily supply an explanation \u2014 \u201cprurient appeal.\u201d Even if the jury did not consist of twelve carefully selected Anthony Comstocks, it might well believe that the predominant appeal of certain acknowledged works of art, sculpture and literature found in all our well-known museums and libraries would be to the prurient interest of the average person, or perhaps someone else. But if that be so, can we allow the censor\u2019s stamp to be affixed on the basis of an uninformed jury\u2019s misconceptions? See also Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U.S. 51, 58, 85 S.Ct. 734, 13 L.Ed.2d 649 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Whatever the value of mere \u201cautoptical\u201d evidence in other contexts, it should not readily be countenanced in this area. Otherwise, too easily the Government\u2019s test might allow a jury to equate patent offensiveness to prurient appeal, thus obliterating the conjunction that has been thought indispensable. See e. g., Manual Enterprises, Inc. v. Day, supra, 370 U.S. at 482, 82 S.Ct. 1432; Jacobellis v. State of Ohio, supra, 378 U.S. at 191-192, 84 S.Ct. 1676. Too easily the jury could aid suppression simply on the basis of speculations and suspicions about the prurient appeal of material to some unknown, undefined person whose psyche is not known. With the First Amendment in the background, this cannot be abided.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">The state of the record gave the jurors impermissibly broad freedom to convict just because, having no more informative evidence than the material itself, they might think that the average person would \u201crecognize\u201d that the material has prurient appeal. But again, <em>to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number><em>whom? </em>In this case, the jury had insufficient evidence even to \u201crecognize\u201d that the material appealed to the prurient interest of the average person. It had absolutely no evidentiary basis from \u2022which to \u201crecognize\u201d any appeal to the prurient interest of the deviate or the typical recipient \u2014 a class never really defined in the record. Because there was insufficient evidence for the jury to consider Nutrix material \u201cobscene\u201d under any proper view of the Roth test, the motion for directed verdict of acquittal should have been granted.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">This result demonstrates perhaps that a second pronouncement may now be needed to clarify the rule of Roth. However, this court is mindful of the difficulties of providing an adequate definition, and it may turn out that the best and most realistic formulation available is that of Mr. Justice Stewart in Jacobel-lis that it is only \u201chard-core pornography\u201d to which the Constitution\u2019s protection does not extend, and although it may be indefinable, \u201cI know it when I see it * * 378 U.S. at 197, 84 S.Ct. at 1683. In any case, following Roth the censor\u2019s disapproving seal was removed from magazines for homosexuals and pictures of nudist camps in which the campers are unemasculated by the censor\u2019s retouching brush. Through these and other breaches in the dike has swept a veritable flood, as each pamphlet, play or picture seems obliged to be even more candid or daring in order to stimulate the public\u2019s prurient palate and assure appearance on the best-seller list. Authors vie with each other to peer through keyholes and over transoms, and to hide themselves at advantageous listening posts in well-selected bedrooms. Their efforts are rewarded by their being able to depict sights and conversations concerning the most intimate phases of sexual activity, with or without the benefit of wedlock. Witness such books as \u201cThe Group,\u201d \u201cCandy,\u201d and \u201cGreen Tree in Gedde,\u201d the last of which the reviewer in the stately New York Times says is \u201ca mixture of existentialism and erotic prurience\u201d apparently demonstrating \u201cthat young people in our tormented civilization are so lost in a wilderness of moral anarchy and philosophical despair that their only interest is in sex and in many of its most debased and perverted manifestations.\u201d May 3, 1965, p. 31, col. 3. And the commercial attributes of sexual candor have apparently not gone unnoticed by publishers of even the women\u2019s magazines. See Iversen, The Pious Pornographers (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">A comparison of judicial reactions to recent <em>causes c\u00e9lebres </em>suggests that the judiciary in our tormented modern civilization are also lost in a wilderness. Before it obtained its imprimatur in Grove Press, Inc. v. Gerstein, 378 U.S. 577, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>84 S.Ct. 1909, 12 L.Ed.2d 1035 (1964). Henry Miller\u2019s \u201cTropic of Cancer\u201d was \u201cobscene\u201d in Florida and in New York, People v. Fritch, 13 N.Y.2d 119, 243 N.Y.S.2d 1, 192 N.E.2d 713 (1963), but not in California, Zeitlin v. Arnebergh, 59 Cal.2d 901, 31 Cal.Rptr. 800, 383 P.2d 152, cert. denied, 375 U.S. 957, 84 S.Ct. 445, 11 L.Ed.2d 315 (1963), Massachusetts, Attorney General v. Book Named \u201cTropic of Cancer,\u201d 345 Mass. 11, 184 N.E.2d 328 (1962), and Wisconsin, McCauley v. Tropic of Cancer, 20 Wis.2d 134, 121 N.W.2d 545 (1963). Similar confusion and inconsistency is being manifested as to \u201cFanny Hill,\u201d which is \u201cobscene\u201d in Massachusetts, Attorney General v. Book Named \u201cJohn Cleland\u2019s Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure,\u201d Mass., 206 N.E.2d 403 (1965), but not in New York, Larkin v. G. P. Putnam\u2019s Sons, 14 N.Y.2d 399, 252 N.Y.S.2d 71, 200 N.E.2d 760 (1964). This is a book which any layman might not hesitate to say met all the requirements of Roth. The most amateur prosecutor could undoubtedly obtain a conviction in any part of the country in comparatively few minutes merely by reading a few pages to the jury. In fact, the same prosecutor might obtain the same result if he exhibited to the jury those glossy prints (mailed in plain envelopes) of quite naked ladies in various poses, despite the fact that they were photographs of famous pictures or statues in art museums. The possibility that deliberating jurors would be uncommonly sanctimonious or hypocritical seems quite obvious. Indeed, most if not all of the censor\u2019s defeats have come at the hands of appellate courts, and not the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Many would doubt that a judicial system that puts its permissive stamp of approval upon such books as \u201cTropic of Cancer\u201d and \u201cFanny Hill,\u201d to name a few, or certain magazines for homosexuals and sunbathers should then incarcerate or penalize these two defendants for disseminating and publicizing material which might or might not (there is no proof) appeal to someone\u2019s \u201cprurient interest.\u201d Indeed, we can sympathize with Klaw\u2019s plight were he to find \u201cFanny Hill\u201d or \u201cTropic of Cancer\u201d in the prison library, or, if others had pre-empted the only copies, there were available \u201cPleasure Was My Business,\u201d see Tralins v. Gerstein, 378 U.S. 576, 84 S.Ct. 1903, 12 L.Ed.2d 1033 (1964), which contains \u201cnumerous descriptions of abnormal sex acts and indecent conversations supposed to have taken place in [a] Florida brothel.\u201d As Chief Judge Desmond pointed out in his dissent in Larkin, \u201cFanny Hill\u201d contains every element which might appeal to \u201cprurient interest.\u201d Judge Scileppi described the book, with considerable justification, as \u201cone of the foulest, sexually immoral, debasing, lewd and obscene books ever published, either in this country or abroad.\u201d Larkin, supra, 14 N.Y.2d at 407, 252 N.Y.S.2d at 78, 200 N.E.2d at 765. If no books are available, Klaw together with the public might turn to stimulation through the auditory nerves rather than the optic nerves. The field is no less fruitful for now \u201cFanny Hill Comes Alive\u201d in an unexpurgated two-record album, giving in 16 stunning scenes \u201call the lusty, intimate, climatic excitement of this erotic masterpiece * * * Banned for 200 years, now available following New York State Court of Appeals decision overruling the lower courts.\u201d So reads the advertising in the Book Review section of a recent Sunday New York Times, April 4, 1965. Thus, another item is added to the party-record list which for generations has delighted those who seek such entertainment with their lusty and ribald old English ballads, entertainment to which Robert Burns, to name one, was a not insubstantial contributor. And in the field of prose, see Mark Twain\u2019s \u201c1601\u201d and Samuel Pepys\u2019 \u201cDiary.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Faced with this vast array of reading and listening matter available to the public, Klaw might un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>derstandably wonder as to the meaning of equal protection of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">In judging the convictions of Klaw and Kramer against the many decisions of the Supreme Court and highest state courts, this court has been left with the definite impression, as indicated above, that there has been insufficient proof presented in this case to justify their penalties and imprisonment. For better or for worse, the standard of what does not arouse \u201cprurient interest\u201d has been established. A particularly careful study of the subject matter involved in this and other cases has been made because this court regards the material as revolting and disgusting. But it is the record and not our feelings that must control. Here the jury had no opportunity to judge the exhibits presented to them by any standard other than their own speculation as to \u201cprurient interest.\u201d If they knew the standard set as a matter of law by other cases, their result might have been different. \u201cDue process of law\u201d would be a meaningless cliche if the nonsensical trash that is the subject of this prosecution were allowed to be the basis of a conviction by judge or jury without any proof demonstrating that it has the proscribed effect on any of our citizenry.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The courts may have opened the floodgates for horror and filth, but if they are to be closed it should be done by the careful drafting of proper laws by our duly elected representatives, and not by a combination of zealous governmental inspectors, prosecutors, and uninformed juries. Then the potential contributors to our culture may have some slight notion of the guidelines and the risks. Of course, it is quite possible that after the public is sated with the products of the new permissiveness the floodtide will ebb of its own diminished momentum. Until then, however, the responsibility of protecting defendants from unguided suppression and conviction weighs as heavily upon this court as it does upon the Supreme Court. While there is some merit to the opinion of those who say that appellate courts should not have to sit as a board of censors supervising the work of the police, the motion picture censorship bureaus, the schools, the churches, and the other organizations that have their lists of good and bad books and motion pictures, there is even more merit to the view that once these preferences are enforced upon others, we \u201ccannot avoid making an independent constitutional judgment on the facts of the case as to whether the material involved is constitutionally protected.\u201d Jacobellis, supra, 378 U.S. at 190, 84 S.Ct. at 1679. Unless there be this protection, a witch hunt might well come to pass which would make the Salem tragedy fade into obscurity. Having in mind the alternatives of jail or freedom, courts must be aware of the facts of the \u201cheld-not-to-be-obscene\u201d or \u201capproved\u201d cases, and ensure that the proof is sufficient to allow a fact finder to set this case apart from them. Otherwise it would be altogether too easy for any prosecutor to stand before a jury, display the exhibits involved, and merely ask in summation: \u201cWould you want your son or daughter to see or read this stuff? \u201d A conviction in every instance would be virtually assured.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Finally, to take Mr. Justice Brennan\u2019s concluding words in reversing the court below in Jacobellis v. State of Ohio, supra, 378 U.S. at 196, 84 S.Ct. at 1682: \u201cWe have viewed the film [the exhibits], <em>in the light of the record made in the trial court, </em>and we conclude that it is [they are] not obscene within the standards enunciated in Roth v.

The third group of 41 counts (reduced to 30) against Klaw were apparently based on the part of \u00a7 1461 declaring nonmailable, and thus unlawful to use the mails for circulating or disposing of, certain circulars, advertisements and notices giving information about \u201cobscene\u201d matters. The basis of these counts would seem to be a combination of the first and fourth paragraphs of \u00a7 1461. However, it is not entirely clear on the face of the statute that the fourth paragraph is at all related to the first \u2014 the only one mentioning \u201cobscene\u201d \u2014 being rather just a part of the second through sixth paragraphs, which deal throughout with abortion and conception prevention and other indecent or immoral uses. For example, in \u00a7 1462, relating to transportation by common carrier, \u201cobscene\u201d books and the like are dealt with in subsection (a), \u201cobscene\u201d recordings and the like are dealt with in subsection (b), and subsection (c) deals only with abortion and conception prevention items and material giving information about such items. The statutory development shows that substantially the present wording of \u00a7 1461 was first enacted in Act of July 12, 1876, ch. 186, 19 Stat. 90. The text was cast in its present paragraphed form by the 1948 revision of the criminal code, ch. 768, 62 Stat. 768. The predecessor of \u00a7 1462 was Act of February 8, 1897, ch. 172, 29 Stat. 512, which was cast in a form similar to the predecessors of \u00a7 1461. Explicit paragraphs and subsections did not appear until Act of May 27, 1950, ch. 214, 64 Stat. 194. However, given our disposition of the case we need not determine whether \u00a7 1461 applies to circulars giving information about \u201cobscene\u201d matter, as opposed to simply matters, articles and things \u201cfor preventing conception or producing abortion, or for any indecent or immoral use.\u201d Moreover, the Court in Roth implicitly assumed, without discussion, that it did.

While knotty problems are raised if one considers the religious background of many of these laws, see Henkin, Morals and the Constitution: The Sin of Obscenity, 63 Colum.L.Rev. 391 (1963), they need not be dealt with if permissible secular purposes and justifications may be found for them. Cf. McGowan v. State of Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961); Two Guys from Harrison-Allentown, Inc. v. McGinley, 366 U.S. 582, 81 S.Ct. 1135, 6 L.Ed.2d 551 (1961). Compare Griswold v. State of Connecticut, 85 S.Ct. 1678 (1965). While contemporary secular support is being found for proscription of words, thoughts and scenes that were inconsistent with \u201creligious\u201d conceptions, so too has the content of those conceptions itself been changing. Thus, descriptive words fit for one generation of translators of the Bible are unfit for another. See, e. g., Adams, The Magic and Mystery of Words 68 (1963). Similarly, in a stimulating article, Reverend Howard Moody has recently questioned the whole religious approach to obscenity. Moody, Toward a New Definition of Obscenity, 24 Christianity &amp; Crisis 284 (1965). Noting that \u201cfrom a theological or ethical perspective, \u2018dirty words\u2019 are a terribly inadequate base from which to write a definition of obscenity,\u201d id. at 286, he suggests that our standard of obscenity is \u201cobsessed with sex and vulgar language; * * * [it should be] defined rather as that material which has as its dominant theme and purpose the debasement and depreciation of human beings \u2014 their worth and dignity.\u201d Id. at 287. If at the same time as the restrictions on publication have been loosened the nation has approached \u201ca state of moral decadence, * * * the evidence of this is not to be found in salacious literature, erotic art or obscene films but in the \u2018soul-rot\u2019 that comes from the moral hypocrisy of straining at the gnat of sexuality and swallowing the camel of human deterioration and destruction.\u201d Id. at 288.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b212-5\">. A problem not discussed in Roth, but initially raised in this case, is whether the standard is any different if the typical potential recipient of the \u201cobscene\u201d material may be someone other than the \u201caverage man,\u201d i. e., a member of a particular group such as a sexual deviate. In Manual Enterprises, Inc. v. Day, 370 U.S. 478, 481-482, 82 S.Ct. 1432, 8 L.Ed.2d 639 (1962), Justices Ilarlan and Stewart indicated that the question of the relevant audience was still open, but they did not feel compelled to reach it.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ6\">We realizo that the Court went on in Roth to quote with approval a charge that \u201c[t]he test in each case is the effect of the book, picture or publication considered as a whole, not upon any particular class, but upon all those whom it is likely to reach. In other words, you determine its impact upon the average person in the community.\u201d 354 U.S. at 490, 77 S.Ct. at 1312. But this brief treatment can hardly be taken as ending the matter. When read in light of the familiar admonition (contained in the same charge) that the reactions of the young, the immature, the prigs, or the highly prudish are not decisive, this passage need mean little more than that putatively \u201cobscene\u201d matter more or less directed to or likely to reach all parts of the community must be appraised on those terms, and not on the basis of its appeal to a small segment of the community. Because there may be good reason for proscribing material that is more likely to reach and be responded to in a prurient way by a deviant segment of the community, we are not convinced that prurient appeal to the average member of the community is the only possible standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b213-5\">. In this ease it is the first of these ambiguities that is most bothersome \u2014 -that is, appeal, if any, to whose prurient interest, judged by whom, and on what basis. Before, during, and at the end of the trial, and now on appeal, the Government\u2019s \u25a0claim has been that the familiar Both test does not require that the material appeal to the average person. \u201cAll that it requires is that the dominant theme of the material \u2014 that is, the dominant nature of such appeal as it has \u2014 be recognizable to the average person as being an appeal to prurient interest.\u201d But in so restating Both, the Government has merely chosen one of several approaches to determination of the requisite prurient appeal, one that does not say to whose prurient interest the appeal must go. Another approach is to say that the material must be shown to appeal to the prurient interest of the \u201caverage person\u201d (a close cousin to the \u201creasonable man\u201d whose assumed existence cannot be questioned lest many a legal edifice become a mere bouse of cards). Since the \u201caverage .person\u201d is almost always a possible recipient, even if not the typical recipient, the effect on him or her would always seem important. After all, the prurient appeal element is presumably related to the deterrence purpose. And without now questioning the apparent legislative assumption that stimulation of prurient interest leads to significant anti-social behavior, but cf. United States v. Roth, 237 F.2d 796, 804, 812-817 (2d Cir. 1956), aff\u2019d, 354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957), if the prurient interest of the average person is stimulated there may be cause for regulation. There may also be cause for regulation of material that stimulates the prurient interest of, not the average person, but the abnormal person \u2014 the deviate \u2014 who is likely to be its typical recipient. Indeed, there may be even more cause for regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b214-5\">. It might be thought that the statute in question is concerned not so much with deterrence of sexually stimulated antisocial conduct as with use of the mails to disseminate unsolicited, undesired offensive materials to uninterested recipients. But the statute is not so narrowly drawn. Indeed, a bill more appropriately designed to cope with that precise problem was recently approved by the House of Representatives. The bill, H.R. 980, 89th Cong. 1st Sess., would permit a recipient or a parent of an infant recipient to return to Ms Postmaster any mail thought by the recipient to be \u201cobscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile\u201d and have the Postmaster notify the sender to discontinue the mailings; such an order would be judicially enforceable. Cf. Lamont v. Postmaster General, 85 S.Ct. 1493, 1495, n. 2 (1965). See generally Schwartz, The Mail Must Go Through\u2014Propaganda and Pornography, 11 U.C.L.A.

Even with adequate proof under the average man test, there might still be problems, for the jury was charged to consider the material from the standpoint of the average man in the nation as a whole. We very much doubt whether twelve random New Yorkers can make such a judgment without being further informed about the \u201ccommon conscience of the nation,\u201d if there be such a thing. In any case, we do not read the Court\u2019s plurality opinions in Jacobellis as unequivocal authority for the proposition. In announcing the Court\u2019s judgment, Justice Brennan was speaking only for himself and Justice Goldberg. Justices White, Black and Douglas concurred only in the judgment. Justice Stewart concurred without indicating adoption of the national community standard. As for the dissenters, the Chief Justice explicitly rejected the national standard, as did Justice Harlan, presumably in light of his views in Both. See Gent v. State, Ark., 393 S.W.2d 219 (1965).
