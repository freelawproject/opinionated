Indeed, the appellant himself addressed the court, insisting that he was not \u201cincompetent.\u201d In detail both lucid and explicit, he offered a quite valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>and reasonable explanation for the position he took. On appeal counsel contends that the trial judge should have raised the insanity issue in spite of appellant\u2019s wishes. See Whalem v. United States, 120 U.S.App.D.C. -, ---, 346 F.2d 812, 818-819 (1965) <em>(en </em>banc); Overholser v. Lynch, 109 U.S.App.D.C. 404, 288 F.2d 388 (1961), reversed on other grounds, 369 U.S. 705, 82 S.Ct. 1063, 8 L.Ed.2d 211 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">We do not think the judge abused his discretion in refusing to raise the issue <em>sua sponte. </em>Appellant had previously been found competent to stand trial, and there is no suggestion that this finding was erroneous. Moreover, whether appellant did in fact commit the criminal act was a closely contested issue during the trial. Introduction of the insanity issue might well have prejudiced his defense on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">We have examined the other points raised on this appeal and found none of them to warrant reversal. The conviction is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
