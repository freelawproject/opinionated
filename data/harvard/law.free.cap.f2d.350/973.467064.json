It operates a number of plants in the south and midwest. The instant case involves the company\u2019s so-called Western Kentucky Division, which embraces (1) a plant in Carrier Mills, Illinois, which manufactures explosives, (2) another such plant near Madisonville, Kentucky, situated about 75 miles from the Illinois plant, and (3) a combined warehouse and retail store in Madisonville proper, which deals in mine and mill supplies other than explosives, and is located about six miles from the above-mentioned Madisonville manufacturing plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-15\">The relevant facts as found by the Board are these: Between March 17 and 26, 1962, Frederick, a Madisonville plant employee, solicited his fellow employees at the plant and at the warehouse to sign union authorization cards. Having obtained twelve signatures among twenty-one employees by March 26, the union on that date sent a letter to the company demanding recognition as the bargaining representative of employees at the \u201cMadi-sonvillle establishment.\u201d This letter was received on March 27 by Thomas G. King, respondent\u2019s district manager. On the same day, company supervisors solicited employees to sign the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-16\">\u201cI hereby certify that I am not a member of Chauffeurs and Teamsters Local 215 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America and that I have not chosen said union as my bargaining representative as your employee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-17\">On the evening of March 27, King telephoned a plant production worker, Opal Frye, and asked her about the \u201ctrouble at the plant,\u201d whether she knew who was \u201cthe head of the union movement,\u201d \u201chow long it had been brewing,\u201d and with whom he could talk \u201cto get it stopped.\u201d Frye testified that when she professed ignorance, King told her, \u201cAs for your job, we made your job for you, we don\u2019t need you tomorrow.\u201d A somewhat dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>ferent version of the conversation was related by King, but the trial examiner and the Board chose to credit Frye\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-4\">On March 28, King called a meeting attended by seventeen employees. At the outset Frederick got into a dispute with King, during the course of which King said that he had been advised by the company \u201cto operate as is\u201d if he could, and if he could not, he \u201cwould have to put a lock on the gate.\u201d In protest, Frederick reportedly declared either that all those who were \u201cwith me\u201d or who were \u201cfor the union\u201d should \u201cfollow me out the door.\u201d Thereupon eleven employees, including Frederick, left the meeting</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">On March 29, the union filed with the National Labor Relations Board a petition for a representation election among the company\u2019s Madisonville employees. On March 30, apparently before receiving notice of the petition, the company rejected the union\u2019s demand for recognition, professing doubt as to its majority status and as to the appropriateness of the claimed unit, and suggesting resort to the Board. On March 31, King posted a notice on one or more of the company\u2019s bulletin boards which informed the employees of the union\u2019s bargaining demand and of the company\u2019s rejection thereof because of doubts as to majority status and proper unit. The notice, which remained posted until August 28, also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-6\">\u201cThe Company wishes to inform you at this time that each and every employee has a right:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-9\">1. To join a union, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-10\">2. Not to join a union.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-11\">The choice is entirely up to each and every employee. This Company will not interfere [sic] or coerce or intimidate any employee in the exercise of the above rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-12\">There seems to be some misunderstanding as to whether or not the Company has interfered with these rights. We do not think we have interfered, however, so that there will be no misunderstanding, we again assure you that any action or statement by the Company which would lead you to believe that you do not have the right to join or to refrain from joining a union is hereby withdrawn and cancelled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-16\">Again we repeat, each and every employee has a right to join or refrain from joining a union, and if any agent, supervisor or executive of this Company should tell you that you cannot exercise such rights, please contact the writer immediately.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1023-17\">Thereafter, between April 10 and May 8 (and prior to the hearing on the union\u2019s representation petition), the company notified seven employees that they were being \u201cpermanently laid off.\u201d None of them has since been called back to work. Of these seven, all but one (Marks, the newest of the Madisonville employees) had signed union cards and one of them, Frederick, was the leader of the union movement. These six were among the eleven employees who had walked out of the March 28 meeting called by King, and three of the six had been asked to sign the statement disavowing the union and had refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-19\">Regarding the instant charges of unfair labor practices, the Board found three violations of 8(a) (1) by the company, viz.: the King-Frye conversation, the March 27 solicitation of employees to sign a statement repudiating the union, and the declaration of King at the March 28 assembly that the plant would be closed if it could not be operated \u201cas is.\u201d The company contends that neither King\u2019s statements to Frye nor to the assembled employees were intimidating. That, however, is a matter of inference to be drawn from the facts. We cannot say that the Board acted unreasonably in considering King\u2019s statements to be veiled threats of reprisal in the event of unionization. Nor did the Board exceed its authority in rejecting the company\u2019s claim that it was engaging in permissible inquiry when it sought disclaimers of union adherence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>from its employees, because the disavowal petition goes far beyond mere interrogation and, in addition, the company\u2019s solicitations occurred in the context of other coercive acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">Respondent insists, however, that any 8(a) (1) violations with which it might be chargeable were effectively neutralized by its posted notice of March 31, advising employees of their statutory rights. The Board found the notice inadequate to dispel prior coercion because it doubted that the notice was \u201csufficiently unambiguous\u201d or adequately publicized, and because the notice itself was vitiated by further violations of the Act. Cf. National Labor Relations Board v. Wagner Iron Works, 220 F.2d 126, 138 (7th Cir. 1955). An assessment as to the probable effect of employer conduct upon the exercise of employees\u2019 statutory rights is involved here as it is involved in the initial finding of 8(a) (1) violations, and once again the Court does not find the Board\u2019s conclusion so wanting in rational basis as to require or permit reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">With respect to the \u201cpermanent layoffs\u201d of six union adherents, the trial examiner found that the company had economic justification for reducing its work force, but further found that the employees selected for termination were chosen on a discriminatory basis. The Board rejected the examiner\u2019s first finding and refrained from passing on the second. In the Board\u2019s view, a \u201cstrong prima facie case\u201d of 8(a) (3) violation was presented by (1) the company\u2019s knowledge of union organizational activity) (2) the timing of the layoffs, which occurred during the pendency of representation proceedings before the Board, and (3) the company\u2019s demonstrated hostility to the union. Nor were the company\u2019s proofs regarded as sufficient to overcome the prima facie case thus made. Although the company established that its Madisonville production had declined by 25 percent in the second quarter of 1962 and that no replacements were hired or overtime worked after the layoffs in question, the Board rejected the asserted business justification, principally on the ground that the decision to reduce the work force was made and executed before the second quarter production figures were compiled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-11\"> If the Board\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence on the record viewed as a whole, the duty of this court plainly is to accept that determination. Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). The difficulty here is that on close scrutiny the Board\u2019s finding is equivocal. If by lack of \u201ceconomic justification\u201d the Board meant to suggest that there had been an insufficient showing of legitimate business reasons for the company to reduce its Madisonville staff, its conclusion lacks the requisite evidentiary support. The decline in second quarter production is undisputed, as is the evidence indicating that the prospects for an upswing were bleak. The fact that exact production figures were unavailable when the decision to eliminate seven employees was made does not neutralize the company\u2019s claim, since the substantia] drop in production was apparent even before it was formally documented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-12\">Yet another construction might be placed on the Board\u2019s finding. It is possible that the Board used the phrase \u201ceconomic justification\u201d in the sense of <em>motivation. </em>That is to say, the Board may have concluded that whatever legitimate business considerations might have existed which would have warranted layoffs, the actual motivation for the company\u2019s decision was its desire to undermine the union majority. Thus the precipitating cause, but for which layoffs would not have been made or would have been postponed, was the company\u2019s hostility to the union and nothing else.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cf. N. L. R. B. v. Brown, 380 U.S. 278, 85 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>S.Ct. 980, 13 L.Ed.2d 839 (1965), American Ship Building Co., v. N. L. R. B., 380 U.S. 300, 313, 85 S.Ct. 955, 13 L.Ed.2d 855 (1965). We need not consider now whether the record discloses substantial evidence to support a finding of unlawful motivation on the part of the employer. In view of our uncertainty as to what it is that the Board decided, our proper course is to deny enforcement of the reinstatement provision of the Board\u2019s order pending remand to the Board for clarification. See N. L. R. B. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 380 U.S. 438, 85 S.Ct. 1061 13 L.Ed.2d 951 (1965). As Mr. Justice Cardozo said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-4\">\u201cWe must know what a decision means before the duty becomes ours to say whether it is right or wrong.\u201d United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. &amp; P. R. R., 294 U.S. 499, 510-511, 55 S.Ct. 462, 467, 79 L.Ed. 1023 (1935).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">The Board also found that respondent had wrongfully refused to recognize or bargain with the union, in violation of sections 8(a) (5) and (1) of the Act. As of March 26, 1962, the date of the union\u2019s demand for recognition, the union represented at least eleven of twenty employees in the unit determined by the Board to be appropriate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The \u201cdoubts\u201d which the company claimed to have harbored regarding the appropriateness of the unit sought by the union were dismissed as a sham. The Board found that respondent\u2019s refusal to bargain was not in fact motivated by any such doubts but \u201cby a rejection of the principle of collective bargaining, and by a desire to gain time in which to undermine the union.\u201d This conclusion was based on the company\u2019s \u201cshifting and sharply divergent unit contentions,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the \u201ccoercive conduct * * * which followed on the heels of the union\u2019s demand of March 26,\u201d the rejection of the union\u2019s offer to prove its majority status by submission of authorization cards to the company,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the demonstration of union support among a majority of employees evidenced by the protest walkout of eleven employees from the assembly called by King. The foregoing facts, established by substantial evidence, permit the inference that respondent\u2019s professed doubts were not the reason for its refusal to bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-14\">The contentions that the unit description in the union\u2019s initial demand for recognition was ambiguous or that the company could reasonably have believed that an alternative unit including the Carrier Mills plant was more appropriate are beside the point. Even if accepted, these contentions establish only that there may have been reasonable grounds for rejecting the union\u2019s demand (a matter as to which we express no opinion), but they do not meet the Board\u2019s finding that the real basis for the company\u2019s actions was not doubt, however reasonable, but a desire to stifle the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-15\">For the reasons stated, the order of the Board will be enforced with the exception of the reinstatement provision, as to which the case is remanded to the Board for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">. Sec. 8(a) It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer \u2014 \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-12\">(1) to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 7;</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-13\">(3) by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment to en-eourage or discourage membership in any labor organization;</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-19\">(5) to refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of his employees, subject to the provisions of section 9(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">. Such a finding would seem to subsume the examiner\u2019s second holding, left open by the Board, that the choice of employees to be terminated was discriminatory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">. \u201cAll production, maintenance and warehouse employees at the Respondent\u2019s operations in the Madisonville, Kentucky, area, including truekdrivers and plant clerks, but excluding office clerks, professional employees, guards and supervisors, as defined in the Act.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1025-9\">. For example, in the abortive representation proceedings the company did not contest the appropriateness of the unit sought, but before the trial examiner hearing the unfair labor practices charges, the company variously contended that the warehouse and the plant in Madison-ville were separate units and that the company\u2019s entire Western Kentucky Division, including the Carrier Mills, Illinois, plant, constituted a single unit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1025-17\">. Even on the basis of the company\u2019s claim that the warehouse and the plant were separate units, the union could have proved its majority status in each if given the opportunity to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
