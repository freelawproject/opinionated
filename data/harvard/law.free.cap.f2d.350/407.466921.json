Upon timely motion, the trial court dismissed the action for lack of the requisite diversity of citizenship. The jurisdictional allegation of the complaint states that one of the plaintiffs is a citizen of the District of Columbia, and the other a citizen of the State of Illinois. It also recites that while some of the defendants are citizens of Kansas, other defendants are citizens of the State of Illinois.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is obvious there is no diversity of citizenship between the plaintiff and the defendants who are citizens of Illinois. It has long been held that diversity means \u201ctotal diversity.\u201d That is, all the parties on one side must have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>citizenship diverse to those on the other side.
