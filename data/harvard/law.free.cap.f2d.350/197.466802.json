These conferences are rate-fixing associations of carriers, all of whom are engaged in the waterborne commerce of the United States and whose association is permitted by \u00a7 15 of the Shipping Act of 1916, as amended 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 814 (Supp. V, 1964), subject to approval of their agreements of association by the Federal Maritime Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">These proceedings involve those provisions of the several agreements of association which permit the fixing of \u201cdual rates\u201d: the granting by a conference of preferential rates to shippers who have agreed with the conference to patronize it exclusively.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Prior to the enactment of the legislation with which we are here concerned the lawfulness of dual rate contracts had long been questioned as contrary to established antitrust policy. In 1958 the Supreme Court in Federal Maritime Board v. Isbrandtsen Co., 356 U.S. 481, 78 S.Ct. 851, 2 L.Ed.2d 926 (1958), had held such a contract to be in violation of \u00a7 14 Third of .the Shipping Act of 1916, 39 Stat. 733 (1916), and had thus cast doubt on the validity of such arrangements. Congress sought to clarify and remedy the situation. After three years of study Public Law 87-346, 75 Stat. 762 (1961), was enacted October 3,1961. Its declared purpose was \u201c * * * to authorize ocean common carriers and conferences thereof serving the foreign commerce of the United States to enter into effective and fair dual rate contracts with shippers and consignees * * By \u00a7 3, interim validity of existing dual rate agreements was provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">The meat of the Act was in what has become \u00a7 14b of the Shipping Act of 1916, as amended, 75 Stat. 762 (1961), 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 813a (Supp. V, 1964), which provides that the Federal Maritime Commission shall permit dual rate agreements,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>\u201c * * * unless the Commission finds that the contract * * * will be detrimental to the commerce of the United States or contrary to the public interest, or unjustly discriminatory or unfair as between shippers, exporters, importers, or ports, or between exporters from the United States and their foreign competitors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The authority of the Commission to permit such contracts was limited by requiring that the contracts in eight specified respects meet the congressional judgment as to what they should include. Listed as specification Nine was the requirement that a contract shall contain \u201c * * * such other provisions not inconsistent herewith as the Commission shall require or permit.\u201d Thus was imposed upon the Commission the task of reviewing and revising all agreements under which the conferences were operating with respect to dual rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The provisions for interim validity of existing dual rates contracts set forth a schedule for bringing those contracts into line with \u00a7 14b\u2019s requirements. The conferences, within six months, were to file with the Commission their proposals as to how their existing contracts should be amended to meet the new requirements. Thereafter the existing contracts as so amended should be valid for a further period of one year, during which period \"the Commission shall approve, disapprove, cancel or modify all such agreements and amendments in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\u201d By subsequent enactment the time allowed the Commission (and the period of interim validity) was extended to April 3, 1964, 77 Stat. 5 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">These petitioners duly submitted their proposed amendments to the Commission before expiration of the six-month period specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">On March 21, 1962, the Commission gave notice by publication in the Federal Register, 27 Fed.Reg. 2647 (1962), that pursuant to the provisions of the Shipping Act it was considering the promulgation of certain rules and regulations governing the use of contract rate systems as authorized by \u00a7 14b.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-14\">On January 3, 1963, the Commission published in the Federal Register its \u201cNotice of Proposed Final Rules and Uniform Agreement.\u201d Reciting its earlier notice the Commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-15\">\u201cHaving given due consideration to the comments of interested persons filed in response to said notice the Federal Maritime Commission hereby gives notice that it is considering the promulgation of final rules in this matter. These proposed final rules are as follows:\u201d 28 Fed.Reg. 74 (1963).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-17\">There followed a proposed uniform contract for all conferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-18\">A storm of protest arose from the conferences over this proposed resort to a uniform contract. The conferences contended that the Commission\u2019s function under \u00a7 14b was to conduct individual hearings on the amendments as proposed by the individual conferences to determine whether those amendments conformed to the requirements of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-19\">The Commission acceded to conference demands. On April 9,1963, it entered its \u201cOrder of Investigation and Hearing\u201d respecting Pacific Coast European Conference (typical of the orders respecting the individual conferences) for hearing before an examiner upon the amended contract as proposed by that conference.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Subsequently, on the petition of various shippers and shipper associations, certain so-called \u201cmajor issues\u201d were severed from most of the proceedings on the individual contracts and were heard before a panel of five examiners in a proceeding assigned Commission Docket No. 1111. The Commission\u2019s order of investigation and hearing in this docket stated that the proceeding was instituted in order to lessen the burden of shippers (who might be signatories to dual rate contracts with a number of conferences, and who might otherwise have to participate in substantially every proceeding before the Commission), and for the purpose of achieving \u201coptimum uniformity\u201d in contract provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">On December 3, 1963, petitioners\u2019 examiner rendered his initial decision. Subject to certain specified modifications, and subject to the rulings in Docket 1111, he concluded that the proposed contract met the requirements of \u00a7 14b and was not detrimental to the commerce of the United States, contrary to the public interest or unjustly discriminatory or unfair and should be permitted in use in foreign commerce by the conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">On March 27, 1964, the Commission handed down its report entitled <em>The Dual Rate Cases, </em>together with orders in petitioners\u2019 proceedings to the effect \u201cthat the agreement submitted to the Commission by the respondents in the above proceedings are hereby approved in the form attached to this order\u201d and providing that the attached form of order should become effective April 4, 1964, \u201cto the exclusion of any other terms and provisions.\u201d The report and order were served on petitioners on March 30, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The form of contract attached to the order was initiated by the Commission pursuant to the findings and conclusions of <em>The Dual Rate Cases </em>and was not the contract considered by the examiner in petitioners\u2019 proceedings. It contained provisions not specifically required by \u00a7 14b and not discussed in the hearings had upon petitioners\u2019 proposed contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">Petitioners assert that they were thus required, on four days\u2019 notice, to commit themselves by agreement to grant concessions to contract shippers above and beyond those called for by the Shipping Act, as to which there has been no hearing in their proceedings, and which in fact were, as to them, unnecessary and prejudicial to the point of unfairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">Petitioners did not seek rehearing before the Commission pursuant to its Rule 16, 18 Fed.Reg. 3726 (1953), 46 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.261,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> upon these protested contractual provisions. Instead they promptly brought this proceeding for judicial review, not primarily attacking the substance of the contracts approved by the Commission but rather the procedures by which they were formulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">1. Petitioners contend that their rights under their outstanding contracts constituted property rights protected by the Fifth Amendment; that Congress through enactment of \u00a7 14b and the Commission by imposing a mandatory agreement upon the conference without their consent have deprived them of their right freely to contract about their business affairs. Specifically, petitioners contend that their contracts constitute property which the Commission is \u201ctaking\u201d without due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\"> It is obvious, however, that although in contract form, what the Congress and the Commission have imposed upon the conferences is simply regulation. The conferences have no right, constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>tional or otherwise, to exemption from such regulation. Addyston Pipe &amp; Steel Co. v. United States, 175 U.S. 211, 20 S.Ct. 96, 44 L.Ed. 136 (1899). They have no right, constitutional or otherwise, to persist in a course which Congress has now found to be discriminatory to shippers and violative of the antitrust policies.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">2. Petitioners contend that the Commission has not proceeded in accordance with \u00a7 14b. They point to the statutory provision that the Commission <em>shall permit </em>the use by a conference of <em>any contract </em>providing dual rates <em>unless </em>the Commission finds the contract to be detrimental to commerce or contrary to public interest or unjustly discriminatory or unfair. They assert that the Commission has not so found as to their proposed contract, and that the hearing examiner expressly found to the contrary. They contend that the congressional intent, disregarded by the Commission, was to authorize conferences to continue under their <em>existing </em>contracts without interruption, provided only that they be amended to the extent required.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-14\">But petitioners overlook \u00a7 14b\u2019s all-important proviso \u2014 \u201cprovided that the contract * * * expressly * * * (9) contains such other provisions not inconsistent herewith as the Commission shall require or permit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-15\">There was thus plain authority in and direction to the Commission to give consideration to and to require agreement on other matters than those occurring to Congress.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Such matters would normally be initiated by the Commission and its reference to an examiner of petitioners\u2019 proposals can hardly be construed as a delegation or a surrender of that function.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-16\">As to deference owed to existing contracts, the Commission had made it plain from the outset that it regarded uniformity of contract, a counterbalancing consideration, as desirable in the public interest. Legislative history demonstrates that such was the view of Congress as well.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While strict uniformity did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>result due to difference of circumstances affecting the different conferences, it was certainly within the authority of the Commission, and, as we view it, wholly consistent with the spirit of the Shipping Act of October 3, 1961, to seek uniformity to the extent possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">As to the Commission\u2019s method of consolidating hearings upon issues and of filing a consolidated report, we note that there were approximately sixty different conference contracts submitted for approval. In each, the issue was whether the contract contained the provisions required by the new Shipping Act. Under these circumstances it would have imposed an unusually heavy burden upon the Commission to require it to treat each contract individually despite the existence of common questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">We conclude that the Commission\u2019s procedures were not contrary to \u00a7 14b.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">3. Petitioners attack the procedure followed by the Commission as violative of the Administrative Procedure Act in certain respects. They make the following contentions:</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">(a) Neither the order nor the report <em>The Dual Bate Cases </em>contain findings, conclusions or reasons or basis for the Commission\u2019s decision, contrary to the requirements of \u00a7 8(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1007(b) (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">(b) Under \u00a7 7(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1006(d) (1958), the transcript of testimony and exhibits in petitioners\u2019 proceedings should have constituted the exclusive record for decision of the Commission. By including in its approved contract clauses other than those under consideration in petitioners\u2019 proceedings, the Commission has gone beyond this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">These sections of the Administrative Procedure Act relate primarily to adjudicatory proceedings rather than rule making proceedings. It is clear that in promulgating <em>The Dual Bate Cases </em>the Commission was proceeding in the area of rule making.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">\u201cRule\u201d and \u201crule making\u201d are defined as follows in \u00a7 2(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(c) (1958):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-13\">\u201c \u2018Rule\u2019 means the whole or any part of any agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or to describe the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of any agency and includes the approval or prescription for the future of rates, wages, corporate or financial structures or reorganizations thereof, prices, facilities, appliances, services or allowances therefore or of valuations, costs, or accounting, or practices bearing upon any of the foregoing. \u2018Rule making\u2019 means agency process for the formulation, amendment, or repeal of a rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-14\">Petitioners contend that \u00a7 14b did not permit the Commission to proceed by general rule; that it was required by the Shipping Act to proceed on a contract-by-contract basis. For the reasons already discussed we cannot agree.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>In our judgment the terms and conditions under which dual rates might be charged were the subject of rule making. In this area the Commission was acting in implementation of \u00a7 14b; its action was legislative rather than judicial in character. It was a prospective determination of the standards under which the conferences were to be permitted to act in the future rather than an adjudication as to whether those standards in a particular case had been met.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The rule making requirements with respect to hearings are set forth in \u00a7 4(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1003(b) (1958), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-4\">\u201cAfter notice required by this section, the agency shall afford interested persons an opportunity to participate in the ruling making through submission of written data, views, or arguments with or without opportunity to present the same orally in any manner; and, after consideration of all relevant matter presented, the agency shall incorporate in any rules adopted a concise general statement of their basis and purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">It is apparent that in rule making hearings the purpose is to permit the agency to educate itself and not to allow interested parties to choose the issues or narrow the scope of the proceedings The purpose of the notice is to allow interested parties to make useful comment and not to allow them to assert their \u201crights\u201d to insist that the rule take a particular form. The agency, in rule making, can look beyond the particular hearing record since it otherwise would be unable to draw upon its expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">That \u00a7 7 and \u00a7 8 of the Administrative Procedure Act are not to apply to the rule making hearings required by \u00a7 14b .of the Shipping Act is also clear from \u00a7 4(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-10\">\u201cWhere rules are required by statute <em>to be made on the record after opportunity for any agency hearing, </em>the requirements of section 1006 and 1007 of this title shall apply in place of the provisions of this subsection.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">While \u00a7 14b does require \u201cnotice and hearing,\u201d still, it does not require that the rules for which it provides be made \u201con the record\u201d after opportunity for agency hearing. The provisions of \u00a7 7 and \u00a7 8 of the Administrative Procedure Act, therefore, do not apply to the rule making provisions of \u00a7 14b of the Shipping Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">Petitioners contend that the Commission, by ordering hearings on the individual contracts proposed by the conferences, abandoned its rule making approach and resorted instead to a series of adjudicatory proceedings upon the individual contracts under consideration; that the requirements of \u00a7 7 and \u00a7 8 of the Administrative Procedure Act should apply to those proceedings. They assert that when, on March 27, 1964, <em>The Dual Bate Cases </em>was handed down, the Commission thus, without notice, reverted to rule making, disregarding and abandoning in mid-stream their adjudicatory proceedings and the rights of the conferences which were there in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">In this we agree in part with petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">As we view the situation, the Commission was faced with the choice of go<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>ing ahead as originally planned by general rule and uniform contract or of proceeding on a contract-by-contract basis in a series of adjudicatory proceedings to determine the sufficiency of the individual contracts under \u00a7 14b, with the Act, unimplemented by rule, forming the applicable standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Although the proposed uniform contract, as published in January, 1963, was never formally withdrawn, still, by acceding to conference demands, and by entering its orders of April 9, 1963, for hearing before an examiner of petitioners proposed contracts, the Commission indicated that it had chosen to proceed not by general rule but by individual adjudicatory proceedings on the individual contracts. Petitioners could reasonably assume from this action that they were engaged in a hearing under \u00a7 7 and \u00a7 8 of the Administrative Procedure Act, with the issues limited to such matters as were there presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">We do not agree with petitioners that the Commission thereafter was without power to revert to general rule and that its only alternative was to proceed under \u00a7 7 and \u00a7 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">In our judgment, however, under the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, it could not revert to general rule without first giving a \u00a7 4(b) notice of its intention and opportunity to petitioners to participate in the making of rules in the manner set forth in \u00a7 4(b). This it has not done. The remedy, however, is not through judicial action to restore to the conferences their own form of contract, but rather to restore to the conferences their opportunity to participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">We conclude that the order of the Commission must be set aside and that in any new order opportunity must be afforded petitioners to participate in rule making in such manner as the Commission may direct pursuant to \u00a7 4(b); such participation, however, to be limited to such clauses of the proposed contract as were not, in subject matter, dealt with in the hearings in petitioners\u2019 adjudicatory dockets or in Docket 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">This is not intended to suggest that notice was deficient only in its scope and that it must have encompassed the whole of the rule which ultimately emerged. We recognize that such is not the law. The deficiency here was in failure to give any notice whatsoever. It is the prejudice resulting from this failure which is limited, and which impels us to limit the scope of the participation to which petitioners are entitled upon remand. Petitioners have already, through the hearings which have been had, enjoyed to the fullest participation in the making of the resulting rule in the areas covered by those hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">We gather that this area in which petitioners have already participated covers the greater portion of the contract as approved by the Commission. As to that portion, the Commission is, of course, free forthwith to promulgate rules and establish the substance of approved contracts as to petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-13\">As to the contract of one of the petitioners, Latin America/Pacifie Coast Steamship Conference (Docket No. 1092), a hearing was ordered by the Commission but the conference was not named as party to Docket 1111. What we have said, however, applies to this petitioner as well as to the rest. Since the Commission was proceeding in the area where rule making was not required to be made \u201con the record,\u201d the notice and hearing requirements of \u00a7 4(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act were met if the conference had &lt; notice, and an opportunity to present its views to the Commission in hearing of Docket 1111. This it clearly had.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If it had anything to submit it could have joined in any appropriate proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-14\">Accordingly the orders under review are hereby set aside.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b247-6\">.

For example, the Senate Commerce Committee Report on the bill stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">\u201cThis broad rulemaking mandate [of \u00a7 9] should move the Commission, for example, to deal with three matters which the National Industrial Traffic League has urged upon us and upon the House Committee. While we would be strongly opposed to trying to freeze into legislation the solution to any of these three problems, they present matters which it seems to us the Commission is equipped to an [sic] should deal with under its rulemaking function.\u201d Index to Legislative History of the Steamship Conference/Dual Rate Law, S.Doc.No. 100, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. 213 (1962).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b251-11\">. As is discussed in the Commission\u2019s report, the Committee on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives, in its report on the bill which ultimately became Public Law 87-346, made it clear that the statute should result in more or less uniform dual rate contracts. The Committee said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-18\">\u201cIt is the expectation of the committee that a standard form of contract to be utilized by all conferences will be approved by the Board [now Commission] with such riders as may be required to suit the needs of a particular trade. This will greatly simplify the problem of shippers, who, of necessity must be members of a number of conferences, with respect to interpretation and application of differing provisions.\u201d Senate Committee on Commerce, Index to the Legislative History of the Steamship Conference /Dual Rate Law, S.Doc.No. 100, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. 120 (1962).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-19\">This objective was further emphasized by the Antitrust Subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary which played a major role (see Index to the Legislative History of the Steamship Conference/Dual Rate Law, supra, 117) in the formulation of Public Law 87-346 when it subsequently said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-20\">\u201cThe Federal Maritime Commission should establish minimal standards for dual-rate contracts beyond those set forth in Public Law 87-346 and should devise and publish a basic form contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>to be used by all conferences.\u201d H.Rept. No. 1419, 87th Cong., 2d Sess., page 390 (1962).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Petitioners argue that the House Reports should be paid little heed because the House-passed bill was amended in certain regards in the Senate. These amendments, however, had no bearing upon the need for uniform contracts. If anything, they strengthened the statutory position of the Commission from what it had been under the House-drafted bill. Thus the report of the House managers of the bill, after the Senate-House conference, stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-16\">\u201cThe House authorized the Commission to make rules and regulations necessary under specified sections of the act: the Senate amended by broadening the authority to include the entire act. The House receded from its position.\u201d Index to the Legislative History of the Steamship Conference/Dual Rate Law, supra, 445.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b252-17\">. Both the Senate and House committee reports on the bill extending the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>allowed the Commission (77 Stat. 5 [1963]) treated the action here under review as rule making: \u201cThe volume and diversity of comments from carriers and shippers <em>in the necessary rulemalcing procedures </em>were enormous * * S.Rept.
