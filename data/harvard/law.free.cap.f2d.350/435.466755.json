Lichtman.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We then deemed \u201cnot susceptible of disposition by summary judgment\u201d the appellant\u2019s claims that the appellees had violated the usury statute, D.C. Code \u00a7 28-2703 (1961), \u201cby charging interest in excess of <em>8%\u201d </em>and the so-called \u201cLoan Shark Law,\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 26-601 to 26-611 (1961), \u201cby lending money without a lender\u2019s license.\u201d After further proceedings in the District Court, the appellant\u2019s second amended complaint was dismissed, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-19\">Following remand, the appellant had filed an amended complaint. It was alleged that the appellees, who include two corporations and ten individuals, between 1955 and 1959 had participated with the appellant through various joint venture groups in some 17 business dealings having nexus with the District of Columbia. The appellant asked the District Court to declare that the transactions had required usurious payments and that the individual appellees should be caused to pay to the appellant usurious interest in the amount of $1,291,000. The appellant also prayed that the court declare its entitlement to recoup the total principal of various \u201cvoid and illegal loans\u201d in the amount of $2,125,819.31. The several transactions had involved participation by the respective parties in financing large real estate development projects organized by the appellant. The appellant additionally had asked the District Court to declare the two corporate appellees <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cto be the alter ego of the individual defendants\u201d; that certain assignments of land purchase contracts to the corporate appellees be declared void; and, finally, that the principal of the allegedly void loans \u201cbe forfeited by the individual appellees and remitted\u201d to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-20\">The respective appellees answered in March, 1963, setting up various defenses and counterclaims. The ten individual appellees and the appellee, Net Limited, Inc., represented by Mr. Bress, counterclaimed in part for damages aggregating $250,000. The appellee, Special Investments, Inc., represented by Mr. Albert Philipson, counterclaimed in part for damages of $953,000. At that time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>D.C.Code \u00a7 29-904(h) (1961) of the \u201cDistrict of Columbia Business Corporation Act,\u201d 68 Stat. 177 (hereinafter referred to as the 1954 Act), provided that a corporation had power \u201cto borrow money at such rates of interest as the corporation may determine without regard to the restrictions of any usury law * * *.\u201d Appellees have pointed to the legislative history of the 1954 Act and of the 1963 amendments which we have examined in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">It appears that on April 11, 1963, a Subcommittee of the House Committee on the District of Columbia conducted hearings on H.R. 4330 respecting certain proposed amendments to the 1954 Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In due course, as of September 3, 1963, Public Law 88-111, 77 Stat. 136, was approved. Pertinent here, D.C.Code \u00a7 29-904(h) (1961) was thereby amended by adding a new sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">\u201cNo corporation formed hereunder shall plead any statutes against usury in any action.\u201d (D.C.Code \u00a7 29-904(h) (Supp. IV, 1965.)) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZp\">On September 13, 1963, the appellees joined in filing a motion to dismiss on the ground that the complaint had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The motion recited, in pertinent part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-15\">\u201cThe action is for alleged usury. By reason of the District of Columbia Business Corporation Act, D.C. Code Secs. 29-904(h) and 29-933a, plaintiff corporation cannot assert usury, as more fully set forth in the memorandum in support hereof.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-16\">The appellant\u2019s opposition to the motion to dismiss, filed September 27, 1963, relied upon this court\u2019s earlier opinion and order, <em>supra, </em>and asserted further that the 1963 amendment applied only to corporations \u201cformed hereunder.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It argued that since the appellant is a foreign corporation, its rights did not depend upon the provisions of the Business Corporation Act of the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-17\">Such was the state of the record when the \u201cfirst judge\u201d on November 27, 1963 heard argument on the appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Orally the judge announced his \u201copinion that the action in this case is barred by the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>ute.\u201d An order was entered on December 3, 1963 granting the motion to dismiss, but \u201cwith leave to amend within 20 days.\u201d A further order on December 19, 1963 extended the time within which an amended complaint might be filed to January 2, 1964.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">The appellant\u2019s \u201csecond amended complaint\u201d was filed on January 2, 1964. Its allegations were unchanged from those of the first amended complaint except that appellant this time <em>pleaded </em>that the appellant is a Florida corporation which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">\u201cwas authorized to and did conduct business in the District of Columbia until plaintiff applied for and was issued, on June 9,1960, a Certificate of Withdrawal by the Superintendent of Corporations pursuant to the provisions of Title 29, \u00a7 933(a) [stc.].\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The appellees then filed their \u201cJoint Motions * * * to Dismiss * * \u201d asserting as \u201cthe law of the case\u201d that the second amended complaint failed to state a valid claim. That motion was argued before a \u201csecond judge\u201d on March 23, 1964 and was granted. The second judge in ruling stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">\u201cI want the order to show that the matters raised by the Second Amended Complaint were-raised, argued, and decided by another judge of this court and that this is virtually a motion for a rehearing before me when it should be before the other judge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">The order entered March 24, 1964 recited \u201cthat all relevant issues\u201d had been \u201craised and argued before\u201d the first judge who had \u201cgranted the joint motion\u201d of the appellees \u201cto dismiss for failure to state a claim, and that the Second Amended Complaint presents no issues not decided\u201d by the first judge. This appeal was taken from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b486-13\">The appellees say at once that this appeal was not timely, not having been taken within 30 days of the December 3, 1963 order. They contend we must dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We do not agree that all \u201crelevant issues\u201d had been raised and argued before the first judge. Nor was the December 3 order dispositive as \u201cthe law of the case,\u201d for the appellant had been granted leave to file its second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-14\">Filed within the time allowed, the second amended complaint placed before the second judge, <em>on the </em>pleadings,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> an issue as to whether or not a foreign corporation previously qualified, possessed different status when it actually filed in advance of suit a certificate of withdrawal as permitted by section 29-933a. The first judge had filed no opinion. He simply stated \u201cI am of the opinion that the action in this case is barred by the statute, and I will grant the motion to dismiss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-15\">There is no suggestion whatever that the consequences of the fact of withdrawal had been put in contention before the first judge. Counsel for the appellees had made no mention of the significance of the withdrawal of the appellant as a foreign corporation or the effect to be attributed to the purported change of status.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-19\">\u201cThe revocation of certificate of authority or the <em>\u2018voluntary withdrawal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number><em>of a foreign corporation </em>whereby its authority to do business in the District shall cease and be determined, shall not affect any action then pending, <em>nor affect any right of action upon any contract </em>made by the corporation in the District <em>before such </em>* * * <em>withdrawal </em>* * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-3\">Rather, the record shows the appellees were contending that D.C.Code \u00a7 29-904 (h) (1961) as set out in the 1954 Act and as amended in 1963 had barred the action. Specifically counsel submitted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\">\u201cSo we say it has been the law since 1954 but clearly since September 1963. No corporation in the District of Columbia may now plead usury under any usury statute either as a shield or as a weapon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The first judge observed: \u201cThe only question before me is whether or not your cause of action is barred by the statute.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Such was the background against which the first judge decided that \u201cthe action in this case is barred by the statute.\u201d And so it is we conclude that the second judge erred in ruling that all \u201crelevant issues\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> had been raised and disposed of by the December 3, 1963 order. The second amended complaint presented on the pleadings a quite different issue as to the status of the appellant, and the order entered March 24, 1964 dismissing the complaint was a final and appealable order.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The appeal taken April 9, 1964 was timely, and this court has jurisdiction of the case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b487-14\">We come at once to D.C.Code \u00a7 29-904 (h) (1961), as amended, D.C.Coode \u00a7 29-904(h) (Supp. IV, 1965), and its application to the claim of usury<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The pertinent language thus appears:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-15\">\u201cEach corporation shall have power:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-16\">*\u2022\u00bb***\u2022\u00bb</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-17\">\u201c(h) To make contracts and incur liabilities; to borrow money at such rates of interest as the corporation may determine <em>without regard to the restrictions of any usury law; </em>* * *. <em>No corporation formed </em>hereunder shall plead any statutes against usury in any action.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-20\">As previously noted, appellant had contended that the amendment could have application only to corporations \u201cformed hereunder.\u201d Here, however, this appellant as a Florida corporation had procured a certificate of authority to transact business in the District. It may even have sought to qualify in the first in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>stance on the theory that it then would be able during the period of 1955 to 1959 \u201cto borrow money at such rates of interest as the corporation may determine without regard to the restrictions of any usury law.\u201d When it received its certificate of authority, by virtue of section 29-933a it became possessed of \u201cthe same rights and privileges as, but no greater rights and privileges than, a domestic corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Chapter 27<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> of the District of Columbia Code deals generally with \u201cInterest and Usury.\u201d Parties to written contracts may provide for interest not exceeding eight per centum, but if a corporation shall agree to pay a greater rate, the <em>creditor </em>shall forfeit the \u201cwhole of the interest so contracted to be received.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> A corporation which actually shall have paid a \u201cgreater amount of interest than is herein declared to be lawful\u201d may recover \u201cthe unlawful interest\u201d from the creditor if suit be commenced within one year from the date of payment.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Yet other provisions of the Chapter dealt with various aspects of the \u201cInterest and Usury\u201d problem, including an express provision that as to contracts made or to be performed elsewhere wherein lawfully a higher rate of interest may be paid \u201cthan is lawful in the District,\u201d a judgment for a plaintiff shall include the <em>contract </em>rate to the date of judgment.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Such were the provisions affected when the 1954 Act in section 29-904 (h) permitted corporate borrowing \u201cwithout regard to the restrictions of any usury law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The 1954 Act had not repealed earlier legislation affecting corporations in the District, nor did it in terms repeal the usury statutes as applicable to corporations. But enlarging a corporation\u2019s power to borrow without regard to lawful interest rates was clearly inconsistent with the usury statutes which permitted suit by the corporate borrower and recovery from the lender of \u201cthe whole of the interest\u201d as contracted for.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">Congress in the 1954 Act had permitted a corporation to seek financing here on whatever terms it might arrange. We can not believe it was intended that a foreign corporation might seek authorization to do business here, become a borrower in the District, accept the benefits of the legislation, thereafter withdraw from the District, and at the same time be freed from the detriments of its contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-13\">On the contrary, D.C.Code \u00a7 29-934d (1961) provided that even if a certificate of withdrawal be filed by a foreign corporation, \u201cin any action upon any liability or obligation so incurred before * * * withdrawal,\u201d process might be served upon the Commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-14\">In such circumstances Congress passed the 1963 amendment. Whatever other rights and duties might have devolved upon the parties to the contract, Congress simply said \u201cstatutes against usury\u201d were not to be pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-15\">Since this appellant had gained its authority to do business in the District under the 1954 Act, by virtue of section 29-933a it became subject to all \u201crestrictions\u201d and otherwise as might be \u201cnow or hereafter imposed upon a domestic corporation of like character.\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-16\"> The filing of the certificate of withdrawal, we are now satisfied, could, not change the status appellant\u2019s contracts had acquired prior thereto. The 1963 amendment to section 29-904(h) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>simply clarified the applicable law so far as the usury statutes were involved. The complaint to recover usurious interest was barred by the statute.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">We now consider a quite different problem, for the appellant additionally had relied upon D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 26-601 to 26-611, sometimes known as the Loan Shark Law.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It is a licensing statute.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In Hartman v. Lubar<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> this court held that a usurious loan contract with a lender who was violating the licensing statute was illegal and void and that proof of the claimed violation should have been received. Thus, a borrower who had entered into a usurious contract, void because the lender was violating the statute, was entitled to recover from the lender any damages sustained by reason of the void contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The effect of a failure to comply with the licensing statute was again considered in Royall v. Yudelevit.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> This court then pointed out that a right of action for damages may flow from a loan which is (1) usurious and (2) granted by an unlicensed lender. Merely to state the appellant\u2019s claim in broad terms may suggest it need prove only that the appellees were engaged \u201cin the business of loaning money\u201d without complying with the requirements of the licensing statute and had here entered into loans under which usurious interest had been exacted, as the result of which the appellant had suffered damage. It is clear, however, that this court\u2019s holding in the <em>Royall </em>case may apply <em>only </em>if the appellees cannot establish an adequate, affirmative defense. We express no opinion whatever on the purported merits to the extent pleaded of record. Even so, the appel-lees would have us say that since one of the elements of such a claim involves proof of usury, section 29-904(h) as amended would bar the appellant\u2019s claim in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-18\">We are not persuaded to that view. The District of Columbia Business Corporation Act is totally unrelated to the licensing statute now under consideration. The two statutes serve utterly different purposes. It would seem indisputable from the legislative history and from our cases that the Business Corporation Act and the law governing licensed lending<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> are independent legislative acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-19\">Congress has said, as here apropos, that a corporation may fund itself on any basis it determines but may not plead usury thereafter, <em>supra, </em>Part II.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-20\">It has likewise said that engaging in the business of lending money without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>being licensed to charge permitted rates is unlawful and illegal. And we have said that contracts illegally entered into under such circumstances are void, and that damages flowing from that type of transaction may be recovered unless the lender \u201ccan establish an adequate affirmative defense.\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">There was error in dismissing the appellant\u2019s complaint insofar as it stated a claim as discussed in Part III of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">WILBUR K. MILLER, Senior Circuit Judge, concurs in Parts I and III of the foregoing opinion, and concurs in the result reached in Part II.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b484-15\">. 114 U.S.App.D.C. 90, 311 F.2d 776 (1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b484-16\">.
