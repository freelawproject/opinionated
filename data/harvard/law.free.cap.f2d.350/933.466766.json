Of the 11.74 acres taken, approximately 5.2 acres were zoned for cemetery purposes and 6.5 acres were not so zoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-22\">In seeking to establish the value of the land taken, Eden relied upon evidence of the capitalization of projected income, or as it is sometimes referred to \u201cthe income approach\u201d. The Government assigns the introduction of this evidence as error. The Government also contends that the trial court erred in rejecting or limiting some of the evidence offered by the Government to establish value by \u201ccomparable\u201d sales, and a prior sale of the instant property.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-23\">At the time of the acquisition of the instant property by Eden in 1953, the California State Highway Department had already planned a highway to traverse a portion of the Eden property. Apparently because of this fact, the Los An-geles City Planning Commission withheld a conditional use permit or zone variance for the 6.5 acres then contemplated to be used for highway purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>In its cross-appeal, Eden contends that the District Court erred in rejecting evidence offered as to the value of the 6.5 acres as cemetery land.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">This Court has jurisdiction in this case pursuant to Title 28, U.S.C. \u00a7 1358 and Title 28, U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">The first question raised by Appellant is whether the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the land owner directed to capitalization of future income. The American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers in its work \u201cThe Appraisal of Real Estate\u201d (1964) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-7\">\u201cAppraisers commonly think of value in three ways:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-8\">1. The current cost of reproducing a property less depreciation from all sources, that is, deterioration and functional and economic obsolescence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-9\">2. The value which the property\u2019s net earning power will support, based upon a capitalization of net income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-10\">3. The value indicated by recent sales of comparable properties in the market.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-11\">The three approaches \u2014 Cost, income, and market data \u2014 are based on these three facets of value. In the majority of his assignments, the appraiser utilizes all three approaches. On occasion he may believe the value indication from one approach will be more significant than from the other two, yet he will use all three as a check against each and to test his own judgment. Obviously there are appraisal problems in which they cannot all be applied. A value indication for vacant land cannot be obtained through the use of the cost approach, nor one for a specialized property such as municipal garden \u2022 by the market data approach, nor but rarely for an owner-occupied home by the income approach. The use of all three approaches is pertinent in the solution of most appraisal problems; their application is well established in appraisal tech-\u00f1ique and held to be part of the fundamental procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-15\">In United States v. Certain Interests in Property, etc., 205 F.Supp. 745, 750, the United States District Court of Montana stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-16\">\u201cIn condemnation actions there are three recognized approaches to the valuation of property:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-17\">(1) The market data approach or consideration of comparable sales;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-18\">(2) The reproduction of cost at the time of taking, less depreciation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-19\">(3) The income approach or capitalization of projected income.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-20\">See also United States v. Leavell &amp; Ponder, Inc., 5 Cir., 286 F.2d 398; United States v. Tampa Bay Garden Apartments, Inc., 5 Cir., 294 F.2d 598; Cementerio Buxeda Inc. v. People of Puerto Rico, 196 F.2d 177, cert. den. 344 U.S. 876, 73 S.Ct. 170, 97 L.Ed. 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-21\">We conclude the Court properly admitted the evidence as to capitalization of income to establish the value of the property taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-22\">The second question raised by Appellant is whether the trial court erred in the rejection of certain evidence offered by Appellant as to \u201ccomparable sales\u201d. Evidence of comparable sales is an appropriate method to the determination of value in condemnation cases. \u201cThe Appraisal of Real Estate\u201d, supra; United States v. Certain Interests in Property, etc., supra; Simmonds v. United States, (9th Cir.), 199 F.2d 305; Fairfield Gardens, Inc. v. United States, (9th Cir.), 306 F.2d 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-23\">Whether or not a sale constitutes a \u201ccomparable sale\u201d so as to constitute evidence of value is within the sound discretion of the trial court. Fairfield Gardens, Inc., supra; Bailey v. United States, 1 Cir., 325 F.2d 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-24\">A review of the record in this case does not disclose an abuse of discretion by the trial court in excluding the evidence offered by Appellant, nor does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>it appear that the trial court erred in instructing the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">The final question for us to determine is Cross-Appellant\u2019s assertion that the 6.5 acres not zoned for cemetery purposes should have been valued as though the land had been zoned for cemetery purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">At the trial of this case, the Court allowed the jury to consider evidence as to the probability of a change in the zoning of the 6.5 acres to cemetery use. It is obvious from the jury\u2019s verdict that it considered the possibility of such a change as an extremely remote one, if in fact there was any possibility at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\"> In a condemnation proceeding the land taken must be valued as it exists at the time of taking and subject to the then applicable zoning regulations. Rapid Transit Co. v. United States, 10 Cir., 295 F.2d 465, cert. den. 369 U.S. 819, 82 S.Ct. 831, 7 L.Ed.2d 785. The zoning placed upon the 6.5 acres in question was within the discretion of the appropriate authority of the City of Los Angeles. Bringle v. Board of Supervisors, 54 Cal.2d 86, 4 Cal.Rptr. 493, 351 P.2d 765; Rassmussen v. County of Orange, 212 Cal.App.2d 246, 27 Cal.Rptr. 866; Village of Euclid, Ohio v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365, 47 S.Ct. 114, 71 L.Ed. 303; Goldblatt v. Town of Hempstead, 369 U.S. 590, 82 S.Ct. 987, 8 L.Ed.2d 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">The record in this case discloses that at the time the land owner acquired the property it was contemplated by state and local authorities that some portion of the property would ultimately be required for highway purposes. At the time the land owner sought a zoning classification for cemetery purposes it was aware of the possible future use for highway purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">It was not an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion in rejecting Cross-Appellant\u2019s request to value the 6.5 acres as though zoned for cemetery purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">Judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
