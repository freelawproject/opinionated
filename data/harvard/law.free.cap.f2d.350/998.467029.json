Hearing the noise, Ap-pellee emerged from a nearby house and gave chase in his damaged auto. Singleton was without question leaving the scene without stopping to identify himself or for any other purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-23\">Several blocks later, while both vehicles were stopped for a red light, Appellee got out of his car and told Singleton that he had struck Appellee\u2019s car; Singleton paid no attention, passed the red light and the chase continued. Whenever Appellee tried to overtake Singleton, the latter shifted lanes, making that impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-24\">At the next stage of his odyssey, Singleton brushed a police officer on the hip after ignoring a stop sign. The officer then joined the hot pursuit at Ap-pellee\u2019s invitation as a passenger in the latter\u2019s car. The pace of the pursuit then quickened, with both vehicles exceeding the speed limit and passing stop signs and red lights. Finally, both turned into a one-way street, Singleton being in the left lane and Appellee in the right. As the two vehicles pulled even, the officer shouted to Singleton to pull over. Appellant\u2019s truck then swerved to the right into Appellee\u2019s car, forcing it partially off the street. The chase continued further on wheels; still further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>on foot, the police officer running after Singleton. Trapped, Singleton attacked the officer with a metal stanchion. The officer then ended the chase by shooting and wounding Singleton with two bullets. All this is undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-4\">Other facts were in dispute and were resolved by the jury. Appellant\u2019s president and manager testified Singleton had been expressly ordered not to drive the truck but in answer to special interrogatories the jury found (1) that Singleton was not driving the truck contrary to Appellant\u2019s express instructions; (2) that at the time of the original collision Singleton was engaged in collecting and/or delivering television sets belonging to Appellant\u2019s customers; (3) that the subsequent swerving \u2014 which forced Appellee\u2019s car off the road \u2014 was Singleton\u2019s intentional act; (4) that Appellee sustained injuries in the amount of $6750.00 as a result of that swerving.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\"> In our view of the case, we need not ascertain whether the jury responses to the special interrogatories have a basis in the evidence adduced at trial. The <em>undisputed </em>facts recited appear to us to require reversal of the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Singleton was engaged in his master\u2019s busi-' ness when he swerved \u2014 intentionally as the jury found \u2014 into Appellee\u2019s car.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Singleton\u2019s extended flight following the first collision, involving reckless disregard of traffic regulations and human life, must be denominated his own \u201cfrolic\u201d and none of Appellant\u2019s affair. Singleton\u2019s actions after his collision with the police officer and perhaps at all times after his contact with Appellee\u2019s car were essentially unlawful. His attempt to use a weapon on the officer was in the same pattern; the jury affirmatively rejected any claim that the swerving of the car was merely negligent. It cannot by any stretch of the imagination be thought to have served his master\u2019s interest in, any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-8\">Of course it is true that an employer may be liable in some circumstances for the intentional torts of his employee arising out of the employment. The leading case on the point in this jurisdiction is Dilli v. Johnson, 71 App.D.C. 139, 107 F.2d 669 (1939); and <em>Dilli </em>is heavily relied upon by Appellee to sustain the District Court\u2019s judgment. In that case,</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-9\">The assault occurred when plaintiff told * * * [the employee in charge] that his hamburger sandwich contained unground meat -* * With this evidence before it, the jury was justified in finding that the servant, <em>whose duty it was </em>* * * <em>to adjust any disputes or differences with the customer, </em>was acting within the scope of his employment when he resented the complaint by violently attacking the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-11\">71 App.D.C. at 140, 107 F.2d at 670. (Emphasis added.) We think it is a long step, however, from the conduct of the employee in <em>Dilli </em>in \u201cremedying\u201d a customer\u2019s complaint to the conduct of Singleton here sought to be attributed to his employer. It is a step we decline to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-12\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the case remanded for the entry of judgment for Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"atf-dedup-0\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">. Appellee argues that the duty of Singleton to stop and report his first collision \u2022was a duty of <em>Ms employment </em>and thus his flight was attributable to his employer; but that obligation is not primarily tbe obligation of tbe owner of tbe vehicle but rather of the <em>operator. </em>Whether the owner of a vehicle, not operating and not present is covered by the statute we need not decide.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
