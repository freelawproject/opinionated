United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 633, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANB\">Defendants-appellants were found guilty by a jury on one of two counts of a federal indictment charging them with falsely representing themselves to be FBI agents in violation of Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 912. A federal judge in the Northern District of Ohio sentenced them to the custody of the Attorney General for three years, with three months of such custody to be served in jail, and sentences to be suspended thereafter with defendants placed on five years probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">Defendants appeal. Having been convicted for employing illegal means to achieve a lawful purpose, they now assert that their convictions were secured by the government by illegal means.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-14\">Defendants Lonardo and Guerrieri were agents of a bonding company which had written a $50,000 bond for one Joseph Arrington and a $25,000 bond for one Alfred Oponowicz. Both of these latter had previously been charged with armed robbery of a bank. When neither of them appeared for trial, defendants undertook to locate them in order to avoid the penalty of forfeiture of the total of $75,000 in bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-15\">It appears that defendant Lonardo learned that a man named Louis Gaye was a close associate of Arrington\u2019s and was assisting in purchasing a car for Ar-rington. On the evening of February 8, 1963, assisted by defendant Stewart, Lonardo waited near the car lot until Gaye picked up the certificate of title and drove away. Lonardo and Stewart followed, forced Gaye to stop his car, and at pistol point, forced Gaye and his passenger, Betty Flonnoy, to get into the Lonardo car. Subsequently, these two defendants were joined by defendant Guerrieri and defendant Manos.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-16\">For several hours thereafter Gaye and Flonnoy were questioned by defendants in automobiles and at Gaye\u2019s apartment. Ultimately Gaye made a phone call in defendants\u2019 presence to Arrington which led to his capture, trial and conviction. The testimony indicated that when Gaye\u2019s car was stopped, and at various other times, defendants displayed pistols. Gaye and Flonnoy at trial testified that defendants repeatedly identified themselves as FBI agents. This defendants denied \u2014 but the jury quite apparently believed Gaye and Flonnoy on this point. Defendants also testified to contacts with various members of the Cleveland Police Department before and during the events of February 8, which they apparently regard as sanction of their extraordinary<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>After Arrington\u2019s arrest and return to Cleveland on March 15, 1963, Gaye and Miss Flonnoy were interviewed by Agent O\u2019Hara of the FBI. An FBI stenographer took notes of the interview and transcribed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Subsequently, Agent O\u2019Hara employed the transcripts in making out formal FBI interview reports \u2014 called 302 Reports \u2014 of these witnesses\u2019 testimony. Thereafter defendants were indicted for falsely posing as FBI agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">A week and a half before trial of the defendants Agent O\u2019Hara removed the copies of the stenographic transcripts from the file of the United States Attorney and destroyed them. The agent testified that destruction of \u201cinterview notes\u201d was in accordance with FBI procedures once the formal interview reports had been made out.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">At trial defendants\u2019 counsel sought and received permission under the Jencks Act, Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500, to inspect the 302 Reports and to use them for purposes of cross-examination. He also sought the original stenographic transcripts for the same purpose. These, of course, were not available to be produced, since they had been destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">At trial the United States contended that all that was destroyed were the notes of the agent after the notes had been transcribed and that the ultimate reports were produced. The government claimed that these \u201cinterview notes\u201d of the agent were not the statements of the witnesses as contemplated by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Defendants, on the other hand, contended that what had been destroyed were the actual verbatim statements of the witnesses as given to a shorthand reporter and transcribed by her. They also contended that at least the Flonnoy statement was adopted and approved by the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">In this regard defendants rely upon the testimony of the FBI stenographer. This same witness also gave support to Miss Flonnoy\u2019s testimony that in her statement to the FBI she had referred to the Cleveland police contacts during the events of February 8, but that such references were eliminated in the final \u201c302 Reports.\u201d Defendants contended that the original transcripts would have been valuable to them for purposes of cross-examination of Gaye and Flonnoy.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">At the trial the District Judge took testimony dealing with the nature of the destroyed documents and apparently concluded that they were \u201cstatements\u201d within the meaning of the Jencks Act. He did not, however, grant defendants\u2019 motions for striking the Gaye and Flonnoy testimony or for a mistrial, but devised an alternative sanction. He allowed cross-examination as to the nature of the documents and the method of their destruction before the jury and charged the jury that it could infer from the fact of destruction that the destroyed documents contained material unfavorable to the government\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-14\">In this appeal we are required first to determine whether or not the documents which were destroyed were \u201cstatements\u201d within the meaning of the Jencks Act. If so, we must then determine whether or not the \u201csanction\u201d employed by the District Judge meets the requirements of the Jencks Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-15\">As to the \u201cstatement\u201d question, the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-16\">\u201cThe term \u2018statement\u2019 * * * means * * * (2) a stenographic -x- -x- -x- recording, or a tran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>scription thereof, which is a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by said witness to an agent of the Government and recorded contemporaneously with the making of such oral statement.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The two government witnesses, Gaye and Flonnoy, testified that at the first FBI interview a stenographer was present who took down what they said word for word. Each also testified that they later saw and read a transcript of the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The government stenographer who took the statements which are in controversy testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">\u201cQ Now, going to the \u2022 time of March the 15th, when you were called in and Mrs. Flonnoy was making her statement, can you tell us\u2014 I am not asking you to recall what she said, but the manner in which this statement was taken; for instance, was it question and answer? Did the officers ask her a question and she give an answer, or was it just a rhetorical statement by her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-13\"><em>\u201cA </em>She was advised to tell it in her own words, so she would say\u2014 she would go on \u2014 maybe they would stop, and they would say, \u2018Did you say this?\u2019 and she would say, \u2018No. I said this.\u2019 That would clarify anything they didn\u2019t understand, but she did give it herself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-14\">\u201cQ You were taking it down, your notes, exactly from her voice, her statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-15\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-16\">\u201cQ At any time was the statement that Mrs. Flonnoy made paraphrased by one of the officers, for instance, did she go on and make a certain statement, and then the offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>cer put it in his words so that you would put his words in your notes rather than what the witness, rather than what the witness, Flonnoy, said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">\u201cA The only thing I can remember is grammar, you know, correcting grammar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">\u201cQ You mean the officer would interpose and interfere and correct her grammar in the way she was telling it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">\u201cA Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-8\">\u201cQ Would he in any sense formulate any statement in his own words from what she said, and then dictate it to you, what he, in his words, interpreted her to say ? I hope that is clear to you. In other words, did she make a statement and then the officer would, or dictate it to you, what you should put down in your notes as her statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-9\">\u201cA As I stated before, the only thing I really remember is grammar, not really changing it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-10\">\u201cQ Your recollection is distinct. You took down word for word what the witness said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-11\">\u201cA Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">This witness also testified that the two statements covered thirty pages \u2014 about twelve pages to the Flonnoy statement and the balance in the Gaye statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">This record convinced the trial judge that the destroyed transcripts were Jencks Act statements. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-14\">\u201cNo Court is going to sit by and observe the destruction of a statement which comes within the Jencks Act the matter of a few days before trial, and simply accept it as a statement of fact, and accept it in the sense that the Jencks Act requires no further sanctions or compliance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-15\">We believe he was correct in this conclusion. The testimony pertaining to the taking of the statements is sufficient for us to hold that these were \u201cstenographic\u201d transcripts which were \u201csubstantially verbatim\u201d and \u201ceontemporane-ously recorded\u201d within the meaning of the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500(e) (2). From the testimony referred to we hold that the statements \u201ccan fairly be said to be the witness\u2019 own.\u201d Palermo v. United States, 360 U.S. 343, 350, 79 S.Ct. 1217, 3 L.Ed.2d 1287 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-18\">The United States Supreme Court has considered the application of the Jencks Act to one form of statement. Where an FBI agent took longhand notes in the course of an interview, reviewed them with the witness, subsequently incorporated the substance of these notes in an Interview (or 302) Report, and then destroyed the notes, and the District Court held that the evidence showed that the report was \u201calmost in <em>ipsissima verba\u201d </em>the witness\u2019 narrative, the Supreme Court held the Interview Report producible. Campbell [II] v. United States, 373 U.S. 487, 491, 83 S.Ct. 1356, 10 L.Ed. 2d 501 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-19\">In this case, of course, we deal with somewhat different facts. As we have noted, the 302, or Interview Reports, were produced. This appeal concerns the transcripts taken in shorthand and then typed by the stenographer for the FBI. Prior to their destruction these transcripts had been reworked into Interview Reports \u2014 but at least as to the Flonnoy statement, with substantial variances. Thus far there does not appear to be any precedent directly in point in relation to this type of statement. But the grounds which we have recited for the inclusion of such a statement under the Jencks Act appear, if anything, to be stronger than those supporting the holdings above.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-20\">On this record we find no need to pass on defendants\u2019 claim that the statements were also producible under Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500(e) (1) because they subsequently were read and adopted by Gaye and Flonnoy. See Williams v. United States, 338 F.2d 286 (C.A.D.C.1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-21\">Perhaps we should also seek to define the limits of our holding in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-22\">This is not a situation wherein the identical information was otherwise available to defendants. See Rosenberg <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>v. United States, 360 U.S. 367, 370-371, 79 S.Ct. 1231, 3 L.Ed.2d 1304 (1959); Killian v. United States, 368 U.S. 231, 244, 82 S.Ct. 302, 7 L.Ed.2d 256 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">It is also clear that no satisfactory \u201csecondary evidence\u201d was made available to counsel for defendants. The fact that reference to Cleveland police officers\u2019 participation in the events of February 8 was deleted from the Flonnoy 302 Report is sufficient evidence that it was not a substitute for the \u201cstatement\u201d which was destroyed. Cf. United States v. Thomas, 282 F.2d 191, 194-195 (C.A.2, 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">In the words of Mr. Justice Brennan dissenting in Rosenberg v. United States, supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">\u201cThis is not a case in which the statement erroneously withheld from the defense merely duplicated information already in the defense\u2019s possession; it is not a case in which the witness\u2019 testimony was unimportant to the proofs necessary for conviction; and it is not a case in which the witness\u2019 statement was wholly void of possible use for impeachment.\u201d Rosenberg v. United States, supra, 360 U.S. at 376, 79 S.Ct. at 1237 (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Having thus held that the statements demanded by the defendants (and not produced because previously destroyed) were Jencks Act statements, we turn to the question of appropriate sanctions. The only sanctions mentioned squarely in the Jencks Act are: \u201c[T]he court shall strike from the record the testimony of the witness, and the trial shall proceed unless the court in its discretion shall determine that the interests of justice require that a mistrial be declared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">In this case, however, the District Judge, after concluding that the statements were governed by the Jencks Act, allowed the jury to hear testimony about them and their destruction and charged the jury thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-9\">\u201c * * * I now instruct you that the destruction by the special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the typewritten transcript of the statements made by the witnesses Gaye and Flonnoy permits you to draw the inference that the documents destroyed contained matters which were unfavorable to the Government in the prosecution of this case. I say to you that it permits you to draw this inference. It does not compel you to draw this inference. That is the reason I permitted you to hear the officer testify on this subject, and it is for you to determine whether or not you will draw such an inference or not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-13\">It seems to us that the District Judge was in doubt as to whether the destruction of the statements was in good or bad faith and that he felt under all of the circumstances a lesser penalty was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-14\">Obviously, this issue has aroused the attention of the United States Supreme Court. In Campbell [I] v. United States, 365 U.S. 85, 81 S.Ct. 421, 5 L.Ed.2d 428 (1961), we find the question squarely posed \u2014 but not answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-15\">\u201cThe parties argue whether destruction may be regarded as the equivalent of noncompliance with an order to produce under that subsection. The Government contends that only destruction for improper motives or in bad faith should be so regarded. The petitioners contend that destruction without regard to the circumstances should be so regarded. However, this record affords us no opportunity to decide this important question of the construction of subsection (d).\u201d Campbell v. United States, supra at 98, 81 S.Ct. at 428.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-16\">Also in Campbell [II] v. United States, 373 U.S. 487, 83 S.Ct. 1356, 10 L.Ed.2d 501 (1963), we find further reference in this footnote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-17\">\u201cThese issues, basically, are whether the Interview Report is producible under \u00a7 3500(e) (2) of the Jencks Act and whether, if the notes are producible under the Act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>their destruction gives rise to sanctions under subsection (d), or permits secondary evidence of their contents to be produced. The second district judge found that the Interview Report was a substantially verbatim recording of Staula\u2019s oral statement to Toomey and hence producible under \u00a7 3500(e) (2). The Court of Appeals disagreed. Moreover, in denying rehearing, the Court of Appeals rendered an opinion holding that no sanctions could attach to Toomey\u2019s destruction of his notes because such destruction had not been in bad faith. 303 F.2d at 751. Our holding that the Interview Report is producible under \u00a7 3500(e) (1) makes it unnecessary for us to consider any of the other issues, and we intimate no view on the correctness of the Court of Appeals\u2019 rulings on them.\u201d Campbell v. United States, supra at 491, n. 5, 83 S.Ct. at 1359.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">In the case before us we see no need to characterize the destruction of these statements as in good faith or bad \u2014 as honest or corrupt. These were no long lost documents or clerical filing errors. The destruction was deliberate; it was on the eve of trial; it was accomplished by the government agent in charge of preparing evidence for the prosecution of the ease. The fact that the agent who destroyed them may have done so in reliance upon FBI regulations (or in good faith belief that such existed) does not alter the nature of the sanctions imposed by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">All this ease requires us to hold, and all we do hold, is that where a stenographic transcript of a witness\u2019 statement has been made which constitutes a \u201cstatement\u201d within the meaning of the Jencks Act, the government cannot avoid the responsibility for producing it or losing the benefit of that witness\u2019 testimony by deliberately destroying that transcript on the eve of the trial. This holding is further restricted, as hereinafter set forth more particularly, to a situation where the defendant has not been furnished, in the form of a 302 Report or otherwise, the very same information contained in the statement which has been destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">Striking of the witnesses\u2019 testimony might well have been an inadequate remedy. In \u201cthe interests of justice\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we believe that the District Judge should have entered an order for mistrial when it became obvious that the statements could, not be produced, and that we must do so now.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">We recognize, of course, that this may mean that the government is deprived of important evidence at the new trial and that this deprivation might frustrate this prosecution. But our system of justice requires that the government should set an example of living by its own law.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-13\">As we have noted, the District Judge found, and our review of the record convinces us that he did so correctly, that there were substantial differences between the stenographic transcript taken from witness Flonnoy and the 302 Report which the court ordered produced and which was produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-14\">There was no such finding as to substantial differences between the stenographic transcript of witness Gaye\u2019s testimony and the 302 Report similarly produced in relation to him. On remand for new trial, if the District Judge finds that the defendant has been furnished, by dint of the 302 Report, with \u201cthe very same information\u201d to which they were entitled, there would then be no requirement of Jencks Act sanctions to forbid the testimony of witness Gaye. See Rosenberg <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>v. United States, supra, 360 U.S. at 371, 79 S.Ct. 1231.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">One other matter needs to be dealt with briefly. On appeal the government took the position that no sanctions were required under 18,U.S.C. \u00a7 3500(d) because it had not elected not to comply with a court order for production of the statements. The appellee\u2019s brief says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">\u201cThe Act clearly relates to statements \u2018in the possession of the United States.\u2019 This paragraph of the Act does not say statement or documents \u2018once\u2019 in their possession.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">This record is clear on the point that these statements yere \u201cin the possession of the United States.\u201d We are asked to hold that they were not \u201cin the possession of the United States\u201d for Jencks Act purposes because of their deliberate destruction by an agent of the United States a week and a half before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Legislation should be interpreted in accordance with its stated and its obvious intent. United States v. Braverman, 373 U.S. 405, 408, 83 S.Ct. 1370, 10 L.Ed.2d 444 (1963); Owensboro Wagon Company v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 209 F.2d 617, 619 (C.A.6, 1954). To hold with the interpretation argued for above would be to permit evasion and emasculation of the Jencks Act to the point of total ineffectiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">It should be added that we believe our holding in this case is considerably less far-reaching than our colleague, Judge O\u2019Sullivan, deems it. Specifically, we deem it entirely consistent with the recent holdings of this court affirming District Judges\u2019 rulings that FBI Agents\u2019 notes and government attorneys\u2019 witness sheets were not in the circumstances there involved Jencks Act statements. United States of America v. Hoffa et al., 349 F.2d 20 (C.A.6, 1965). United States v. Gosser, 339 F.2d 102, 113 (C.A.6, 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">Reversed, sentences vacated, and remanded for new trial in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b572-17\">.

I share my brothers\u2019 concern for maintaining the integrity of procedures employed in criminal trials and recognize the power of federal courts to exercise surveillance over the conduct of federal officers. Yet I cannot avoid the conclusion that this is but a case where persons convicted of crime seek judicial absolution by wearisome repetition of inapplicable passages from the immortal literature of the law, and by characterizing as \u201cdeliberate, malicious and corrupt,\u201d conduct of an FBI agent which, at worst, I would characterize as unthinking or which the meanly uncharitable might call stupid. While in this field we do not test the propriety of the challenged conduct by our view of whether prejudice to an accused resulted, I feel it not inappropriate to say that my own study of the record persuades me that no impairment of appellants\u2019 defense resulted from what happened. As support for my view that the District Judge exercised sound discretion in handling the situation may I also, at the cost of some repetition, recite the interesting events which provided the setting for this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">Defendant Dominic C. Lonardo of Cleveland, Ohio, and defendant Mario John Guerrieri of Youngstown, Ohio, were both in the bail bond business. They were agents of a concern identified as The Maryland National Insurance Company, but Ohio law and their arrangement with their company required that Lonardo and Guerrieri personally pay the bill when bonds were forfeited for failure of a client to appear for trial. Londardo had written a $50,000 bail bond for one Joseph Arrington and Guerrieri provided $25,000 bail for one Oponowicz who, with Arrington, a Charles Pollizi and another, were to appear for trial on burglary charges in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Criminal Division of the Common Pleas Court of Cuyahoga County, Ohio, on February 4, 1963. Although Lonardo had been in touch with Arrington on the evening before the trial, Arrington failed to appear for trial and Oponowicz disappeared shortly after appearing at the courthouse and has not been located since. The bail bonds of Arrington and Opono-wicz were accordingly forfeited and if Lonardo and Guerrieri were unable to produce them within a prescribed time, they stood to personally pay $50,000 and $25,000, respectively. Lonardo and Guerrieri were, therefore, interested in finding their missing principals.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The government\u2019s evidence was such that the jury could, and evidently did, find the following facts which constituted the crime for which defendants were indicted and convicted. From some source, Lonardo learned that one Louis Gaye had information as to the whereabouts of the fugitive Arrington. On the day in question, Lonardo, defendant Stewart and a nondefendant, all armed, apprehended Gaye driving a car on a Cleveland street. With pointed guns and calling out that they were the FBI, they ordered Gaye to the curb and at gun point took Gaye and a lady companion, Betty Mae Flonnoy, prisoners. Lonar-do and his companions then took their prisoners to the vicinity of a Cleveland police station where defendants Mario Guerrieri and Peter Manos joined the party. Mrs. Flonnoy was directed to get in a second car and after another stop both cars were driven to Gaye\u2019s home with the idea that from there Gaye would make contact with Ar-rington. Gaye and Mrs. Flonnoy were apprehended in the late afternoon. Gaye was kept in custody until about 4:00 A.M. the next morning and Mrs. Flonnoy was taken home by the Lonardo party sometime after midnight. The coup worked and through a call to Birmingham, Alabama, by Gaye the whereabouts of fugitive Arrington was discovered and he was captured and returned to Cleveland for trial. There was ample evidence that throughout the involved events Lonardo and party justified their conduct by representing that they were a party of FBI agents, and implemented this pretense by the display of their guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Defendants denied that they represented themselves to be FBI agents. Otherwise they offered little change in the above scenario. Lonardo, Guerrieri, Manos and Stewart were all carrying guns, but attributed the carrying and display of their armament to fear that the fugitive Arrington, described, and probably correctly, as a dangerous man, would appear or have equally dangerous associates. The Cleveland police were also interested in apprehending Arring-ton and knew something of and may have cooperated in what was going on. The appendices before us, however, provide no clear explanation as to why the capture and inquisition of Gaye were not turned over to the police authorities. Disclaiming that they held themselves out as FBI agents, the defendants, so far as the appendices disclose, provide no information as to what they did tell Gaye and Mrs. Flonnoy to justify their being taken and held captive.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">The above events were the subject matter of the questioning of the witnesses Flonnoy and Gaye and of the stenographer\u2019s transcripts later destroyed by an FBI agent. Because the destroyed transcripts apparently contained some verbatim statements, I accept the District Judge\u2019s determination that they were \u201cstatements\u201d within the meaning of the Jencks Act. The majority opinion discusses the background to their destruction before concluding that the resulting nonproduction calls for a new trial at which the testimony of the witness Flon-noy will not, and that of witness Gaye may not, be admitted. I construe the opinion, however, as announcing a rigid rule that regardless of the circumstances, intentional destruction by an agent of the government of any writing that can be found to be a \u201cstatement\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3500(e), effectively forecloses the government from using the testimony of the witness unless \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>very same information\u201d is made available to the defense. This will be so without reference to the agent\u2019s good faith so long as the destruction was deliberate. My brothers say,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-4\">\u201cIn the case before us we see no need to characterize the destruction of these statements as in <em>good, faith or bad </em>\u2014 as <em>honest or corrupt. </em>* * The fact that the agent who destroyed them may have done so in reliance upon FBI regulations (or in good faith belief that such existed) does not alter the nature of the sanctions imposed by the statute.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">In the case at bar, application of this rule may well be tantamount to dismissal because the government must rely upon the witnesses Gaye and Flonnoy to sustain its case. The rule will indeed be far reaching; henceforth every investigative branch of the government will be under the compulsion to refrain from destroying any piece of paper that can arguably be found to be a \u201cstatement\u201d under the Jencks Act. No error of judgment or good faith belief in the propriety of destroying such a statement by any government employee will permit escape from the sanctions of the Jencks Act, unless \u201cthe very same information\u201d has somehow been preserved in another form.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">In my view, neither the language of the statute nor any decision of the United States Supreme Court or any other court construing the Act supports such results. Certainly the decision in Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657, 77 S.Ct. 1007, 1 L.Ed.2d 1103 (1957), which precipitated Congress to pass the Jencks Act, did not so hold nor have we been cited any case which before Jencks announced such a rule. The sanctions of the statute are to be applied when the government fails to produce a statement <em>\u201cin the possession of the United States\u201d </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500 (b), (Emphasis supplied) and do not purport to cover statements <em>not </em>in its possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Because my brothers appear to give some consideration to the circumstances involved, notwithstanding the rigid rule announced, I consider it important to review some of their observations before discussing my view of the law. I do this because I feel that, there being no compelling rule to follow, it was within the discretion of the District Judge to determine how best to accord defense counsel full use of the circumstances disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">1) The majority opinion says, \u201cIt seems to us that the District Judge was in doubt as to whether the destruction of the statements was in <em>good or bad faith </em>* * (Emphasis supplied.) Notwithstanding his early irritation over the destruction of the statements, after full investigation of the circumstances he concluded, \u201cI do not think that the court, under these circumstances, should find, per se, <em>bad faith </em>on the part of the Government or the Federal Bureau of Investigation, such per se <em>bad faith </em>as would authorize this Court to strike the testimony of these witnesses from this case.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">2) The majority state that the transcript made by the stenographer from her shorthand notes \u201chad been reworked into Interview Reports- \u2014 but at least as to the Flonnoy statement, <em>with substantial variances.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) I do not get such impression. The agent involved, one O\u2019Hara, testified that at the beginning of his interview he had in mind taking a signed statement from the witness Flonnoy. To that end he had dictated an appropriate preamble reading, \u201cI, Betty Flonnoy, voluntarily furnish the following information,\u201d etc. In the course of the interview, however, he decided that a signed statement would be impracticable. During the interview, sometimes the witness\u2019 remarks were taken down in the first person and sometimes the agent would correct her grammar and, according to the agent, he dictated part of the information, stating that the stenographer\u2019s notes were \u201ca combination\u201d of a verbatim account from the witness and the agent\u2019s own dictation. Regardless of how much of the transcript was in Flon-noy\u2019s own words, fair reading of the testimony leads me to conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>agent testified correctly when he said that the only changes made by him in putting the stenographer\u2019s transcript into the FBI\u2019s regular report Forms No. FD 302 were the deletion of the quoted preamble and putting all of the witness\u2019 statement into the third person.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">3) The witnesses Flonnoy and Gaye both testified that Exhibits A and B, being respectively the Form 302 reports of their interview statements, correctly reflected what they had told the agent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is no suggestion that the Gaye Report 302, Exhibit B, was other than a meticulously correct account of his statement to the FBI. However, the majority opinion finds the following discrepancy between the Form 302 and what the witness Flonnoy told the agent in the interview \u201cThe fact that reference to Cleveland police officers\u2019 <em>participation in the events of February 8 </em>was deleted from the Flonnoy 302 Report is sufficient evidence that it was not a substitute for the \u2018statement\u2019 which was destroyed.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) It is understandable that the extensive and confusing examination of the stenographer, the FBI Agent and the witness Flonnoy could lead to such impression. Careful analysis of the testimony and exhibits persuades me, however, that there was no such deletion. Upon her trial testimony the witness Flonnoy said that upon entering the Gaye home, Gaye had said to an elderly gentleman there, \u201cThese men are from the FBI. They are looking for Joe.\u201d Upon cross-examination she was asked whether she had told the FBI agent that Gaye\u2019s entrance remark was, \u201cThese are either Cleveland Police or FBI.\u201d She denied making such statement and insisted there was no reference made to the Cleveland police in Gaye\u2019s remarks or that she had told the FBI agent so. This put her partly in conflict with the Form 302, Exhibit A, which did report her saying \u201cShe heard Gay [sic] tell Mr. FORBES * * * that these men were either police officers or FBI agents * * Except as discussed below, there is no evidence that in her interview she made any other reference to police officers, from Cleveland or elsewhere. Defense counsel had available to them for impeachment the witness Flonnoy\u2019s above reference to police in the FBI Form 302 report, as against her trial denial that she had ever mentioned police officers. It may be that my brothers\u2019 conclusion comes from the following part of the examination of the agent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">\u201cQ. Isn\u2019t it a fact that in Mrs. Flonnoy\u2019s discussion in this matter with you on March 15th at the FBI office she made some reference to the <em>Cleveland </em>Police Department?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-10\">\u201cA. She did. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-11\">\u201cQ. Did you delete anything concerning the Cleveland Police Department?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-12\">\u201cA. I did not.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">Again, careful analysis discloses that Report 302 does contain a reference by Flonnoy to the <em>Cleveland Police Department </em>but in a different context than Gaye\u2019s remark on entering the home. It should be noted that the above question put to the agent was not whether Flonnoy had made a reference \u201cto Cleveland police officers\u2019 <em>participation in the events of February 8th,\u201d </em>(the omission found by the majority) but only whether she had made some reference to the Cleveland Police Department. (Emphasis supplied.) That she had done so is correctly reported in the Form 302.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In answer to another question as to whether Mrs. Flonnoy had mentioned Cleveland police officers \u201cbeing involved\u201d the agent said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>that she had not. There was testimony from the FBI agent that it was during the interviews, first of Gaye and then Flonnoy, \u201cthat it became a matter of concern to me that another law enforcement agency, the Cleveland Police Department, was involved in this incident.\u201d He had talked first to Gaye, who not only made reference to police involvement but identified by name two members of the Cleveland police.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The closest support for the claim that the FBI agent deleted something from the stenographer\u2019s transcript comes from testimony by the FBI stenographer, Ruth Lahetta, who, after having said that the 302 forms contained all that had been said in the interviews, under questioning by the District Judge, said, referring to Exhibit A,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">\u201cA. I thought I remembered something else that was in there, sir, so I can\u2019t say that it is complete.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">\u201cQ. So we understand you now, relying on your recollection, there were matters in the statement of Mrs. Flonnoy on March 15th, that are not contained in the Court\u2019s Exhibit A?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">* * -X- -X- X- -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">\u201cA. They also implicated some police officers, and it is not in here, in Mrs. Flonnoy, and I don\u2019t know about Gaye.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">\u201cQ. In other words, Court\u2019s Exhibit A is not a complete account, does not contain all of the subject matter of the Flonnoy statement on March 15th?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-10\">\u201cA. No, sir.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-17\">It should be observed that the witness said, <em>\u201cth%y </em>[Flonnoy and Gaye] also implicated some police officers.\u201d It will be recalled that the Flonnoy statement, Exhibit, A, does refer to \u201cpolice officers\u201d in her account of Gaye\u2019s identification of Lonardo and party when they entered Gaye\u2019s home. It also shows that she told two of the Lonardo party she thought she had seen them at the Cleveland Police Department. The FBI Report 302 of Gaye\u2019s interview, Exhibit B, gave a full account of his recognition and later identification of two Cleveland detectives who appeared during a stop made near a bar on East 21st Street shortly after Flon-noy and Gaye were apprehended. The Flonnoy 302 Report, Exhibit A, also refers to the appearance of two men <em>at this same place, </em>although she apparently did not know they were detectives.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Gaye statement went on to give a detailed account of the seeming cooperation between the Lonardo party and the Cleveland police.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-18\">I think the District Judge was under a misapprehension when, in denying the defense motion to strike the Gaye and Flonnoy testimony, he remarked \u201c * * Flonnoy has clearly indicated that she mentioned the contact with the City Detectives, which is not in the statement that was produced.\u201d Actually, she did not so testify at the trial, and the FBI report does contain her interview statement that she observed the presence of two men whom Gaye identified as detectives. In all events, the District Judge was not impressed that what occurred called for striking the testimony of Flon-noy and Gaye.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>From my own study of the extended examination of the FBI agent, the FBI stenographer, the witnesses Flonnoy and Gaye, and careful examination of the FBI 302 forms, Exhibits A and B, I am satisfied that the agent\u2019s testimony as to the method of conducting the interview and his preparation of the reports is correct and that there were no substantial deletions from the stenographer\u2019s transcript of her notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">4) In relating the circumstances of the destruction of the transcription of the stenographer\u2019s notes (there were two copies of each transcription given to the agent) my brothers state that \u201ca week and a half before trial of the defendants Agent O\u2019Hara removed the copies of the stenographic transcripts from the file of the United States Attorney * * * \u201d and make reference to <em>\u201ctheir </em>deliberate destruction by an agent of the United States a week and a half before trial,\u201d and further that \u201cthe destruction was deliberate; <em>it was on the eve of trial; </em>it was accomplished by the government agent <em>in charge of preparing evidence for the prosecution of the case.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) Some further exploration of the circumstances seems appropriate. The testimony of the agent was that upon receipt of the two copies of the stenographer\u2019s transcript of her notes, he made changes on one copy, eliminating the preamble and putting the witnesses\u2019 statements into the third person, and delivered such copy to the FBI stenographic pool to be written up on their official Form 302. The other copy was delivered to the office of the United States Attorney. Upon receiving and checking the completed 302 forms, he immediately tore up and threw in the disposal basket the copy of the transcribed notes from which they were prepared. This was done not \u201con the eve of trial\u201d but about two months prior to trial. He testified that this was in keeping with regulations, and there is no evidence to the contrary. In my view, this was no different than what has been done by lawyers, investigators, and researchers of all kinds in preparing reports of their work. The other copy remained in the United States Attorney\u2019s office, along with the official reports of the agent\u2019s investigation, until about a week and a half or two weeks before trial. The agent being then at the United States Attorney\u2019s office noted that the remaining copy of the transcribed notes was in the file. He took it with him to his own office and tore it up as he had the other copy. There is no evidence that such action was surreptitious or motivated by any purpose of the United States Attorney or the agent to suppress any information. There is nothing in the described circumstances to suggest the \u201cmalicious and corrupt\u201d conduct which appellants now charge to the FBI. Asked by defense counsel why he then destroyed the paper, the agent said, \u201cBecause the 302 which I submitted in interviewing Gaye and Flonnoy was my official interview of those two individuals. The statement that I tore up was never read to these people or by these people at any time.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cAt the time this 302 was prepared by me it was substantially, in every way, the same information that was furnished to me by these people in that particular night, and which I dictated to the stenographer and which she transcribed.\u201d \u201cThe statement [stenographer\u2019s transcript] was not given completely in the first person. It was never read to them at the end of the interview, nor did they ever read it, and it was not adopted by them as their signed statement or unsigned statement.\u201d He answered a further question as to his reason for tearing up the transcript, which he called rough notes, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">\u201cA. Because to me it was not an official record. The only reason they were in existence they were rough drafts that I had a steno type up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>and send them to me. I sent the thing back down to the steno pool with corrections, and I said I wanted to change it to the FD 302. We had already decided not to make it a signed statement. The same thing applied to Mr. Gaye when I talked to him. The only reason those other two copies were in McCurdy\u2019s office was because he had nothing on the case at that time, and he understood when it was brought over at that time it was not a record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">All of this detailed discussion, it could properly be said, is much ado about very little.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Little indeed, in my view, to justify the majority\u2019s rigid rule which, regardless of the circumstances, would leave no discretion in the District Judge. As stated above, it is included so I may better expose my reasons for believing that the District Judge\u2019s discretion was properly exercised. His own investigation of the circumstances surrounding the interviews and the statements of the witnesses followed the procedure suggested in Campbell v. United States, 365 U.S. 85, 81 S.Ct. 421, 5 L.Ed.2d 428 (1961). After his own investigation of the circumstances of the destruction of the stenographer\u2019s transcripts, he allowed defense attorneys to examine the FBI agent on the subject in the presence of the jury. This they did at length. The judge explained the purpose of the examination to the jury, and in his instructions called the jury\u2019s attention to the provisions of the Jencks Act and continued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-8\">\u201cAt the time the inquiry into this subject matter was concluded, the Court explained the purpose of the inquiry. At this time I wish to qualify that explanation, and I now instruct you that the destruction by the special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the typewritten transcript of the statements made by the witnesses Gaye and Flonnoy permits you to draw the inference that the documents destroyed contained matters which were unfavorable to the Government in the prosecution of this case. I say to you that it permits you to draw this inference. It does not compel you to draw this inference. That is the reason I permitted you to hear the officer testify on this subject, and it is for you to determine whether or not you will draw such an inference or not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">My view that the handling of the situation was a matter for the District Judge\u2019s discretion finds support in decided cases. The importance of relying on the district judge to properly enforce the provisions of the Jencks Act by determining whether requested records are \u201cstatements\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3500(e) is emphasized by the opinions in Palermo v. United States, 360 U.S. 343, 79 S.Ct. 1217, 3 L.Ed.2d 1287 (1959). Mr. Justice Frankfurter there said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>\u201c[f]inal decision as to production must rest, as it does so very often in procedural and evidentiary matters, within the good sense and experience of the district judge guided by the standards we have outlined, and subject to the appropriately limited review of appellate courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ama1\">And concurring in the same case, Mr. Justice Brennan observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\">\u201cWe of this Court, removed as we are from the tournament of trials, must be careful to guard against promulgating general pronouncements which prevent the trial judges from exercising their traditional responsibility. The Court\u2019s opinion well observes that the hope for a fair administration of the statute rests in the final analysis with its responsible application in the federal trial courts. This responsibility of the federal trial judge, it goes without saying, is not to be delegated to the prosecutor.\u201d 360 U.S. 360-361, 79 S.Ct. 1228.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">I believe we must similarly place primary reliance on the district judge to assess the circumstances in which otherwise producible statements have been destroyed, and determine appropriate sanctions, if any. The refusal of the District Judge in the present case to find that the transcripts were destroyed in bad faith is a finding of fact which will not be disturbed, unless clearly erroneous. Cf. Campbell v. United States, 373 U.S. 487, 493, 83 S.Ct. 1356, 10 L.Ed.2d 501 (1963); Palermo v. United States, 360 U.S. 343, 353, 79 S.Ct. 1217, 3 L.Ed.2d 1287 (1959); Killian v. United States, 368 U.S. 231, 242, 82 S.Ct. 302, 7 L.Ed.2d 256 (1961); United States v. Gosser, 339 F.2d 102, 113 (C.A.6, 1964); Williams v. United States, 338 F.2d 286, 289 (C.A.D.C.1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">The rule announced by my brothers that they \u201csee no need to characterize the destruction of these statements as in good faith or bad \u2014 -as honest or corrupt\u201d and that upon failure to produce them the striking of the witnesses\u2019 testimony or a mistrial is called for is in conflict with statements in several decided cases. In Killian v. United States, 368 U.S. 231, 242, 82 S.Ct. 302, 308, the Supreme Court said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-11\">\u201cIf the agents\u2019 notes * * * were destroyed by the agents in <em>good faith </em>and in accord with their normal practice, it would be clear that their destruction did not constitute an impermissible destruction of evidence nQr deprive petitioner of any right. Those are the factual representations made by the Solicitor General. <em>Whether they are true can be determined only upon a hearing in the District Court.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-12\">\u201cIt is entirely clear that petitioner would not be entitled to a new trial because of the nonproduction of the agents\u2019 notes <em>if those notes were so destroyed and not in existence at the time of the trial.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-13\">In concurring in part in the result in Campbell v. United States, 365 U.S. 85, 102, 81 S.Ct. 421, 430 (1961), Justice Frankfurter said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-14\">\u201cNothing in the legislative history of the Act remotely suggests that Congress\u2019 intent was to require the Government, with penalizing consequences,\u2019 to preserve all records and notes taken during the countless interviews that are connected with criminal investigation by the various branches of the Government..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-15\">* -X * -X * -X</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-16\">\u201cPetitioners\u2019 contention that the words <em>\u2018in the possession of </em>must be interpreted as meaning <em>\u2018possession at any prior or present time\u2019 </em>must be rejected. Congress surely did not intend to initiate a game of chance whereby the admission of a witness\u2019 testimony is made to depend upon a file clerk\u2019s accuracy or care. Senator O\u2019Mahoney, the sponsor of the bill, in illustrating that his measure approved the essential basis of the Jencks case, interpreted Jencks to apply only where the Government \u2018had at the same time in its files a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>statement\u2019 pertinent to a witness\u2019 testimony.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8nz\">Justice Frankfurter\u2019s observations, concurred in by three other Justices, were not at odds with anything said in the majority opinion. See 365 U.S. 98, 81 S.Ct. 428. Having in mind that the sanctions to be imposed under \u00a7 3500 (d) arise where the government elects not to produce statements \u201cin the possession of the United States,\u201d \u00a7 3500(b), the Second Circuit in United States v. Greco, 298 F.2d 247, 250 (C.A.2, 1962), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 820, 82 S.Ct. 831, 7 L.Ed.2d 785 (1962), said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\">\u201cCongress, in using the words \u2018possession\u2019 and \u2018elects not to comply, clearly was not addressing itself to <em>non-existent notes. </em>Nor is there any legislative requirement that all notes be preserved after transcriptions have been made and checked for accuracy.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">See also United States v. Thomas, 282 F.2d 191, 193-195 (C.A.2, 1960) and N. Sims Organ &amp; Co. v. S. E. C., 293 F.2d 78, 81 (C.A.2, 1961), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 968, 82 S.Ct. 440, 7 L.Ed.2d 396 (1962); United States v.

My brothers cite no authorities for their position, but mention a footnote to the second Campbell opinion, 373 U.S. 491, n. 5, 83 S.Ct. 1356 where it is perhaps implied that the Supreme Court had not yet reached the question whether good faith destruction of notes makes inappropriate the imposition of \u00a7 3500(d) sanctions. The First Circuit had so held in denying rehearing of Campbell, Campbell v. United States, 303 F.2d 747, 751 (C.A.1, 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">I think it appropriate to conclude by emphasizing that the Jencks Act here relied upon was not passed to provide persons accused of crime with a new opportunity to assert a technical error in the procedures of law enforcement as a complete bar to conviction. The Jencks Act was Congress\u2019 hurried effort to limit the wide exposure of Government files that could be the consequence of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657, 77 S.Ct. 1007, 1 L.Ed.2d 1103 (1957). Notwithstanding the excitement which followed the Jencks decision, it did not announce any revolutionary change in criminal practice, but confirmed a practice which had always considered that it was fair play to allow an accused access to earlier statements made by prosecution witnesses for use as impeachment on cross-examination. Experienced advocates have always been aware of the value of access to pretrial statements of a witness whom they seek to impeach. Various means have been employed by skillful lawyers in both civil and criminal cases to serve this end. And many feel that no greater aid to discrediting a witness\u2019 testimony can be found than evidence that a statement or transcript thereof, made at a time when the witness\u2019 recollection would likely be more reliable, had been destroyed by the witness or by someone offering his testimony at trial. Research, however, discloses no case before or since the Jencks decision holding that such destruction calls for striking the witness\u2019 testimony. Certainly Jencks did not so hold. In Jencks the Court merely held that statements previously made by government witnesses to the FBI and <em>then in the government\u2019s possession </em>had to be produced for inspection by defense counsel without requiring that counsel show in advance that such statements were, or might be, inconsistent with the court testimony of such witness. There were other aspects to the decision not necessary to discuss here. The government resisted production of the statements without a preliminary showing of inconsistency, fearing that the broad rule requested would require it to expose important confidential results of its agencies\u2019 investigations. The Court held,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">\u201cthat the criminal action must be dismissed when the Government, on the ground of privilege, elects not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>comply with an order to produce, for the accused\u2019s inspection and for admission in evidence, relevant statements or reports <em>in its possession </em>of of government witnesses. * * * \u201d 353 U.S. 672, 77 S.Ct. 1015, 1 L.Ed.2d 1114. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Congress, concerned with the possible impairment of the national security by broad exposure of confidential information under Jencks, moved rapidly to provide safeguards by adoption of the so-called Jencks Act. It is quite clear that this Act was <em>restrictive </em>and did not by its words or Congressional intent provide new procedural devices to escape from criminal convictions. This, in my view, is so unless it is now proper for us to read into it something that is not there. In the context of this decision its language is clear and limits the imposition of its sanctions to cases where the government elects not to produce statements <em>\u201cin the possession of </em>the United States,\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3500(b). (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">In the case at bar, the District Judge found as a fact, and I assume as a matter of law, that both the destroyed transcripts of notes and all of the 302 Forms were Jencks Act statements. He required that the government deliver to defense counsel all of its 302 Forms, including those made from pencil notes taken by FBI agents throughout their investigation. Whatever inconsistency there was between Flonnoy\u2019s interview statements and her court testimony was clearly brought out. In addition, the District Judge allowed counsel to fully explore by cross-examination the circumstances of the destruction by a government agent of material that might otherwise be available to defense counsel and thereby to enjoy whatever implications arose therefrom. The District Judge added to that his instruction that from what occurred the jury could infer that the missing statements \u201ccontained matters [which were] unfavorable to the government.\u201d The testimony of the stenographer who took the notes, the testimony of the FBI agent, and the testimony of the witnesses Flonnoy and Gaye that the 302 Forms accurately reflected what was said forbids me, as it did the Second Circuit in a like situation described in United States v. Greco, supra, from assuming that in the destroyed papers \u201cthere must have been a veritable gold mine of cross-examination material,\u201d 298 F.2d 249. I believe that the District Judge\u2019s conduct was judicially discreet and that defense counsel really got more \u201cmileage\u201d out of the events discussed than would have been afforded had the destroyed transcripts been preserved and produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">The majority suggests that the testimony of Gaye may escape Jencks Act interdiction if upon remand it is found that the 302 report on him contains \u201c \u2018the very same information\u2019 to which they [defendants] were entitled.\u201d I am not sure that I understand just what is meant by \u201cthe very same information,\u201d but I be-, lieve that whatever it means it provides no basis for distinguishing between the testimony of Gaye and Flonnoy. If \u201cthe very same information\u201d means material having the very same impeaching utility, only carbon, photographic, or other exact copies of the destroyed material would qualify and Gaye\u2019s testimony too should be stricken. But if \u201cthe very same information\u201d is intended to include situations where the contents of the destroyed notes may be established by the living testimony of witnesses, it has been shown here that the 302 reports actually produced contained \u201cthe very same information\u201d as both sets of destroyed notes. The FBI agent, the FBI stenographer, and Gaye himself so testified as to Gaye\u2019s report, and except for one claim of niggling discrepancy, the FBI 302 report on Flonnoy was, by agent O\u2019Hara, Flonnoy, and the FBI Stenographer Lahetta, also verified as containing \u201cthe very same information\u201d as the stenographer\u2019s notes. I have reviewed above the one statement by Lahetta that \u201cthey [referring to Flon-noy and Gaye] also implicated some police officers, and it is not in here, in Mrs. Flonnoy, and I don\u2019t know about Gaye.\u201d This statement was made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Lahetta after she had already testified that Exhibit A (the 302 report on Flon-noy) corresponded accurately with her \u201ctranscribed notes.\u201d From all of this and notwithstanding his hereinabove referred to misapprehension that Flonnoy \u201chas clearly indicated that she mentioned the contact with the City Detectives,\u201d the District Judge refused to strike the testimony of Gaye and Flon-noy.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">I fail to discern the difference between the Gaye and the Flonnoy situations in this regard, and if the destruction of the stenographic notes calls for imposing the Jencks sanctions as to Flonnoy, the blow should also fall on Gaye\u2019s testimony. Thus would the government be foreclosed from going ahead with any prosecution. It is clear to me that there was just as much proof that the Flonnoy 302 report contained the \u201cvery same information\u201d as was in the destroyed notes as there was in relation to Gaye\u2019s report, and in all events there was sufficient proof to permit the District Judge to exercise his discretion as he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Since preparation of the original drafts of the majority opinion in the case at bar and this opinion, our Court has announced its opinion in the case of United States v. Hoffa et al., 349 F.2d 20 (C.A.6, 1965). FBI agents there took notes in both longhand and shorthand of interviews with two witnesses and subsequently destroyed the notes after incorporating their substance in formal statements and reports. The District Judge ruled that such destruction did not call for imposition of the Jencks Act sanctions and this Court affirmed. My brothers find their opinion here not inconsistent with <em>Hoffa </em>because of their view that in <em>Hoffa </em>this Court affirmed on the basis of a ruling by the District Judge that the destroyed notes \u201cwere not in the circumstances there involved Jencks Act statements.\u201d While it might be inferred that the District Judge and this Court were of the view that the destroyed notes in <em>Hoffa </em>were not Jencks Act statements, I do not read either opinion as a clear cut ruling to that effect. Certainly other considerations entered into the refusal to strike the testimony of the involved witnesses. The District Judge ruled that the Jencks Act sanctions need not be employed because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">\u201cIn each instance where a government agent testified to having disposed of his original notes of an interview, the testimony was undisputed that the original notes had been fully and accurately incorporated into the typewritten interview report prepared from the notes before the notes were disposed of.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">In affirming, this Court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqJ\">\u201cThe defense had available for impeachment purposes the signed typed statements of both witnesses, and the F.B.I. reports. The typed statements and reports embodied <em>the substance of the interview notes. </em>The agent was not required to preserve his longhand or shorthand notes or other memoranda from which he prepared the witnesses\u2019 typewritten statements. There is nothing to suggest bad faith in what the agent did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Earlier in this opinion I have set out the analysis of the testimony which led me to conclude that the FBI 302 reports on Flonnoy and Gaye clearly contained \u201cthe substance of the interview notes\u201d and that any possible discrepancies were trifling and insubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">Whether or not <em>Hoffa </em>is inconsistent with the majority opinion here, it is not inconsistent with and I cite it to support this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b581-6\">. Mrs. Flonnoy testified that she had seen the stenographer\u2019s transcript, and that \u201cthe information on Court\u2019s Exhibit A is the same as what is on this other statement, and I can tell because I know there are certain points I checked as I go along.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b581-14\">. The 302 Report of Flonnoy\u2019s interview contains the following: \u201cWhile they were at Gaye\u2019s house, Flonnoy mentioned to Pete and the other individual that she thought that she had seen them at the <em>Cleveland Police Department </em>and they told her they doubted it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b582-11\">. Miss Lahetta had earlier concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-12\">\u201cQ. That what is contained in Exhibit A [Form 302 re Flonnoy] is what Mrs. Flonnoy said on March 15th?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-13\">\u201cA. Yes, sir. * * * It seems to be the full and complete statement that she gave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-14\">\u201cQ. # * * I am concerned with whether Exhibit A corresponds accurately with your transcribed notes that you turned over to the officers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-16\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b582-20\">. \u201cFlonnoy stated that they drove from behind the County Jail up East 21st Street and stopped near a bar on the east side of the street north of Superior Avenue. She stated that the \u2018chief\u2019 [Lonardo] got out of the car and she observed two more men appear from somewhere and they talked to the \u2018chief\u2019.\u201d (Exhibit A.) Lonardo was addressed by his companions as \u201cchief\u201d during the simulated FBI capture and restraint of Gaye and Flonnoy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b583-8\">. The witness Flonnoy was of the opinion that while at the District Attorney\u2019s office she did look over the copy of the stenographer\u2019s transcript. That could be because such copy remained in the District Attorney\u2019s files for about two months,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b584-5\">. This case, in my view, does not present a factual basis out of which to fashion the drastic rule announced by my brothers. The alleged discrepancy in the FBI 302 report on the Flonnoy interview has to do with the apparent condonation and possible cooperation by Cleveland police officers in the colorful capture and inquisition of Flonnoy and Gaye. The FBI 302 report of the Gaye interview sets out at length his account of the activities of the Cleveland police in the day\u2019s events. In its 302 report on the Flonnoy interview the FBI recorded that she had referred to \u201cpolice officers,\u201d to the \u201cCleveland Police Department,\u201d and told of the arrival on the scene of \u201ctwo more men\u201d at the same time and place at which Gaye said that two identified Cleveland detectives appeared. At trial, Flonnoy repeatedly denied that Gaye had told one Forbes that defendants \u201care either Cleveland Police or FBI,\u201d and testified that \u201cAt no time was I under the impression, nor Mr. Gaye, that these men were from the Cleveland Police Department.\u201d The FBI 302 report provided ready impeachment of her on the point of what Gaye had told Forbes. <em>This discrepancy was not between what she told the FBI and their report of it, but between the FBI report and Flonnoy\u2019s trial testimony. </em>Whatever support the police activities gave to the defense was readily accorded by the FBI 302 reports on Gaye and Flonnoy and provided material for impeachment of Flonnoy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
