We have, thus, no concern with the Full Faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>and Credit Clause of the Constitution, nor is it claimed that any international engagement of the United States compels recognition of the foreign law. On the record before us, however, we do not find that the District Court erred in according such recognition; and we affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Vincent Tramontana was killed on February 26, 1960, when the United States Navy airplane in which he was traveling on naval orders collided over Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with an airplane owned and operated by a Brazilian airline.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time of his death, Tramontant was a member of the United States Navy Band, which was on an official tour of Latin America. The record does not show his permanent duty station, but he resided with his wife, appellant here, in Hyattsville, Maryland. The Navy plane in which he was travelling when he was killed was en route from Buenos Aires in Argentina to Galeao, Brazil. Appellee Varig Airlines is a Brazilian corporation having its principal place of business in Brazil but carrying on its transportation activities in many parts of the world, including the United States. The Brazilian plane was on a regularly scheduled commercial flight from Campos, Brazil, to Rio de Janeiro when the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Almost two years after her husband\u2019s death, appellant instituted this action in the District Court against Varig and its predecessor, alleging that negligence in the operation of the Brazilian plane had caused her husband\u2019s death. She explicitly based her claim for recovery on certain provisions of the Brazilian Code of the Air which provide a cause of action for injury or death resulting from negligent operation of aircraft in Brazil. She claimed damages of $250,-000. Service was made on Varig Airlines, which concededly is subject to suit in the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Varig filed an answer to appellant\u2019s amended complaint and the same day moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint or, in the alternative, for summary judgment in respect of so much of appellant\u2019s claim as exceeded the U. S. dollar equivalent of 100,000 Brazilian cruzeiros. Varig relied on Article 102 of the Brazilian Code, which limits liability for injury or death in aviation accidents to that amount. The District Court, with Varig\u2019s consent, entered judgment in favor of appellant in the amount of $170.00, the current dollar value of 100,000 cruzeiros. It awarded judgment in favor of Varig \u201cfor all of the plaintiff\u2019s claim which exceeds the sum of One Hundred Seventy Dollars ($170.00).\u201d From this latter judgment Mrs. Tramontana appealed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The only question now before us is whether Brazil\u2019s limitation on the damages recoverable for death sustained in airplane accidents occurring there is to be applied in this suit in the District of Columbia. Appellant appears to concede that her cause of action, if any, was created by, and arises under, a provision of Brazilian law enacted coincidentally and in conjunction with the damage limitation. She argues, however, that the forum law regarding damages for wrongful death occurring in the District of Columbia, <em>i. e., </em>unlimited recovery, should govern that aspect of her claim. Initially, she accepts the applicability of the traditional conflict of laws rule in personal injury cases that the <em>lex locus delicti, </em>the law of the place where the injury occurred, generally governs in a suit brought elsewhere, but she asserts that a court sitting in the District of Columbia should adopt the familiar exception to the effect that the forum will</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">refuse to apply the otherwise applicable foreign law if it is contrary to some strong public policy of the forum. Appellant asserts the existence of a strong policy of the District of Columbia in favor of unlimited recovery for wrongful death, which she claims is evidenced by Congress\u2019 repeal in 1948 of the $10,-000 maximum until then contained in the local wrongful death statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She points also the fact that only thirteen states still limit recovery for wrongful death, and that none imposes a ceiling as low as that contained in the Brazilian Air Code. She cites the Warsaw Convention, which governs generally accidents involving international air carriers and which now permits recovery up to $8,292, as constituting in essence an international standard of fairness in such matters.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And, finally, she relies on the New York Court of Appeals decision in Kilberg v. Northeast Airlines, Inc., 9 N.Y.2d 34, 211 N.Y.S.2d 133, 172 N.E.2d 526 (1961), as a persuasive prece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>dent for the position she urges us to adopt. Another contention, which we treat separately hereinafter, is that the Brazilian limitation should be disregarded because of the striking decline which has taken place in the value of the cru-zeiro in terms of the dollar.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">Appellant\u2019s essential effort throughout is to urge us to follow the \u201cnewer and more realistic judicial approach\u201d to conflict of laws problems exemplified by <em>Kil-berg </em>and Babcock v. Jackson, 12 N.Y.2d 473, 240 N.Y.S.2d 743, 191 N.E.2d 279, 95 A.L.R.2d 1 (1963), and more recent decisions of the Supreme Court, and to reject the assertedly outmoded and discredited teaching of Slater v. Mexican Nat\u2019l R. R., 194 U.S. 120, 24 S.Ct. 581, 48 L.Ed. 900 (1904), and kindred decisions. Under the test we are asked to employ, the choice of law to be applied to each legal issue presented is to be made in light of the jurisdiction which has the strongest interest in the resolution of that issue.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief, p. 10. \u201cEmphasis is [to be] placed * * * upon the law of the place which has the most significant contacts with the matter in dispute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26. A cornerstone of this newer thinking, appellant contends, is the forum\u2019s reluctance to subordinate its policies to those of another state when its own interest in the case is real and substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The Supreme Court, in its decisions in Richards v. United States, 369 U.S. 1, 82 S.Ct. 585, 7 L.Ed.2d 492 (1962), and many earlier cases,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> has recognized the inadequacies of the theoretical underpinnings of <em>Slater </em>and its progeny. The latter cases have a highly attenuated precedential weight, both in authority and reason.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus we are free to explore the question presented by this appeal in the light of the newer concepts of conflict of laws. Our conclusion that the District Court properly applied the Brazilian limitation rests upon an examination of the respective relationships of Brazil and the District of Columbia with the accident, and with the parties here involved; and a consideration of their respective interests in the resolution of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The interest underlying the application of Brazilian law seems to us to outweigh any interest of the District of Columbia. Not only is Brazil the scene of the fatal collision, but Yarig is a Brazilian corporation which, as a national airline, is an object of concern in terms of national policy. To Brazil, the success of this enterprise is a matter not only of pride and commercial well-being, but perhaps even of national security. The limitation on recovery against airlines operating in Brazil was enacted in the early days of commercial aviation,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> no doubt with a view toward protecting what was then, and still is, an infant industry of extraordinary public and national importance. The Brazilian limitation in terms applies only to airplane accidents, unlike the Massachusetts provision rejected in <em>Kilberg, </em>which was an across-the-board ceiling on recovery for wrongful death in that state. The focus of Brazilian concern could hardly be clearer.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>We have seen nothing that would suggest that Brazil\u2019s concern for the financial integrity of her local airlines should be deemed to be less genuine now than when Article 102 was enacted, simply because of the depreciation of the cruzeiro. The failure to amend that provision may reflect a conscious desire to avoid enlarging the potential liability of local airlines during a period of general economic difficulty. It may represent an unwillingness to contribute to the inflationary spiral by adjusting \u201cprices\u201d fixed by statute, which the government can control. Or it may be attributable in part to both motives. In any event, we are not persuaded that the fact of inflation itself\u2014 with the result that 100,000 cruzeiros are worth now considerably less than when the limitation was enacted \u2014 should be deemed to render obsolete Brazil\u2019s legitimate interest in limiting recoveries against her airlines.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Appellant relies primarily on the New York Court of Appeals decision in Kil-berg v. Northeast Airlines, Inc., <em>supra, </em>as a precedent for the course she asks us to follow. A close analysis of that court\u2019s reasoning reveals that the relationships and interests, which it thought compelled the result reached, do not parallel those here. The decedent in <em>Kilberg </em>was both a resident and a domiciliary of New York. He was a paying passenger on the defendant airline, which relationship had originated in New York. As the Court of Appeals pointed out, once on board the plane the place of the injury was merely \u201cfortuitous.\u201d New York\u2019s long-standing policy in favor of unlimited recovery in actions for wrongful death coalesced in this case with its real and immediate interest in providing full compensation for the death of one of its own citizens. And its interest would have been the same whether the defendant\u2019s aircraft had crashed in New York, in Long Island Sound, or, as it did, in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">In the case before us neither appellant, her children, nor her husband were or are resident or domiciled in the District of Columbia. Vincent Tramontana was not a passenger on appellee\u2019s plane, and his \u201crelationship\u201d with appellee commenced and ended in Brazil in one shattering moment. The -place of injury, under these circumstances, was clearly not fortuitous, although the accident was something of a freak. Vincent Tramon-tana could not have been killed by Varig's Campos-to-Rio flight except in Brazil. To suggest that he might have been killed here in the District, or in Maryland, by one of Varig's international flights is to ignore the facts of this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is one thing to say that airlines should not be the beneficiaries, nor their passengers the victims, of the vagaries of weather and faulty equipment that cause an aircraft to crash in one jurisdiction rather than another. It is quite another to say that an American traveler, who is injured in Brazil through the negligence of the operator of a local airline on which he was not a passenger and with which he had no previous connection, is entitled to the benefit of the law of a forum which is not his home, because its successor happens to do business there.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>The District of Columbia\u2019s connection with the occurrence and with the parties, and its interest in the resolution of the issue before us, are, if not wholly remote, certainly less than Brazil\u2019s. Neither appellant nor her decedent are or were residents of the District of Columbia. Varig Airlines is subject to suit here only because of the international operations in which it is engaged. Whatever negligence it may have been guilty of assuredly did not occur here, nor, manifestly, did the decedent\u2019s death. If appellant and her children should ever become public charges, the burden will rest not on the District of Columbia but on the citizens of Maryland, where appellant resides.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Although Maryland, the state of the decedent\u2019s and appellant\u2019s residence, might be thought to have a substantial interest in the amount recoverable for his death, no suggestion has been made that we should apply the law of Maryland to determine the issue before us.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But this possibility inevitably suggests itself, and we therefore are inclined to say why we think that, even as between the law \u2022 of Maryland and the law of Brazil, we are without warrant to look to the former. In striking this balance, the weight to be accorded the interests of Brazil remains unchanged. The question is whether Maryland has a significantly greater claim to the application of its law than' the District of Columbia. Maryland\u2019s only relationship with the parties or the transaction is that it is appellant\u2019s residence, and was that of the decedent, but its interest in the matter of appellant\u2019s recovery is not insignificant, for it is on the citizens of Maryland that the burden of her support, if she is unable to support herself, is likely to fall in the first instance<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Yet it appears likely that a Maryland court would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>have ignored the Brazilian limitation on recovery if this action had been brought there originally.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Section 2 of Maryland\u2019s wrongful death statute provides that, in suits based \u25a0on acts committed outside the state,</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">the courts of this State shall apply the- law of such other state, District of Columbia or territory of the United States, to the facts of the particular case, <em>as though such foreign law were the law of this State, </em>provided, however, that the rules of pleading and procedure effective in the court of this State in which the action is pending govern and be so applied as to give effect to the rights and obligations created by and existing under the laws of the foreign jurisdiction in which the wrongful act, neglect or default occurred * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Md.Ann.Code, art. 67, \u00a7 2 (1957). (Emphasis added.) This provision was enacted in 1937 specifically to overrule several Maryland cases refusing to entertain suits for wrongful death based on foreign wrongful death acts that were \u201cdissimilar\u201d to the Maryland statute.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Maryland courts previously appeared to accept the traditional <em>lex locus delicti </em>rule in personal injury cases. The new section, far from changing this allegiance, invested it with statutory authority.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It opened the Maryland courts to suits based on a foreign law, regardless of its content, and instructed the courts to give effect to each and every substantive element of that law. The result was to expose Maryland residents to suit at home for acts committed outside the state, with the survivors of Maryland residents killed away from home dependent upon foreign law for any rights of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">The Maryland Court of Appeals has held that, where both accident and death occurred in another state, the defendant\u2019s liability \u2014 and thus the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover \u2014 depends\u2019 on the law of that state.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It has not had an opportunity to consider whether the amount of damages recoverable is an element of that right, but it is speculative in the extreme for us to infer that it would hold it to be otherwise. The amount of damages recoverable for a tort is, in traditional theory, a matter of substantive law. The New York Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Appeals, shortly after <em>Kilberg, </em>abandoned its position in that case that the measure of damages was governed by New York, and not Massachusetts, law because damage limitations are procedural in nature, and not substantive.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The broad language of the Maryland statute, enjoining the courts to give effect to \u201cthe rights and obligations created by and existing under the laws of the foreign jursidiction,\u201d suggests strongly that Maryland would enforce a foreign limitation on the damages recoverable for wrongful death. Though Section 2 is in terms applicable only to suits based on the laws of another state, the District of Columbia, or a territory of the United States, there is no reason for us to suppose that the Maryland courts would refuse to follow the approach it represents when the cause of action arises under the law of a foreign country.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> And if a Maryland court would not disregard Brazilian law for the benefit of one of its own residents in a suit brought there, why should a court sitting in the District of Columbia do so at the expense of substantial and legitimate interests of Brazil?</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">Two recent cases support the decision we reach here, Truath v. Northeast Airlines, Inc., Civil No. 149-256, S.D.N.Y., grew out of the same accident as <em>Kilberg, </em>and it was initially consolidated for trial with Pearson v. Northeast Airlines, Inc., 199 F.Supp. 539 (S.D.N.Y.1961), aff\u2019d, 309 F.2d 553, 92 A.L.R.2d 1162 (2d Cir. 1962) (en banc), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 912, 83 S.Ct. 726, 9 L.Ed.2d 720 (1963). Both the deceased passenger and his surviving dependents were residents of New Jersey. After the trial judge ruled in <em>Pearson </em>that he was bound to follow the New York rule enunciated in <em>Kilberg, </em>the plaintiff in <em>Truath </em>moved to amend her complaint to allege damages in excess of the Massachusetts limitation. Her motion was denied on the ground that there was no indication that New Jersey would have followed any law except that of the place of the injury. Although this ruling was never appealed because Mrs. Truath\u2019s claim was settled prior to trial, it seems to us to represent a correct understanding of the policies that were thought to control in <em>Kilberg. </em>New York, whose conflict of laws rule the District Court was obliged to follow,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> had no interest in enforcing its protective policy where both the deceased and his dependents were non-residents, especially when the state of their residence would not have asserted its own interest if the suit had been brought there. The proper law to apply was that of Massachusetts, \u201cthe only state having an interest in the matter.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">In Gore v. Northeast Airlines, Inc., 222 F.Supp. 50 (S.D.N.Y.1963), which also arose out of the Nantucket crash, the same District Judge who had presided in <em>Pearson </em>and <em>Truath </em>denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion to strike Northeast\u2019s affirmative defense based on the Massachusetts damage limitation. The plaintiff, suing as executor of the deceased who had himself been a New York domiciliary, was a citizen of Maryland and a resident of the District of Columbia. The deceased, like Kilberg and Pearson had purchased his ticket in New York. But his beneficiaries all lived outside New York. His widow and two minor children had taken up residence in Maryland a month after his death. Two adult children, from a prior marriage, at all times <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>relevant resided in California. The District Judge concluded, correctly we think, that New York\u2019s protective policy which had been held to govern in <em>Kilberg </em>was directed at \u201cthe deceased\u2019s surviving dependents who are domiciled in New York.\u201d He noted that in both <em>Kilberg </em>and <em>Pearson </em>not only the accident victims but also their sole beneficiaries were New York domiciliaries, both at the time of the accident and at the time of the suit. He further concluded that either California or Maryland would have applied the Massachusetts limitation if the suit had been brought there. In short, in both <em>Truath </em>and <em>Gore </em>the court found that New York had no interest of its own substantial enough to justify rejection of the Massachusetts limitation when the deceased\u2019s beneficiaries resided elsewhere, and that a New York court would not ignore that limitation if the state of their residence would not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Our decision is consistent as well with the most recent formulation of the <em>Restatement (Second), Conflict of Laws.</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Section 379 sets forth the general rule in tort cases as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">(1) The local law of the state which has the most significant relationship with the occurrence and with the parties determines their rights and liabilities in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">(2) Important contacts that the forum will consider in determining the state of most significant relationship include:</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">(a) the place where the injury occurred,</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">(b) the place where the conduct occurred,</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">(c) the domicile, nationality, place of incorporation, and place of business of the parties, and</p>\n<p id=\"b524-14\">(d) the place where the relationship, if any, between the parties is centered.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-15\">(3) In determining the relative importance of the contacts, the forum will consider the issues, the character of the tort, and the relevant purposes of the tort rules of the interested states.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-16\">This enumeration of significant relationships does not include that of forum <em>qua </em>forum.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The injury in the case before us occurred in Brazil, as did appellee\u2019s negligent conduct, if it was negligent at all. Vincent Tramontana was an American national, domiciled in Maryland, and so are his widow and children. Var-ig is a Brazilian corporation, which does business throughout the world. The \u201crelationship\u201d between the parties, if it can be called that, existed fleetingly- \u2014 and in Brazil. By these criteria, the only state, other than Brazil, with a substantial claim to the application of its law is Maryland, which apparently would apply the Brazilian law in a case brought there. Thus it is that the only relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>ship of the District of Columbia to this claim is that it provides a forum with jurisdiction over the appellee. That is hardly a reason for the forum to prefer its own notions of policy to those embodied in the Brazilian law which created the claim appellant is asserting.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">A separate facet of appellant\u2019s public policy argument is that the Brazilian limitation on recovery for wrongful death should be disregarded entirely because of the recent marked decline in the dollar value of the Brazilian cruzeiro. Brazil\u2019s current economic problems are a matter of common knowledge, including the fact that inflation has depreciated the Brazilian currency by more than 600 per cent since the accident occurred in 1960. This development undoubtedly contributes to the appeal of appellant\u2019s argument, but it does not, in our view, warrant a result different from that we would reach had the value of the cruzeiro in terms of the dollar remained unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Brazil\u2019s interest in the protection of the financial integrity of its most important means of domestic transportation almost certainly has not been diminished by the decline in the value of its currency. Indeed, its concern may well have increased in proportion to the rate of domestic inflation. A reluctance to reflect that decline in those prices that are subject to direct government control would be wholly understandable. See text at page 472 supra. Moreover, an unpredictable and virtually immeasurable factor would be imported into the decision of international conflict of laws cases if the otherwise applicable law were subject to being displaced because of the recent history of the relative values of the currencies involved. Courts would be called upon in each case to determine at what point a declining rate of exchange of a foreign currency made application of the foreign law intolerable. Should Brazilian law be disregarded if the cruzeiro had depreciated only 300 per cent? Or 50 per cent? Victims of the same negligence might recover widely differing amounts, depending, not on where they lived \u2014 a not irrelevant factor, as we have suggested \u2014 but on <em>when </em>they sued.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">Considerations of comity among sovereign nations certainly have relevance in this context. International balance of payments problems have a way of assailing the weak and the strong alike, and it is not only the underdeveloped nations who feel the sometimes rapidly fluctuating effects upon their exchange rates of both domestic and international economic factors, over some of which at least they have little or no control. If the courts of one country make the applicability of the law of another turn on the way the exchange balance happens to be inclined at the moment, a speculative and highly artificial element would be intruded into those considerations normally recognized by civilized nations as germane in the choice of applicable law. And the forum so motivated, whether it knows it or not, wields a two-edged sword.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">One further question remains, though it is one not raised by the parties.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The District Court converted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>100,000 cruzeiro ceiling on recovery into dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing on October 14, 1963, the date of the entry of its judgment. Although New York, alone among jurisdictions in this country, and England appear to follow a rule that recovery in tort is to be measured in terms of the rate of exchange on the date of the wrong, we think the District Court applied the sounder rule. This \u201cday of judgment\u201d rule has the support of the authors of the <em>Restatement (Second), Conflict of Laws </em>\u00a7 612a, (Tent. Draft No. 11, 1965), and is in accord with the Supreme Court\u2019s most recent decision on the point, Die Deutsche Bank Filiale Nurnberg v. Humphrey, 272 U.S. 517, 47 S.Ct. 166, 71 L.Ed. 383 (1926). It has been endorsed by the majority of writers who have considered the problem.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> And it has been applied by both the Second Circuit and the United States District Court in Maryland in tort cases. Shaw, Savill, Albion &amp; Co. v. The Fredericksburg, 189 F.2d 952 (2d Cir. 1951); The Integritas, 3 F.Supp. 891 (D.Md. 1933). The rule provides the plaintiff with the dollar equivalent of the amount he would recover if he had sued in the country whose law determines his right to recover, and it thereby ensures that he neither suffers nor benefits from the fact that he chose another forum in which to litigate his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The judgment appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"APx\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-6\">.

Empresa De Viacao Aerea Rio Grandense, t/a Varig Airlines, Civil Action No. 637-62 in this Court, counsel having stipulated that the final ruling in said case will be controlling herein.\u201d Of the seventeen other plaintiffs in these two suits, two, and perhaps three, were listed as residents of the Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>trict of Columbia, eight as residents of Maryland, and the remainder as residents of other states. We, of course, decide only the case before us, which involves a non-resident appellant suing in respect of the death of a non-resident decedent.

Armiger et al. Estates v. United States, 339 F.2d 625 (Ct.C1.1964). This recommendation was founded on purely equitable grounds, and rested upon the circumstance that, prior to the fatal flight, there had been a failure to follow the usual practice of distributing application forms for private flight insurance. The possibility of suit against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act is precluded by that statute\u2019s express exclusion of claims \u201carising in a foreign country.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680 (k).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b518-8\">. 16 D.C.Code \u00a7 2701 was amended in 1948, 62 Stat. 487, eliminating the $10,-000 ceiling on damages recoverable for wrongful death.

The possible locations of Varig\u2019s wrongdoing, if such it was, are irrelevant to the determination of which law should measure appellant\u2019s recovery except insofar as they have some other connection, with the parties or the accident, or some independent interest in the resolution of this issue. If the mere possibility, however remote, that Vincent Tramontana might have been killed through some negligence of appellee in the District of Columbia were thought to give the District some interest in the application of its law, whatever predictability remains in the conflict of laws of torts would disappear. Concededly, predictability is a depreciated coin in tort law, see Babcock v. Jackson, 12 N.Y.2d 473, 478, 240 N.Y.S.2d 743, 746-747, 191 N.E.2d 279, 281 (1963), but it still retains some value. Varig\u2019s ability to predict and obtain the cost of insurance, for example, may depend to some extent on its ability to estimate its potential liability.

The presentation to us of this appeal by both parties was depressingly devoted almost entirely to a discussion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>merits of <em>Kilberg. </em>Actually, the resemblance of this case to <em>KiVberg </em>begins and ends with the circumstance that death in each case occurred while in flight. Decision of this case involves a great deal more than measuring one\u2019s respect for the memory of Professor Beale by means of one\u2019s attitude towards <em>Kilberg. </em>The case before us is much the same as if a resident of the State of Maryland, while on a summer vacation trip to Europe and while crossing the street in Amsterdam, were run over and killed by a beer truck making a local delivery. If Holland had a wrongful death act with a limitation onl damages, and if the brewing company had! a sales office in the District of Columbia,] then a suit in the District by the Mary-; land widow would present us with a prob-j lem virtually identical with that we now! have. The increasing international mobility of both ordinary citizens and business enterprises suggests that the issue, is an important one already and is likely \u00a1 to become more so. There are obvious implications to be considered in respect - of the degree of comity which should obtain between sovereign nations unrestrained by a full faith and credit clause in a world constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b521-6\">. The New York Court of Appeals\u2019 dominating concern in <em>Kilberg </em>was to ensure \u201cprotection for <em>our own State\u2019s people </em>against unfair and anchronistic treatment of the lawsuits which result from these [airline] disasters.\u201d 9 N.Y.2d at 39, 211 N.Y.S.2d at 135, 172 N.E. at 527-528. The immediate objects of that concern were, of course, the victims and their dependents. The implicit assumption, however, was that if protection were not provided them, the cost of their support might have to be borne by the state and citizens of New York. The District of Columbia may have an altruistic interest in seeing that the survivors of residents of nearby states do not go uncompensated, but it faces no additional burden if compensation is not provided.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b521-11\">. Neither in her brief nor at the oral argument did appellant urge us to consider any other alternative than the application of District of Columbia law. Her failure to rely, at least in the alternative, on the law of Maryland, the state of her residence, as well as that of her husband\u2019s may be at least in part attributable to the fact that at least some of the eighteen plaintiffs appear to reside in states which have damage limitations in their wrongful death acts. It is more likely due to counsel\u2019s awareness of what appears hereinafter with respect to the state of Maryland law in this area.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b521-12\">.
