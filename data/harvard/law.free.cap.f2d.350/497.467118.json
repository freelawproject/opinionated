He was sentenced to three and one-half years in the federal penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-16\">Defendant had been indicted on three counts of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503. Count One of the indictment charged that appellant in November 1963 \u201cdid request, counsel, and direct\u201d one Robert D. Vick to contact Ralph A. Elliott, who was and known to be a member of the petit jury panel from which jurors were to be drawn for a pending ease, \u201cand to offer and promise to pay the said Ralph A. Elliott $10,000 to induce the said Elliott to vote for an acquittal\u201d if Elliott were to be selected as a juror for that trial, this in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-17\">Count Two charged a similar offense in November 1962 in relation to the \u201cTest Fleet\u201d trial, the request being alleged to have been made to a lawyer named Beard to approach D. M. Harrison, the husband of a sitting juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-18\">Defendant was convicted on Count One and acquitted on Count Two. The third count had been dismissed before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-19\">At the time of the events in question, defendant was a prominent and successful lawyer who had handled a good deal of important litigation. Just before the happenings which led to this indictment, he had served (and was serving) as local counsel for defendant James R. Hoffa in United States v. James R. Hoffa <em>&amp; </em>Commercial Carriers, Inc. (Criminal No. 13,-241, United States District Court, Middle District of Tennessee, Nashville Division) (the so-called \u201cTest Fleet\u201d case) wherein his client had been the subject of mistrial resulting from a divided or \u201chung\u201d jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-20\">Subsequent to the conclusion of the \u201cTest Fleet\u201d case, evidence was presented to a federal grand jury which resulted in the indictment of Hoffa and a number of other defendants on charges of jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>tampering pertaining to alleged approaches to the \u201cTest Fleet\u201d case jury. United States v. Hoffa, et al., D.C., 235 F.Supp. 611 (United States District Court, Eastern District of Tennessee, Southern Division, at Chattanooga). See 349 F.2d 20 (C.A. 6, 1965)</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">This Hoffa jury tampering case was originally scheduled to be tried in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, Nashville, Tennessee, and it was expected that the jury panel for that District would be the panel from which the Hoffa, et al., jury tampering case would be chosen.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Prior to the transfer of the United States v. Hoffa, et al., trial on jury tampering to Chattanooga, Tennessee, the Federal Bureau of Investigation called to the attention of two of the United States District Judges for the Middle District of Tennessee (Judges Miller and Gray) that an informant, one Vick, had brought them charges to the effect that Hoffa\u2019s local counsel, defendant herein, was seeking to make contact through intermediaries with prospective members of the Hoffa, et al., jury. Vick was an officer of the Nashville Police Department whom defendant had employed during the \u201cTest Fleet\u201d trial to investigate jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The two District Judges, although openly skeptical of the information, authorized the informant to seek further conversation with defendant, carrying on his person a recording device by which they, the judges, would later be able to hear what transpired.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Vick twice talked with appellant with the recording device concealed on him, but it twice failed to operate. On the third occasion the recorder did operate and the tape thus produced resulted in such confirmation of Vick\u2019s information as to occasion appellant\u2019s disbarment in the federal courts and the indictment in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">At trial of the presently considered charges Vick testified and the recording of the last of his conversations with appellant was introduced in corroboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">Vick testified that his representations to appellant concerning conversations with and willingness to bribe prospective juror Elliott were false. At the time they were made, Vick, indicated he was reporting to FBI and Justice Department personnel. The jury also heard defendant\u2019s admission that the transcript of this recording was \u201csubstantially correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ACZ\">Since on this appeal defendant\u2019s primary appellate issue is a claim of legal entrapment, we feel it relevant to reproduce the record of this conversation in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-12\">\u201cGIRL: You can go in now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-13\">\u201cVICK: O.K. honey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-14\">\u201cHello, Mr. Osborn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-15\">\u201cOSBORN: Hello, Bob, close the door, my friend, and let\u2019s see what\u2019s up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-16\">\u201cVICK: How\u2019re you doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-17\">\u201cOSBORN: No good.

Why of course, there\u2019s al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>ways a chance, but I wouldn\u2019t get into it if I thought it was very, very great.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\">\u201cOSBORN: (Laughed.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">\u201cVICK: You understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">\u201cOSBORN: (Laughing) Yeah, I do know.

I\u2019m gonna take care of old Bob and I know, and of course I\u2019m depending on you to take care of old Bob if anything, if anything goes wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-9\">\u201cOSBORN: I am. I am. Why certainly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-10\">\u201cVICK: Er, we had coffee Saturday morning and now I had previously told you that it\u2019s the son.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-11\">\u201cOSBORN: It is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-12\">\u201cVICK: Yes, and not the father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-13\">\u201cOSBORN: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-14\">\u201cVICK: The son is Ralph Alden Elliott and the father is Ralph Don-nal.

Anway, we had coffee and he\u2019s been on a hung jury up here this week, see?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-15\">\u201cOSBORN: I know that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-16\">\u201cVICK: Well, I didn\u2019t know that but anyway, he brought that up so he got to talking about the last Hoffa case being hung, you known, and some guy refusing $10,000 to hang it, see, and he said the guy was crazy, he should\u2019ve took it, you know, and so we talked about and so just discreetly, you know, and course I\u2019m really playing this thing slow, that\u2019s the reason I asked you if you wanted a lawyer down there to handle it or you wanted me to handle it, cause I\u2019m gonna play it easy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-17\">\u201cOSBORN: The less people, the better.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-18\">\u201cVICK: That\u2019s right. Well, I\u2019m gonna play it slow and easy myself and er, anyway, we talked about er, something about five thousand now and five thousand later, see, so he did, he brought up five thousand see, and talking about about (sic) how they pay it off you know and things like that. I don\u2019t know whether he suspected why I was there or not cause I don\u2019t just drop out of the blue to visit him socially, you know. We\u2019re friends, close, and kin, cousins, but I don\u2019t ordinarily just, we don\u2019t fraternize, you know, and er, so he seemed very receptive for er, to hang the thing for five now and five later. Now, er I thought I would report back to you and see what you say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-20\">\u201cOSBORN: That\u2019s fine! The thing to do is set it up for a point later so you won\u2019t be running back and forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-22\">\u201cVICK: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-23\">\u201cOSBORN: Tell him it\u2019s a deal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-24\">\u201cVICK: It\u2019s what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-25\">\u201cOSBORN: That it\u2019s a deal. What we\u2019ll have to do when it gets down to the trial date, when we know the date, tomorrow for example if the Supreme Court rules against us, well, within a week we\u2019ll know when the trial comes. Then he has to be certain that when he gets on, he\u2019s got to know that he\u2019ll just be talking to you and nobody else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-27\">\u201cVICK: Social strictly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-28\">\u201cOSBORN: O yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-29\">\u201cVICK: I\u2019ve got my story all fixed on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-30\">\u201cOSBORN: Then he will have to know where to, he will have to know where to come.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-31\">\u201cVICK: Well, er * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-32\">\u201cOSBORN: And he\u2019ll have to know when.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-34\">\u201cVICK: Er, do you want to use him yourself? You want me to handle it or what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-35\">\u201cOSBORN: Uh huh. You\u2019re gonna handle it yourself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-36\">\u201cVICK: All right. You want to know it when he\u2019s ready, when I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>think he\u2019s ready for the five thousand. Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">\u201cOSBORN: Well no, when he gets on the panel, once he gets on the jury. Provided he gets on the panel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">\u201cVICK: Yeah. Oh yeah. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. Well now, he\u2019s on the number one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">\u201cOSBORN: I know, but now * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-9\">\u201cVICK: But you don\u2019t know that would be the one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-10\">\u201cOSBORN: Well, I know this, that if we go to trial before that jury he\u2019ll be on it but suppose the government challenges him over being on another hung jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-11\">\u201cVICK: Oh, I see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-12\">\u201cOSBORN: Where are we then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-13\">\u201cVICK: Oh I see. I see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-14\">\u201cOSBORN: So we have to be certain that he makes it on the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-15\">\u201cVICK: Well now, here\u2019s one thing, Tommy. He\u2019s a member of the CWA, see, and the Teamsters, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-17\">\u201cOSBORN: Well, they\u2019ll knock him off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-18\">\u201cVICK: Naw, they won\u2019t. They\u2019ve had a fight with the CWA, see?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-20\">\u201cOSBORN: I think everything looks perfect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-21\">\u201cVICK: I think it\u2019s in our favor, see. I think that\u2019ll work to our favor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-22\">\u201cOSBORN: That\u2019s why I\u2019m so anxious that they accept him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-23\">\u201cVICK: I think they would, too. I don\u2019t think they would have a reason in the world to. I don\u2019t think that I\u2019m under any surveillance or suspicion or anything like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-24\">\u201cOSBORN: I don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-25\">\u201cVICK: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t frankly think, since last year and since I told them I was through with the thing, I don\u2019t think I have been. Now Fred,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-26\">\u201cOSBORN: I don\u2019t think you have either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-27\">\u201cVICK: You know Fred and I may not (pause), he may be too suspicious and I may not be suspicious enough. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-28\">\u201cOSBORN: I think you\u2019ve got it sized up exactly right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-29\">\u201cVICK: Well, I think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-30\">\u201cOSBORN: Now, you know you promised that fella that you would have nothing more to do with that case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-31\">\u201cVICK: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-32\">\u201cOSBORN: At that time you had already checked on some of the jury that went into Miller\u2019s court. You went ahead and did that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-33\">\u201cVICK. Well, here\u2019s another thing, Tommy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-34\">\u201cOSBORN: * * * church affiliations, background, occupation and that sort of thing on those that went into Miller\u2019s court. You didn\u2019t even touch them. You didn\u2019t even investigate the people that were in Judge Gray\u2019s court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-35\">\u201cVICK: Well, here\u2019s the thing about it, Tommy. Soon as this damn thing\u2019s over, they\u2019re gonna kick my \u2014 out anyway, so probably Fred\u2019s too. So, I might as well get out of it what I can. The way I look at it. I might be wrong, cause the Tennessean is not gonna have anything to do with anybody that\u2019s had anything to do with the case now or in the past, you know that. Cause they\u2019re too close to the Ken-nedys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-36\">\u201cOSBORN: All right, so we\u2019ll leave it to you. The only thing to do would be to tell him in other words your next contact with him would be to tell him if he wants that deal, he\u2019s got it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-37\">\u201cVICK: O.K.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-38\">\u201cOSBORN: The only thing it depends upon is him being accepted on the jury. If the government challenges him there will be no deal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-39\">\u201cVICK: All right. If he is seated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>\u201cOSBORN: If he\u2019s seated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-4\">\u201cVICK: He can expect five thousand then and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\">\u201cOSBORN: Immediately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">\u201cVICK: Immediately and then five thousand when it\u2019s hung. Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">\u201cOSBORN: All the way, now!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\">\u201cVICK: Oh, he\u2019s got to stay all the way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-10\">\u201cOSBORN: All the way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-11\">\u201cVICK: No swing. You don\u2019t want him to swing like we discussed once before. You want him</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-12\">\u201cOSBORN: Of course, he could be guided by his own b , but that always leave a question. The thing to do is just stick with his crowd. That way we\u2019ll look better and maybe they\u2019ll have to go to another trial if we get a pretty good count.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-13\">\u201cVICK: Oh. Now, I\u2019m going to play it just like you told me previously, to reassure him and keep him from getting panicky, you know. I have reason to believe that he won\u2019t be alone, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-14\">\u201cOSBORN: You assure him of that. 100%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-15\">\u201cVICK: And to keep any fears down that he might have, see?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-16\">\u201cOSBORN: Tell him there will be at least two others with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-17\">\u201cVICK: Now, another thing, I want to ask you does John know anything. You know. I originally told John about me knowing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-18\">\u201cOSBORN: He does not know one thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-19\">\u201cVICK: He doesn\u2019t know? O.K.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-20\">\u201cOSBORN: He\u2019ll come in and recommend this man-and I\u2019ll say well just let it alone, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-22\">\u201cVICK: Yeah. So he doesn\u2019t know anything about this at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-24\">\u201cOSBORN: Nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-25\">\u201cVICK: Now he hasn\u2019t seen me. When I first came here he was in here, see.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-26\">\u201cOSBORN: - We\u2019ll keep it secret. The way to keep it safe is that nobody knows about it but you and me-Where could they ever go?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-30\">\u201cVICK: Well, that\u2019s it, I reckon, or I\u2019ll probable go down there. See, I\u2019m off tonight. I\u2019m off Sunday and Monday, see. That\u2019s why I talked to you yesterday. I had a notion to go down there yesterday cause I was off last night and I\u2019m off again tonight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-31\">\u201cOSBORN: It will be a week at least until we know the trial date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-32\">\u201cVICK: O.K. You want to hold up doing anything further till we know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-33\">\u201cOSBORN: Unless he should happen to give you a call and-something like that, then you just tell him, whenever you happen to run into him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-36\">\u201cVICK: Well, he\u2019s not apt to call, cause see</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-37\">\u201cOSBORN: You were very circumspect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-38\">\u201cVICK: Yeah. We havn\u2019t talked really definite and I think he clearly understands. Now, he might, it semed to me that maybe he thought I was joking or, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-39\">\u201cOSBORN: That\u2019s a good way to leave it, he\u2019s the one that brought it up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-40\">\u201cVICK: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-41\">\u201cOSBORN:-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-42\">\u201cVICK: Well, I knew he would before I went down there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-43\">\u201cOSBORN: Well,---</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-44\">\u201cVICK: Huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-45\">\u201cOSBORN: I\u2019ll be talking to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-47\">\u201cVICK: I\u2019ll wait a day or two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-48\">\u201cOSBORN: Yeah, I would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-49\">\u201cVICK: Before I contact him.

Miller, 316 F.2d 81 (C.A.6, 1963), this court specifically declined to hold inadmissible evidence of government agents based on their hearing a radio transmission of a conversation by use of a transmitter (Fargo device) secreted on the person of one of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">The statute under which this case was tried provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">\u201cWhoever corruptly, or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication, endeavors to influence, intimidate, or impede any witness, in any court of the United States or before any United States commissioner or other committing magistrate, or any grand or petit juror, or officer in or of any court of the United States, or officer who may be serving at any examination or other proceeding before any United States commissioner or other committing magistrate, in the discharge of his duty, or injures any party or witness in his person or property on account of his attending or having attended such court or examination before such officer, commissioner, or other committing magistrate, or on account of his testifying or having testified to any matter pending therein, or injures any such grand or petit juror in his person or property on account of any verdict or indictment assented to by him, or on account of his being or having been such juror, or injures any such officer, commissioner, or other committing magistrate in his person or property on account of the performance of his official duties, or corruptly or by threats or force, or by any theaten-ing letter or communication, influences, obstructs, or impedes, or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">This statute mirrors the national concern with preserving the integrity of the jury trial as the cornerstone of this nation\u2019s criminal law. Under its terms it is obvious that Congress has intended not merely to make successful bribing of a juror a crime, but likewise to make it a criminal offense to do any act which has the ultimate bribing of a juror as its purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">Defendant herein contends first, that what he did, did not constitute violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>of this statute, and second that if it did, he was entrapped into doing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">The principal interpretations of this statute have been made by the United States Supreme Court in United States v. Russell, 255 U.S. 138, 41 S.Ct. 260, 65 L.Ed. 553 (1921); Sorrells v. United States, 287 U.S. 435, 53 S.Ct. 210, 77 L.Ed. 413 (1932); and Sherman v. United States, 356 U.S. 369, 78 S.Ct. 819, 2 L.Ed.2d 848 (1958). (See also United States v. Gosser, 339 F.2d 102 (C.A.6, 1964)). In these cases the following principles were laid down pertaining to the substantive offense and to the defense of legal entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In Russell we find this definition of the key word \u201cendeavor.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">\u201cThe word of the section is \u2018endeavor,\u2019 and by using it the section got rid of the technicalities which might be urged as besetting the word \u2018attempt,\u2019 and it describes any effort or essay to accomplish the evil purpose that the section was enacted to prevent. Criminality does not get rid of its evil quality by the precautions it takes against consequences, personal or pecuniary. It is a somewhat novel excuse to urge that Russell\u2019s action was not criminal, because he was cautious enough to consider its cost and be sure of its success. The section, however, is not directed at success in corrupting a juror, but at the \u2018endeavor\u2019 to do so. Experimental approaches to the corruption of a juror are the \u2018endeavor\u2019 of the section.\u201d United States v. Russell, supra, 255 U.S. at 143, 41 S.Ct. at 261.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">In Sherman we find this discussion of entrapment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">\u201cTo determine whether entrapment has been established a line must be drawn between the trap for the unwary innocent and the trap for the unwary criminal. The principles by which the courts are to make this determination were outlined in Sorrells. On the one hand, at trial the accused may examine the conduct of the government agent; and on the other hand, the accused will be subjected to an \u2018appropriate and searching inquiry into his own conduct and <em>predisposition\u2019 </em>as bearing on his claim of innocence.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Sherman v. United States, supra, 356 U.S. at 372-373, 78 S.Ct. at 821.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-10\"> And in Sorrells we find these crucial distinctions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-11\">\u201cIt is well settled that the fact that officers or employees of the government merely afford opportunities or facilities for the commission of the offense does not defeat the prosecution. Artifice and stratagem may be employed to catch those engaged in criminal enterprises. Grimm v. United States, 156 U.S. 604, 610 [15 S.Ct. 470, 39 L.Ed. 550]; Goode v. United States 159 U.S. 663, 669 [16 S.Ct. 136, 40 L.Ed. 297]; Rosen v. United States, 161 U.S. 29, 42 [16 S.Ct. 434, 480, 40 L.Ed. 606]; Andrews v. United States, 162 U.S. 420, 423 [16 S.Ct. 798, 40 L.Ed. 1023]; Price v. United States, 165 U.S. 311, 315 [17 S.Ct. 366, 41 L.Ed. 727]; Bates v. United States, (C.C.) 10 F. 92, 94, note page 97; United States v. Reisenweber [2 Cir.], 288 F. 520, 526; Aultman v. United States [5 Cir.], 289 F. 251. The appropriate object of this permitted activity, frequently essential to the enforcement of the law, is to reveal the criminal design; to expose the illicit traffic, the prohibited publication, the fraudulent use of the mails, the illegal conspiracy or other offenses, and thus to disclose the would-be violators of the law. A different question is presented when the criminal design originates with the officials of the government, and they implant in the mind of an innocent person the disposition to commit the alleged offense and induce its commission in order that they may prosecute.\u201d Sorrells v. United States, supra 287 U.S. at 441-442, 53 S.Ct. at 212-213. (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>In the evidence which we have set forth, we find ample grounds for affirmance of this jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"> We are fully convinced that telling a third party to offer a bribe to a potential juror is a corrupt \u201cendeavor to influence\u201d within the meaning of the statute. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503. We do not believe that this act is insulated from prosecution by failure, or by lack of actual intent on the part of the third party ever to make the approach. The falsity of Vick\u2019s statement pertaining to Elliott closely parallels the situation in Lopez, where the Supreme Court said;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\">\u201cDavis was not guilty of an unlawful invasion of petitioner\u2019s office simply because his apparent willingness to accept a bribe was not real. Compare Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471 [83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441]. He was in the office with petitioner\u2019s consent, and while there he did not violate the privacy of the office by seizing something surreptitiously without petitioner\u2019s knowledge. Compare Gouled v. United States, supra, [255 U.S. 298, 41 S.Ct. 261, 65 L.Ed. 647]. The only evidence obtained consisted of statements made by Lopez to Davis, statements which Lopez knew full well could be used against him by Davis if he wished. We decline to hold that whenever an offer of a bribe is made in private, and the offeree does not intend to accept, that offer is a constitutionally protected communication.\u201d Lopez v. United States, supra 373 U.S. at 438, 83 S.Ct. at 1387.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Further, we find ample evidence to support this jury\u2019s rejection of the defense of entrapment. This transcript does not mirror the inducing of an unwilling party to commit a crime. This recorded conversation could have convinced the jury that defendant was a fully informed and eager jury tamperer, ready to seize the opportunity which he saw provided by Vick.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">It seems significant to us that defendant was the first to name the juror supposed to be bribed; that after ascertaining that Vick had \u201cgone pretty far,\u201d it was he who thought it might be desirable to move the conversation out of his office, presumably for the purpose of greater security; that it was he who decided that Vick should employ no intermediary in his contacts with the Elliott family; and that it was he who insisted that Elliott had to be chosen on the jury before the deal was complete or any money would be due.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">Further, we regard the following portion of the transcript as peculiarly invulnerable to the interpretation that defendant had been reluctantly induced and entrapped into participation in a jury tampering scheme not resulting from his own plans and desires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-13\">\u201cVICK: Oh. Now, I\u2019m going to play it just like you told me previously, to reassure him and keep him from getting panicky, you know. I have reason to believe that he won\u2019t be alone, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-15\">\u201cOSBORN: You assure him of that. 100%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-16\">\u201cVICK: And to keep any fears down that he might have, see?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-17\">\u201cOSBORN: Tell him there will be at least two others with him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-18\">In saying what we have said, we do not ignore the fact that defendant\u2019s principal point pertaining to entrapment concerns his argument that in conversations prior to this one he had effectively been induced to participate in the scheme which involved the proposed bribing of Elliott. His testimony pertaining to these prior unrecorded conversations with Vick was evidence which the jury, if convinced of its accuracy, could have held to represent entrapment. But defendant\u2019s version of these prior conversations was not undisputed; Vick\u2019s testimony as to them was substantially different.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-19\">Generally, disputed fact questions concerning entrapment are for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>jury to resolve. Sorrells v. United States, supra; Sherman v. United States, supra, 356 U.S. at 377, n. 8, 78 S.Ct. 819, And here there is undisputed evidence (in the evidence just quoted) from which the jury could have found that at most what the alleged entrapper did (at least on the last visit) was to provide \u201copportunity\u201d for violation of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">We certainly do not find here undisputed evidence of a case where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">\u201c[T]he Government plays on the weaknesses of an innocent party and beguiles him into committing crimes which he otherwise would not have attempted.\u201d Sherman v. United States, supra at 376, 78 S.Ct. at 822. (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">In defendant\u2019s brief much is made of the evil character of the informer, Vick. Vick\u2019s willingness to change sides from law enforcement to law violation, depending upon the inducement offered, seems apparent to us \u2014 as it doubtless did to the jury. While this moral flexibility was obviously one of the material issues bearing on the credibility of his testimony, it did not prevent jury consideration of that testimony \u2014 particularly where, as here, much of the testimony was corroborated by other evidence. United States v. Thomas, 342 F.2d 132 (C.A.6, 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Defendant\u2019s protests about the unreliability of Vick are diminished in force by substantial corroboration of the most damaging of Vick\u2019s testimony. It must also be remembered that in the first instance he chose Vick to work for him on a jury investigation in a criminal case, well-knowing his police <em>employment</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and his reputation. And the credibility of defendant\u2019s own testimony was greatly damaged, as compared to his prior reputation, by the fact that he lied repeatedly under oath before the two District Judges about knowing anything at all about the Elliott approaches until he was confronted by the record of his own voice.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Further, as opposed to defendant\u2019s own testimony as to the nature of these unrecorded conversations, the jury had an opportunity to see and hear the testimony of the defendant and his accuser, Vick. The jury could, and doubtless did, compare the relative intelligence and determination and character and experience and legal training and knowledge of the two in determining whether or not Vick would be likely (as defendant claims) successfully to induce and entrap him.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">Our review of the record indicates that there was evidence which required the United States District Judge to submit the case for jury decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">Our review of the jury charge indicates that the issue of entrapment was properly submitted to this jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">No challenge is brought to us pertaining to the impartiality of the jury which actually tried this case nor to the events of the trial itself. Defendant made no motion for change of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-12\">We are, however, confronted by a challenge to the composition and the impartiality of the grand jury which found the instant indictment. It is claimed that this grand jury was illegally impaneled and was preconditioned by preindictment publicity so as to deprive defendant of due process in its consideration of the government\u2019s evidence upon which the indictment was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-13\">The first of these issues has been recently and carefully considered by this court, and decided adversely to appellant\u2019s claims. United States v. Hoffa, et al., 349 F.2d 20 (C.A.6, 1965). Although this case was before another panel of the court, we concur in the views therein expressed pertaining to the composition of this grand jury. Swain v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 202, 85 S.Ct. 824, 13 L.Ed.2d 759 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-14\">On the issue of appellant\u2019s claim of prejudice resulting from preindictment publicity and alleged failures of the judge properly to screen the grand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>jury panel for bias, we find no grounds for reversal. Mr. Justice Black\u2019s opinion in Costello v. United States, 350 U.S. 359, 76 S.Ct. 406, 100 L.Ed. 397 (1956) indicates the limited nature of appellate review of grand jury indictment proceedings. Much of Mr. Justice Clark\u2019s majority opinion in Beck v. Washington, 369 U.S 541, 82 S.Ct. 955, 8 L.Ed.2d 98 (1962), could be read as directly appli cable to the instant case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-4\">\u201cEver since Hurtado v California, 110 U.S. 516 [4 S.Ct. 292, 28 L.Ed. 232] (1884), this Court has consistently held that there is no federal constitutional impediment to dispensing entirely with the grand jury in state prosecutions. The State of Washington abandoned its mandatory grand jury practice some 50 years ago. Since that time prosecutions have been instituted on in-formations filed by the prosecutor, on many occasions without even a prior judicial determination of \u2018probable cause\u2019 \u2014 a procedure which has likewise had approval here in such cases as Ocampo v. United States, 234 U.S. 91 [34 S.Ct. 712, 58 L.Ed. 1231] (1914), and Lem Woon v. Oregon, 229 U.S 586 [33 S.Ct 783, 57 L.Ed. 1340] (1913). * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">\u201cIn his attempts before trial to have the indictment set aside petitioner did not contend that any particular grand juror was prejudiced or biased. Rather, he asserted that the judge impaneling the grand jury had breached his duty to ascertain on <em>voir dire </em>whether any prospective juror had been influenced by the adverse publicity and that this error had been compounded by his failure to adequately instruct the grand jury concerning bias and prejudice. It may be that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires the State, having once resorted to a grand jury procedure, to furnish an unbiased grand jury. Compare Lawn v. United States, 355 U.S. 339, 349-350 [78 S.Ct. 311, 317-318, 2 L.Ed.2d 321] (1958); Costello v. United States, 350 U.S. 359, 363, [76 S.Ct. 406, 408, 100 L.Ed 397] (1956); Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 485 [71 S.Ct. 814, 817, 95 L.Ed. 1118] (1951). But we find that it is not necessary for us to determine this question; for even if due process would require a State to furnish an unbiased body once it resorted to grand jury procedure \u2014 a question upon which we do not remotely intimate any view \u2014 we have concluded that Washington, so far as is shown by the record, did so in this case.\u201d Beck v. Washington, supra at 545-546, 82 S.Ct. at 957-958. (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">We hold that here, too, as in Beck, the appellant has not borne \u201cthe burden of showing essential unfairness\u201d in relation to his indictment. Beck v. Washington, supra 369 U.S. at 558, 82 S.Ct. at 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">The essential conflict of evidence developed in this trial pertaining to Count One concerned the initial con versations between Vick\u2019 and defendant about prospective juror Elliott. Defendant\u2019s testimony varied in a number of respects (bearing on the defense of entrapment) from Vick\u2019s direct testimony. In this situation the appearance of the two District Judges to identify the Vick affidavit (upon which they authorized further investigation by use of a recording device) and the admission of the affidavit itself, were not reversible error. The affidavit was a prior record of a statement by Vick consistent with his direct testimony which defendant had attacked. The District Judge held that the affidavit and the circumstances surrounding its origin and use were proper rebuttal. We find no abuse of discretion or reversible error in this ruling. Goldsby v. United States, 160 U.S. 70, 16 S.Ct. 216, 40 L.Ed. 343 (1895); United States v. Alaimo, 297 F.2d 604 (C.A.3, 1961), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 817, 82 S.Ct. 829, 7 L.Ed.2d 784 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">In this case at the conclusion of Judge Boyd\u2019s charge both sides stated that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>had no exceptions to the jury instructions as given. We have reviewed the claims of error in the charge as given which defendant\u2019s counsel now presents on appeal and find no example of \u201cplain error\u201d therein. Rule 52(b) Fed.R.Crim.P. Taking the charge as a whole and its paragraphs in their proper context, we find the charge essentially fair.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">As to the instructions submitted by defendant but denied or not employed by the District Judge, we find no reversible error. In most instances cited the instruction was properly covered in the Judge\u2019s own language. Under the evidence in this case we do not believe that defendant was entitled to defendant\u2019s proffered instructions No. 4 or No. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Defendant\u2019s proffered instruction No. 4 would have told the jury that they could not consider any evidence offered pertaining to one count in determining the truth or falsity of the other count. This instruction was not given and the District Judge did charge \u201cthat an existing disposition to commit a similar offense is an important factor to consider in determining whether there was a subsequent entrapment.\u201d We believe that where entrapment is offered as a defense, that this charge is a proper one. Knight v. United States, 310 F.2d 305 (C.A.5, 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Here evidence pertaining to Count Two was such that the jury might have concluded that defendant rejected the opportunity to make a bribe attempt largely because he deemed it impractical and unlikely to succeed, rather than because he rejected the whole idea.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Defendant\u2019s own testimony concerning his conversations with Henry Beard pertaining to juror, Mrs. Harrison, and his subsequent employment of Beard for reporting on jury panel members\u2019 backgrounds is hardly consistent with the argument of innocent gullibility which defendant proffered to the jury. We do not believe that the judge\u2019s refusal to instruct that the jury could not consider the testimony pertaining to Count Two (in the event they rendered a Not Guilty verdict thereon) was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">We find no other issues of substance on this appeal and our review of the record does not disclose any reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b551-10\">. In view of the strong dissent in Lopez (See Lopez v. United States, 373 U.S. at 446, 83 S.Ct. 1381) to the controlling rule described above, it may be relevant to note that the essentials of search warrant procedures were carried out in the instant case, albeit no statutory authority for such a warrant exists. These include appearance before a court, a showing of probable cause, a specific judicial authorization for the search, including a description of method and object.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b554-15\">.
