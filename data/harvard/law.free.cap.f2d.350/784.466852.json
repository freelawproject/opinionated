Attys., were on the brief, submitted on the brief for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b832-20\">Before Bazelon, Chief Judge, and Wright and Leventhal, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b832-21\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b832-22\">On January 16, 1956, a two-count indictment was filed in the District Court charging appellant with rape<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and robbery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a plea of not guilty, appellant was tried and found guilty of assault with intent to commit rape and robbery. This appeal is from the District Court\u2019s denial without hearing of appellant\u2019s motion, filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, to set aside this 1956 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-23\">Appellant\u2019s first contention is that he was convicted of a crime, assault with intent to rape, for which he was not indicted. Assuming for purposes of this appeal that this contention states sufficient grounds for collateral attack,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appellant cannot prevail on this point for assault with intent to rape is a lesser included offense in the charge of rape. United States v. Lovely, E.D.S.C., <em>77 </em>F.Supp. 619, 621, reversed on other grounds, 4 Cir., 169 F.2d 386 (1948); People v. Kimball, 122 Cal.App.2d 211, 264 P.2d 582 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-26\">On appeal, appellant makes certain allegations, not made below, which might form the basis for a successful claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Since the issue was not presented below, we do not reach the question on this appeal. We do note, however, that our judgment here is without prejudice to appellant\u2019s raising the issue in a later motion by proper and sufficient pleadings in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-27\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b832-17\">. 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2801 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b832-18\">. 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2901 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b832-28\">.
