SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A8P\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b841-32\">This appeal is from a denial without hearing of a \u00a7 2255 motion which both sides agree states grounds entitling appellant to relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Though this is appellant\u2019s second \u00a7 2255 motion, it is not successive in the legal sense, as the Government on brief admits, since the earlier motion based on the same grounds did not result in a ruling on the merits. Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 15-17, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963). Abuse of remedy is, therefore, the only ground on which appellant can be denied the relief he seeks without a hearing on the merits. <em>Id. </em>at 17-19, 83 S.Ct. 1068.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-33\">In this case, the Government did plead abuse of remedy. The trial judge, however, has made no finding of fact showing an abuse of remedy, nor could such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>finding have been made on this record without a hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, I would remand this case for a hearing and findings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Compare United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 205, 77 S.Ct. 263, 96 L.Ed. 232 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b841-20\">. Petitioner alleged that the plea of guilty on which his conviction was based was entered without counsel and without intelligent waiver of his right to counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b842-14\">. The Government bears the burden of pleading and proving abuse of remedy. Sanders v. United States, <em>supra, </em>373 U.S. at 10-11, 83 S.Ct. 1068. See Note, 77 Harv.L.Rev. 79, 148 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b842-15\">, Another panel of this court has remanded another case against Pouncey to the District Court for a hearing on mental competence. Pouncey v. United States, 121 U.S.App.D.C. -, 349 F.2d 699 (No. 18,565, decided June 30, 1965). The evidence developed in that hearing would he useful in determining whether Pouncey has abused his \u00a7 2255 remedy here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
