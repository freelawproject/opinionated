He appeals, contending that it was incumbent upon the United States to prove, as an element of the crimes, that his admittedly false statements actually influenced the Federal Housing Administration to insure the loans. The subject statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1010 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"atr-dedup-0\">\u201cWhoever, for the purpose of obtaining any loan or advance of credit from any person, partnership, association, or corporation with the intent that such loan or advance of credit shall be offered to or accepted by the Federal Housing Administration for insurance * * * or for the purpose of influencing in any way the action of such Administration, makes, passes, utters, or publishes any statement, knowing the same to be false, * * * shall be fined * * * or imprisoned *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">The clear wording of the statute indicates that the essence of the crime lies in the making, passing, uttering, or publishing of a false application with the intent to influence the Administration and is not dependent upon the accomplishment of that purpose. Cohen v. United States, 6 Cir., 178 F.2d 588, cert. denied, 339 U.S. 920, 70 S.Ct. 623, 94 L.Ed. 1344; Bins v. United States, 5 Cir., 331 F.2d 390, 392, cert. denied, 379 U.S. 880, 85 S.Ct. 149, 13 L.Ed.2d 87. The crime is one of subjective knowledge and intent and requires no defrauding of the government nor reliance upon the part of its officials. See Brilliant v. United States, 8 Cir., 297 F.2d 385, 389, cert. denied, 369 U.S. 871, 82 S.Ct. 1140, 8 L.Ed.2d 275; United States v. Pesano, 2 Cir., 293 F.2d 229, 231. Appellant\u2019s contrary contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-15\">Although no instruction of the court was objected to, appellant now characterizes the instructions as \u201cvague, uncertain, and erroneous.\u201d We have examined the court\u2019s charge for clear error, find none, and consider the instructions to be specific, certain and correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-16\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
