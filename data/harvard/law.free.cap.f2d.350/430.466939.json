It later filed an amended complaint adding the appellant as a party. In two counts appellee alleged it had entered into two contracts with Nassau for sandblasting portions of the Hotel Roosevelt \u201creputed to be owned by the defendant Tracy Roosevelt Corporation.\u201d Nassau was alleged to be the duly authorized agent of Tracy Roosevelt Corporation. After receiving payments of only $8,750, leaving a substantial balance owing on the first contract, no payment having been made on the second contract, the ap-pellee filed two mechanic\u2019s liens \u201cagainst the interest of Tracy Roosevelt Corporation\u201d in the Hotel Roosevelt premises. Under circumstances to be mentioned, Nassau and Tracy Roosevelt having defaulted, the District Court entered judgment against the appellant surety in favor of the appellee to recover $5,850 together with interest and costs from February 27,1957. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-27\">Shortly after notice of intention to file the mechanic\u2019s liens had been given to Tracy Roosevelt by registered mail, Tracy Roosevelt as principal and the appellant as surety entered into and filed a \u201cMechanic\u2019s Lien Undertaking.\u201d The instrument in part recited that the \u201cabove-named Tracy Roosevelt Corporation, owner\u201d and the appellant \u201cunder<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>take * * * that they will pay and satisfy any judgment that may be recovered in any suit * * * that may be instituted on, or to enforce the above-entitled mechanic\u2019s lien.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Appellant insists that the District Court erred in granting judgment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against it in that its undertaking merely had been substituted for whatever rights the appellee might have had to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien against the interest of Tracy Roosevelt Corporation in the property known as the Roosevelt Hotel. It was urged at trial and is argued here that the appellee had not proved that Tracy Roosevelt Corporation ever had any \u201cinterest\u201d in the property purportedly subject to lien. Thus, if the property could not have been held to respond to the ap-pellee\u2019s claim of lien, the appellee had gained no greater rights from the undertaking. It was stipulated in the District Court between counsel for the respective parties hereto that the land records of the District of Columbia disclosed \u201cno leases or other instruments of record in the names of either Nassau Management Company, Inc. or Tracy Roosevelt Corporation, and that William Newman, Jack Salvage, and Jack Freeman were record title owners of the above-described property at all times pertinent to the dispute in this case * *</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The District Judge noted that the mechanic\u2019s lien undertaking had been entered into between \u201cTracy Roosevelt Corporation, owner, and Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company, surety,\u201d and that the parties had undertaken \u201cfor themselves, and each of them\u201d to pay and satisfy <em>any judgment </em>that may be recovered in any suit \u201cto enforce the above-entitled mechanic\u2019s lien.\u201d He concluded that although the default judgment entered against Nassau and Tracy Roosevelt \u201cdid not constitute an adjudication that the lien should be <em>foreclosed,\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>nevertheless the \u201cjudgment\u201d against Tracy Roosevelt had flowed from a suit \u201cinstituted on, and to enforce the mechanic\u2019s lien.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">The judge therefore ruled, in effect, that the surety may be held liable on its undertaking<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> even though the appellee had secured no more than a personal judgment against Tracy Roosevelt Corporation and even though it was not shown that the latter had <em>ever </em>owned any interest in the property. But the default judgment had expressly reserved a ruling with respect to the validity of the mechanic\u2019s lien. In making that reservation, the motions judge undoubtedly had in mind that a prerequisite to ultimate liability of the surety on the undertaking<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> involved an <em>establishment </em>on the</p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>record that Tracy Roosevelt Corporation had some interest in the Roosevelt Hotel which might have been made subject to a mechanic\u2019s lien.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">D.C.Code \u00a7 38-102 (1961) provides that a valid notice of mechanic\u2019s lien must include (1) the amount claimed, (2) the name of the party against whose interest the lien is claimed and (3) a description of the property to be charged. On its face, the \u201cnotice of lien\u201d in this case purportedly complied with those requirements. We have held however, that where a lienor has named as the alleged owner one who has no interest in the property or the lienor has named the wrong person as purported owner, the notice is fatally insufficient.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Surely it may not successfully be maintained that a contractor may gain a valid lien against the true owner of property by filing notice of lien against one who has <em>no </em>interest whatever in the property named.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">It is the theory of our mechanic\u2019s lien law that an undertaking, when approved by the court as was the case here, becomes a substitute <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for that interest in the premises which was \u201csubject to a lien.\u201d The Code provides that enforcement of the lien proceeds by a bill in equity, and the burden of proof rests upon the complainant. Indeed, the Code expressly provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">\u201cIf the <em>right of the complainant * * * </em>to the lien * * * <em>shall be established, </em>the court shall decree a sale of the land and premises or the estate and interest therein of the person who, as owner, contracted [for the work done].\u201d (Emphasis added.) <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-15\"><em>That </em>judgment which establishes a right to a lien upon the interest \u201csubject to lien\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is <em>the </em>judgment which is secured by the undertaking. The instrument here in suit did not include a liability upon the surety to respond at all events simply because the appellee secured a personal judgment that Tracy Roosevelt was indebted to the appellee. The surety\u2019s \u201cobligation is confined to the purpose of the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial judge erred in resting his decision on the default judgment rendered against Tracy Roosevelt Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-16\">But after reference to the default judgment against Tracy Roosevelt as' one basis for his decision, the District Judge also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-17\">\u201cThe second string to my bow is that if I am in error on that, plaintiff is entitled to judgment because, in my opinion, the defendant surety company is estopped from denying that the Tracy Roosevelt Corporation is the owner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-18\">We are thus brought to consideration of the estoppel ground for the judgment. The trier\u2019s findings include none of the elements<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> upon which a conclusion of estoppel might rest, indeed there seems to have been no proof offered in support of the theory. We can not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>possibly accept this predicate<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> on the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Yet in reversing, we will not order judgment for the appellant. We think we sense what the trier had in mind. He knew, of course, that the statute made the action equitable in nature. Before him was a surety seeking to be excused from liability. The pleadings disclosed that the surety had caused Tracy Roosevelt to execute an indemnity agreement to save the surety harmless. The surety had not exhibited of record the Tracy Roosevelt application for the undertaking, so that whatever representations had been made by Tracy Roosevelt were not available. Certainly the judge could reason that on the basis of Tracy Roosevelt\u2019s activities and the fact that as principal, it had paid a premium for the undertaking, it must have had some interest in the premises and in the Hotel Roosevelt. Perhaps Tracy Roosevelt at all times pertinent had been party to an agreement to buy the Hotel Roosevelt property and had thus acquired an interest.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Tracy Roosevelt or its agent Nassau had made payments of some $8,750 on account of work performed by the ap-pellee, and the latter by the default judgment had shown itself to be a creditor as to the unpaid balances long since due, with interest and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Certainly with the foregoing in mind, the mere showing by the appellant of the negative subject matter of the stipulation as to record title was insufficient to constitute a satisfactory explanation of the situation. This appellant as surety had participated with Tracy Roosevelt in freeing the purportedly liened premises from the appellee\u2019s asserted lien claim. Since to that end court approval of the undertaking had been procured, the trial judge might have thought that this case called for the surety\u2019s more complete exhibition of the circumstances producing that result. We will not say the judge unreasonably expected that all the \u201cequities\u201d should be exhibited in their true light.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-14\">Of course the ultimate burden of proof would and still does devolve upon the contractor, appellee here, but it seems clear the District Court will assay the respective rights of the parties upon the record as a whole, after full and frank disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-15\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-5\">. It was stipulated that the appellee had performed work, labor and services \u201cunder contract with the other two Defendants\u201d on account of which there was an outstanding balance to the appellee of $5,850 plus interest and costs. Neither Nassau Management Co., Inc. nor Tracy Roosevelt Corporation is before this court. A \u201cpersonal judgment\u201d had been entered by default for the appellee to recover $8,850 plus interest and costs from February 26, 1957, \u201cagainst the defendant Tracy Roosevelt Corporation.\u201d That judgment expressly reserved \u201cany ruling regarding the establishment or enforcement of a mechanic\u2019s lien against the property involved in this case, said matter being left open for future decision of this Court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b480-6\">.

It may not have been the record owner, but that by no means precludes its having an interest that will support a mechanic\u2019s lien. Thus, I do not think that the stipulated negation of record ownership was adequate by itself to satisfy appellant\u2019s burden of coming forward with an explanation of why it once signed and filed a bond characterizing Tracy Roosevelt Corporation as \u201cowner,\u201d but now claims flatly that there is no indication that the latter had any interest of any kind.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>pellant may, of course, be able to adduce a satisfactory explanation that will rebut the presumption, or prima facie showing, of lienable interest which I think arises in the special circumstances of this case. If it does, the ultimate burden will remain on appellee to establish that Tracy Roosevelt had an interest to which its lien could have attached in the absence of a bond.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-20\">. Although the proof normally associated with estoppel has not been forthcoming, I do note that the bond was filed May 16, 1957, and that it was not, as I read the record, until the hearing on its mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>tion for default judgment on June 15, 1962, that appellee was fully placed on notice of appellant\u2019s contention that Tracy Roosevelt Corporation was devoid of any interest in the property. Until that latter date, appellee was certainly entitled to feel that, if it could establish the debt owing to it, it would be assured of payment. The fact and exact amount of that debt were later stipulated by appellant and appellee.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
