The sixth count was a conspiracy count. In 1958 Sirico, represented by counsel, pleaded not guilty and trial was begun. After conferring with counsel, he withdrew his plea and changed it to guilty on all counts. He was sentenced as a second felony offender to 14 <em>x/% </em>years on each count, to run concurrently. In 1960 he moved under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 to withdraw his guilty plea and to vacate judgment and sentence. The motions were denied. Applications for leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>were denied by the District Court and by this court. In 1964 Sirico again moved under \u00a7 2255 to vacate the judgment and sentence. This motion was also denied, and from that order Sirico appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">Sirico\u2019s only argument is that the indictment did not sufficiently inform him about the nature of the accusation because it failed to specify the precise place and circumstances of the offenses, including the identity of the recipients of the narcotics. Precisely the same indictment was upheld by us against the same charge in United States v. Spada, 331 F.2d 995 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 865, 85 S.Ct. 130, 13 L.Ed.2d 67 (1964); see United States v. Cimino, 321 F.2d 509, 512 (2d Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 375 U. S. 974, 84 S.Ct. 491, 11 L.Ed.2d 418 and <em>sub nom. </em>D\u2019Ercole v. United States, 375 U.S. 967, 84 S.Ct. 486, 11 L.Ed.2d 416 (1964). The claim of prejudice is without merit. Represented by counsel, Sirico pleaded guilty, without even seeking a bill of particulars; and, the indictment is sufficiently clear to provide a bar for double jeopardy purposes. The name of the purchaser is not essential under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 173-174, see United States v. Rosa, 343 F.2d 123, 124 (2d Cir. 1965). Compare United States v. Lauer, 321 F.2d 187, 191 (7th Cir. 1963), with Clay v. United States, 326 F.2d 196, 198-199 (10th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 1000, 84 S.Ct. 1930, 12 L.Ed.2d 1050 (1964); United States v. Dickerson, 337 F.2d 343, 346-348 (6th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
