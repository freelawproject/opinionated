L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, to enforce the alleged liability of the defendant as a \u201cperson other than the insured\u201d for a personal injury sustained by Carlson on August 22, 1934, while working on a State road then under construction at West Boylston.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Mario Pandolf Company, Inc., had the contract from the Commonwealth for building the road. Carlson, while in the employ of that corporation, and while at work upon a machine for laying concrete paving, was struck and injured by a truck driven by the defendant and loaded with \u201caggregate\u201d which had been brought to be dumped into the paving machine. The Pandolf Company had hired this truck with driver at $3 an hour from the defendant\u2019s brother, who owned it. The owner had procured the defendant to drive the truck. We assume, as argued by the plaintiff, that the owner of the truck was an independent contractor with the Pandolf Company, and that the defendant was an employee of his brother, the truck owner, and not of the Pandolf Company. The truck owner was not insured under the act. The Massachusetts Bonding and Insurance Company, as insurer of the Pandolf Company, has paid compensation to Carlson, presumably under \u00a7 15, for which it seeks to reimburse itself in this action. Under these circumstances regard must be had to \u00a7 18 of the act as well as to \u00a7 15. It is provided in \u00a7 18, within specified limitations, that if an insured person contracts with an independent contractor to do the work of the insured the insurer shall pay the compensation to employees of the independent contractor which would be payable to them if the independent contractor were insured and shall be entitled to recover indemnity from any other person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>who would have been liable to such employees independently of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\">This is a case where an employee (Carlson) of the insured general contractor (the Pandolf Company) has been injured by an employee (the defendant) of an uninsured independent subcontractor (the truck owner). In such a case the insurer who has paid compensation to the injured employee cannot recover in his name or otherwise against the defendant. This proposition is supported by precise statement and nearly, if not quite, by actual decision of this court. In <em>Clark </em>v. <em>M. W. Leahy Co. Inc. </em>300 Mass. 565, at pages 568-569, we said, \u201cThe insurance of the general contractor or ' common employer \u2019 . . . throws its shadow over the\" whole work. In that shadow (unless there has been a written notice under \u00a7 24 reserving common law rights) a cause of action for negligence causing a compensable personal injury cannot grow. . . . Since the insurance of the \u2018 common employer \u2019 covers and protects all employees engaged in the \u2018 common employment \u2019 . . . , one engaged in that common employment as contractor, subcontractor or employee cannot be a 'person other than the insured \u2019 within \u00a7 15, and the injured employee has no option to sue him at common law. An insurer, whether of the common employer or of a subcontractor, paying compensation to an employee, cannot recover over under \u00a7 15 against a negligent contractor, subcontractor or employee engaged in the ' common employment,\u2019 for the insurer succeeds only to the rights of the employee receiving compensation. ... In the application of this rule, it is immaterial whether the subcontractors are insured or not. . . . The essential thing is the existence of a ' common employer' who is an 'insured person\u2019 under \u00a7 18 ... , and who is having work done by contract in or about premises specified in \u00a7 18 . . . , which work is part of or process in his trade or business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">It is unnecessary to repeat here the somewhat elaborate line of reasoning which has led to this rule. Its development may be traced through the cases cited in <em>Clark </em>v. <em>M. W. Leahy Co. Inc. </em>300 Mass. 565, from which we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>quoted above. Reference may be made, however, to <em>White </em>v. <em>George A. Fuller Co. </em>226 Mass. 1, <em>Bindbeutel </em>v. <em>L. D. Willcutt &amp; Sons Co. </em>244 Mass. 195, <em>Catalano </em>v. <em>George F. Watts Corp. </em>255 Mass. 605, <em>Bresnahan </em>v. <em>Barre, </em>286 Mass. 593, <em>Dresser </em>v. <em>New Hampshire Structural Steel Co. </em>296 Mass. 97, and <em>Caira </em>v. <em>Caira, </em>296 Mass. 448. The case of <em>Pimental </em>v. <em>John E. Cox Co. Inc. </em>299 Mass. 579, does not help the plaintiff. In that case there was no \u201ccommon employer\u201d insured under the act with respect to the work in question. See page 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">In the case at bar the Pandolf Company was a \u201ccommon employer\u201d as that expression is used in this connection whose insurance threw its \u201cshadow over the whole work,\u201d including the act of delivery by the defendant at the site of material to be used in building the road. This case falls within the scope of \u00a7 18 in that the contract between the insured and the truck owner was \u201cpart of or process in, the trade or business carried on by the insured\u201d and in that the injury occurred \u201cin or about the premises\u201d on which the truck owner had \u201cundertaken to execute the work for the insured.\u201d See <em>Doherty\u2019s Case, </em>294 Mass. 363, 367-368; <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>[1908] 2 K. B. 567, 571. See now St. 1938, c. 102, amending \u00a7 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">We do not discuss the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the Commonwealth was the \u201ccommon employer\u201d and was not insured under the act further than to say that it is plain that the Pandolf Company was a \u201ccommon employer\u201d as to all parties here involved and was insured. The existence of some uninsured \u201ccommon employer\u201d over and above the Pandolf Company, if it were a fact, could not help the plaintiff. See <em>Saxe\u2019s Case, </em>242 Mass. 290. Compare <em>Pimental </em>v. <em>John E. Cox Co. Inc. </em>299 Mass. 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
