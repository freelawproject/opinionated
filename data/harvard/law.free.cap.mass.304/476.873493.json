The jury could have found that, without any justification, the plaintiff was assaulted by Chiampa at about one o\u2019clock in the morning, although the evidence was conflicting whether the assault was committed in the caf\u00e9 and whether at the time Chiampa was an employee. There was evidence that Chiampa was employed to clean the caf\u00e9; that he did this work between the hours of eight and ten o\u2019clock every morning; and that he was not employed to do any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>work. Although there was evidence that just prior to the assault Chiampa was serving customers in the caf\u00e9, there was other evidence that at that time he was there solely as a customer or \u201cmerely to pass the time and talk to the bartender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">A witness, called in direct examination by the plaintiff, was asked what Chiampa\u2019s reputation as a fighter in the prize ring was, and he replied: \u201cVery good . . . Well, he would travel like a son-of-a-gun ... He can fight very hard.\u201d If we assume that Chiampa had a general reputation as a fighter and the witness knew of it, and if we could further assume that a prize ring fighter is apt to commit assaults, nevertheless we are of the opinion that the evidence was inadmissible. \u201cThe fact that a person\u2019s habits or character are such that he would be apt to do an act is not competent evidence that he did the act.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivet, </em>205 Mass. 464, 466, and cases cited. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. 295, 325. <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>14 Gray, 107. <em>Bruce </em>v. <em>Priest, </em>5 Allen, 100. <em>Geary </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>169 Mass. 23, 31. <em>Luiz </em>v. <em>Falvey, </em>228 Mass. 253, 255. Compare <em>Day </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>154 Mass. 13. The case is distinguishable from those cases where, under a plea of justification or self-defence, the general character and habits relevant to the issue on trial of the one assaulted may be shown if known to the assailant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tircinski, </em>189 Mass. 257. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Festo, </em>251 Mass. 275, 280. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bezko, </em>280 Mass. 435. Although it was undisputed at the trial that Chiampa struck the plaintiff, and for that reason it might seem that the admission of this evidence was not prejudicial, nevertheless there was evidence that, before any assault occurred, Chiampa, in order to get away from the plaintiff, left the caf\u00e9 followed by the plaintiff, who was the aggressor and struck the first blow. In these circumstances it cannot be said that the error was not prejudicial and the exception must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">There was no error in the refusal of the trial judge to give the defendant\u2019s request that \u201cIf the jury find that Chiampa\u2019s work consisted only of cleaning the premises, then the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>should find for the defendant.\u201d The request fails to take into consideration other important factors upon which the defendant\u2019s liability, if any, could be established.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Inasmuch as there must be a new trial at which the question presented by the remaining exception probably will not arise, it is unnecessary to consider it. See <em>Caron </em>v. <em>Lynn Sand &amp; Stone Co. </em>270 Mass. 340, 348; and also <em>Ciarmataro </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>275 Mass. 521; <em>Fanciullo </em>v. <em>B. G. &amp; S. Theatre Corp. </em>297 Mass. 44, with cases collected at page 478.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
