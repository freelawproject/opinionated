The action is brought to recover his \u201cConservation Commission\u201d for the quarters ending August 8 and November 7, 1938.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-14\">The plaintiff\u2019s written contract with the defendant provides that he shall \u2018 \u2018 accept in full satisfaction for all services the commissions and advances hereinafter provided and limited.\u201d Then follows (passing over some clauses immaterial to this case) a description of three kinds of \u201ccommission,\u201d with a detailed statement of the manner in which each is to be calculated. These are the \u201cFirst-Year Commission,\u201d the \u201cCollection Commission\u201d and the \u201cConservation Commission.\u201d The \u201cConservation Commission\u201d is based upon a comparison between the \u201crenewal lapse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>rate\u201d of policies written through, or placed in charge of, the particular agent with the \u201crenewal lapse rate\u201d of the company as a whole. It is so adjusted that if the agent\u2019s lapse rate for a given quarter is twenty per cent or less of the company\u2019s rate for that quarter the agent shall receive in the succeeding quarter a \u201cConservation Commission\u201d of $6 per week, and if the agent\u2019s rate is over one hundred seventy-five per cent of the company\u2019s rate he shall receive no \u201cConservation Commission.\u201d Between these extremes the amount which the agent shall receive is to be ascertained by reference to a sliding scale inserted in the contract. The contract states that this provision for the payment of a \u201cConservation Commission\u201d \u201cis not a part of this contract in any jurisdiction in which it may be in conflict with any law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\">G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 175, \u00a7 164A, inserted by St. 1938, c. 225, is as follows: \u201cIf a policy of industrial life insurance upon which premiums have been paid for three years or more is surrendered to the company for a cash surrender value or paid up insurance or extended term insurance or lapses for non-payment of premiums, the agent shall not be charged with a decrease for said premium and no deduction shall be made from his commission or salary.\u201d The policies with respect to which the \u201cConservation Commission\u201d is calculated include surrendered and lapsed policies of the class to which the statute refers. The question to be decided is, therefore, whether the provision for a \u201cConservation Commission\u201d conflicts with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">The statute declares that the agent \u2018' shall not be charged with a decrease,\u201d and that \u201cno deduction shall be made from his commission or salary.\u201d We construe this to mean that in computing the agent\u2019s commission or salary no deduction shall be made on account of the surrenders or lapses to which the statute refers from the commission or salary which under his contract the agent would receive if there had been no such surrenders or lapses. We can think of no other reasonable interpretation of the words of the statute. The purpose was to exclude these surrenders and lapses as elements operating adversely to the agent in com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>puting his commission or salary. Apparently it was thought that the fixing of the agent\u2019s commission or salary with reference to such surrenders and lapses, which may have increased in recent years without any fault of the agent, was unfair or contrary to the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-3\">We cannot accept the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the \u201cConservation Commission\u201d-is not in reality a part of the agent\u2019s \u201ccommission or salary,\u201d but is a \u201cbonus\u201d or \u201cpriz\u00e9\u201d to be given to him over and above his commission or salary, if his lapse rate is low. The contract will not admit of this construction. If the clause providing for the \u201cConservation Commission\u201d takes effect as included in the contract, then under its terms the \u201cConservation Commission\u201d is not a gift or bonus but is as much a stipulated part of the consideration to be paid to the agent for the performance of his agreement as is the \u201cFirst-Year Commission\u201d or the \u201cCollection Commission.\u201d If the plaintiff\u2019s contention should prevail, it would always be possible to evade the statute by setting up a minimum rate of compensation to be calculated without regard to surrenders and lapses and then providing for an additional compensation if the agent\u2019s surrenders and lapses should be few.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">The terms of the provision for a \u201cConservation Commission\u201d described in the plaintiff\u2019s contract, if put into effect, would result in reducing the agent\u2019s commission or salary because of these surrenders and lapses below the sum which the agent would be entitled to receive if there had been no such surrenders and lapses, and therefore would conflict with G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 175, \u00a7 164A. It follows that by the express terms of the contract the provision relative to the \u201cConservation Commission\u201d never became a part of the contract, and the plaintiff is not entitled to recover that commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
