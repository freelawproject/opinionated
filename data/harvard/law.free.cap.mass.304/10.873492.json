There was evidence that the street was straight and about seventy feet wide between curbs; that the defendant\u2019s driver was proceeding on his right of the middle, but \u201crather close to said middle line\u201d; that Brennan had driven through Kenmore Square at a speed not exceeding twenty-five miles an hour and was continuing in about the middle of his right hand half of the road when two headlights of an \u201cinbound\u201d automobile, which could have been found to have been the defendant\u2019s taxicab, suddenly flashed from Brennan\u2019s left hand side of the road in a diagonal direction \u201cin front of\u201d him, \u201cstriking about at the front right hand side of . . . [Brennan\u2019s] car.\u201d The word \u201cstriking,\u201d taken in connection with other evidence, could be found to refer to the impact of the two automobiles and not merely to the direction of the beams of light from the headlights. Brennan testified that he thought \u201cthe car was going to cut in in front of him,\u201d and that as quickly as he could he turned his automobile to his left to avoid a collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">If the jury believed the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff they could find that the plaintiff\u2019s injury was caused by negligence of the defendant\u2019s driver in suddenly turning to his left toward, if not quite into, the path of the Brennan automobile. A finding of an auditor that the actual point of collision was at Brennan\u2019s left of the middle fine, even if we assume without deciding that that finding (which was not to be final) was uncontradicted at the trial, was not conclusive against the plaintiff. One cause of the collision might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>still be found to have been negligence of the defendant\u2019s driver in suddenly turning his vehicle to his left in such a manner as to cause Brennan to turn to his left in an effort to escape. See <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Bragdon, </em>289 Mass. 595, 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">The defendant suggests that the evidence fails to show that the defendant\u2019s driver was not forced to change the direction of the taxicab by some person or obstruction appearing in front of him and so may not have been negligent in turning. <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Town Taxi Inc. </em>263 Mass. 215, 217, 218. To this it is a sufficient answer that the jury could find from the testimony of the defendant\u2019s driver himself that nothing of the kind occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
