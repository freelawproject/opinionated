The bill of exceptions states that the only issue is whether there was any evidence which would warrant the jury in finding that the defendant\u2019s automobile was being operated by a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>(Womer) for whose conduct the defendant was legally responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\">Proof of the fact that at the time of the collision the defendant\u2019s automobile was \u201cregistered in the name of the defendant as owner\u201d would be \u201cprima facie evidence that it was then being operated by and under the control of a person for whose conduct the defendant was legally responsible,\u201d and absence of such responsibility would be \u201can affirmative defence to be set up in the answer and proved by the defendant.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 85A. \"Under this statute the mere fact of registration in the name of the defendant as owner commonly carries the case to the jury so far as agency of the driver in behalf of the defendant is concerned. <em>Thomes </em>v. <em>Meyer Store Inc. </em>268 Mass. 587. <em>Haun </em>v. <em>LeGrand, </em>268 Mass. 582. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>273 Mass. 146. <em>Ferreira </em>v. <em>Franco, </em>273 Mass. 272. <em>Karpowicz </em>v. <em>Manasas, </em>275 Mass. 413, 418. <em>Bruce </em>v. <em>Hanks, </em>277 Mass. 268. <em>Greenburg </em>v. <em>Gorvine, </em>279 Mass. 339. <em>Boyas </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>302 Mass. 519, 521-522. The jury may disbelieve the testimony of witnesses tending to the contrary, even though they are called by the plaintiff. <em>Haun </em>v. <em>LeGrand, </em>268 Mass. 582, 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">But the defendant contends that G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 85A, does not apply, because, as the defendant says, the automobile admittedly owned by the defendant was not \u201cregistered in the name of the defendant as owner.\u201d This contention rests upon the claim that the defendant, being a dealer, instead of registering this particular automobile as an owner under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 2, had applied under \u00a7 5 for \u201ca general distinguishing number or mark\u201d and held a certificate of registration issued under the latter section \u201ccontaining the name and business address of the applicant and the general distinguishing number or mark assigned to him.\u201d By \u00a7 5 \u201call motor vehicles or trailers owned or controlled by . . . [the] dealer . . . shall be regarded as registered under such general distinguishing number or mark until sold or let for hire or loaned for a period of five successive days,\u201d provided that the number plates furnished by the registrar are properly displayed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>thereon. There was evidence that at the time of the collision the defendant\u2019s automobile carried Massachusetts dealer\u2019s plates. It could be inferred that these were plates duly furnished to the defendant by the registrar under \u00a7 5. <em>Karpowicz </em>v. <em>Manasas, </em>275 Mass. 413, 419. There was also evidence that the defendant had not \u201clet for hire or loaned\u201d the automobile \u201cfor a period of five successive days.\u201d There was other and different evidence which might possibly support a finding that this automobile was in fact registered to the defendant under \u00a7 2, but we prefer to deal with the larger question and to assume as the fact \u2022the defendant\u2019s view that it was being operated under a dealer\u2019s certificate issued in accordance with \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\">This case thus presents the question whether G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 85A, applies with respect to a vehicle which is not separately registered on application of the owner under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 2, but is to be \u201cregarded as registered\u201d under \u00a7 5 because owned by a dealer and bearing a set of his plates. Stated differently, the question is whether a vehicle in fact owned by a defendant dealer and operated under his dealer\u2019s plates is \u201cregistered in the name of the defendant as owner\u201d within the meaning of those words as used in c. 231, \u00a7 85A. It was suggested that such a question might be raised in <em>Foley </em>v. <em>John H. Bates Inc. </em>295 Mass. 557, 560-561, but no attempt was there made to answer it. See also <em>Liddell </em>v. <em>Middlesex Motor Co. </em>275 Mass. 346, 350, 351, and <em>Liddell </em>v. <em>Standard Accident Ins. Co. </em>283 Mass. 340, 344-347.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Section 85A was important remedial legislation. It was obviously intended to do away with the difficulty which under the law as it had previously stood was often encountered by injured persons in trying to make formal proof that the driver was operating in the owner\u2019s behalf at the time of an accident. The truth about, this matter would be known to the defendant and the evidence would normally be within his control. The truth would commonly be unknown to the plaintiff and often very difficult of ascertainment by him. It may well have been thought that greater justice would be done and more responsible control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>over motor vehicles established by shifting the burden. Registration as owner could be used as a means of accomplishing these results. The law in this Commonwealth would thus be brought into approximate conformity with that manifested by judicial decision in a number of other jurisdictions. Tho<em>mes </em>v. <em>Meyer Store Inc. </em>268 Mass. 587, 589. See cases collected in 74 Am. L. R. 951. Compare <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Brereton, </em>261 Mass. 238, 241, decided before the enactment of \u00a7 85A. The objects sought can best be attained by a liberal construction and a wide application of the act throughout the field and would be in part defeated by limitation to special classes of cases. The evils to be overcome would seem to exist in connection with vehicles owned by dealers no less than in connection with those owned by persons not dealers, and the remedy would seem equally appropriate. Chapter 231, \u00a7 85A should therefore be held to apply where the vehicle involved in an accident is owned by a dealer and is \u201cregarded as registered\u201d under c. 90, \u00a7 5, if the words of \u00a7 85A will fairly admit of that construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">We think that the words of \u00a7 85A will fairly admit of that construction. To begin with, we have no doubt that a dealer\u2019s vehicle \u201cregarded as registered\u201d under c. 90, \u00a7 5, is to be regarded as registered for all purposes and is in reality as fully \u201cregistered\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 85A as a vehicle registered under c. 90, \u00a7 2. Section 5 itself refers to \u201cvehicles . . . registered in accordance with this section.\u201d Where the dealer is the defendant there can be no doubt that the vehicle is registered \u201cin the name of the defendant\u201d when it is operated under a dealer\u2019s certificate issued to him by name. The question remains whether it is registered in the name of the defendant \u201cas owner.\u201d We think it is where the defendant dealer is in fact the owner. By \u00a7 5 a particular vehicle comes under the protection of the dealer\u2019s certificate and plates either by virtue of being \u201cowned\u201d by him or by virtue of being \u201ccontrolled\u201d by him. If, therefore, he owns the vehicle, it is not stretching the meaning of words to say that it becomes \u201cregistered in his name as owner\u201d when, having a certificate in his name under \u00a7 5, he places his plates upon the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>It is possible that this construction may lead to a distinction in the application of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 85A, between vehicles owned by a dealer and those merely in his control without ownership. We need not now decide the point. Even if our reasoning leads to that distinction, the difficulty seems to us to be less than would be involved in holding that all owners except dealers are subject to the burdens of \u00a7 85A, but that dealer owners are to escape. There may be reasons for treating vehicles owned differently from those merely in the control (usually temporary) of the dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In our opinion there was <em>prima facie </em>evidence under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 85A, warranting the jury in finding that the defendant was legally responsible for the conduct of Womer.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
