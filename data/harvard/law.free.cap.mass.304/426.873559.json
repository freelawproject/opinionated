Lowell, Massachusetts to New York, N. Y. are equipped with the Babaco Alarm System. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>... It is further warranted by the assured that such \u2018Babaco\u2019 equipment protecting the cargo compartment shall be in the \u2018on\u2019 position except with respect to any truck . . . which is actually being loaded and/or unloaded . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\">The Babaco alarm system for trucks is designed, when set in the \u201con\u201d position, to sound a siren whistle upon the opening of a door to either the cab where the operator sits or the compartment containing the cargo. The siren whistle sounds a long time and stalls the motor, so that the truck cannot easily be driven away. The alarm is set in the \u201con\u201d position by master keys, of which there are only two, one kept at Lowell and the other in the city of New York. The operator by pressing a certain button can open the cab door without sounding the alarm, but he has no means of so opening the cargo compartment when the alarm is set in the \u201con\u201d position.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">On August 15, 1937, the Lowell Trucking Corporation undertook to carry goods of the plaintiff from Lowell to a consignee in the city of New York in one of its trucks which was equipped with the Babaco alarm system. The Lowell Trucking Corporation intentionally refrained from setting the alarm in the \u201con\u201d position as to the cargo compartment, for some goods in the truck were to be delivered at Stamford, Connecticut, on the way to New York. In the city of New York, before the transportation ended, the operator of the truck was beset with armed robbers, who forced him to give them access to the cargo compartment, as he could do because the alarm was not in the \u201c on \u201d position. The robbers drove the truck away and stole all the plaintiff\u2019s goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The plaintiff obtained judgment against the Lowell Trucking Corporation in the sum of $4,079.51 damages and $9.90 costs, and then brought this bill under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 112, 113, and c. 214, \u00a7 3 (10), to reach and apply the obligation of the insurer Niagara Fire Insurance Company in satisfaction of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">It is not necessary to decide whether the provision requiring the use of the Babaco alarm system in the \u201con\u201d position is a condition of liability or only a warranty. Even if it was the latter, and because the policy was made in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Massachusetts the provision fell within G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 175, \u00a7 186, though incorporated in the policy <em>(Everson </em>v. <em>General Accident, Fire &amp; Life Assurance Corp. Ltd. </em>202 Mass. 169; <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Casualty Co. of America, </em>224 Mass. 327, 331; <em>Goldstein </em>v. <em>Royal Indemnity Co. </em>297 Mass. 55, 57; compare <em>Faris </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. 278 </em>Mass. 204), the breach of it under the circumstances of the case warranted if it did not require the finding that the \"matter . . . made a warranty increased the risk of loss.\u201d <em>Goldstein </em>v. <em>Royal Indemnity Co. </em>297 Mass. 55. Compare <em>Schiller </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>295 Mass. 169, 177, <em>et seq. </em>The Lowell Trucking Corporation has no right to recover upon the policy, and consequently, apart from the indorsement remaining for consideration, there is no obligation for the plaintiff to reach. <em>Souza </em>v. <em>Car &amp; General Assurance Corp. Ltd. </em>281 Mass. 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\">But the judge rightly ruled that the violation by the Lowell Trucking Corporation of the provisions of the policy did not impair the right of the plaintiff to enforce for its own benefit the obligation of the defendant insurer to the extent of $1,000 and no more, under the indorsement added to the policy in obedience to the rules and regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission made under the authority of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935 (Act of August 9, 1935, c. 498, 49 U. S..Sts. at Large, 543, U. S. C. Sup. IV, Title 49, \u00a7\u00a7 301-327).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>The plaintiff and the defendant Lowell Trucking Corporation claim appeals from an interlocutory decree as well as from the final decree, but no interlocutory decree appears in the record. They may have supposed that the order for a decree was an interlocutory decree and appealable as such. <em>Gulesian v. Newton Trust Co. </em>302 Mass. 369, 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\n<em>Final decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b471-4\"> Pursuant to U. S. C. Sup. IV, Title 49, \u00a7 315, the Interstate Commerce Commission on August 3, 1936, prescribed a form of indorsements for policies of insurance for cargo liability which interstate motor common carriers were required by that section and the rules of the commission to obtain. That form was followed in the policy in question. By the indorsement the insurer \u201chereby agrees to pay, within.the limits of liability hereinafter provided, any shipper or consignee for all loss of or damage to all property belonging to such shipper or consignee, and coming into the possession of the insured in connection with its transportation service, for which loss or damage the insured may be held legally liable .... Within the limits of liability hereinafter provided it is further understood and agreed that no condition, provision, stipulation, or limitation contained in the policy, or any other endorsement thereon or violation thereof, or of this endorsement by the insured, shall affect in any way the right of any shipper or consignee, or relieve the Company from liability for the payment of any claim for which the insured may be held legally liable to compensate shippers or consignees, irrespective of the financial responsibility or lack thereof or insolvency or bankruptcy of the insured. . . . The company shall not be liable ... in any event for an amount in excess of $1,000, in respect of the loss of or damage to such property carried on any one motor vehicle . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
