M. Quinn, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b141-4\"><em>B.

The provision for grace is as follows: \u20181 Grace. \u2014 If any premium is not paid on or before the day it falls due the policy holder is in default; but a grace of one month (not less than thirty days) will be allowed for the payment of every premium after the first during which time the insurance continues in force. If death occurs within the period of grace the overdue premium will be deducted from the amount payable hereunder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The annual premium of $216.15 came due on August 1, 1934, and was not paid. On August 11, 1934, the plaintiff was stricken with a cerebral hemorrhage and thereafter was continuously totally and permanently disabled for life. She was unable, until some time in September, 1934, to take any steps to pay the premium or to communicate to her family the need of paying it. When payment was tendered on September 10, 1934, after the month of \u201cgrace\u201d had expired, it was refused. The action is brought to recover disability payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The liability for disability benefits is conditioned upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>receipt of due proof of disability \u201cbefore default in payment of premium,\u201d and the consequent waiver of premiums is limited to \u201cany premium . . . falling due during the period of continuous total disability.\u201d In this case the premium became due and payable, and the plaintiff became in default, before any due proof of disability and indeed before any disability began. The month of \u201cgrace,\u201d by the express language of the policy, does not begin until the insured is \u201cin default\u201d because of the nonpayment of premium on the day when it becomes due. The ' <em>\u2018 </em>grace \u2019' preserves the policy from immediate forfeiture, but does not of itself vacate the default. The plain language of the policy shows that the plaintiff has no valid claim, notwithstanding the unfortunate situation in which she finds herself through no fault of her own except that of not paying the premium promptly.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Our conclusion is supported by authority in some other jurisdictions. <em>Talsky </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co. </em>244 App. Div. (N. Y.) 661, affirmed 270 N. Y. 665. <em>Brams </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co. </em>299 Penn. St. 11, 15. See also <em>Bruce </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins.
