L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 25; see \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2), for a writ of mandamus to compel the respondents, the trustees of the properties of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Company, debtor, and of the Old Colony Railroad Company, debtor, both in reorganization under \u00a7 77 of the Federal bankruptcy law, to comply with all the terms and conditions of an order dated July 28, 1938, made by said department \u2014 a copy of which is attached to the petition. This order purports to have been made upon a petition by the respondent trustees of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Company \u2014 one of eighteen petitions \"seeking the approval of the Commission to the abandonment of passenger service at 88 stations in southeastern Massachusetts\u201d \u2014 which involved the abandonment of \"all of the stations on the railroad from Bass River to Provincetown, both inclusive, on Cape Cod.\u201d The order made upon the petition was \"that the Trustees of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Company, operating the Old Colony Railroad under a decree of the Federal Court for the District of Connecticut, operate a gas-electric rail car on all weekdays from Yarmouth to Provincetown in the morning and from Provincetown to Yarmouth in the afternoon, and said gas-electric rail car shall stop to permit passengers to board or alight at the following stations: . . . [naming nine of them],\u201d and as to these stations the petition is denied, and \"that the Department hereby grants its approval in writing of the abandonment of the following stations: . . . [naming eight stations other than those previously referred to in the order].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">The respondents filed an answer containing two subdi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>visions. Subdivision I is entitled \u201cAnswers to Matters Demurrable,\u201d and contains four paragraphs numbered one, two, three and four, respectively. The fourth paragraph is as follows: \u201cIt is nowhere alleged in the petition before the court that the petitioners do not have other adequate and effectual remedy; by\u201d G. L. (T\u00e9r. Ed.) c. 25, \u00a7 5, and G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 160, \u00a7 252, \u201cit is provided that this court shall have jurisdiction in equity to enforce valid orders of the said department of public utilities; and where other adequate and effectual remedy exists, there is no authority in law for proceedings for mandamus.\u201d Subdivision II is entitled \u201cAnswers in the Nature of Pleas in Abatement,\u201d and contains two paragraphs numbered five and six respectively. The petitioners in response to the answer of the respondents filed a \u201ctraverse and demurrer thereto\u201d in which they demurred \u2018 \u2018 to the averments contained in paragraphs 5 and 6 under caption \u2018II. Answers in the nature of pleas in abatement. \u2019 \u201d A further answer by the respondents is on file, but is not now involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\">The case came on to be heard before a single justice of this court upon the petition, the answer of the respondents and the petitioners\u2019 traverse and demurrer. He reserved and reported the case \u201cupon so much of the aforesaid pleadings as relate to the matters contained in paragraphs 1 to 6, inclusive, of the respondents\u2019 answer for determination by the full court. If any of the matters contained in paragraphs 1 to 6, inclusive, of the answer constitutes a valid defense, the petition is to be dismissed with costs to the respondents, provided, however, if the court is of the opinion that the petitioners\u2019 remedy is by a bill in equity and not by mandamus the petitioners are to be given the right to apply for an appropriate amendment before the single justice. If none of said matters constitutes a valid defense, the proceeding is bo be remitted to a single justice for further proceedings upon the matters involved in the remaining paragraphs of the answer and the traverse and demurrers thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">At the argument before the full court the respondents waived all defences set up by the six paragraphs of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>answer, herein referred to, except the defence set up by paragraph four thereof, above quoted. The sole question for decision, therefore, is whether a petition for a writ of mandamus will lie to enforce an order of the department of public utilities such as is referred to in the petition \u2014 provided such order is valid \u2014 particularly when it is not alleged in the petition that the petitioners have no \u201cother adequate and effectual remedy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-3\">While no question of the validity of the order of the department referred to in the petition is presented for decision, the nature of this order must be considered in its bearing upon the procedural question raised. The petitioners rely for authority to make the order upon G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 160, \u00a7 128, which reads as follows: \u201cA railroad corporation which has established and maintained a passenger station throughout the year for five consecutive years at any point upon its railroad shall not abandon such station, unless it is relocated under the following section, nor substantially diminish the accommodation furnished by the stopping of trains thereat as compared with that furnished at other stations on the same railroad, except with the written approval of the department after notice posted in and on said station for a period of thirty days immediately preceding a public hearing thereon.\u201d The petitioners urge that the order made was in substance \u201ca partial denial of the application for abandonment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">The specific prayer of the petition \u2014 which is coupled with a prayer for general relief \u2014 in form, seeks relief against negative conduct of the respondents in failing to comply with the order in question, including failing to \u201coperate a gas-electric rail car\u201d which shall \u201cstop to permit passengers to board or alight\u201d at certain stations. But the conduct of the respondents, against which relief is sought, apparently includes also some affirmative elements, namely, abandoning, in violation of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 160, \u00a7 128, certain passenger stations, the abandonment of which has not received the written approval of the department, and violating the order of the department denying the petition of these respondents for approval of abandonment of such stations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>The petitioners contend that under authority of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 159, \u00a7 40, read in the light of the law relating to mandamus generally, this court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandamus to compel the respondents to comply with the terms and conditions of the order in question. The respondents, on the other hand, contend that the only jurisdiction of this court to compel the respondents to comply with the terms and conditions of this order \u2014 if it is valid \u2014 is in equity, under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 25, \u00a7 5, and c. 160, \u00a7 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\">Little aid in the determination of the question presented is to be derived from G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 25, \u00a7 5. That chapter is a chapter dealing with the department of public utilities generally. In the second paragraph of \u00a7 5 thereof \u201cjurisdiction in equity\u201d is conferred upon the Supreme Judicial Court \u201cto review, modify, amend or annul any ruling or order of the commission . . . but only to the extent of the unlawfulness of such ruling or order,\u201d with detailed provisions as to procedure. Such review is referred to also in the first paragraph of the section. This provision for review was described in <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad </em>v. <em>New York Central Railroad, </em>256 Mass. 600, 618, as more specific than the power of review given \u201cin general terms by G. L. c. 160, \u00a7 252,\u201d and, consequently, controlling with respect to a proceeding within its scope. The present proceeding, however, is not brought under the second paragraph of \u00a7 5. The third paragraph thereof, however, provides in somewhat more general terms that the \u201csupreme judicial court shall also have jurisdiction, upon application of the commission, to enforce all valid orders of the commission and the provisions of this chapter and of chapter one hundred and fifty-nine.\u201d The jurisdiction thus conferred is not in terms limited to jurisdiction \u201cin equity\u201d and we think that no such limitation can be implied from the fact that the jurisdiction conferred by the previous paragraph is so limited. We are confirmed in this opinion by the fact that prior to the codification of the statutes in General Laws a sentence closely similar to this third paragraph was the first sentence of St. 1913, c. 784, \u00a7 28, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>remainder of which section, substantially unchanged, became G. L. c. 159, \u00a7 40, hereinafter considered, referring expressly to proceedings \u201ceither by mandamus or injunction.\u201d This sentence was omitted from G. L. c. 159, \u00a7 40, in the codification \u201cas being covered by 1919, 350, \u00a7 121,\u201d according to a statement by the Joint Special Committee on Consolidating and Arranging the General Laws. See Report of Committee, page 1446. Said \u00a7 121 was codified as G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, and included in substance what is now the third paragraph of said \u00a7 5. This paragraph, therefore, does not, of itself, preclude a proceeding by mandamus in an appropriate case falling within its scope. Whether the present proceeding would fall within the scope of this paragraph if the paragraph stood alone is not wholly clear. The paragraph applies in terms to the provisions of c. 25 and c. 159, and not to the provisions of c. 160, in which is included the section (\u00a7 128) upon which the petitioners rely in this case. The paragraph, however, in terms applies also to \u201call valid orders of the commission\u201d and there may be a question whether the orders to which it applies are impliedly restricted to those made under the provisions of the chapters specifically mentioned. For reasons which will later appear this question need not be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-3\">We think, however, that, if the petitioners are entitled to relief such as is sought by this petition, the Supreme Judicial Court has jurisdiction in equity under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 160, \u00a7 252, to grant such relief. This section reads as follows: \u201cThe supreme judicial court shall have jurisdiction in equity on petition of the attorney general, of the railroad corporation, of any public body or of any other party interested to compel the observance of and to restrain the violation of all laws which govern railroad corporations and of all orders, rules and regulations made in accordance with the provisions of this chapter by any public body or by the department and to review, annul, modify or amend the rulings of any state department relative to such corporations as law and justice may require. The superior court shall have such jurisdiction concurrent with the supreme judicial court to enforce the provisions of sections forty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>eight, one hundred and ninety-three and two hundred and six.\u201d This section first appeared, in anything like its present form, in the General Laws when the laws were codified. The Joint Special Committee on Consolidating and Arranging the General Laws explains in its report (page 1494), referring to the proposed chapter 160, that the \u201cvarious provisions as to enforcement of this chapter have been combined in \u00a7 252.\u201d Examination of statutory provisions codified in said c. 160, discloses that in many instances each of them included or was accompanied by a specific provision for its enforcement \u2014 in nearly every instance a provision for enforcement in equity, though in one instance the nature of the proceeding for enforcement was not described (St. 1906, c. 463, Part II, \u00a7 160) and in two other instances provision was made for enforcement \u201cby injunction, mandamus or other suitable process.\u201d St. 1906, c. 463, Part II, \u00a7\u00a7 189, 197. Indeed, there was a specific provision, somewhat limited in scope, for enforcement in equity of what is now G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 160, \u00a7 128 (see St. 1906, Part II, c. 463, \u00a7 137, as amended by St. 1922, c. 116) \u2014 the section upon which the petitioners rely. These specific provisions for enforcement of particular statutes now codified in said c. 160 were expressly repealed by G. L. c. 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\">There can be no doubt that the petitioners in the present case constitute a \u201cpublic body\u201d authorized to bring a petition under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 160, \u00a7 252, and that the petition in this case, according to the allegations thereof, if brought in equity would be within the terms of that section authorizing a petition \u201cto compel the observance of\u201d or \u201cto restrain the violation of\u201d a law \u201cwhich govern[s(] railroad corporations\u201d or an order made by the department of public utilities \"in accordance with the provisions of\u201d said c. 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">The jurisdiction of the Supreme Judicial Court under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 160, \u00a7 252, of proceedings for the enforcement of said c. 160 and orders, rules and regulations made in accordance therewith is in terms limited to \u201cjurisdiction in equity.\u201d Apart from the jurisdiction \u201cto review, annul, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>modify or amend the rulings of any state department relative to\u201d railroad corporations \u2014 which is not here involved \u2014 the jurisdiction conferred, according to the express words of the section, not only extends to granting relief against affirmative action, namely, \"to restrain the violation of . . . laws which govern railroad corporations\u201d and \"orders, rules and regulations made in accordance with the provisions of this chapter by any public body or by the department [of public utilities],\u201d but also extends to granting relief against negative conduct, or inaction, namely, \u201cto compel the observance\u201d of such laws, orders, rules and regulations. This language, though limited in its application to cases in which railroad corporations are involved, in other respects is very broad and clearly embraces a proceeding for relief such as is sought by the present petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\">Moreover, there is nothing in the nature of jurisdiction in equity precluding its exercise under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 160, \u00a7 252, to the full extent therein described. Relief by restraining affirmative action ordinarily is given in equity by preventive injunction. But relief against inaction by compelling performance of a public or <em>quasi </em>public duty imposed by statute or by valid order of a public officer or board ordinarily is given at law by a writ of mandamus. <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Malden &amp; Melrose Gas Light Co. </em>199 Mass. 324, 326. In general the \"functions of an injunction are to restrain motion and to enforce inaction, those of a mandamus to set in motion and to compel action. . . . The former preserves matters <em>in statu </em>quo, while the very object of the latter is to change the status of affairs and to substitute action for inactivity.\u201d High on Extraordinary Legal Remedies (3d ed.) 10. Nevertheless, an order compelling affirmative action is not necessarily outside the field of equity. In some circumstances, even apart from statutory provision therefor, relief having this effect may be given by a mandatory injunction. See <em>Codman </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>201 Mass. 361, 369. See also <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, </em>246 Mass. 292, 299. And when, as here, jurisdiction in equity to give relief through compelling affirmative action is expressly conferred by statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>the exercise of such jurisdiction is not limited to the usual situation in which, apart from statute, a mandatory injunction may be issued, that is, where \u201cthe defendant is guilty of a continuing wrong upon the plaintiff, from the further perpetration of which he ought to be enjoined, and where the termination of the wrongful conduct involves a restoration of conditions existing before the wrongful conduct began.\u201d <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Malden &amp; Melrose Gas Light Co. </em>199 Mass. 324, 326. The language of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 160, \u00a7 252, imports no such limitation. Yet much \u2014 if not all \u2014 of the relief sought by the petitioners would fall within the scope of a mandatory injunction as so limited. See <em>Western Union Telegraph Co. </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>224 Mass. 365, 366, 378 (reversed on the merits, 247 U. S. 105), for a case where, upon petition of the public service commission \u2022\u2014 a predecessor of the department of public utilities, St. 1919, c. 350, \u00a7 117 \u2014 it was held that a mandatory injunction should issue to compel compliance of an affirmative nature with an order of the commission. And see <em>Public Service Commissioners </em>v. <em>New England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. </em>232 Mass. 465, where a like petition for a-mandatory injunction was dismissed on the merits, without discussion of the question of jurisdiction. See also <em>Selectmen of Gardner </em>v. <em>Templeton Street Railway, </em>184 Mass. 294; <em>Selectmen of Clinton </em>v. Worcester <em>Consolidated Street Railway, </em>199 Mass. 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-3\">A proceeding in equity to obtain the relief sought by this petition, therefore, could be brought in the Supreme Judicial Court unless relief by such a proceeding is precluded for the reason that an adequate and effective remedy at law by mandamus is available to the petitioners. See <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Malden &amp; Melrose Gas Light Co. </em>199 Mass. 324, 326. See also <em>Selectmen of Gardner </em>v. <em>Templeton Street Railway, </em>184 Mass. 294, 298. It is not contended by the petitioners that the remedy in equity under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 160, \u00a7 252, if available to them, would not be adequate and effective. Consequently, the question for determination is whether the remedy by mandamus that the petitioners seek by the present petition is the exclusive remedy available to them or,.at least, a concurrent remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>The Supreme Judicial Court has a general jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 211, \u00a7 3; c. 249, \u00a7 5. And, as already pointed out, the third paragraph of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 25, \u00a7 5, in view of the existence of this general jurisdiction, is broad enough to confer jurisdiction in mandamus \u2014 though such jurisdiction is not specifically mentioned \u2014 in cases within the scope of that paragraph. But if it is assumed that the grant by this paragraph of jurisdiction to \"enforce all valid orders of the commission\u201d is to be interpreted literally as embracing all valid orders of the commission, including those made under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 160, and not as limited to orders made under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 25, or c. 159, the paragraph is much more general in its terms than is G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 160, \u00a7 252, notwithstanding the comparison made in <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad </em>v. <em>New York Central </em>Railroad, 256 Mass. 600, 618, already referred to, between the second paragraph of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 25, \u00a7 5, conferring the power of review, and the much less detailed provision of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 160, \u00a7 252, conferring a like power.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-3\">The petitioners, however, rely upon the provisions of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 159, \u00a7 40, as conferring upon the Supreme Judicial Court jurisdiction of the present petition for mandamus. This section is included in the chapter entitled \"common carriers\u201d and relates to common carriers generally, including, but not limited to, railroads. This section reads as follows: \"Whenever the department is of opinion that a common carrier subject to its supervision is failing or omitting or about to fail or omit to do anything required of it by law or by order of the department, or is doing anything or about to do anything or permitting anything or about to permit anything to be done, contrary to or in violation of the law or of any order of the department, it shall direct its counsel to begin, subject to the supervision of the attorney general, an action or proceeding in the supreme judicial court in the name of the department for the purpose of having such violations or threatened violations stopped and prevented either by mandamus or injunction.\u201d This section imposes a duty upon the department of public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>utilities with respect to bringing \u201can action or proceeding in the supreme judicial court\u201d to accomplish certain purposes \u201cby mandamus or injunction.\u201d The section, however, does not purport to confer on that court any jurisdiction which it did not otherwise have, but rather to direct the department to resort to some jurisdiction otherwise conferred, unless, at least, as is not true in the present case, there is no jurisdiction otherwise conferred within which an adequate and effective remedy is available. And the reference to proceedings \u201ceither by mandamus or injunction\u201d imports merely that the department shall proceed in the manner appropriate to obtain the relief sought, as determined by legal principles otherwise stated or established. It is true that \u00a7 40, as it stood in St. 1913, c. 784, \u00a7 28, prior to the codification of the statutes in the General Laws, contained a provision relating to jurisdiction, reading as follows: \u201cThe supreme judicial court shall have jurisdiction upon the application of the commission to enforce all valid orders of the commission and all the provisions of this act.\u201d But this provision was codified as the third paragraph of G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, hereinbefore discussed, and must be dealt with as it appears there. For this reason \u2014 if not for others \u2014 the petitioners cannot rely upon G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 159, \u00a7 40, as enabling them to maintain this petition for mandamus instead of proceeding in equity for the relief sought. Nothing said in <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad </em>v. <em>Deister, </em>253 Mass. 178, 182, is inconsistent with the conclusion here reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-3\">As between the general jurisdiction of the Supreme Judicial Court to issue writs of mandamus and the jurisdiction in equity conferred upon that court by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 160, \u00a7 252, it is clear that \u00a7 252 provides a special statutory remedy. Moreover, if the third paragraph of G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 25, \u00a7 5, were to be construed as broad enough to confer jurisdiction to enforce all valid orders of the department, including orders made under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 160, we think that, as between that paragraph so construed and G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 160, \u00a7 252, said \u00a7 252 must be regarded as providing a special statutory remedy. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>section is more narrowly restricted with respect to the kind of proceedings, whether legal or equitable, that may be taken thereunder, and with respect to the orders of the department that may be enforced thereby, and more specific with respect to the nature of the relief that may be afforded. Consequently, under the principle stated in <em>Selectmen of Gardner </em>v. <em>Templeton Street Railway, </em>184 Mass. 294, 298, since a special statutory remedy in equity that is adequate and effective is available to the petitioners it is their exclusive remedy, and the present petition for mandamus cannot be maintained. See also <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>180 Mass. 547; <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>197 Mass. 194, 199; <em>County Commissioners of Essex </em>v. <em>Mayor of Newburyport, </em>252 Mass. 407, 410; <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad </em>v. <em>New York Central Railroad, </em>256 Mass. 600, 618; <em>Godfrey </em>v. <em>Building Commissioner of Boston, </em>263 Mass. 589, 593; <em>Tuckerman </em>v. <em>Moynihan, </em>282 Mass. 562, 569. <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Malden &amp; Melrose Gas Light Co. </em>199 Mass. 324, 326, relied on by the petitioners, is not an authority to the contrary. In that case relief in equity was denied to the plaintiffs, but no special statutory remedy in equity was available, as in the present case, and the plaintiff\u2019s, remedy at law by mandamus was perfect.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-3\">It follows that, in accordance with the terms of the report, \u201cthe petitioners are to be given the right to apply for an appropriate amendment before the single justice,\u201d and the case is remanded to the county court for that purpose and for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
