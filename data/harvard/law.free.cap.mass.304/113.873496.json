No person was permitted to \u201cset up and use\u201d or to \u201cdrive or have charge of\u201d such a vehicle, without a license from the police commissioner. St. 1930, c. 392, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, 4. St. 1934, c. 280. The petitioner was both the owner, and the \u201cdriver\u201d or operator, of a taxicab, and was duly licensed in both capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">The statute provided for both \u201cpublic\u201d and \u201cspecial\u201d hackney stands on public ways. A \u201cpublic\u201d stand was open to all \u201chackney carriages\u201d not assigned special hackney stands. St. 1930, c. 392, \u00a7 8. A \u201cspecial\u201d stand had to be \u201cabutting . . . [a] hotel, station, pier or [public or semi-publicj building,\u201d the owner, lessee or official representative of which had requested the establishment of such a stand, and had to be assigned by the police commissioner to a particular licensee or particular licensees. \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The police commissioner was given \u201cexclusive authority to make rules and orders for the regulation of hackney carriages and hackney stands, . . . within the limits of said city, with penalties for the violation thereof not exceeding twenty dollars for each offence.\u201d \u00a7 1. The rules (1936) \u00a7 11 provided that special stands \u201cshall not be occupied by any vehicle other than a hackney carriage licensed therefor.\u201d By \u00a7 25 of the rules, \u201cAny person or corporation violating any of the provisions of the foregoing sections shall forfeit and pay a fine not exceeding twenty dollars for each offense; and any licensed owner or driver who violates any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>provisions of the foregoing sections shall, in addition to said penalty, thereupon become liable to suspension or forfeiture of his license, and may be disqualified to hold a license thereafter.\u201d See also St. 1909, c. 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\">In June, 1937, the petitioner, who had no special stand, violated the rules by trespassing upon a special stand of the Checker Taxi Company at the South Station. From a suspension of his license for five days for that offence, he appealed to the police commissioner. The latter, after hearing, ordered on July 1, 1937, \u201cthat the suspension was proper; it shall stand as a matter of record in this department; and that no further action be taken in this case.\u201d The petitioner, contending that the record would injure him in his dealings with the police department, brought this petition for a writ of certiorari to quash the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">This case involves no question as to the right to establish a taxicab stand or parking space on a public way against the will of an abutting owner. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>297 Mass. 559. The question relates solely to the right of the Commonwealth as against persons engaged in the taxicab business to establish a taxicab stand to which certain taxicabs are admitted and from which others are excluded. The system of special stands is assailed as denying \u201cthe equal protection of the laws\u201d in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, and as contravening certain provisions of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights which have been declared to \u201c contain ample guaranties for equal protection of equal laws without discrimination or favor based upon unreasonable distinctions.\u201d <em>Brest </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Insurance, </em>270 Mass. 7, 14. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Transportation Co. </em>282 Mass. 345, 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The business of operating taxicabs is plainly subject to regulation in the public interest. <em>Morley </em>v. <em>Police Commissioner of Boston, </em>261 Mass. 269, 276. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>261 Mass. 340. <em>Rafferty </em>v. <em>Police Commissioner of Boston, </em>259 Mass. 145. <em>Burrell </em>v. <em>Checker Taxi Co. </em>287 Mass. 108. The establishment of special taxi stands, adjoining railroad stations and other properties to which a reliable service of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>taxicabs is a necessity, for the public as well as for the proprietor, is not unreasonably discriminatory. The Legislature might find that by reserving such a stand for the exclusive use of the taxicab owner selected by the proprietor of the abutting premises, a constant supply of taxicabs would be maintained and the public would be well served. The Legislature might find that the opening of all taxicab stands to all taxicabs would result at a particular stand in an excessive supply at some times and a dearth at others, as the drivers would seek the part of the city that at the moment might hold out the greatest promise of business. Such a finding might or might not be correct. The opposite conclusion might be equally reasonable. But the question was one for the Legislature to decide. Moreover, as was said in <em>Morley </em>v. <em>Police Commissioner of Boston, </em>261 Mass. 269, 277, \u201cThis method of controlling and distributing the taxicab business may have a tendency to prevent congestion in street traffic at certain points, and if the licensees conduct their business from stands assigned, the police have a better opportunity to learn whether the conveyances are used for illegal purposes and whether the conditions of the licenses are being observed. The designation of stands and the requirement that licensees maintain service at them are justified for reasons based on the public welfare and convenience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\">The question whether the establishment of special stands was in the public interest, was a legislative one, and the statute in our opinion was a valid exercise of the police power. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>122 Mass. 60. <em>State </em>v. <em>Muolo, </em>119 Conn. 323. <em>McFall </em>v. <em>St. Louis, </em>232 Mo. 716. <em>Mader </em>v. <em>Topeka, </em>106 Kans. 867. <em>Ritchhart </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>193 Iowa, 271. <em>Long\u2019s Baggage Transfer Co. </em>v. <em>Burford, </em>144 Va. 339. <em>City Cab, Carriage &amp; Transfer Co. </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>73 Wash. 24. <em>People </em>v. <em>Galena, </em>24 Cal. App. (2d) 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b156-9\"> Special taxicab stands on public highways were abolished by St. 1.938, c. 508, in cities and towns accepting the provisions of the act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
