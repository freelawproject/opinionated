No point was made at the argument of the failure to state the time of the alleged injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">The employee had worked for twenty-eight years in his employer\u2019s dye house, always at dyeing and bleaching. According to his testimony, he \u201cgot sore hands\u201d on January 19, 1936. He showed his hands and explained his condition to his boss who took him to the superintendent, and the latter took him to the hospital where he was seen by Dr. Durstoff. Except for brief intervals, the employee continued to work for the same employer until November 10, 1937, although, as hereinafter appears, his work was changed to that of sweeping. The single member found that the employee\u2019s condition was causally related to his employment; that because of his work in the dye house and his coming in contact with dyes and chemicals, he sustained a dermatitis of his hands on January 19, 1936; that since November 10, 1937, he has been suffering from a dermatitis of the hands as a result of which he has been totally disabled for work. Compensation was awarded on the basis of total disability from November 10, 1937. The reviewing board affirmed and adopted the findings and the decision of the single mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>ber and found further that the employer, under date of January 10, 1936, made a report of facts under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 19, of a personal injury to the employee, describing the occurrence of said injury as,.\"This man\u2019s arms became irritated from using dyes,\u201d stating that the nature of the injury was \"skin irritation,\u201d and that the employee became disabled on January 10, 1936. The board further found that the employer, through a superintendent, arranged for treatment of the employee\u2019s condition by Dr. Durstoff, \u201cphysician of the employer or insurer at the onset of the condition, January 10, 1936\u201d; that the employee, having been supplied work of a nature that did not further expose him to the danger of skin affection or disablement, had reasonable cause for not filing his claim sooner than November 26, 1937; that neither the employer nor the insurer was prejudiced by the employee\u2019s failure' to. file claim within the statutory period, and that the employee throughout sought and obtained the medical treatment that he expected would diagnose and cure his condition. The insurer appealed from the final decree that was entered awarding compensation for total disability and costs, and makes three contentions: (1) that the proceedings for compensation were barred by the employee's failure to file his claim for compensation for injury in the form and within the time prescribed by statute; (2) that it could not be found that the employee\u2019s condition on November 10, 1937, or at the time of the hearings in 1938, was causally related to his employment with the subscriber on \"November 10, 1936 [7?], or at any time prior to June, 1936, when this insurer went off the risk\u201d; and (3) that a finding was not warranted that the employee had been totally incapacitated for work, regardless of the date or cause of his injury, subsequently to November 10, 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">1. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 41, among other things, contains a provision that no proceedings for compensation for injury to an employee shall be maintained \"unless the claim for compensation with respect to such injury has been made within six months after its occurrence.\u201d Section 49 of said chapter, among other things, provides that failure to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>a claim within the time fixed by \u00a7 41 shall not bar proceedings under said c. 152 if it is found that \u201cit was occasioned by mistake or other reasonable cause, or if it is found that the insurer was not prejudiced by the delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">It could have been found that the insurer was not prejudiced by the delay in filing the claim. The burden of proof in this particular was on the employee, <em>Booth\u2019s Case, </em>289 Mass. 322, 325, but the burden is sustained if he introduces evidence from which a reasonable inference can be drawn that the insurer suffered no prejudice. <em>Zabec\u2019s Case, </em>302 Mass. 465, 469, and cases cited. Whether the burden was sustained in the case at bar, and commonly, is a question of fact, <em>McGowan\u2019s Case, </em>288 Mass. 441, 444, and the inquiry here is whether there was evidence to support the findings of the board. <em>Zabec\u2019s Case, </em>302 Mass. 465. There was evidence that Dr. Durstoff \u201chas been physician for the Waterhead Mills [employer] for the insurer\u201d; that he saw the employee at the Lowell General Hospital on January 10, 1936; and that he submitted a report to the insurer \u201con January 1936,\u201d where, in answer to the question, \u201cState in the employee\u2019s own words, where and how the accident happened,\u201d he gave the answer, \u201cFollowing the use of dyestuffs.\u201d The doctor \u201ckept the employee under treatment from January 10, 1936 until February 15, 1937.\u201d . It is true that he testified that when he first saw the employee he had an acute dermatitis on his forearms, and that he did not recall that it was on his hands at that time, but he also testified that the employee came to him for treatment on January 28, 1937, with his hands broken out \u201cagain.\u201d Furthermore, it could be found that Dr. Durstoff directed the employee to wear gloves that \"were furnished to him by the employer, and that as a result of the doctor\u2019s treatment and recommendations, the employee was taken from his work with dyestuffs and given a sweeping job. The employer\u2019s record disclosed that the employee started on the sweeping job on February 5, 1936. Furthermore, there was evidence that after about one month of treatment, Dr. Durstoff \u201cwould come to the shop to treat\u201d the employee; that the nurse there treated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>him; that he procured medicine from the first aid department of the employer; and that the doctor took over the first aid department in the last of April, 1936. A finding was warranted that the employer knew of the employee\u2019s condition in January, 1936. The finding of the board on the question of want of prejudice cannot be disturbed. <em>Tingus\u2019s </em>Case, 273 Mass. 453, 455. <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>279 Mass. 481, 485. <em>Wnukowski\u2019s Case, </em>296 Mass. 63, 66. See <em>Kangas\u2019s Case, </em>282 Mass. 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">This being so, it is unnecessary to consider whether the failure to file the claim within the statutory period was occasioned by mistake or other reasonable cause. The provisions of said \u00a7 49 are in the alternative. <em>Zabec\u2019s Case, </em>302 Mass. 465, 469, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">2. It could have been found that the employee\u2019s condition on November 10, 1937, or at the time of the hearings in 1938, was causally related to his employment in January, 1936, or, in any event, prior to June, 1936, when, it appears, the insurer in question \u201cwent off the risk.\u201d The insurer does not question that industrial dermatitis, so called, induced by the necessary exposure of employment, falls within a recognized class of personal injuries. <em>Panagotopulos\u2019s Case, </em>276 Mass. 600, 604, and cases cited. <em>Robinson\u2019s Case, </em>299 Mass. 499. The employee testified that his hands never got better between January, 1936, and the date of the hearing, which was in May, 1938. There was evidence that before May, 1936, and from then until into August, 1937, the employee\u2019s hands were dressed with \u201crags.\u201d Although there was evidence that there was a recurrence of the employee\u2019s condition, it could have been found that the original condition of dermatitis did not entirely disappear, and that the subsequent exposure in the use of water for washing that was a part of his sweeping job did not result in a distinct injury that constituted an independent, intervening cause for his incapacity. <em>Wentworth\u2019s Case, </em>284 Mass. 479, 484. <em>Evans\u2019s Case, </em>299 Mass. 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">3. The burden rested upon the employee of showing by a preponderance of the evidence the nature and extent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>his incapacity. <em>Ginley\u2019s Case, </em>244 Mass. 346, 348. He did not sustain the burden of showing total incapacity. He stopped work about November 10, 1937, when he was \u201claid off.\u201d Up to that time he had been working regularly, and if he had not been laid off, would have kept on. He has not looked for work anywhere since he got through. When asked if he felt that he had been able to work since November, 1937, he replied, \u201cThat is entirely up to the doctor.\u201d The medical testimony was that he would be able to do some work, especially where he could protect his hands and keep away from any irritating substances. An analysis of the testimony of his own physician, who first saw him on December 21, 1937, shows also that the employee is able to do some work, \u201cAny other type of work except work where he comes in contact with these irritants.\u201d There is nothing to indicate any unsuccessful attempts upon the part of the employee to secure employment after his discharge. See <em>Driscoll\u2019s Case, </em>243 Mass. 236, 239; <em>Dow\u2019s Case, </em>252 Mass. 191, 192-193; <em>Fennell\u2019s Case, </em>289 Mass 89, 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-3\">There was evidence, however, of partial disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">The decree of the Superior Court is reversed, and a decree is to be entered remanding the case to the Industrial Accident Board for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. See <em>Capone\u2019s Case, </em>239 Mass. 331; <em>Coakley\u2019s Case, </em>284 Mass. 559, 562; <em>Crowley\u2019s Case, </em>287 Mass. 367, 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
