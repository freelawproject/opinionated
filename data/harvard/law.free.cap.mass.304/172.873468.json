There was a finding for the plaintiff and the Appellate Division ordered the report dismissed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>The defendant\u2019s appeal is based upon the refusal of the judge to grant a request that \u201cUpon all the evidence, the defendant is not liable,\u201d and a second request that the defendant was not liable for any damage caused by the independent contractor if she used reasonable care in his selection. The denial of the first request was right. It had no standing in the District Court. The judge was not required to consider it. Rule 27 of the District Courts (1932). <em>Duralith Corp. </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>274 Mass. 397. <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>291 Mass. 100. <em>McKenna </em>v. <em>Andreassi, </em>292 Mass. 213. The judge, however, did consider it, but .there was no error in refusing to give it since the evidence, for reasons hereafter stated, presented a question of fact upon the issue of the defendant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The spraying of a poisonous substance in the immediate vicinity of or practically over a crop of vegetables intended for human consumption was the performance of work of such a character that damage would necessarily result to the owner of the vegetables unless reasonable precautions were taken to avert such damage. Here the judge could find that no adequate measures were adopted to protect the plaintiff\u2019s property from being sprinkled with the poison, and that the defendant, unmindful of the plaintiff\u2019s protest, ordered the work to be done and witnessed its performance. Care in the selection of an independent contractor in these circumstances is not a defence. <em>Boucher </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>196 Mass. 355. <em>Nugent </em>v. <em>Boston Consolidated Gas Co. </em>238 Mass. 221. <em>Levesque </em>v. <em>Hildreth &amp; Rogers Co. </em>276 Mass. 429. <em>McConnon </em>v. <em>Charles H.
