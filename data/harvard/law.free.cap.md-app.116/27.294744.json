Dillman appealed to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, and on October 31, 1995, the court reversed the decision of the ALJ. The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH or Department) appeals from the lower court\u2019s decision and presents two questions for our review, which are restated below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-15\">I. Is private residential placement \u201cavailable,\u201d within the meaning of Md.Code (1994 Repl.Vol., 1996 Supp.), \u00a7 7-503(e)(l)(iii) of the Health-Gen. Art. (H.G.), when a private contractor proposes to create such a placement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>but the State has exhausted funds allocated for such a placement and has not agreed to fund the proposal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-4\">II. Did the trial court violate the standard of review for an administrative decision under Md.Code (1995 Repl.Vol\u201e 1996 Supp.), \u00a7 10-222 of the State Gov\u2019t Art. (S.G.) by not accepting the ALJ\u2019s finding that a proposed private residential placement was not \u201cless restrictive\u201d than placement at a State residential center?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">William Dillman is fifty-three years old and diagnosed with moderate mental retardation and paranoid personality disorder with anti-social traits. Dillman was admitted to Rosewood Center (Rosewood), a State residential center for individuals with developmental disabilities, on March 9, 1978. Dillman was admitted to Rosewood from the Prince George\u2019s County Detention Center where he was incarcerated for a criminal offense which occurred in June 1977. Subsequently, the criminal charges were dropped, and in May 1979, Dillman was placed in the community under the supervision of the Baltimore Association for Retarded Citizens (BARC). On April 10, 1980, Dillman was returned to Rosewood by Order of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City because of an alleged criminal offense which occurred in March 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">On May 9, 1992, Dillman was placed in another community residential placement program under the direction of Jesse Grim. On September 17, 1992, Dillman was arrested and charged with second and fourth degree sex offenses. As a result, Dillman was returned to Rosewood. The District Court of Maryland for Baltimore City found Dillman incompetent to stand trial and committed him to Rosewood pursuant to H.G. \u00a7 12-105(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The criminal charges were dismissed on July 25,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>On October 24, 1994, a hearing was held, pursuant to H.G. \u00a7 7-503(a), to determine whether Dillman met the criteria for continued confinement at Rosewood. The ALJ made several findings of fact including that the Rosewood treatment team consistently stated that Dillman requires residential services to maintain and acquire life skills. The findings also stated that Dillman \u201cis independent in areas of domestic tasks and self care, is self aware and expresses appropriate emotional responses.\u201d Dillman, accompanied by a Rosewood staff member, is employed by BARG three to five days a week planting bulbs and shrubs and cutting grass. The ALJ found that Dillman requires assistance with budgeting and does not fully understand the value of money. The treatment team at Rosewood noted that Dillman \u201cfunctions best in a highly structured environment where routines are clearly outlined.\u201d The ALJ also found that the intervention team\u2019s annual report, among other recommendations, stated that Dillman should receive twenty-four-hour close supervision, line-of-sight supervision when in the community, and a staff trained in the management of disruptive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">In September 1993, interdisciplinary and forensic teams at Rosewood recommended that Dillman be released to Other Options Inc., a community based residential placement program. The team noted that \u201c[w]hen Mr, Dillman has a structured program and appropriate supervision, he presents little to no problems____Other Options Inc. is prepared to provide services to Dillman if funding is approved. In addition, Joseph Matthew from The Center for Social Change, another residential community based program, met with Dill-man and stated that The Center for Social Change is prepared to place Dillman in community placement with services recommended by the team if funding is provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>In 1994, the Developmental Disabilities Administration (DDA)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was allocated funds for the institutional downsizing of Rosewood by providing individuals with needed services in community placements. The funding allowed for community placement of ten individuals for 1994. Dillman was not included among those ten individuals and there are no funds from that budget allocation for additional placements. The DDA Central Maryland Regional Office was also allocated approximately two million dollars for placement of clients in the community to avoid admission into an institution. These funds, however, are only for persons brought to Rosewood as a temporary option while DDA arranges community placement. DDA does not consider Dillman a community client. There are funds currently available in the budget for these emergency placements, but, as the ALJ concluded, it is within the discretion of the DDA whether to use these funds for community placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">On March 14,1995, the ALJ certified Dillman\u2019s admission to Rosewood. The ALJ concluded that Dillman was mentally retarded within the meaning of H.G. \u00a7 7-503(e)(l)(i) and needed residential care and treatment within the meaning of H.G. \u00a7 7-503(e)(l)(ii). The ALJ also concluded that there was no less restrictive setting in which Dillman\u2019s needs could be met that was available pursuant to H.G. \u00a7 7-503(e)(l)(iii) because there were no available funds for Dillman\u2019s private placement. The ALJ stated \u201cthe fact that Other Options and the Center for Social Change are willing to accept the Appellant, does not make the placements available.\u201d In addition, the ALJ concluded that Dillman would receive the same services in the community programs that he would receive at Rosewood, and thus community placement was not \u201cless restrictive.\u201d Dillman appealed from the ALJ\u2019s order to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The court found that the DDA did not show by clear and convincing evidence that there was not a less restrictive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>setting in which the needed services could be provided that was available pursuant to H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7-503(e)(l)(iii). The court held that \u201ca lack of funding is an inappropriate measure of availability for community placement.\u201d The court stated the legislative intent of H.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7-502 and 7-503 is \u201cnot to deprive individuals of their constitutional right to liberty by placing individuals with developmental disabilities in a restrictive setting.\u201d With regard to a \u201cless restrictive placement,\u201d the court found that DDA relied solely on its financial ability and did not \u201cadequately argue that there was no less restrictive setting in which to place appellant.\u201d On October 31, 1995, the court, finding error of law and that DDA had not shown by clear and convincing evidence that no less restrictive setting was available, reversed the decision of the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">According to H.G. \u00a7 7-503(e)(l)(iii), in order to certify Dillman for admission to a State residential center, DHMH must show by clear and convincing evidence that there is \u201cno less restrictive setting in which the needed services can be provided that is available to the individual or will be available to the individual within a reasonable time after the hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, in order to not certify an individual to a State residential center, the ALJ must find that both an individual\u2019s needs can be met in a less restrictive setting, and that a less restrictive setting is available. We address each criteria below.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">\"\u2018Judicial review of agency fact[-]finding is narrow in scope and requires the exercise of a restrained and disciplined judicial judgment.\u201d <em>Liberty Nursing Ctr., Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number><em>Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>330 Md. 433, 442, 624 A.2d 941 (1993). When the agency\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence, \u201cin the form either of direct proof or permissible inference, in the record before the agency, an appellate court may not substitute its judgment, even on the question of the appropriate inference to be drawn from the evidence, for that of the agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 443, 624 A.2d 941. Whten, however, the decision of the AL J involves a question of law, ordinarily no deference is appropriate and the reviewing court may substitute its judgment for the agency\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>In the case at bar, the first issue raised by appellant, the interpretation of \u201cavailable\u201d within the meaning of H.G. \u00a7 7-503(e)(l)(iii), is an issue of law which we review <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">The Department argues that a less restrictive placement is not \u201cavailable\u201d if the price of the placement is unknown and there are no funds allocated to pay for the placement. H.G. \u00a7 7-502(b) prohibits the Secretary of DHMH from admitting an individual to a State residential center if there is a less restrictive setting available in which the needed services can be provided. H.G. \u00a7 7-503 provides that, within twenty-one days after admission of an individual to a State residential center, an ALJ shall conduct a hearing using the criteria set out in H.G. \u00a7 7-5Q3(e)(l)(iii). H.G. \u00a7 7-503(e)(l) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\"><em>Findings supporting </em>admission.\u2014(1) At the hearing, in order to certify the admission of the individual, it must be affirmatively shown by clear and convincing evidence that the conclusions leading to the decision to admit the individual are supported by the following findings:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">(i) The individual has mental retardation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">(ii) The individual needs residential services for the individual\u2019s adequate habilitation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">(in) There is no less restrictive setting in which the needed services can be provided that is available to the individual or will be available to the individual within a reasonable time after the hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>H.G. \u00a7 7-503(e)(l). Neither the statute nor the regulations define the term \u201cavailable\u201d; thus, to determine the legislature\u2019s intended meaning we must ascertain the legislative purpose of the statute. <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Shrader, </em>324 Md. 454, 462, 597 A.2d 939 (1991). To interpret the purpose of H.G. \u00a7 7-503(e)(l)(iii) we look to the plain language of this section and the intent of the Maryland General Assembly in promulgating H.G. \u00a7 7-503(e)(l) in the context of the overall statutory scheme of Title 7 of the Health-General Article. <em>Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>324 Md. at 463, 597 A.2d 939 (\u201c[t]he legislative intent must be gleaned from the entire statute, rather than from only one part.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">The legislative policy of Title 7 is set forth in H.G. \u00a7 7-102 which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">(1) To promote, protect, and preserve the human dignity, constitutional rights and liberties, social well-being, and general welfare of individuals with developmental disability in this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">(2) To encourage the full development of the ability and potential of each individual with developmental disability in this State, no matter how severe the individual\u2019s disability;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">(3) To promote the economic security, standard of living, and meaningful employment of individuals with developmental disability;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">(4) To foster the integration of individuals with developmental disability into the ordinary life of the communities where these individuals live;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\">(5) To support and provide resources to operate community services to sustain individuals with developmental disability in the community, rather than in institutions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-10\">(6) To require the administration to designate sufficient resources to foster and strengthen a permanent comprehensive system of community programming for individuals with developmental disability as an alternative to institutional care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>(7) To recognize the right of those individuals with developmental disability who need residential services to live in surroundings as normal as possible and to provide adequate facilities for this purpose;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-4\">(8) To provide appropriate social and protective services for those individuals with developmental disability who are unable to manage their own affairs with ordinary prudence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">H.G. \u00a7 7-102. Title 7 must be construed in a manner consistent with this policy to encourage the integration of developmentally disabled individuals into community life and designate support and resources for community programs. H.G. \u00a7 7-103.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">After examining the policy and statutory scheme of Title 7, we hold that the term \u201cavailable\u201d within H.G. \u00a7 7-503(e)(l)(iii) means practically and actually available. That reading necessarily includes a financial or budgetary component and is consistent with the plain language of H.G. \u00a7 7-503(e) and with the overall statutory scheme of Title 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">In this case it is undisputed that appellee has mental retardation and requires residential services for adequate habilitation. H.G. \u00a7 7-503(e) focuses on the admission of an individual to a State residential center and the criteria that must be established in order for an ALJ to certify an individual for admission. The ALJ must decide (a) whether the services can be provided in a less restrictive setting <em>and </em>(b) whether that setting is available to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">We disagree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that determining whether a less restrictive setting is available does not include financial considerations. If we were to prohibit the ALJ and DDA from considering the availability of funding to pay for such a setting, we would be reducing the inquiry to a single part. If the ALJ could not consider financial factors when determining if a less restrictive setting is \u201cavailable,\u201d DDA would be unable to admit or retain an individual in a State residential facility as long as a private contractor is willing to provide the residential services needed without regard to cost. If there is no limit to the amount of money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>that a private contractor can charge for its services, it is difficult to conceive of a situation in which an individual could be admitted or retained in a State facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><em>Department of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Prince George\u2019s Co. Department of Social Services, </em>47 Md.App. 436, 423 A.2d 589 (1980) and <em>In Re Demetrius J., </em>321 Md. 468, 583 A.2d 258 (1991), support our interpretation of H.G. \u00a7 7-503(e)(l)(iii). In <em>Dep\u2019t of Health, </em>the trial court ordered that DHMH expend State funds for the private placement of a child adjudicated as a child in need of assistance (CINA). <em>Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>47 Md.App. at 438, 423 A.2d 589. On appeal, we held that, if the courts are permitted to instruct DHMH in this way, the State budget and financial structure will be undermined as well as the \u201clegislative intent to promote and provide mental health services with impartiality to all citizens of the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448, 423 A.2d 589. Similarly, in <em>Demetrius, </em>the Court considered the governmental obligations in juvenile cases between the Judiciary and the Executive Departments. <em>In Re Demetrius J., </em>321 Md. at 474, 583 A.2d 258. The Court held that, if it is proven that a child has committed a delinquent act, the court may commit the child to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Services (DJS), and may designate the type of facility where the child is to be accommodated. <em>Id. </em>at 475, 583 A.2d 258. The court, however, may not designate a specific facility; such designation is the prerogative of the DJS. <em>Id. </em>The Court went on to explain that it would not be possible for DJS to fulfill its functions if it could not control the appropriated funds. <em>Id. </em>at 474-75, 583 A.2d 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Appellee attempts to distinguish the instant case from <em>Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Plygiene </em>and <em>In Re Demetrius J. </em>by stating that the effect of the court\u2019s decision in the instant case is not for the AL J to instruct DDA to place appellee in any particular facility, but merely to determine that appellee cannot be retained in a State residential facility. In other words, if DDA determines that the less restrictive setting is not within its budgetary authority, DDA has the choice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>releasing appellee from the State facility.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellee fails to appreciate that the choice he leaves DDA is a Hobson\u2019s choice, particularly in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">With the exception of three short periods of time, appellee has resided at Rosewood since 1978. During each of these short releases from Rosewood, he was implicated in incidents of sexual misconduct, including criminal charges of sodomy with a four-year-old child. While the record is unclear regarding the details of the disposition of appellee\u2019s criminal charges, <em>all of the witnesses, including his own witnesses, agree that he requires twenty-four hour one-on-one supervision, including awake at night supervision in order not to pose a danger to others. </em>The legislature did not intend to leave DDA with the choice of exceeding its budgetary authority or releasing such an individual, unassisted, into society. Indeed, a review of the other sections of Title 7 convinces us that this is so.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">H.G. \u00a7 7-505 provides for the annual reevaluation of each individual with mental retardation who is admitted to a State residential center. If, upon reevaluation, the Secretary finds that an individual no longer meets the admission requirements, the Secretary must begin appropriate proceedings for the release or transfer of that individual. If the ALJ is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>permitted to take financial considerations into account, DDA will be required, upon annual reevaluation, to release or transfer each individual who comes forward with a private contractor who is willing to provide residential services within a less restrictive setting. DDA has a set budget for downsizing that cannot possibly accommodate wholesale transfers of individuals from State facilities. Indeed, appellee could not be accommodated through DDA\u2019s downsizing budget. Accordingly, if such financial constraints are not taken into account, DDA may potentially be required to release individuals, unassisted, who may then pose a danger to themselves or others.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">Further, an individual may petition for release at any time, and is entitled to a jury trial on his petition. H.G. \u00a7 7-507. In considering whether an individual should be released, the trier of fact must consider all of the admission requirements once again, including \u201c[wjhether there is a less restrictive setting in which the needed services can be provided that is available to the individual or will be available to the individual within a reasonable time.\u201d By permitting the ALJ to consider financial factors, DDA will not be forced to release or transfer individuals upon a showing that residential services can be provided in a less restrictive setting without regard to cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The legislative policy set forth in H.G. \u00a7 7-102 must be construed to promote and preserve the human dignity, constitutional rights and liberties, social well being, and general welfare of individuals with developmental disability, and to encourage the integration of the developmentally disabled into community life. The developmentally disabled are done a disservice when government directs that they be released unassisted into a society in which they are unprepared to live. Implicit in the legislature\u2019s policy is the encouragement of <em>successful </em>integration of the developmentally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Therefore, the legislature intended the term \u201cavailable\u201d within the meaning of H.G. \u00a7 7\u2014503(e)(1)(iii) and Title 7 to require a showing by clear and convincing evidence that an individual\u2019s needs cannot be met in a less restrictive setting that is practically and actually available. This interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>necessarily permits the ALJ to take financial considerations into account. In the instant case, the ALJ determined that no funds existed for appellee\u2019s community placement, and therefore, such placement was not \u201cavailable\u201d within the meaning of H.G. \u00a7 7-503(e)(l)(iii). We agree with the ALJ\u2019s decision and reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">We now turn to appellant\u2019s argument that the trial court violated the standard of review for an administrative decision under S.G. \u00a7 10-222 by not accepting the ALJ\u2019s finding that a proposed private residential placement was not \u201cless restrictive\u201d than placement at a State residential center. We hold that the trial court did not err because the ALJ did not make any findings with regard to whether there was a less restrictive setting in which Dillman could receive the services he needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\u201cJudicial review of administrative action differs from appellate review of a trial court judgment.\u201d <em>United Steelworkers of America, Local 2610 v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>298 Md. 665, 679, 472 A.2d 62 (1984). When an appellate court reviews the decision of a trial court it may affirm the judgment if there is any evidence in the record to support the lower court\u2019s judgment even if the reason was not relied on by the trial court. <em>Id. </em>On judicial review of an agency decision, however, the Court \u201cmay not uphold the agency order unless it is sustainable on the agency\u2019s findings and for the reasons stated by the agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although we agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the ALJ never reached the issue of whether the alternative <em>settings </em>were less restrictive than Rosewood, we believe that there was sufficient evidence upon which the ALJ could have made that finding.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>The ALJ in the instant case stated that \u201cthe record established the Appellant [Dillman] received services recommended by his treating professionals such as budgeting, recreational opportunities and employment and would continue to receive those same services, maintain the same employment and be subject to the same level of supervision while in the community, as at Rosewood.\u201d The ALJ concluded that the treatment team recommended the same services in the community as were being provided at the State residential center, and \u201cthere was no evidence those services are professionally unacceptable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">The ALJ, however, failed to make any findings as to whether the <em>setting </em>was less restrictive in the community placement than in the State residential center. Instead, the ALJ focused on the degree of services and stated that the services would be the same in both facilities. According to H.G. \u00a7 7-503(e)(l)(iii), the ALJ must determine whether it is possible for Dillman to receive the services recommended by the DDA in a setting that is less restrictive than a State residential center. There, however, is no need to remand the case on this issue because we reverse the circuit court\u2019s decision on the interpretation of the term \u201cavailable\u201d within H.G. \u00a7 7-503(e)(l)(iii) and agree with the ALJ\u2019s finding that the proposed private placement is not \u201cavailable.\u201d Thus, the alternative ground relied on by the ALJ, that there was not a \u201cless restrictive setting,\u201d is not dispositive of the issue presented to us on appeal. We reverse the circuit court\u2019s decision and thereby affirm the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Finally, DHMH filed a Motion To Strike Part Of Appellee\u2019s Brief And Appendix which cites and reprints an unreported opinion of the Circuit Court for Allegany County as persuasive authority. Opinions of the lower courts are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>binding on the Court of Appeals or this Court, and thus, we do not regard the circuit court opinion cited in Dillman\u2019s brief as persuasive authority. <em>Cfi </em>Md. Rule 8-114(a) (1996) (\u201can unreported opinion of the Court of Appeals or Court of Special Appeals is neither precedent within the rule of <em>stare decisis </em>nor persuasive authority\u201d). We therefore grant DHMH\u2019s motion to strike that portion of appellee\u2019s brief and appendix which cites the opinion of a circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-8\">.
