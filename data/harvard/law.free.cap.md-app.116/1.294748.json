(Retired, Specially Assigned).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b27-6\">MURPHY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">James Robinson (Appellant), an inmate in the State penal system, was serving a 60-year sentence for robbery-related offenses when he assaulted an officer at the Maryland House of Correction at Jessup on October 4, 1994. This latter misbehavior netted Appellant administrative sanctions: 400 days in segregation and the loss of 400 days\u2019 good conduct time. It also resulted in his criminal prosecution. An Anne Arundel County Circuit Court jury convicted Appellant of battery. On February 14, 1996, the court sentenced him to a term of 12 years consecutive to the time he was already serving.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">Appellant argues before us that the administrative action taken against him in the prison system was punishment within the contemplation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment and thus barred the subsequent criminal prosecution. At sentencing, Appellant told the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-9\">Your Honor, I would like to say that I\u2019ve been punished more than once for this offense. I was punished by the State and now I\u2019m being punished by the State once again. I was told, and I\u2019ve read that, you know, a person can\u2019t be prosecuted twice. I have been tried by the institution. I\u2019ve stood trial in here again by another portion of the State. And, I don\u2019t feel as though what\u2019s been done to me is justifiable. I\u2019m being punished more than once for an offense that occurred.... And, I would like to ask that you take that into consideration. The fact that I\u2019ve been punished more than once.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-10\">The trial court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-11\">You talk about having been punished once for this offense. I don\u2019t know of any law that says it\u2019s double jeopardy for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>the administrative team to exact some type of administrative sanction for what\u2019s happened in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment proclaims that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d This constitutional guarantee is made applicable to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Illinois v. Vitale, </em>447 U.S. 410, 415, 100 S.Ct. 2260, 2264, 65 L.Ed.2d 228 (1980), citing <em>Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Double Jeopardy Clause</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK\">protects against three distinct abuses: a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and multiple punishments for the same offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-6\"><em>United States v. Halper, </em>490 U.S. 435, 440, 109 S.Ct. 1892, 1897, 104 L.Ed.2d 487 (1989). We are concerned with the last of the three. <em>See Flaherty v. State, </em>322 Md. 356, 365, 587 A.2d 522 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">For support of his contention that 400 days in segregation and the loss of 400 days\u2019 good conduct time barred his being criminally punished, Appellant directs us to <em>Department of Revenue of Montana v. Kurth, </em>511 U.S. 767, 114 S.Ct. 1937, 128 L.Ed.2d 767 (1994). In <em>Kurth, </em>the Supreme Court held that the state could not tax illegal drugs at several times their market value after the defendants had been convicted for drug law violations, because the tax constituted an impermissible second punishment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-8\">This drug tax is not the kind of remedial sanction that may follow the first punishment of a criminal offense. Instead, it is a second punishment within the contemplation of a constitutional protection that has \u201cdeep roots in our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>history and jurisprudence,\u201d ... and therefore must be imposed during the first prosecution or not at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">511 U.S. at 784, 114 S.Ct. at 1948, citing <em>U.S. v. Halper, supra, </em>490 U.S. at 440, 109 S.Ct. at 1897.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Appellant also draws our attention to <em>State v. Jones, </em>340 Md. 235, 666 A.2d 128 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 1265, 134 L.Ed.2d 213 (1996), which he says stands for the proposition that an administrative sanction survives double jeopardy scrutiny if it \u201ccan fairly be justified solely by remedial purposes.... \u201d Appellant misinterprets <em>Jones </em>and the Supreme Court cases upon which <em>Jones </em>relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\"><em>Jones </em>involved a man prosecuted for driving while intoxicated even though an administrative law judge had already suspended his driver\u2019s license. In determining that a subsequent criminal prosecution was not barred by the administrative action, the Court of Appeals noted \u201cthat license suspensions generally serve remedial purposes.\u201d 340 Md. at 251, 666 A.2d 128. The Court further observed that the legislative history of the statute permitting license suspensions \u201cdemonstrates that <em>both punitive and remedial </em>purposes motivated the legislators in enacting the amendments that created [Maryland Code, Transportation Article (1977, 1992 RepLVoL, 1994 Cum.Supp.) ] \u00a7 16-205.1\u2019s administrative per se license suspension provisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 259, 666 A.2d 128 (emphasis added). Rejecting the double jeopardy argument raised by Jones, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-10\">In <em>Halper, </em>the Supreme Court examined a statute that served both punitive and remedial goals and determined that if the remedial goals by themselves justified the sanction imposed, then the statute did not impose a \u201cpunishment\u201d for purposes of double jeopardy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 263-64, 666 A.2d 128 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-12\">In other words, if an administrative sanction can be characterized as remedial rather than as one whose main purpose is deterrence or retribution, it may not be barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>U.S. v. Halper, supra, </em>490 U.S. at 448-49, 109 S.Ct. at 1902. Even if the sanction has some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>punitive effect, it can withstand constitutional scrutiny. \u201c[F]or the defendant even remedial sanctions carry the sting of punishment.\u201d <em>State v. Jones, supra, </em>340 Md. at 249, 666 A.2d 128, quoting <em>United States v. Halper, supra, </em>490 U.S. at 447 n. 7, 109 S.Ct. at 1901 n. 7.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\"><em>United States v. Ursery, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 2135, 135 L.Ed.2d 549 (1996), a case involving forfeiture and not prison regulations, recognized that a remedial sanction may have \u201ccertain punitive aspects\u201d while at the same time serving \u201cimportant nonpunitive goals.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at -, 116 S.Ct. at 2148. A civil proceeding under <em>Halper </em>and <em>Ursery </em>would constitute double jeopardy only when the sanction is so punitive in form and effect as to negate the civil intent. <em>Ursery, </em>\u2014 U.S. at ---, 116 S.Ct. at 2147-48.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">Appellant is not the first inmate to contend that criminal prosecutions following administrative sanctions violate the double jeopardy clause. Of the courts that have entertained this question, the overwhelming consensus is that such claims are without merit. \u201cIt is now well settled that \u2018punishment\u2019 imposed by prison authorities for infractions of prison regulations does not generally bar a subsequent criminal prosecution for the same conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez-Fundora, </em>58 F.3d 802, 806 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 115 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>S.Ct. 2288, 132 L.Ed.2d 290 (1995), citing <em>United States v. Rising, </em>867 F.2d 1255 (10th Cir.1989); <em>Kerns v. Parratt, </em>672 F.2d 690 (8th Cir.1982); and <em>United States v. Stuckey, </em>441 F.2d 1104 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 841, 92 S.Ct. 136, 30 L.Ed.2d 76 (1971). <em>Accord United States v. Galan, </em>82 F.3d 639, 640 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 117 S.Ct. 179, 136 L.Ed.2d 119 (1996) (agreeing with the \u201cuniform conclusion\u201d of other circuits that prison disciplinary proceedings do not bar future criminal prosecutions); <em>Garrity v.

Harlin, </em>260 Kan. 881, 925 P.2d 1149, 1151-52 (1996) (jurisdictions that have considered whether a subsequent criminal prosecution can be brought \u201chave unanimously rejected the application of double jeopardy in all but some rare extreme facts not before the court.\u201d); <em>Commonwealth v. Forte, </em>423 Mass. 672, 671 N.E.2d 1218, 1220 (1996) (\u201cOpinions of the United States Courts of Appeal have unanimously agreed that the double jeopardy clause does not preclude both prison discipline and a criminal prosecution (and a further sentence) based on the same acts.\u201d); <em>State v. McKenzie, </em>542 N.W.2d 616, 620 (Minn.1996) (\u201cSeveral federal circuit courts and state appellate courts have applied <em>Halper </em>in the context of prison discipline and have unanimously held that no double jeopardy violation occurred.\u201d); <em>State v. Nelson, </em>275 Mont. 86, 910 P.2d 247, 250-51 (1996) (\u201cTypically, both state and federal jurisdictions have held that prison disciplinary proceedings are remedial in nature and present no impediment to subsequent criminal proceedings involving the same conduct\u201d); <em>Cordero v. Lalor, </em>227 A.D.2d 848, 642 N.Y.S.2d 399, 400 (3d Dept.1996) (discussing \u201cthe well-settled principle that \u2018punishment\u2019 imposed by prison authorities for infractions of prison regulations does not generally bar subsequent criminal prosecution for the same conduct ... \u201d); <em>State v.

State, </em>904 S.W.2d 808, 810 (Tex.App.1995) (Texas and federal courts \u201chave consistently held that disciplinary sanctions imposed by prison officials for crimes committed within the prison do not bar subsequent prosecution for those crimes in a court of competent jurisdiction\u201d); <em>State v.

Newby, </em>11 F.3d 1143, 1144, (3d Cir.1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 834, 115 S.Ct.

Fonder, supra, </em>469 N.W.2d at 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The virtually uniform result in prison discipline cases comes from the recognition that administrative sanctions for violating prison regulations are basically remedial, not puni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>tive. <em>United States v. Brown, supra, </em>59 F.3d at 105; <em>State v. O\u2019Connor, supra, </em>681 A.2d at 477-78. <em>Cf. Ward v. Dept. of Pub. Saf. and Cor. Services, </em>339 Md. 343, 350-51, 663 A.2d 66 (1995) (because disciplinary sanctions imposed on correctional employees are remedial they do not implicate double jeopardy protections).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">The primary purpose of the disciplinary system itself is not punishment. <em>People v. Watson, supra, </em>892 P.2d at 390; <em>Wild v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 716, 446 S.E.2d 626, 627 (1994). Nor is the system part of a criminal prosecution. <em>Lucero v.

Lynch, </em>248 Neb. 234, 533 N.W.2d 905, 910 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">The disciplinary system by which inmates are governed while in the care of penal facilities \u201cis designed to maintain institutional security and order.\u201d <em>Garrity v. Fiedler, supra, </em>41 F.3d at 1153. Prison is a place where \u201cgood order and discipline are paramount because of the concentration of convicted criminals.\u201d <em>United Slates v. Newby, supra, </em>11 F.3d at 1145, 1146. Disciplinary sanctions are designed to punish \u201conly insofar as they enable the government to fulfill its remedial goals.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, supra, </em>59 F.3d at 105. The adoption and execution of prison policies are \u201cpecu liarly within the province and professional expertise of corrections officials\u201d whose judgment should generally be deferred to by the courts. <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 547-48, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), quoting <em>Pell v. Procunier, </em>417 U.S. 817, 827, 94 S.Ct. 2800, 2806, 41 L.Ed.2d 495 (1974). Because prison security and the safety of its population are in their hands, prison officials \u201cmust have a wide discretion in promulgating rules to govern the prison population and in imposing disciplinary sanctions for their violation.\u201d <em>McCloskey v. Maryland, </em>337 F.2d 72, 74 (4th Cir.1964).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Punitive interests and remedial interests ... are nowhere so tightly intertwined as in the prison setting, where the government\u2019s remedial interest is to maintain order and to prevent violent altercations among a population of criminals. Accordingly, the mere fact that a sanction imposed by prison officials has a punitive component does not mean that the sanction constitutes \u201cpunishment\u201d for double jeopardy purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-5\"><em>United States v. Hernandez-Fundora, supra, </em>58 F.3d at 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">If institutional disciplinary measures were to bar subsequent criminal prosecutions, prison officials would</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4\">be forced to choose between instituting a disciplinary proceeding or awaiting a criminal prosecution. The process of conducting a criminal investigation and prosecution may take considerable time. The difficulties and delay that a criminal prosecution entails would leave the prisoners who violated the prison rules without a prompt resolution of charges and hinder prison administration and discipline.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyB\"><em>United States v. Newby, supra, </em>11 F.3d at 1146 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-7\">If prison authorities waited until prosecutors decided whether to bring charges and criminal proceedings were completed, the offending inmate might remain in the prison as a threat to institutional order for an extended period. If, on the other hand, prison authorities acted to maintain order by promptly sanctioning the inmate, criminal prosecutions would be barred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-8\"><em>United States v. Brown, supra, </em>59 F.3d at 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">The action taken by prison authorities in Appellant\u2019s case was not of the kind that brings the Double Jeopardy Clause into play.
