At disposition, the court placed appellant on probation and ordered restitution in the amount of $62.85. Appellant timely noted his appeal and presents two questions for our review, which we have rephrased slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">I. Did the motion judge err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress his confession?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">II. Did the trial judge err in admonishing a State\u2019s witness to tell the truth?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">As we answer appellant\u2019s first question in the affirmative, we shall vacate the court\u2019s findings and remand the matter to the court for further proceedings. Therefore, we decline to address appellant\u2019s second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">I. FACTUAL SUMMARY\u2014MOTION TO SUPPRESS</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">At the hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, John Sines, chief of the Oakland Police Department, was the sole witness. He testified that he was called to the Farm Fresh Building, a wooden structure owned by the Town of Oakland, at approximately 10:10 a.m. on July 23,1996, in response to an attempted burning of the building that had occurred during the prior evening. He observed eight cigarette lighters in the vicinity that had all been spray painted. After the chief developed several suspects, including appellant, he proceeded to appellant\u2019s house. Neither appellant nor his mother was home, but Sines left a message with appellant\u2019s sister that he wanted to speak with appellant and his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">Later that day, at approximately 5:30 p.m., Ms. C., Joshua\u2019s mother, brought him to the police department, located at city hall. Sines initially met with both appellant and his mother in his office and explained that he wanted to discuss the burning at the Farm Fresh Building. According to Sines, Ms. C. did not object to the interview. To the contrary, she encouraged her son to tell the truth. Chief Sines testified that he did not have to introduce himself, because appellant and Ms. C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>already knew him, and appellant was aware that Sines was the chief of police. The chief initially stated that he was in uniform during the interview, but later indicated that he was not sure how he was dressed. During the interview, Chief Sines sat behind his desk and appellant and Ms. C. sat across from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Soon after appellant\u2019s arrival, in the presence of his mother, Sines advised appellant of his rights, pursuant to <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), by reading from a waiver form. The chief explained that he \u201cmade sure [appellant] understood,\u201d and he advised appellant that \u201cwhat you should do, Josh, is tell the truth.\u201d Neither appellant nor his mother had any questions. Nor did either one request an attorney. Although appellant said he understood, Sines conceded: \u201cI don\u2019t think he understood a lot of those questions.\u201d Moreover, when asked if, in his opinion, \u00e1ppellant understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights, the chief responded, \u201cHe\u2019s ten years old.\u201d In any event, appellant signed the waiver form by printing his name.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Initially, appellant denied any involvement in the burning. Chief Sines thought appellant might not want to reveal his involvement in the presence of his mother. Accordingly, after about fifteen or twenty minutes, Chief Sines \u201csuggested\u201d to Ms. C. that it would be \u201cbetter\u201d if he spoke with appellant \u201cone-on-one,\u201d and that Ms. C. \u201cshould go out to the next office.\u201d Ms. C. then left appellant alone with the chief. Thereafter, Sines asked appellant to bring his chair closer to him so that they could talk, and he said something along \u201cthe lines of, \u2018Josh, your mom\u2019s not in the room, just you and me here. How about you telling me the truth finally, and we can take a statement.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Approximately one half hour after Ms. C. left the chiefs office, appellant confessed. His statement was formalized in writing, using a question and answer format. After the written statement was obtained, appellant\u2019s mother returned to the room. Chief Sines testified that when Ms. C. returned to the office, she did not voice any concern about the state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>ment. Rather, she \u201cwas glad he told the truth----\u201d At approximately 7:00 p.m., the interview was completed and appellant departed with his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Chief Sines denied telling Joshua that he could not leave the room, threatening appellant, or making any promises to him in order to induce the confession. The chief added that he did not believe that appellant was \u201cafraid\u201d of him, because they \u201cknow each other very well.\u201d Nevertheless, during cross-examination, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">Q. [DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Do you recall making a statement to Josh that you\u2019d tell your wife to hold dinner or you had all night to stay there with him if need be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">A. Right. I didn\u2019t get home until about nine o\u2019clock that night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">Q. But do you recall telling Josh that you\u2019d stay there as long as you had to get him to tell the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-10\">A. I\u2019d stay there as long as it takes. You know, we\u2019re not in no hurry here. That\u2019s what I was trying to express to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">Chief Sines also conceded that he was aware that appellant was taking the medication Ritalin for a condition known as attention deficit disorder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, he acknowledged that appellant expressed an interest in some tee shirts that the police department had on display. The following testimony is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-12\">Q. [DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Do you recall some tee shirts that the Police Department had on display?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-13\">A. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-14\">Q. And do you recall Josh being interested in getting one of those tee shirts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-15\">A. All kids like those tee shirts, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Q. And did you ever indicate to him that he could get one of those tee shirts if he told you the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-4\">A. Okay. Kathy [appellant\u2019s mother] and I\u2014Kathy wanted to buy one of those tee shirts for her son. It was $12. It wasn\u2019t my idea to say like, \u201cJosh, if you tell me the truth, you\u2019ll get one of these tee shirts.\u201d It was an idea to get him to tell the truth. His mother was going to like reward him for telling the truth, that kind of thing. It wasn\u2019t an ultimatum, \u201cYou don\u2019t get a shirt if you don\u2019t tell me the truth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">Q. But Josh didn\u2019t know about this conversation you had had with his mother, did he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">A. He could have been in the room when we was talking about that. I don\u2019t know for sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">Q. But this was a conversation between you and Kathy C. and then did you go and then tell Josh that he could get a shirt if he told the truth? Even though his mother was going to buy it, he didn\u2019t know that though, did he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">A. I don\u2019t know if he knew that or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-9\">Q. But wasn\u2019t that statement made to Josh that he could get a shirt by telling the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-10\">A. I don\u2019t recollect. It could have been. I could have said that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-11\">Q. But it could have. Were there any discussions about him getting a tee shirt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-12\">A. Oh, I think they bought one at the end\u2014before they left, I think they did buy one or later get one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-13\">Q. But had you discussed that with Josh prior to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-14\">A. I don\u2019t think so, I did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-15\">At the conclusion of the testimony, the judge summarized the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-16\">As I understand the testimony, Chief Sines investigated a burning____ [H]is investigation led him to Ms. C.\u2019s house, as well as others, to talk to her son. They weren\u2019t there. He left a note with ... some relative ... that when she and her son came in to come down. They came down about 5:30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>in the evening to the Town Hall at a time when everybody had gone home and Chief Sines was awaiting them. Perhaps someone else showed them in. They arrived with his mother [sic]. They talked about some things. Josh specifically denied the incident occurred. His mother asked him to tell the truth. So did Chief Sines. <em>At some point, Chief Sines, </em>I assume while his mother was present\u2014well, I don\u2019t assume; that\u2019s what the evidence is, <em>advised Josh of his\u2014of Miranda warnings. </em>I didn\u2019t say \u201cof his\u201d because <em>I think as Chief Sines says, who knows whether he understood it or not. </em>He understood probably some of the things. I think, though, he understood that this was serious stuff that Chief Sines was talking with him, and certainly his mother was there and she knew what those things were, the statements and questions and rights were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\">In addition to that, Chief Sines ... suggested to his mother, Josh\u2019s mother, that perhaps she\u2019d leave the room and he\u2019d talk one-on-one with him to see whether that would be more productive and I have the understanding that <em>Josh\u2019s mother was </em>as interested in getting to the bottom of it as anyone else and <em>she was, in a sense, I guess, working with Chief Sines. </em>Anyway, she left and they then stayed together approximately a half an hour where Chief Sines talked to him and he told him some things that happened and then he got out a paper and wrote those things down in an orderly fashion and took their good time doing it, which took about a half an hour or so. Josh\u2019s mother came back in and John Sines talked with her about the whole situation and then they went on home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">Apparently, they did buy a tee shirt or did not buy a tee shirt or something of that nature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Thereafter, defense counsel argued that appellant did not voluntarily and knowingly waive his rights and did not volun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>tarily confess. He claimed that the interview constituted custodial questioning and that, because of appellant\u2019s age and his attention deficit syndrome, he did not understand his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Moreover, he contended that the rights were personal and thus could not be waived by appellant\u2019s mother. In denying appellant\u2019s motion, the judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">[A]s I understand from the facts that I recited earlier, that then Josh was brought into the Town Hall by his mother, they left together. [Defense Counsel], I just do not see that he was under arrest. If Chief Sines had gone out and put him in the police car, put handcuffs on him or took him into custody somehow, I could agree with you. I don\u2019t think young Joshua was under arrest at all, and when he was down there, he was read the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and as you point out, and perhaps he could have been talking about a Happy Meal at McDonald\u2019s across the street, I don\u2019t know, but Chief Sines says that he has known this young man. The young man was not afraid of him. I think that\u2019s very important. He knew his mother. His mother knew him. They were talking amongst themselves and as [the State\u2019s Attorney] points out, <em>Miranda </em>is not, in itself, a part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Constitution. It\u2019s an assurance that when statements are made, they\u2019re free, a product of free and voluntary actions; that they\u2019re not a product of force, intimidation, threat, promise or any other coercive matter. Without <em>Miranda </em>is evidence that the statement is free and voluntary and that safeguards of counsel and so forth have been offered, and I think the statements\u2014I don\u2019t know whether it was in the nature of a confession or admission or just a statement, but whatever it is, and I think it does make it a slight difference to a degree, I think it\u2019s admissible. So I would rule that there\u2014I don\u2019t think that there was an arrest, but even if there was____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">Additional facts will be included in our discussion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AtH1\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Appellant contends that the hearing judge erred in denying his motion to suppress the confession. In support of this position, he claims that he was subjected to custodial interrogation, and did not validly waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights, because he did not understand them. Additionally, appellant urges that his confession was involuntary under Maryland nonconstitutional law. In this regard, he relies on the following: (1) he was only ten years old at the time of the events; (2) he suffers from attention deficit syndrome; (3) he was on the medication Ritalin; (4) the duration of the interview was too lengthy for a child with attention deficit disorder; (5) he was threatened by Chief Sines that they would stay at the police station for as long as it took to obtain a confession; (6) he did not understand the <em>Miranda </em>warnings; (7) he was ultimately questioned outside the presence of his mother; and (8) he was offered a tee shirt as an inducement to confess.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we look only to the record of the suppression hearing; we do not consider the record of the trial itself. <em>Trusty v. State, </em>308 Md. 658, 670, 521 A.2d 749 (1987); <em>Aiken v. State, </em>101 Md.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>557, 568, 647 A.2d 1229 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>337 Md. 89, 651 A.2d 854 (1995). We extend great deference to the findings of fact and determinations of credibility made by the suppression hearing judge. <em>McMillian v. State, </em>325 Md. 272, 281-82, 600 A.2d 430 (1992); <em>Riddick v. State, </em>319 Md. 180, 183, 571 A.2d 1239 (1990); <em>Perkins v. State, </em>83 Md.App. 341, 346, 574 A.2d 356 (1990). Indeed, we accept the facts as found by the hearing judge, unless clearly erroneous. <em>Riddick, </em>319 Md. at 183, 571 A.2d 1239; <em>Perkins, </em>83 Md.App. at 346, 574 A.2d 356. In addition, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the State. <em>Riddick, </em>319 Md. at 183, 571 A.2d 1239; <em>Cherry v. State, </em>86 Md.App. 234, 237, 586 A.2d 70 (1991). Nevertheless, this Court must make its own independent constitutional determination as to the admissibility of the confession, by examining the law and applying it to the facts of the case. <em>Riddick, </em>319 Md. at 183, 571 A.2d 1239; <em>see also Ornelas v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">As we noted, appellant claims that he was subjected to custodial interrogation and that his statement was obtained in violation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The State vigorously disputes that appellant was in custody during the interview by Chief Sines. Therefore, it posits that <em>Miranda </em>is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">It is pellucid that the application of <em>Miranda </em>is triggered only in a custodial setting. <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 441, 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1611, 1612; <em>see also Thompson v. Keohane, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 116 S.Ct. 457, 460, 133 L.Ed.2d 383 (1995); <em>Hughes v. State, </em>346 Md. 80, 87, 695 A.2d 132 (1997); <em>Whitfield v. State, </em>287 Md. 124, 138-39, 411 A.2d 415, <em>cert. dismissed, </em>446 U.S. 993, 100 S.Ct. 2980, 64 L.Ed.2d 850 (1980). Thus, prior to interrogation, only an individual in <em>custody </em>must be advised of his or her constitutional rights. <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612. An individual in custody may waive his or her constitutional rights, so long as the waiver is made \u201cvoluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612. \u201cAbsent a knowing and voluntary waiver of these rights, any incriminating responses to police questioning are inadmissible.... \u201d <em>Hughes, </em>846 Md. at 87, 695 A.2d 132. Therefore, we must first examine the trial court\u2019s factual determination that appellant was not under arrest at the time he confessed and its implicit finding that appellant was not subjected to custodial interrogation. We conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, the questioning occurred in a custodial setting, even though appellant had not been formally arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">\u201c \u2018Custody\u2019 ordinarily contemplates that a suspect will be under arrest, frequently in a jailhouse or station house setting.\u201d <em>Reynolds v. State, </em>88 Md.App. 197, 209, 594 A.2d 609 (1991), <em>aff'd, </em>327 Md. 494, 610 A.2d 782 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 1054, 113 S.Ct. 981, 122 L.Ed.2d 134 (1993). The concept of \u201ccustody,\u201d however, is not necessarily synonymous with an actual arrest; it also includes a reasonable perception that one is significantly deprived of freedom of action. <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 478, 86 S.Ct. at 1630.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The Supreme Court explained in <em>Thompson </em>that custody may be found when \u201ca reasonable person [would] have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at -, 116 S.Ct. at 465. Similarly, the Court of Appeals has said that the trial court must consider, <em>inter alia, </em>whether the suspect was \u201cphysically deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way or is placed in a situation in which he reasonably believes that his freedom of action or movement is restricted by such interrogation.\u201d <em>Whitfield, </em>287 Md. at 140, 411 A.2d 415 (internal quotation omitted). Further, in <em>Whitfield, </em>the Court indicated that whether a suspect \u201ccame [to the place of questioning] completely on his own, in response to a police request, or escorted by police officers,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 141, 411 A.2d 415 (internal quotation omitted), and what occurred at the end of the interrogation, may also be probative in resolving whether a suspect was in custody at the relevant time. The \u201csubjective intent\u201d of a law enforcement officer, however, is not relevant in resolving the custody issue. <em>Id. </em>at 140, 411 A.2d 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>In regard to juveniles, we have added the caveat that \u201cit is reasonable ... for courts to apply a wider definition of custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes.\u201d <em>In re Lucas F., </em>68 Md.App. 97, 103, 510 A.2d 270, <em>cert. denied, </em>307 Md. 433, 514 A.2d 1211 (1986). Indeed, in determining whether a juvenile\u2019s statement was made while in custody, the court must consider additional factors, such as the juvenile\u2019s education, age, and intelligence. <em>In re Owen F., </em>70 Md.App. 678, 685 n. 3, 523 A.2d 627, <em>cert. denied, </em>310 Md. 275, 528 A.2d 1286 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">At the chiefs request, Joshua was brought to the police department by his mother, after Sines notified Ms. C. of his desire to speak with appellant. No evidence was presented that Joshua wanted to go to the police station to talk to Chief Sines. On this record, we cannot say that the mother\u2019s decision to go to the police station constituted the free and considered act of a ten-year-old boy, or that the act of appellant\u2019s mother in bringing appellant to the interview was otherwise probative of the custody issue. Therefore, as we proceed to analyze the thorny issue of custody, we give little weight to Ms. C.\u2019s decision to bring appellant to the police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">We do find it significant, however, that appellant was only ten years old, and he was completely inexperienced in regard to police interviews. It is also noteworthy that the record is devoid of any indication that appellant was ever told that he could leave the office of the police chief at any time during the interview. Nor is there any indication in the record that, once appellant\u2019s mother left the room, appellant nonetheless realized he could ask to talk to her in order to obtain her guidance. Instead, appellant was told that the chief would stay as long as necessary. Further, the chief knew that appellant was taking Ritalin for his attention deficit disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">When we consider that a ten-year-old boy, with no prior criminal involvement, was alone with the chief of police, at the chiefs office, at night, without a parent, and without having been told that he was free to leave, we easily conclude that, for purposes of the interview, appellant reasonably would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>thought his freedom of action was restricted. Therefore, we are amply satisfied that, for <em>Miranda </em>purposes, custody was established.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">In reaching our conclusion, we find <em>In re Imcas F. </em>instructive. There, the appellant was also ten years old and had been picked up by the police as a runaway. He was subsequently interrogated by detectives in regard to a brutal assault committed on a seven-year-old, and was not told that he was free to leave or that his mother was in a nearby waiting room. Moreover, one detective specifically testified that the appellant was in custody. On that record, we concluded that the child \u201cwas significantly deprived of his freedom of action and was in custody within the meaning of <em>Miranda.\u201d In re Lucos F., </em>68 Md.App. at 103, 510 A.2d 270. Although there is no indication in the opinion that the child testified in regard to the suppression issue, we added that the boy \u201creasonably perceived himself to be in the custody of the police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court went on to hold that \u201cordinarily a ten year old child is entitled to the counseling and guidance of a parent or guardian before he or she may validly waive the constitutional rights protected by <em>Miranda.\u201d Id. </em>at 104, 510 A.2d 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">We are equally convinced here that appellant did not execute a valid waiver. As we have said, Chief Sines essentially conceded that, due to his age, appellant probably did not understand his rights. Moreover, the evidence does not reflect that any effort was made\u2014beyond mere recitation of the form\u2014to ensure that appellant (or his mother) really understood the rights or that appellant (or his mother) appreciated the gravity of the circumstances. Nor did the State demonstrate that Joshua \u201chad the mental capacity to comprehend the significance of <em>Miranda, </em>and the rights waived.\u201d <em>In re Lucas F., </em>68 Md.App. at 104, 510 A.2d 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">We recognize that in <em>In re Lucas F., </em>the Court was troubled that the child was never told that his mother was in an adjoining room; in contrast, appellant was advised of his rights in Ms. C.\u2019s presence. The chief seemed to view Ms. C. as his ally. Given Sines\u2019s candid acknowledgment that appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>lant did not seem to understand his rights, the mere presence of appellant\u2019s mother during the advice of rights does not automatically establish a valid waiver. Therefore, while appellant signed the waiver form in the presence of his mother, we decline to impute to appellant his mother\u2019s understanding, if any, of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">We hold that the court erred in accepting the waiver. Under the circumstances attendant here, any waiver by appellant was hollow at best. What the Court said in <em>In re Lucas F. </em>is apt here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">The paper writing superficially satisfies <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>dictates. Facially it appears constitutionally consecrated. But in the case of a child of age ten years, is that enough? Did he realize what services an attorney could perform for him? Did he understand that he was incriminating himself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">Those questions and others lead us to believe that [appellant\u2019s] waiver of <em>Miranda </em>was almost, if not totally, meaningless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">68 Md.App. at 103-04, 510 A.2d 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Alternatively, appellant argues that even if he were not in custody, the court erred in denying his suppression motion because it was involuntary. He relies on State nonconstitutional grounds. <em>See Hillard v. State, </em>286 Md. 145, 153, 406 A.2d 415 (1979). The State counters, preliminarily, that this issue is not preserved, because defense counsel failed to assert the argument below. <em>See Brashear v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 709, 720, 603 A.2d 901 (concluding that failure to argue particular theory in support of motion to suppress constitutes waiver of that argument on appeal), <em>cert. denied, </em>327 Md. 523, 610 A.2d 796 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">Ordinarily, an appellate court will not decide any issue <em>\u201cunless </em>it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in <em>or decided by the trial court.\u201d </em>Maryland Rule 8-131(a)(em-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>phasis added). The hearing judge found that <em>Miranda </em>did not apply because appellant was not in custody and because appellant\u2019s confession was <em>voluntarily </em>given. The judge stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">I think that the atmosphere and the taking of the statement was in fairness and was not the product of a threat, force or promise and was the free act of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">[B]ut I think it\u2019s important to know whether the statement is a product of free will and voluntary exchange or whether it\u2019s threatened, induced or intimated [sic]. Certainly, a person young in tender years has a greater advantage than a person who doesn\u2019t, but from what I heard from the entire facts presented to me, I think this statement is admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoZ\">As the hearing judge decided that appellant voluntarily confessed, we are entitled to address appellant\u2019s contentions with respect to common law voluntariness. We turn to the merits of the contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Under Maryland nonconstitutional or common law, the State must establish the voluntariness of a confession, even if a defendant is interrogated in a noncustodial setting. <em>See Hillard, </em>286 Md. at 151, 406 A.2d 415. When a defendant is not in custody, the Court of Appeals has recognized that <em>\u201cMiranda </em>did not supersede the existing law on voluntariness.\u201d <em>Hof v. State, </em>337 Md. 581, 598, 655 A.2d 370 (1995). <em>See also Reynolds v. State, </em>327 Md. 494, 511-13, 610 A.2d 782 (1992) (applying Maryland nonconstitutional voluntariness analysis when appellant was interviewed in noncustodial setting), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>506 U.S. 1054, 113 S.Ct. 981, 122 L.Ed.2d 134 (1993). Based on \u201cthe common law concern for fairness,\u201d as well as State and federal constitutional requirements, the Court has reasoned that \u201ca defendant\u2019s confession is admissible only if it is \u2018(1) voluntary under Maryland nonconstitutional law, (2) voluntary under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>elicited in conformance with the mandates of Miranda.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hof </em>337 Md. at 597-98, 655 A.2d 370 (quoting <em>Hoey v. State, </em>311 Md. 473, 480, 536 A.2d 622 (1988) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that appellant was not in custody when he was questioned, we are nonetheless of the view that appellant\u2019s confession was involuntary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Based on Maryland common law, a confession is presumed inadmissible \u201cunless it is \u2018shown to be free of any coercive barnacles that may have attached by improper means to prevent the expression from being voluntary.\u2019\u201d <em>Hoey, </em>311 Md. at 483, 536 A.2d 622 (quoting <em>Hillard, </em>286 Md. at 150, 406 A.2d 415). <em>See also Hof, </em>337 Md. at 595, 655 A.2d 370; <em>Lodowski v. State, </em>307 Md. 233, 254, 513 A.2d 299 (1986). Further, \u201ca confession is involuntary if it is induced by force, undue influence, improper promises, or threats.\u201d <em>Hoey, </em>311 Md. at 483, 536 A.2d 622. We must also consider whether the accused\u2019s \u2018\u201cwill was overborne\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u201cwhether his confession was the product of a rational intellect and a free will\u2019 \u201d and whether the accused \u201c \u2018knew and understood what he was saying.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lodowski, </em>307 Md. at 254, 513 A.2d 299 (quoting <em>State v. Hill, </em>2 Md.App. 594, 601-02, 236 A.2d 27 (1967)). In <em>Hillard, </em>the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>[UJnder Maryland criminal law, independent of any federal constitutional requirement, if an accused is told, or it is implied, that making an inculpatory statement will be to his advantage, in that he will be given help or some special consideration, and he makes remarks in reliance on that inducement, his declaration will be considered to have been involuntarily made and therefore inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">286 Md. at 153, 406 A.2d 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In resolving whether a confession is voluntary, the totality of the circumstances standard applies. <em>Hof </em>337 Md. at 595, 655 A.2d 370; <em>Reynolds, </em>327 Md. at 504, 610 A.2d 782; <em>Gilliam v. State, </em>320 Md. 637, 650, 579 A.2d 744 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 1110, 111 S.Ct. 1024, 112 L.Ed.2d 1106 (1991). The Court of Appeals explained in <em>Hof </em>that this standard requires the trial court to consider a variety of factors, including</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\">where the interrogation was conducted, its length, who was present, how it was conducted, its content, whether the defendant was given Miranda warnings, the mental and physical condition of the defendant, the age, background, experience, education, character, and intelligence of the defendant, when the defendant was taken before a court commissioner following arrest, and whether the defendant was physically mistreated, physically intimidated or psychologically pressured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-8\"><em>Hof, </em>337 Md. at 596-97, 655 A.2d 370 (citations omitted). The court must also consider other relevant circumstances, such as whether the defendant\u2019s will was overcome due to the use of drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 597, 655 A.2d 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">It is well settled in Maryland that the same totality of circumstances standard applies in juvenile cases in regard to determining the voluntariness of a statement. <em>McIntyre v. State, </em>309 Md. 607, 620-21, 526 A.2d 30 (1987). Thus, \u201cthe age of a juvenile, in itself, will not render a confession involuntary,\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>311 Md. 398, 407, 535 A.2d 471 (1988), but it is a factor for the court to consider. Similarly, although lack of access to a parent does not compel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>a finding of involuntariness, <em>id. </em>at 407-08, 535 A.2d 471; <em>McIntyre, </em>309 Md. at 620, 526 A.2d 30, it is another important factor in regard to the voluntariness issue. The Court of Appeals has cautioned, however, that \u201cgreat care must be taken to assure that statements made to the police by juveniles are voluntary before being permitted in evidence.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>311 Md. at 407, 535 A.2d 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">In numerous cases, the Supreme Court has found involuntary the inculpatory statements of juveniles. For example, in <em>Gallegos v. Colorado, </em>370 U.S. 49, 82 S.Ct. 1209, 8 L.Ed.2d 325 (1962), the Supreme Court found involuntary the confession of a fourteen-year-old who was held incommunicado by the police and questioned for several days. The Court reasoned that \u201cno matter how sophisticated, [he] is unlikely to have any conception of what will confront him____ [He] is not equal to the police in knowledge and understanding of the consequences of the questions and answers ... and ... is unable to know how to protect his own interests____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 54, 82 S.Ct. at 1212. Similarly, in <em>Haley v. Ohio, </em>332 U.S. 596, 68 S.Ct. 302, 92 L.Ed. 224 (1948), the Supreme Court held the confession of a fifteen-year-old involuntary, because he was held incommunicado by the police for five days and was coerced, interrogated, and denied access to his parents. The Court recognized that \u201c[a]ge 15 is a tender and difficult age for a boy.... He cannot be judged by the more exacting standards of maturity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599, 68 S.Ct. at 304. <em>See also Miller v. State, </em>251 Md. 362, 378, 247 A.2d 530 (1968) (holding that sixteen-year-old voluntarily waived <em>Miranda </em>rights), <em>vacated in part on other grounds, </em>408 U.S. 934, 92 S.Ct. 2851, 33 L.Ed.2d 747 (1972) (mem.).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">In examining the voluntariness issue in this case, we are guided by <em>McIntyre. </em>There, the Court considered whether a fifteen-year-old who was arrested for rape voluntarily and knowingly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and, further, whether his statement was voluntary \u201cin the traditional sense.\u201d 309 Md. at 609, 526 A.2d 30. At the time of arrest, the youth understood the advice of rights. When he asked to see his mother, however, he was told that he could not do so, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>he had been charged as an adult. At the police station, the youth was again fully advised of his rights and renewed his request to see his mother; that request was again denied. Subsequently, the appellant executed a written waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and, thereafter, he gave the police a statement concerning the alleged crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">McIntyre argued that his denial of access to his mother violated his rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution, because such a request was tantamount to invoking one\u2019s right to an attorney. Additionally, he argued that he did not voluntarily waive his rights to remain silent and to the assistance of counsel. The Court of Appeals upheld the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Although the Court recognized \u201cthe importance of parental involvement in a juvenile\u2019s decision to waive <em>Miranda </em>rights, and ... in evaluating the validity of the juvenile\u2019s waiver,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 620, 526 A.2d 30, it declined \u201cto depart from the totality of the circumstances test in determining the validity of a <em>Miranda </em>waiver and in assessing the traditional voluntariness of a juvenile\u2019s statement to the police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 621, 526 A.2d 30. After reviewing the entire record, the Court noted, <em>inter alia, </em>that there was no indication that McIntyre did not understand his rights. Nor did the Court find the existence of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A31\">any special factors ... to indicate that he was unable to understand the nature of his actions. Nor ... was there any indication that McIntyre \u201cwas of insufficient intelligence to understand the rights he was waiving, or what the consequences of that waiver would be ... [and] he was not worn down by improper interrogation tactics or lengthy questioning or by trickery or deceit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-7\"><em>McIntyre, </em>309 Md. at 624-625, 526 A.2d 30 (quoting <em>Fare v. Michael C., </em>442 U.S. 707, 726-27, 99 S.Ct. 2560, 2572-73, 61 L.Ed.2d 197 (1979)). Accordingly, the Court upheld the trial judge\u2019s determination that McIntyre voluntarily waived his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">In reaching the conclusion that the totality of circumstances test applies to juveniles, the Court relied on <em>Fare v. Michael </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number><em>C., </em>442 U.S. 707, 99 S.Ct. 2560, 61 L.Ed.2d 197 (1979). There, the Supreme Court held that, during custodial interrogation, the request of a sixteen-year-old, charged with murder, to see his probation officer, with whom he had a special relationship, did not constitute a <em>per se invocation </em>of the juvenile\u2019s rights to remain silent and to counsel. The Supreme Court reasoned that the totality of the circumstances approach \u201cis adequate to determine whether there has been a waiver even where interrogation of juveniles is involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 725, 99 S.Ct. at 2572. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">The totality approach permits\u2014indeed, it mandates\u2014inquiry into all the circumstances surrounding the interrogation. This includes evaluation of the juvenile\u2019s age, experience, education, background, and intelligence, and into whether he has the capacity to understand the warnings given him, the nature of his Fifth Amendment rights, and the consequences of waiving those rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-6\"><em>Id. See also Colorado v. Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 169, 107 S.Ct. 515, 522-23, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Applying the totality of the circumstances test here, in the light most favorable to the State, it is immediately clear to us that the State failed affirmatively to show that appellant\u2019s confession was voluntary. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">Appellant was substantially younger than the youth in <em>McIntyre. </em>Moreover, in contrast to the appellant in <em>McIntyre, </em>the record does not show that Joshua comprehended his rights. Additionally, no evidence was presented regarding appellant\u2019s educational level or intellectual abilities. Chief Sines also testified that appellant\u2019s mother left Joshua alone during the interview, at the chiefs suggestion. Yet appellant was not informed that he could have further contact with his mother if he wished, or that he was free to leave the interview if he wanted to do so. To the contrary, Chief Sines testified that he told appellant, in effect, that they would remain at the police station for as long as necessary. We also note that there was testimony from Chief Sines that appellant suffered from attention deficit syndrome, for which he took Ritalin. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>No evidence was presented as to the nature of this disorder, its effect on appellant, or the ameliorating impact, if any, of the Ritalin. Under these circumstances, we are of the view that the atmosphere was inherently coercive to a ten-year-old.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">Furthermore, Chief Sines testified that there was some discussion with appellant\u2019s mother regarding the use of a tee shirt that the police had on display, as a means of rewarding appellant for telling the truth. He acknowledged that appellant could have been in the room during this discussion. Even if appellant\u2019s mother initially raised the possibility of giving appellant the shirt, and then purchased it for him, Chief Sines participated in the discussion and admitted that he may have informed appellant that he could have a shirt if he told the truth. \u201cIf a confession \u2018had been induced by any threat of harm, or promise of worldly advantage held out to [the suspect] by [the interrogating detective], or by his authority, or in his presence and with his sanction, it ought to be excluded.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reynolds, </em>327 Md. at 507, 610 A.2d 782 (quoting <em>Nicholson v. State, </em>38 Md. 140, 153 (1873)). A tee shirt is an item that may be perceived by a ten-year-old boy as giving him great \u201cworldly advantage.\u201d As the Supreme Court observed in <em>Haley, </em>\u201cThat which would leave a man cold and unimpressed can overawe and overwhelm a lad.... \u201d 332 U.S. at 599, 68 S.Ct. at 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">In reaching our conclusion, we are mindful of Judge Adkins\u2019s comments in his dissent in McIntyre.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He said: \u201c[C]ourts have long applied special safeguards in cases involving police interrogation of youths charged with criminal activity, and in the use of statements obtained during interrogation.\u201d <em>McIntyre, </em>309 Md. at 626, 526 A.2d 30 (Adkins, J., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>dissenting). Moreover, he noted that the majority did not disagree with his assertion that \u201c[statements obtained from juveniles during police interrogations invite special caution and should be carefully scrutinized, not simply for evidence of physical or psychological coercion, but for some demonstration that the juvenile comprehended his constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 629-30, 526 A.2d 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Such a demonstration is woefully lacking here. Even if appellant were not in custody, thereby relieving the State of its obligation to inform Joshua of his rights, we cannot ignore that the State elected to advise appellant. Due to his age and other factors, appellant apparently did not understand his rights or appreciate the gravity of his circumstances. If appellant did not understand those rights, we cannot look the other way by sanctioning the use of appellant\u2019s statement at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">We recognize that, in recent years, there has been a heightened public concern for the increasing numbers of crimes of violence committed by teenaged juvenile offenders. Nevertheless, neither the Court of Appeals nor the Legislature has abrogated the \u201cstrong public policy commitment to juvenile welfare.\u201d <em>McIntyre, </em>309 Md. at 629, 526 A.2d 30 (Adkins, J., dissenting). This policy warrants application of special safeguards here. Appellant\u2019s failure to appreciate his rights, coupled with the general caution we apply to inculpatory statements made by children, inescapably leads to our conclusion that Joshua\u2019s statement was not voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">At trial, Eric S. testified that he, appellant, and others stole the lighters and caused the burning to the building. Appellant\u2019s mother testified that the boys were at her house playing video games on the date in question. In light of this conflicting evidence, we are unable to conclude that the admission of appellant\u2019s confession was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 295, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 1257 (1991) (concluding that harmless error analysis applies when coerced confessions admitted at trial). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Accordingly, we reverse and remand appellant\u2019s case to the Circuit Court for Garrett County for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">JUDGMENTS REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR GARRETT COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY GARRETT COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-14\">. Three other boys were involved in the underlying incident. Jimmy and Robbie K. were tried with appellant and were found to have committed the same delinquent acts. They are not parties to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>appeal, however. In addition, Eric S. admitted his guilt to the police, but was not prosecuted. All of the boys were first-time offenders.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b551-16\">. We note that the record does not reflect the nature of the disorder or the extent to which appellant was affected by it. Nor does the record indicate whether the Ritalin was effective in controlling Joshua's disorder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b553-9\">. Based on our resolution of the suppression issue, we need not fully recount the additional evidence adduced at trial. For completeness, however, we note the following: At trial, the State introduced the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>cigarette lighters and photographs of the damage to the building. In addition, over defense objection, appellant\u2019s statement was admitted, in which he said that he stole several cigarette lighters from Naylor\u2019s Hardware Store and then went with the other boys, who had also stolen cigarette lighters, to the Farm Fresh Building. There, they attempted to ignite the lighters and set the building\u2019s walls on fire. Eric S., appellant's eleven-year-old cousin, testified for the State after the State agreed not to prosecute him. He explained that the boys put the stolen cigarette lighters on the ground and on a bench and created sparks by lighting some of the lighters, and then using other lighters as fuel. They stepped on them, however, in an effort \"to make the sparks stop.\" In the process, the wall of the building and a bench were burned.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Donald Mason, the manager of the Naylor\u2019s Hardware Store in Oakland, testified that the lighters found at the scene were the same kind sold by Naylor's. He estimated the cost of the lighters at less than one dollar a piece. Asa McCain, Jr., the Mayor of Oakland, testified that the damaged property belonged to the town and that it would cost approximately $62.85 to repair the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Kathy C., appellant's mother, testified for the defense. She stated that appellant and Eric were at home with her when the incident occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b562-6\">. It has never been determined that the voluntariness standards trader Maryland nonconstitutional law and federal and Maryland constitutional law are precisely the same. <em>Hillard, </em>286 Md. at 150 n. 1, 406 A.2d 415. We note, however, that the Supreme Court has engaged in a due process voluntariness analysis even in cases for which <em>Miranda </em>did not apply. <em>See, e.g., Arizona v.
