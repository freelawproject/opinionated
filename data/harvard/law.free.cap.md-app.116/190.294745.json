She presents several questions on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-14\">1. Can the parties to a marriage enter into an oral agreement to <em>exclude </em>from marital property: [a] all assets then known, [b] all assets then unknown, and [c] all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>assets acquired during the marriage, subsequent to the alleged oral agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">2. Did the circuit court err in finding that the parties entered into an oral agreement, unsupported by any writing, excluding all known, unknown, and subsequently acquired property from consideration as marital property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">3. Did the circuit court err in finding certain assets not to be marital property, even though the parties stipulated they were marital property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">4. Did the court err in finding that the assets appellee transferred to his family, after having an argument with appellant, came from assets which originated before the marriage?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">5. Did the circuit court err in ruling that the appellant should be denied an equitable share of the marital home?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">The Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">The parties were married in 1982<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and divorced in 1995 based upon a two-year separation. When they married, each already owned property located in other jurisdictions. During the divorce proceedings, neither party claimed that these properties that they brought into the marriage were marital property. Both parties were employed during the marriage. Each kept a separate bank account. Additionally, they established a joint account for household expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">In 1984, the parties separated, with appellant moving to her District of Columbia residence, while appellee remained at his Virginia property. After efforts to reconcile were undertaken, appellee moved into appellant\u2019s District of Columbia residence. Shortly after the reconciliation, the parties purchased a home together in Maryland. They each kept their prior residences. Each party contributed $14,000 to the down payment of the marital home, which was located in Cheverly. During the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>period when the parties were reconciled, they shared proportionately in family expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Difficulties again developed between the parties. Ultimately, appellant left the Maryland home and moved back into her District of Columbia residence; this litigation ensued, during which appellee alleged the existence of an oral agreement between the parties as to the disposition of the parties\u2019 interests in marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The trial court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">The nature of the financial arrangements between these parties is crucial to this case. The evidence is abundantly clear that before and after marriage, these parties, with the exception of the joint account for household expenses, handled their money and their investments as though unmarried. Neither accounted to the other for expenditures nor investments nor loans nor gifts to third parties. Mrs. Golden loaned money to her brother for a car and to her aunt for a beauty shop. They each bought cars in their own names without input from the other, neither drove the cars belonging to the other. They kept separate bank accounts in their sole names, they attended different churches. He has invested approximately $150,000 since the marriage, some of which came from previous investments, some from his Dale City rental, and some from marital wages. It is not possible to separate and identify which funds were marital....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">Even if some of the assets accumulated by these parties are part marital, there is no accurate way to trace the source of funds from this evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-9\">Each was aware of the monetary gifts by the other to relatives. No complaints were registered by either. Each kept their financial records inaccessible to the other....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-10\">After evaluating the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses, this court specifically finds as a fact that at the time of and at all times thereafter, there was an agreement in place between these parties that their property was sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>and separate, except for the marital home in Cheveriy, which is jointly owned. There was a specific intention that no other property, including pensions, was to be marital property, as evidenced by the manner in which they conducted their affairs. Both parties relied on the agreement in investing and handling their financial affairs. The court does not find Mrs. Golden\u2019s [appellant\u2019s] assertions and claims to be credible. She asserts a \u201cwhat\u2019s mine is mine, and what\u2019s yours is ours\u201d mentality. Sec. 8-101 of the Family Law Article states that marital partners may make agreements respecting their property. There is no requirement that such an agreement be in writing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">The parties separated in 1993; the joint marital account was closed out four to five months prior to that when the wife stopped contributing. Since the separation, Mr. Golden [appellee], who remained in the Cheveriy house, has paid $35,800 on mortgage payments. Mrs. Golden has paid none. He is entitled to <em>Crawford </em>payments as set forth hereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">The plaintiff [appellant] did not satisfy this court by a preponderance of evidence, taken as a whole and evaluating the credibility of witnesses, that the items she claims as marital property are indeed marital property. To the contrary, the agreement between the parties shows there was no intention for any property except Cheveriy to be joint or marital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">No acts nor contributions of either contributed to, detracted from, nor otherwise affected the pension or other monetary position of the other. Had they not married, each would be in the same financial position in which they find themselves today. Because of the marriage they are both richer by one asset only\u2014the Cheveriy house.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">The only evidence of any agreement between the parties to which we have been directed was their testimony. Appellant\u2019s testimony included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-9\">Q. Now, what other [financial] arrangements did you and Mr. Golden make at the time [of the marriage]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>A. We had a joint account that we contributed to ... for the expenses for the marriage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-4\">Q. ... [H]ow long did that arrangement continue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">A. Throughout the marriage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">Q. Now, while you lived in Washington, what were the arrangements ... regarding ... family expenses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">A. ... [H]e did contribute some toward the expenses ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-8\">Q. Tell us what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">A. ... Gary [appellee] wanted us to move back to Dale City. I refused. I figured our problem was that when we were in his house, and he was saying, well, this is mine, this is mine, this is mine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-10\">So, basically, I thought that we would have a chance, if we bought something together.... We would buy this house together.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-11\">... [I]t wouldn\u2019t be a thing of mine or yours.... It would be ours[ ] together.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">She then testified as to their finances in respect to the Maryland house the parties bought together:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-13\">A. In 1987 I was earning approximately $22,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-14\">A. He was earning approximately $57,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-15\">A. ... I was paying something like $350 [monthly].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-16\">A. He was paying something like a thousand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-17\">Q. And, why was there a difference?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-18\">A. Because, his salary was much more than mine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-19\">Later, she testified further as to the overall financial arrangements during the marriage. She testified as to premari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>tal assets, including a settlement from a car accident in which she had been involved and in which her mother was killed. She also testified as to the existence of a 401-K plan and her bank account. On cross-examination, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">Q. You are aware of the fact that during that period [the five-year period before the parties\u2019 marriage in 1982] that Mr. Golden was concerned about his finances, and he was very careful about how he spent money, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">A. That I beg to differ. It changed radically.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">Q. When you moved into the Dale City home [after the marriage], were you aware of how much the mortgage was on that home that Mr. Golden was paying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">A. No....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-9\">Q. And, in fact with respect to your Washington D.C. property, Mr. Golden had nothing to do with the mortgage on there, did he? ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-10\">A. ... [I]t was just that it basically evolved that way. He had his house. I had my house, and [he] paid his, and I paid mine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-11\">A. Yes. When [financial] situations would arise, we discussed them, and we decided how to handle them. It wasn\u2019t really like an agreement or a written agreement or verbal agreement I don\u2019t think at this time. It just evolved that way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">Later, she was cross-examined about deposition testimony she was supposed to have given:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-13\">Q. And, you recall admitting at the time that his money was his, and your money was yours?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-14\">A. No. I don\u2019t recall saying that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-15\">Q. And, in fact, there never was any suggestion ... that you both maintain all of your income in one account, was there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>A. No, there wasn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-5\">A. I don\u2019t know about our intentions. It just happened that way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Later, either continuing on cross or on redirect examination, she testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">[W]e could meet each other half and half, but he really did want this home.... 1 was telling him, listen, I don\u2019t bring in but so much, so I wouldn\u2019t be able to meet him, you know, half and half on this, and he was in agreement with this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQR8\">Later, on a continuation of cross-examination, she testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-8\">Q. Now, the funds that went into that joint account, those were funds that you and Mr. Golden contributed <em>yourself from your income. </em>Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-9\">A. That\u2019s correct. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">Then, as to the properties each party owned prior to the marriage and maintained under separate ownership during the marriage, the following exchange occurred. Appellant was questioned initially about her Washington, D.C. residence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A40\">Q. But you had purchased that property in terms of the initial interest ... while you were not married to Mr. Golden. Is that your testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-11\">A. That\u2019s correct, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-12\">Q. And since the time that you have been married to him, you have been paying on the mortgage. Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgF\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-13\">Q. But you still consider that property to be your sole property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-14\">A. That is my sole property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-15\">Q. ... And ... at some point during the marriage you were receiving rental income from that property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-16\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-17\">Q. And that rental income ... you put into your own separate account. Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-18\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>A similar line of questioning as to Mr. Golden\u2019s Virginia property was then put to appellant. After establishing that appellee paid the mortgage on that property, appellant was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-5\">Q. But by the same token, you agreed that that property was his sole property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Later, she was asked about her bank accounts and retirement accounts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">Q. ... [Y]ou consider those funds to be your sole funds. Isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">A. ... [TJhere\u2019s a retirement account at Penn Mutual---- [T]hat\u2019s the IRA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-10\">Q. And that was acquired upon your marriage to Mr. Golden. Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-11\">A. Part of it, because its direct from the retirement from\u2014the little bit of retirement that I got from NBW, and I was hired at NBW in \u201978.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-12\">Q. So, a portion of it was acquired during your marriage and a portion of it before you got married?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-13\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-14\">She was then questioned about other investments, some before the marriage, and was eventually asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-15\">Q. As far as you were concerned, were those funds solely your money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-16\">A. As far as I was concerned, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-17\">Q. And most of the money ... was acquired during your marriage. Isn\u2019t that right? ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-18\">A. Yeah, I would say so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-19\">The direction of the questioning of her then turned towards appellee\u2019s assets:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Q. Did you ever discuss with Mr. Golden anything about his retirement accounts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-4\">A. No, and he never did discuss anything about mine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">A. ... [T]he way that it turned out, I already had accounts____ He had accounts, too---- As far as joining or what\u2014it just evolved that way. If wasn\u2019t this is mine or\u2014I\u2019m pretty sure as far as he was concerned, what [is] his is his, but I don\u2019t\u2014I didn\u2019t come from that type of family.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">She was asked specifically on redirect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-9\">Q. So, just to follow up on the last issue, there was never an agreement between you and Mr. Golden about anything other than\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-10\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-11\">Q. \u2014the Cheverly property when you listed that for sale. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-12\">A. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-13\">Q. And in addition to that, both [of| you understood that the houses you had owned before the marriage were yours?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-14\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-15\">Q. And there wasn\u2019t any other agreement on any other things, was there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-16\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-17\">Mr. Golden\u2019s testimony, in relevant part, included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-18\">Q. ... [D]id you ever discuss with her your financial status prior to your marriage?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-19\">A. Not a great detail. I told her I had money market accounts, I had stocks, savings bonds, mostly municipal bonds....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-20\">Q. Did you ever discuss with her how much money you had?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-21\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>A. During our marriage, I paid 75, 80 percent of the household account, until I guess about 1992.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">[A.] The mortgage, ... the electricity, the gas, the water.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">Q. ... [T]ell us how your financial arrangement was with your wife ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">A. ... I would put about 75 percent in there and she would put about 25 percent in there, based on her income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">Q. ... And with respect to any other monies that you would receive in your income, what if anything was your understanding with respect to those monies?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-9\">A. Our agreement was what\u2019s mine was mine and hers is hers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">He later testified as to investments made during the marriage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-11\">Q. ... [A]ll told, during your marriage ... how much money would you say that you invested in either stocks, municipal bonds or CDs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-12\">Q. So, an additional [$]150,000 you invested\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-13\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-14\">Q. And what was the source of that money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-15\">A. Primarily, from two sources. From the investments that I ... had prior to the marriage. The other source is from my wages that I had ... prior to the marriage ... and ... a small amount [from marital income]____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-16\">He was then questioned about the joint statement of marital assets:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-17\">Q. \u2014to numerous of those assets, you and she dispute ownership. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-18\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Q. Okay. And with respect to the property that is in dispute, do you maintain that the property is\u2014that is in your name only is your sole property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">Q. And on what do you base that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">A. I base it on a number of things. Our verbal agreement that her, her money was her money, her assets were her assets.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">There then occurred a discussion of several gifts totaling over $133,000 that appellee gave to his parents and to his sister, because, according to appellee, he was depressed over the marital problems he was experiencing. Eventually, on cross-examination, he was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">Q. ... You claimed ... that you and your wife had an agreement where your property was yours and hers was hers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-11\">Q. Was that ever in writing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-12\">A. ... So, to answer your question, her property was hers, and my property was mine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-13\">A. We had verbal agreements. We had a lot of agreements in our house that were not written.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-14\">On other occasions, appellee recited his opinion that they had an agreement, but the terms of that agreement were always stated as \u201cwhat was hers was hers and what was mine was mine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-15\">We have included an extensive recitation of the testimony of the parties as to their financial arrangements and appellee\u2019s assertion that an oral marital property settlement agreement existed because the trial court based most of its other findings on its initial finding that the parties had an agreement. We perceive that the finding of an oral property settlement agreement was erroneous. We perceive of nothing in the testimony or evidence in this case that would constitute an agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>sufficient to bind the parties to it or to support the trial judge\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">The Law</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\"><em>Falise v. Falise, </em>63 Md.App. 574, 493 A.2d 385 (1985), is instructive. There, the parties had separated and entered into a formal separation agreement. The parties subsequently reconciled and built a jointly owned house during the reconciliation. The initial issue was what effect the prior separation agreement, which contained an ownership waiver as to after-acquired property, had on the ownership of the house. Mrs. Falise argued that her interest in the newly built house was presumed to be a gift to her upon the titling of it as <em>tenants by the entireties </em>and that the separation agreement was inoperative because it was abrogated by virtue of their reconciliation. We first opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">[Ejven if the separation agreement was not abrogated, the unimproved lot of ground acquired by appellant during the separation must be classified as \u201cmarital\u201d and not as \u201cnon-marital\u201d property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">It is clear that by paragraph 13 of the agreement the parties intended to relinquish any and all right, title and interest in and to the other\u2019s property, then owned or thereafter acquired. We doubt that the subject agreement could affect the status of something which is neither an interest in real or personal property, <em>i.e., </em>marital property. Marital property is merely a term created by the legislature to describe the status of property acquired during the marriage, however titled (as defined in Md. Family Law Code Ann. \u00a7 8-201(e) (1984)), title to which may have given rise to a potential inequity, upon dissolution of the marriage. That inequity, conceptually, may be corrected via a different legislative creature called the \u201cmonetary award.\u201d Thus, the only function of \u201cmarital property\u201d is to form a base for a \u201cmonetary award.\u201d The legislature never intended that either spouse could have a legal <em>interest </em>in the \u201cmarital property\u201d of the other since it merely intended to cure the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>title created inequity through the issuance of a \u201cmonetary award.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 580, 493 A.2d 385. We held explicitly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">In order to exclude property \u201cby valid agreement\u201d from the reach of a monetary award, we believe that the parties must specifically provide that the subject property must be considered \u201cnon marital\u201d or in some other terms specifically exclude the property from the scope of the Marital Property Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 581, 493 A.2d 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Accordingly, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court\u2019s finding that an agreement existed \u201cbetween these parties that their property was sole and separate\u201d is clearly erroneous. We would doubt, although we do not now specifically hold, that a \u201cwhat is hers is hers and what is mine is mine\u201d oral agreement, no matter how often repeated, could ever contain the degree of specificity required by <em>Falise, i.e., </em>\u201cthe parties must specifically provide that the subject property must be considered \u2018non marital\u2019 or in some other terms specifically exclude the property from the scope of the Marital Property Act.\u201d <em>Falise, </em>63 Md.App. at 581, 493 A.2d 385. Accordingly, we shall vacate the trial court\u2019s judgment on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">On remand, the trial court is reminded that income from all sources to either spouse during a marriage is generally income of the marriage and that, to the extent any such funds are used to purchase other investments, marital property is thereby created. Moreover, to the extent the value of nonmarital property has been increased by the utilization of marital funds, <em>e.g., </em>mortgage payments, taxes, repairs, etc., that new or added value is, itself, marital property. The trial court is further reminded that, under the source-of-funds theory, when any mixture of marital and nonmarital property exists, to the extent it cannot be traced to nonmarital funds, it is marital. On this point, see <em>Merriken v. Merriken, </em>87 Md.App. 522, 535, 590 A.2d 566 (1991), where we said: \u201cInsofar as the value of inherited property is increased by the expenditure of marital funds for its upkeep ... the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>such increase ... is marital____\u201d We then opined, \u201cFor each property, it should have been determined whether appellant\u2019s efforts actively appreciated the value through the expenditure of funds for maintenance and/or development.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 536, 590 A.2d 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Also relevant to the case at bar is <em>Gravenstine v. Gravenstine, </em>58 Md.App. 158, 472 A.2d 1001 (1984), where, prior to the marriage, the husband owned certain securities. During the marriage, dividends were reinvested in the stocks. The husband maintained that because the original shares were nonmarital, the additional shares acquired by reinvesting the dividends were also nonmarital. We opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">Appellee responds that the stocks acquired during marriage were marital property because \u201cbut for her monetary contribution to the family\u2019s finances, the parties would have needed the dividends for other purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">... [T]he evidence showed that appellant could afford to purchase new shares and reinvest the dividends only because of appellee\u2019s marital contributions. Since the new securities were purchased with marital funds supplied in part from money earned by appellee, the new shares were no longer traceable to nonmarital funds originally expended by appellant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 173-75, 472 A.2d 1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">We have held that no agreement as to property disposition existed. Accordingly, on remand, the trial court shall have to reconsider whether the additional investments by either party in their respective real and personal properties constitute the investment of marital property. If so, the marital property will have to be valued. In other words, the trial court shall have to comply with the three-step process described in <em>Merriken. See also Hoffman v. Hoffman, </em>93 Md.App. 704, 712-13, 614 A.2d 988 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">In the present case, the trial court opined, \u201cIt is not possible to separate and identify which funds were marital.\u201d The court, however, avoided the problem of making a determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>tion by finding that an agreement existed. On remand, the trial judge is reminded of the dictates of <em>Noffsinger v. Noffsinger, </em>95 Md.App. 265, 281, 620 A.2d 415, <em>cert. denied, </em>331 Md. 197, 627 A.2d 539 (1993):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">Any property acquired during the marriage that cannot be directly traced to a nonmarital source is marital property....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">The party who asserts a marital property interest bears the burden of producing evidence of the <em>identity </em>and value of the property. Generally, the burden of proving a fact is on the party bearing the affirmative of the issue. When attempting to demonstrate that property acquired during the marriage is nonmarital, the party with this burden must directly trace the property to a nonmarital source.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 281-82, 620 A.2d 415 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Accordingly, as to all of the value increases of property resulting from the expenditure of either party\u2019s marital income, including investment income during the marriage, and from nonmarital income or sources as well, the party asserting that a portion is nonmarital bears the burden of tracing the expenditure to nonmarital funds. If he or she cannot do so, the increase in value is considered to be marital property.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Because the trial court based the entirety of its decision on the existence of an agreement that we have determined did not validly exist, we shall vacate the entire judgment, including the matter of the alleged gifts to appellant\u2019s relatives, except for the granting of the divorce. On remand, except for the divorce, all matters of property classification and valuation should be addressed, and the calculation of monetary award, if any, should be computed and, if necessary, relitigated. In addition, the issue of contribution needs to be reconsidered since the funds used for the house payments apparently were marital.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">Before concluding, we note that there was no claim for alimony below, and the trial court\u2019s denial of alimony was not appealed. In order, however, to ensure that the issue is final, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>we shall, for the record, affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">JUDGMENT OF DIVORCE AFFIRMED; JUDGMENT DENYING ALIMONY AFFIRMED; JUDGMENT OTHERWISE VACATED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-12\">.
