In terms of the Machiavellian employment of the mistrial device deliberately to sabotage a trial perceived to be going badly for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>prosecution, the historic culprits were the judge and the prosecuting attorney. When, therefore, a mistrial is declared, over the objection of the defense, either at the request of the prosecution or <em>sua sponte </em>by the judge, the rule provides that no mistrial will be permitted unless there was a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for the mistrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-5\"><em>Fields v. State, </em>96 Md.App. 722, 733, 626 A.2d 1037 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">In this interlocutory appeal from the Circuit Court for Carroll County, we must determine whether manifest necessity existed for the trial judge\u2019s decision to grant the State\u2019s motion for a mistrial on the ground that defense counsel presented the jurors with inadmissible evidence. Philip Stephan Malpas, appellant, presents a single question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">Did the circuit court err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds, when the mistrial that aborted appellant\u2019s earlier trial was granted over defense objection and without substantial justification?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Because there was no manifest necessity in this case, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion for dismissal of charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">In July and August of 1995 Barbara Van Rossum owned a house that contained two dwelling units, one of which she shared with appellant. Richard Scott Craigie, the victim in this case, resided in the adjacent unit. During the month of July, Craigie fell behind on his rent and utilities payments. On several occasions, appellant threatened to remove Craigie\u2019s property from the house unless Craigie paid what was owed to Van Rossum. Craigie ultimately vacated the premises after signing an agreement to leave behind his family\u2019s dinette set as security for the money he owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">On August 8, 1995, after he left work, Craigie went to a bar, and eventually met Mrs. Craigie, who was upset that their dinette set was in Van Rossum\u2019s possession. At this point, Craigie went to Van Rossum\u2019s to retrieve the dinette set, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>was met by appellant, who threatened to \u201ckick [Craigie\u2019s] ass\u201d unless Craigie left the property. Craigie insisted on removing the rest of his possessions, picked up a shovel off the ground, and headed toward the house. Appellant then pulled out a gun and threatened to kill Craigie if he did not leave the property. Craigie testified that although he then dropped the shovel, raised his left hand, and told appellant he would leave, appellant shot him in the side as he turned away.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Appellant was charged with attempted first-degree murder, assault with intent to murder, reckless endangerment, assault, battery, and the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. A jury trial commenced on March 4, 1996, but was terminated three days later over appellant\u2019s objection when the court \u201cvery reluctantly\u201d granted the State\u2019s motion for mistrial. Appellant then moved for dismissal of all charges on double jeopardy grounds. That motion was denied, but further proceedings were stayed pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The Basis for the State\u2019s Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The following exchange occurred during Craigie\u2019s cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">[COUNSEL]: And you described [appellant] as ... calling you a mother-fucker several times in the course of these events on the 8th when he\u2019s coming after you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">[CRAIGIE]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-10\"><em>* </em>* * * sk *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-11\">[COUNSEL]: That\u2019s a term you use very frequently, isn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-12\">[CRAIGIE]: Towards?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-13\">[COUNSEL]: Towards other people?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-14\">[CRAIGIE]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-15\">\u00edf\u00bb \u2018k H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-16\">[COUNSEL]: Well, you said your wife had left and you hadn\u2019t seen her in three or four weeks ... And there were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>times when you had some really violent arguments there, weren\u2019t there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-4\">[CRAIGIE]: No, sir, me and my wife never ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-5\">[COUNSEL]: Never did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">[CRAIGIE]: No. sir. No, not at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">[COUNSEL]: Did you refer to her brother as a motherfucker?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">[CRAIGIE]: My\u2014her brother?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">[COUNSEL]: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-10\">[CRAIGIE]: ... I\u2019m sure I did after he set there and stopped payment on a three hundred dollar rent check that I had to cover.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-11\"><em>% </em>sj\u00ab sj{</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-12\">[COUNSEL]: But you and your wife had arguments about her boyfriend?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-13\">[CRAIGIE]: My wife never had a boyfriend. I don\u2019t know anything about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-14\">[COUNSEL]: You don\u2019t\u2014you don\u2019t recall calling her up on July 24th, 1995, around 7:25 in the evening and referring to her boyfriend as that skinny-ass little mother fucker?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Agz\">[CRAIGIE]: No. My wife\u2014my wife ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-15\">[COUNSEL]: You never did that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-16\">[CRAIGIE]: No. sir. No, sir, not at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-17\">[COUNSEL]: And you never\u2014never referred to her brother as that fat-ass mother-fucker?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-18\">[CRAIGIE]: He\u2014he wasn\u2019t fat, he was a big boy. He wasn\u2019t fat, he was muscular.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-19\">[COUNSEL]: Did you\u2014did you tell her that if anyone came to the house and as soon as they got on the porch you were gonna shoot them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-20\">[CRAIGIE]: My wife? ... No, I would never threaten my wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-21\">[COUNSEL]: And did you quite often use this term with her, mother-fucker?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>[CRAIGIE]: No. I would not\u2014I don\u2019t\u2014I have respect for my wife, I would have never done that to her, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\">[COUNSEL]: I\u2019d like you to listen to something, Mr. Craigie.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Appellant had used a micro-cassette recorder to record Craigie\u2019s voice during a telephone conversation in which Craigie was yelling so loud that he could be heard in appellant\u2019s unit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At this point in the proceedings, appellant\u2019s counsel proceeded to play a tape of that conversation, presenting the jurors with the following utterances shouted by Craigie:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">[CRAIGIE]: ... You need to wake the fuck up. I don\u2019t give a shit what anybody does. I do not like bein\u2019 threatened. The worst thing in my life somebody could ever do to me is threaten me. (Unintelligible.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">I tell you what, you need to call. Tell that asshole hole [sic]\u2014that\u2014that fat mother-fucker to call me. Tell him to call me. That\u2019s all you to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-9\">Tell that little skinny-ass mother-fuckin\u2019 boyfriend of yours to call me. Tell him to call me.... [T]he first mother-fucker that walks up on this porch, I\u2019m gonna shoot 'em. I\u2019m gonna. I am. I am.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">The State interposed no objection to the presentation of that evidence. The following transpired when appellant\u2019s counsel resumed cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-11\">[COUNSEL]: Did you hear that? If they come up on the porch, if someone comes up on the porch, the first person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>that comes up on the porch, \u201cI\u2019m gonna shoot \u2019em\u201d? Did you say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">[CRAIGIE]: I guess that\u2019s what it\u2019s saying, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-6\">sf: $ <em>% </em>#</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">[COUNSEL]: Okay. Now, during the period of July down to August 8th, did you threaten Barbara Van Rossum?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-8\">[CRAIGIE]: No, sir, I never did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-9\">^ ^ ^ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-10\">[COUNSEL]: Did you tell Philip Malpas you were gonna kill him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-11\">[CRAIGIE]: I told him I could have killed him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-12\">[COUNSEL]: You told him you could have killed him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Atz\">[CRAIGIE]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-13\">[COUNSEL]: When did you tell him that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-14\">[CRAIGIE]: When he walks in\u2014walked in to my house.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-15\">At this point, the State objected for the first time and moved for a mistrial on the narrow ground that appellant\u2019s counsel had no right to question Craigie about an argument that had occurred in February of 1995.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court denied that motion and testimony continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-16\">After the luncheon recess, the State once again moved for a mistrial, asserting for the first time that appellant\u2019s counsel had no right to play the tape during Craigie\u2019s cross-examination. The court denied this motion, ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-17\">There was nothing on that tape that directed any kind of threats or foul language or innuendo towards [appellant] or towards Ms. Van Rossum. Why Mr. Malpas felt that he was compelled to tape this conversation of Mr. Craigie while Mr. Craigie was in his house with a reasonable right and expectation of privacy, I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-18\">This may well constitute ... an illegal intercept, I don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s before me today.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>If, prior to your playing that tape, you had disclosed to the Court and to the State what it was that you intended to do, and I\u2019d have heard a proffer at that time and an opportunity to listen to that tape in camera, I would have had an opportunity to make a decision based on what I heard, and whether it was relevant, based on what was said.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">And I\u2019m going to caution the Defense ... that that should not happen again, it should not happen again, or the Court will act appropriately. We don\u2019t have trial by ambush in\u2014 in this State, although we don\u2019t require the Defense to disclose impeachment witnesses or other kinds of things. Still, there\u2019s some fundamental fairness that I think is being violated in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Now, Mr. Craigie did say he did not use such language directed towards his wife and that he did not utter words directed towards other persons. Well, from what I heard on the tape, that language wasn\u2019t directed towards his wife, he did use it conversationally, he did use it towards whoever the skinny-ass guy is and whoever the large guy is, and that directly contradicted what he had said he had not done, or couldn\u2019t recall doing. And, it\u2019s up to him to explain what he did say and what he didn\u2019t say, and he\u2019s had an opportunity to do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">So, I don\u2019t believe it amounts\u2014what\u2019s happened amounts to a basis for a mistrial .... when that tape was cued up and played during cross-examination, I didn\u2019t know what to expect, I don\u2019t think the State knew what to expect by what was [being] played.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">But, no objection was made, as you say, and I think that what came in is\u2014tests, perhaps, to some extent, subject to redirect, the victim\u2019s\u2014alleged victim\u2019s credibility, but I don\u2019t think that it\u2014it\u2019s relevant and will in all likelihood\u2014or whether or not it forms a basis for [appellant], since ... this language was not directed to him or Ms. Van Rossum, serves as a basis for concern or fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">So, that being said, I\u2019m going to deny the Motion for Mistrial....</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>The trial continued. Three days later, however, the State yet again moved for a mistrial, this time in a written motion accompanied by \u201cMistrial Motion Exhibit 1,\u201d a letter from an Assistant Attorney General of Maryland that had been requested by and was addressed to the State\u2019s Attorney for Carroll County. The text of that letter is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-4\">You\u2019ve asked for our views on application of Title 10, subsection 10 of Courts Article, concerning wiretapping and electronic surveillance to a specific set of facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\">As I understand the situation, an individual surreptitiously tape-recorded words spoken by the occupant of an adjoining dwelling unit, the tape recording apparently made by placing the recorder near the thin wall connecting the two units was done without the knowledge or consent of the neighbor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">In my view, such an action would generally be prohibited under 10-402(a)(l) of the Courts Article, which makes it unlawful for any person to wilfully intercept any wire, oral, or electronic communication. An oral communication is defined as \u2018Any conversation or words spoken to or by any person in a private conversation.\u2019 10-401(ii)(l). If an oral communication has been intercepted, it is unlawful to wilfully disclose its contents. 10-402(a)(2). Furthermore, under 10-405, neither \u2018the contents of an intercepted oral communication nor any \u2018evidence derived\u2019 from it \u2018may be received in evidence in any trial ... or other official proceeding.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">Given that this question relates to a matter currently at trial, this Office cannot provide a formal opinion. However, I hope you will find this statement of my views to be helpful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">After hearing further argument of counsel, the court announced the following ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">Now, neither the State, nor the Court had knowledge\u2014or the victim, for that matter\u2014had knowledge of that tape, and the Court had not been asked to rule on the tape\u2019s admissibility, or an opportunity to research the law, which has subsequently come to light on the use of such a tape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>The tape was cued up and ready to be played and was, in fact, played.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">The Court subsequently denied a State\u2019s Motion for Mistrial moments later at the bench, stating reasons on the record. And [the State] renewed that Motion at the end of the State\u2019s case; the Court subsequently denied that Motion, as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">Today, at the start of trial\u2014or shortly before the start of today\u2019s proceedings, the State filed a formal Motion for Mistrial---- Accompanying her Motion, she provided a letter\u2014it\u2019s a letter/opinion dated March 6th, 1996 addressed to the State\u2019s Attorney. It\u2019s Mistrial Motion Exhibit 1. ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\">Now, with her Motion, the ... Deputy State\u2019s Attorney provided the Court with the Wood\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-10\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-11\">Clearly, Mr. Craigie\u2019s telephone conversation, while he was alone in his apartment, is a private ... conversation, which qualifies as an oral communication as defined in Section (2) dash (i).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-12\">It is also clear that [appellant] intercepted Mr. Craigie\u2019s prior\u2014private oral communications by tape recording said conversation. Section (5) makes it equally clear that the Defendant is, quote, \u201cany individual,\u201d end quote, which is covered by the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-13\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-14\">10-402 makes it unlawful for one to intercept an oral communication and disclose that interception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-15\">Therefore, the Defendant\u2019s tape of Mr. Craigie\u2019s oral communications is a violation of the statute and could\u2014 could be considered a violation of the statute, and his attorneys are prohibited from wilfully disclosing the contents of that tape by Section 10-402.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-16\">Pursuant to Section 10-405, any portion of that intercepted oral communication is not admissible in this trial .... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>10-405 excludes this tape even though the Defense seeks to only use it for impeachment purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">The State suggests that, to allow this tape to be played in court is reversible error, and refers the Court\u2014moves for a Mistrial and refers the Court to In Re: Rachael [Rachel] S., 60 Md.App. 147 [481 A.2d 520 (1984)] case. The Court of Special Appeals held it was reversible error for the lower court to rely on the results of the defendant\u2019s polygraph test even though all the parties had stipulated to the result. It appears to the Court that the results of the polygraph and illegal intercept are analogous in that the legislature has made a very strong statement, they are not in any way admissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">Accordingly, the Court finds that it would be reversible error for the Court to allow this trial to continue and grants, very reluctantly, the State\u2019s Motion for Mistrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The Protection Against Double Jeopardy</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \u201cno person shall twice be put in jeopardy\u201d for the same offense. U.S. Const, amend. V. This prohibition is applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 787, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 2058-59, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969). In Maryland, common law principles also \u201cprotect an accused against twice being put in jeopardy for the same offense.\u201d <em>Gianiny v. State, </em>320 Md. 337, 342, 577 A.2d 795 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">In this case, jeopardy attached when the jury was empaneled and sworn. <em>Illinois v. Somerville, </em>410 U.S. 458, 467, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 1072, 35 L.Ed.2d 425 (1973); <em>Blondes v. State, </em>273 Md. 435, 444, 330 A.2d 169 (1975). \u201c[A]fter jeopardy attaches, retrial is barred if a mistrial is declared without the defendant\u2019s consent unless there is a showing of \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 to declare the mistrial.\u201d <em>State v. Woodson, </em>338 Md. 322, 329, 658 A.2d 272 (1995) (citing <em>United States v. Perez, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 580, 6 L.Ed. 165 (1824)). There must be a \u201chigh degree of necessity before concluding that a mistrial is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>appropriate.\u201d <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 506, 98 S.Ct. 824, 831, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Manifest necessity does exist \u201cwhere there has been a procedural error in the proceedings which would necessitate reversal on appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Crutchfield, </em>318 Md. 200, 209, 567 A.2d 449 (1989) (citing <em>Somerville, </em>410 U.S. at 464, 93 S.Ct. at 1070), <em>cert. denied, </em>495 U.S. 905, 110 S.Ct. 1926, 109 L.Ed.2d 289 (1990). In this case, however, there are three reasons why a mistrial should not have been declared as a result of the alleged error. First, the evidence at issue was introduced by appellant\u2019s trial counsel rather than by the State. Second, the State made no effort to exclude that evidence at any time before it was presented. Third, evidence of what Craigie shouted so loudly as to be recorded in an adjoining apartment did not violate the Maryland Wiretap Act. As Judge Moylan stated in <em>Fields, </em>supra, 96 Md.App. at 745, 626 A.2d 1037:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">[F]rom the vantage point of the defendant ... there are several valuable but quite distinct interests at stake. The foremost is the interest in receiving a fair trial ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">The second interest is in keeping together a tribunal, once it is impaneled, until a verdict has been reached.... There is a significant defense interest in keeping the trial upon the tracks quite apart from the interest in receiving a fair trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Appellant was entitled to \u201ckeep the trial on the tracks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">The Alleged Wiretap Act Violation</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">The Maryland Wiretap Act is codified in Sections 10-401 through 10-414 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Under that statute, it is unlawful for any person to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-11\">(1) Wilfully intercept, endeavor to intercept, or procure any other person to intercept, any wire, oral, or electronic communication;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-12\">(2) Wilfully disclose, or endeavor to disclose, to any other person the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication in violation of this subtitle; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>(3) Wilfully use, or endeavor to use, the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication in violation of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 10\u2014402(a) (1995 RepLVol.).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Section 10-401(2)(i) defines an \u201coral communication\u201d as \u201cany conversation or words spoken to or by any person in private conversation.\u201d Furthermore, Section 10-405 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">Whenever any wire or oral communication has been intercepted, no part of the contents of the communication and no evidence derived therefrom may be received in evidence in any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court, grand jury, department, officer, agency, regulatory body, legislative committee, or other authority of this State, or a political subdivision thereof if the disclosure of the information would be in violation of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Section 10-405 contains an absolute prohibition against the use of illegally obtained wire or oral communications as either substantive or impeachment evidence. <em>Wood v. State, </em>290 Md. 579, 584, 431 A.2d 93 (1981).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">In <em>Fearnow v. C &amp; P Telephone Co., </em>342 Md. 363, 676 A.2d 65 (1996), the Court of Appeals stated that \u201cwhen an oral communication is intercepted, determining whether a violation of the Wiretap Act occurred hinges on a jury determination that at least one of the parties had a reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 376, 676 A.2d 65. <em>See also Benford v. American Broadcasting Co., Inc., </em>649 F.Supp. 9, 11 (D.Md.1986) (noting that, similar to the federal act, \u00a7 10-401(2) of the Maryland Wiretap Act requires factual examination into the person\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">Appellant contends that the use of the tape recorded statement to impeach Craigie\u2019s testimony is not a violation of the Wiretap Act because appellant did not record an \u201coral communication\u201d as that term is defined in the statute. According to appellant, when Craigie was in his apartment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>decided to shout loud enough to be heard thorough the walls, he had no reasonable expectation that the content of his conversation was private. We agree. The mere recording of the words that Craigie shouted did not constitute an illegal intercept of \u201cwords \u25a0 spoken to or by any person in <em>private </em>conversation.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">To determine whether Craigie had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the statements overheard and recorded in a different dwelling unit, we apply the two-pronged inquiry applicable to search and seizure cases set forth in <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 361, 88 S.Ct. 507, 516-17, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967) (Harlan, J. concurring). We first ask whether Craigie exhibited an actual, subjective expectation of privacy with regard to his statements. If we answer that question in the affirmative, we then ask whether that expectation is \u201cone that society is prepared to recognize as \u2018reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 361, 88 S.Ct. at 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">It is obvious that \u201cwhat a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.\u201d <em>Katz, </em>389 U.S. at 351, 88 S.Ct. at 511. Craigie could have no expectation of privacy in statements made in his apartment that were shouted so loudly as to be overheard by persons in the adjacent apartment. We do recognize that the \u201cvery fact that a person is in his own home raises a reasonable inference that he intends to have privacy, and if that inference is borne out by his actions, society is prepared to recognize his privacy.\u201d <em>United States v. Taborda, </em>635 F.2d 131, 138 (2d Cir.1980). In this case, however, what Craigie chose to shout could not have been intended as words spoken in private.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">It is widely recognized that technologically unaided or unenhanced overhearing of statements does not constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Mankani, </em>738 F.2d 538 (2d Cir.1984); <em>United States v. Fisch, </em>474 F.2d 1071 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>412 U.S. 921, 93 S.Ct. 2742, 37 L.Ed.2d 148 (1973); <em>United States v. Ortega, </em>471 F.2d 1350 (2d Cir.1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 948, 93 S.Ct. 1924, 36 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>L.Ed.2d 409 (1973); <em>United States v. Llanes, </em>398 F.2d 880 (2d Cir.1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 1032, 89 S.Ct. 647, 21 L.Ed.2d 576 (1969). The risk of being overheard by an eavesdropper has long been recognized by courts, <em>Berger v. New York, </em>388 U.S. 41, 87 S.Ct. 1873, 18 L.Ed.2d 1040 (1967); <em>United States v. Martin, </em>509 F.2d 1211 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 967, 95 S.Ct. 1958, 44 L.Ed.2d 455 (1975), and \u201cis probably inherent in the conditions of human society. It is the kind of risk we necessarily assume whenever we speak.\u201d <em>Hoffa v. United States, </em>385 U.S. 293, 303, 87 S.Ct. 408, 414, 17 L.Ed.2d 374 (1966), <em>reh\u2019g. denied, </em>386 U.S. 940, 87 S.Ct. 970, 17 L.Ed.2d 880 (1967) (quoting <em>Lopez v. United States, </em>373 U.S. 427, 465-66, 83 S.Ct. 1381, 1401-02, 10 L.Ed.2d 462, <em>reh\u2019g. denied, </em>375 U.S. 870, 84 S.Ct. 26, 11 L.Ed.2d 99 (1963) (Brennan, J. dissenting)).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">In <em>United States v. Agapito, </em>620 F.2d 324 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 834, 101 S.Ct. 107, 66 L.Ed.2d 40 (1980), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents received information that suspects were selling drugs out of a Manhattan hotel room. Relying on that information, two DEA agents checked into a room adjacent to the one where the drug activity was allegedly taking place. Over the course of two days, by pressing their ears up against the connecting door between the rooms, the agents were able to hear various conversations and noises from the suspects\u2019 room. The suspects were ultimately arrested, charged, and convicted of drug trafficking offenses. On appeal, they asserted that, by pressing up against the connecting door, the DEA agents violated their Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">In holding that this activity did not violate the Fourth Amendment, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit focused on the legal right of the eavesdropper to be in the adjoining or adjacent area, and the reduced privacy afforded by an apartment, hotel or motel when compared with a private residence. In this case, it is equally clear that Craigie did not enjoy a reasonable expectation of privacy as to the words he shouted out in his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>First, appellant needed only his unaided ear to decipher what Craigie was shouting. While the record does not contain an explanation of what prompted appellant to record Craigie\u2019s conversation, there is no evidence that appellant ever used an amplifier or sensory enhancing device along with the tape recorder. The fact is appellant merely turned on a tape recorder to capture Craigie\u2019s shouting of words that could easily be heard in appellant\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Second, there is no dispute that appellant was lawfully in position to overhear Craigie\u2019s statements. Appellant lived in the adjoining unit with Barbara Van Rossum, the owner of the building, and was as entitled to be in her apartment as Craigie was entitled to be in his. Finally, appellant\u2019s presence in the apartment adjacent to Craigie\u2019s could reasonably be anticipated.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Apartments are similar to motels and hotels in that both have shared corridors, stairs, sidewalks and common walls. Statements in one apartment made in a tone of voice so loud as to be audible to persons in adjacent apartments are the functional equivalent of statements knowingly exposed to the public. <em>See Llanes, </em>398 F.2d at 884. Thus, Craigie did not enjoy a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the conversation played for the jury by appellant\u2019s trial counsel, and appellant did not introduce evidence of an \u201coral communication\u201d in violation of the Wiretap Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">As the defense did not present the jurors with illegally obtained evidence, the State should not have moved for a mistrial, and the trial court erred in granting that motion. Moreover, even if the tape was inadmissible, we would be required to reverse on the ground that the State\u2019s remedy was exclusion of the inadmissible evidence rather than a mistrial. Md. Rule 4-323. The State did not object when counsel played the tape, objected later on the specific ground that the introduction of such evidence violated the court\u2019s prior ruling on evidence of the February fight, and raised the issue of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Wiretap Act only after an extensive break in the proceedings. <em>See von Lusch v. State, </em>279 Md. 255, 263, 368 A.2d 468 (1977) (where one objecting to the admission of evidence volunteers those grounds, \u201che will be bound by those grounds and will ordinarily be deemed to have waived other grounds not mentioned.\u201d) and <em>Dyce v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 193, 582 A.2d 582 (1990) (improper admission of evidence will not be preserved for appellate review unless the party asserting the error objected at the time the evidence was offered or as soon thereafter as the grounds for the objection became apparent).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Having failed to interpose a timely request for appropriate relief, the State was not entitled to a mistrial thereafter. Further prosecution of this case is barred by appellant\u2019s protection against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY CARROLL COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-12\">. When questioned by the court about how he obtained the tape, defense counsel made the following proffer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-13\">We're gonna show evidence that this is Mr. Craigie yelling so loudly that [appellant and Van Rossum] just simply turned on a tape recorder in the apartment and recorded it. As [the prosecutor] said, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-14\"><em>* </em>sfs sjs si*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-15\">All right, I proffered to the Court today at the bench a few minutes ago that this man was so loud that these people simply turned on a tape recorder in their home and they recorded him. Now, I don\u2019t know what other kind of proffer I can make.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-19\">.
